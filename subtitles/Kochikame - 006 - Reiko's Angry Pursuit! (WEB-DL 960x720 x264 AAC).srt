1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Reiko, the Great Pursuer of Anger!

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Move, move!

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 The speedometer is entering the red zone of 1 million revolutions!

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Power up to 2 million revolutions!

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Hand on the rescue curve!

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 This is scary! It's dangerous!

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Stop at the corner.

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Look right, look left, and check your safety.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Got it?

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Let's go!

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Don't jump out!

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Let's go!

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Are you okay?

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 If we're late for the shift, Ryo-chan will be so noisy!

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Reiko!

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Hello, how's the old man's cold?

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 His fever has gone down, so he'll be able to go out in a couple of days.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 It's hard being all alone, but take care of yourself.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Take care!

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Old man!

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I'm grateful to Reiko-chan for always taking care of me.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 It's business, but bring it.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Um, I was told it was 12 o'clock, but I'm completely late.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Here.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Thank you very much!

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 You're a good girl, Reiko-chan.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 There aren't many good girls like her these days.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 She's strong, and she's also beautiful.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I wonder if she can be replaced by my wife.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Really?

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Wait a minute!

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Let's cross, old lady.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Oh, yes.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 If we take a detour, there's a pedestrian bridge.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 There are a lot of cars coming this way.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 There will be a traffic light soon, so please be patient.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Hurry up!

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Please wait a moment.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Yes, yes.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 What is it?

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 That old lady waited a long time to cross this bridge.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Wait a moment.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 If you hold on for about 30 seconds...

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Yes.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Thank you for your cooperation.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Thank you very much.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 No, be careful.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 I'm glad.

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Reiko-san, can you come here for a moment?

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 It's been here every day for a while.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 It's in front of the kindergarten, and the child is in the shade of the car, so it's dangerous.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I'm warning you many times, but you don't listen to me.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 It's in the middle of the pedestrian crossing, Tsuzushi.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Please move the car number that is parked in front of the kindergarten immediately.

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 It's in the middle of the pedestrian crossing, Tsuzushi.

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 By the way, I'm waiting for you.

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 I'm at the repair factory in the neighborhood.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 You're coming, aren't you?

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 These people said the same thing yesterday.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 It's all a lie.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Here's the study book.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Please forgive me.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 I don't have any points anymore.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 You're so cute.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I won't give you a license.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Don't even move.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 I won't move.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Then I'll move it for you.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 What's that?

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 It's supposed to be a pump for jack-up.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 If you raise the level to the maximum, it will swell up to anywhere.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Hey, you idiot, stop it.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I don't know how to stop it.

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 It's my first time using it.

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Damn it.

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 What?

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Hey!

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 You bastard, get out of the way.

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 It's a colorful foot.

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 It's a terrible foot.

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 I can't move on like this.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Of course.

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Pay the fine properly.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Oh, no.

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Welcome back.

89
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 You're late.

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 You're late.

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I'm sorry, Ryo-chan.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 The transfer time is 12 o'clock in the afternoon.

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 It's past 1 o'clock.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I'm in a bad mood.

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Patroll and my life.

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Which one is more important?

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Even if you say it's a transfer,

98
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 you're still there in the middle of the day.

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Chief Ohara won't come today.

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 So I'll be like that all the time.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I'm going to Patroll.

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 By the way, I'm hungry.

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I'm hungry.

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 You won't come back no matter how long it takes.

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 I couldn't go out for lunch.

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Hey, don't boil the noodles too much.

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Add a lot of green onions.

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 I didn't forget the transfer time.

109
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 It was hard.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 That's it.

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Next time, next time.

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Hey, Reiko.

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Take the newspaper there.

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Isn't it faster to take the newspaper there?

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 There's a vicious criminal.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Even if you say it's a car accident,

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 it doesn't work at all.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 You think you're a criminal,

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 but you're licking it from the head.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 By the way,

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 press my back.

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 It's lower.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Lower.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Not there.

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Press it.

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Like this?

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 No, it doesn't work at all.

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 It doesn't work at all.

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 That's why you're licking it.

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 It has nothing to do with it.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 What you need to control

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 is the power of the face.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Your face doesn't have the power of the face.

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 It's itchy.

136
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Please write it down there.

137
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Here?

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Hey, is the ramen okay?

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Don't add too much.

140
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Oh, it's itchy again.

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Ouch!

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 What are you doing?

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 The last one is the power of the face.

144
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Oh, it's itchy.

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I'll hit you if you want.

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I'll run away if you want.

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 What's that?

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 It's a special pillow for Ryo-chan.

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 It's handmade.

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 What?

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Ouch!

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 How is it?

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Don't let your guard down.

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Start the counterattack!

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Think of the power of a man!

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 You bastard!

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Are you done?

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 The game starts now.

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 If you can't do it,

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 use your own power.

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Ouch!

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Ouch!

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 I got it!

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 I'll kill you!

165
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Not yet!

166
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 You're so obsessive.

167
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Yes?

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I saw the poster.

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Who did this?

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Reiko, right?

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Who are you?

172
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Please go on a date with me.

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Who are you?

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 What's wrong with this number?

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 It was written on the poster.

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 What's wrong?

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I don't know what's wrong with the poster.

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Hello?

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Are you Reiko?

180
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Who are you?

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I'll go to the beach with you.

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 I won't go.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Then go ahead.

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Go alone.

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 What's this?

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 A date?

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I'll lend it to you.

188
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Reiko?

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Yes?

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Are you asking for a date?

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I'll give you 5,000 yen as an introduction fee.

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Ouch!

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 If you say something stupid,

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 I'll arrest you.

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Reiko!

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 There's a lot of this on the table.

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 What's this?

198
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 To Be Continued

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 The people just now

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 called because they saw this.

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 It's a bad photo.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Who is this?

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 I took it off a lot,

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 but it's still stuck on the side of the road.

205
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 It's a bad guy.

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Reiko, what do you think?

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 It's obvious.

208
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 This is Naoko.

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 This is Naoko.

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Please respond.

211
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 We found a suspicious large dump.

212
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 We are currently tracking

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 and heading north in the direction of Kameari.

214
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Please support us.

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 The driver

216
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 was hanging around

217
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Reiko's poster.

218
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Roger.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 I'll lock you up.

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 It's terrible.

221
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 It's Reiko's large dump.

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Ugh.

223
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Both of them

224
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 are checking the signal.

225
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Reiko,

226
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 the dump was pulled away.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Can't you see it?

228
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Is that it?

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Reiko,

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 hurry up!

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 What?

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Hey!

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 It's dangerous!

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Hey!

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Are you okay?

236
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Yeah, I'm fine.

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 I'm glad.

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Look!

239
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I turned my back!

240
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Ouch!

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I hit my back.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 I won't forgive you!

243
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Reiko,

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 ouch!

245
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Hurry up!

246
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Put your seatbelt on!

247
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 I have an announcement.

248
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 We are currently tracking

249
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 and heading north in the direction of Kameari.

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 The driver

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 was hanging around Reiko's poster.

252
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Roger.

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 I'll lock you up.

254
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Put your seatbelt on!

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Ouch!

256
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I won't let you get away!

257
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 I found it!

258
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Take this chance!

259
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 I found it!

260
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 It's the same scene as the rumor.

261
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 What happened, Reiko?

262
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Listen up, you guys.

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 You were about to pull the kids away.

264
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Besides,

265
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 what did I do wrong?

266
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 What did you do?

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 I didn't do anything wrong.

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Then why did you hang around the city?

269
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Reiko!

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Look over there!

271
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 It's them!

272
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 They?

273
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 I found them!

274
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 They were coming.

275
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 I'll leave the rest to you.

276
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Hurry up!

277
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 This is the car

278
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 that was parked at the kindergarten.

279
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 They're the bad guys.

280
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 What a bad car.

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 It's like a natural monument.

282
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 What are you doing?

283
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Don't drive so fast!

284
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Shut up!

285
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Hey!

286
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Don't let them get away!

287
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 If you're going to do that,

288
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 do it faster!

289
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 You're so stubborn!

290
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Hey!

291
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 What are you doing?

292
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 You're the bad guy!

293
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 You broke my car!

294
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Let's go back to the school.

295
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 That's right!

296
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Stop it!

297
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Wait!

298
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Calm down, Reiko!

299
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I know how you feel,

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 but Mini Pat is only a 550 cc light car.

301
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 You can't catch up with the 2000 cc guys!

302
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Hey, they're still following us!

303
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 They're not just bad guys.

304
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 It's not easy to go that far with a light car.

305
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Let's go at high speed.

306
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 We can't go that fast with that car.

307
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 They're going at high speed.

308
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 We can't catch up with them with this car.

309
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 This is Reiko.

310
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 This is Kameyari Park.

311
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Kei, I have a favor to ask you.

312
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 I can't see anymore.

313
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Hey, Reiko!

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Oh, no!

315
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Hurry up and stop!

316
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Here we are!

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 It's the Audi Quattro!

318
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Sorry for being late.

319
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 I just got here yesterday.

320
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 This is the car that won the Monte Carlo Rally.

321
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 I couldn't make it.

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 The collector gave it to me.

323
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Well, I'm going to borrow it.

324
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 They weren't here before,

325
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 but something strange is following us instead of Mini Pat.

326
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Hey, could it be them?

327
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Hey, Nikusama!

328
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Huh?

329
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 What's going on?

330
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 It's like a gas station.

331
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I'm so frustrated!

332
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 What's going on, Nakagawa?

333
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Just fill it up with gas.

334
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 There's no gas at high speed.

335
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I found gasoline!

336
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Reiko, slow down.

337
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 I'll get it from the tank car behind you.

338
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 What?

339
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Oh, no!

340
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 What are they doing?

341
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Damn it!

342
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I'm so tired that I can't get out.

343
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 One liter is 100 yen.

344
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 45 liters is 4,500 yen.

345
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Reiko, buy me 4,500 yen.

346
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 It's not bad.

347
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 It's not bad?

348
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Does that mean you don't need it?

349
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Okay, I'll pay for it.

350
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 I'll pay for it.

351
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 What is this?

352
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Give me my money!

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Reiko, hurry up!

354
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Give me my money!

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Give me my money!

356
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Give me my money!

357
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Give me my money!

358
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Here it comes again.

359
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Oh, no!

360
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Damn it!

361
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Oh, no!

362
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 My money!

363
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Damn it!

364
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Damn it!

365
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 It's sweet!

366
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Are you running away?

367
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Reiko, go!

368
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 I'll forgive you!

369
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Wait a minute!

370
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Don't go on the highway!

371
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 You've gone too far, Reiko!

372
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Damn it!

373
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 We can't go on the highway!

374
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 How far can we go by that car?

375
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Calm down, Reiko!

376
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 I sent out two Audi cars,

377
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 but their car was blown up!

378
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 It's too much!

379
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Is it a dream?

380
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 I'm sorry!

381
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Help me!

382
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 It's scary!

383
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Stop it!

384
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I'm sorry!

385
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Help me!

386
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 It's scary!

387
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 It's scary!

388
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 It's scary when you look at a woman like that.

389
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 You must not let her turn into an enemy.

390
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 I don't mind if she climbs up, but I wonder what she's up to.

391
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Good morning.

392
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Good morning.

393
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 I forgot my wax.

394
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Thank you for your hard work.

395
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 What's wrong with those two?

396
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 They fell in love with Reiko's driving technique and decided to get into the car on their own.

397
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 It's been a long time since I've had such a scary feeling.

398
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 You guys should be careful of Reiko, okay?

399
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Ryo-chan, did you call me?

400
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Here, have some tea.

401
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Reiko-san, thank you for the delicious tea you always make.

402
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Thank you.

403
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 The weather is nice.

404
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Be careful.

405
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 I know.

406
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Oh, the old lady from before.

407
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 You're so kind.

408
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 You're welcome.

409
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Reiko-chan.

410
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Oh, old lady, what's wrong?

411
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Actually, Reiko-chan has an affair.

412
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 What?

413
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 You're also an old lady, aren't you?

414
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Old lady.

415
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Hey.

416
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 If you marry her, you'll have a lot of money.

417
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 This year is the year of the Olympics.

418
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 The year of the Olympics.

419
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Speaking of the Olympics, it's the day life.

420
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 The day life is when you wake up once every four years.

421
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 But this guy has a lot of superpowers.

422
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Next time, on Waking Up, Police Officer Tomi.

423
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Thank you.

424
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Thank you.

425
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Thank you.

426
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 To be continued.
