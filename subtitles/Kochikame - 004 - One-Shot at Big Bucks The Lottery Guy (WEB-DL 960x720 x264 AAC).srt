1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 South Wind Nihon

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 South Wind Nihon

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 What's up?

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 What's up?

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 What's up?

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 One-Shot at Big Bucks The Lottery Guy

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Thank you very much.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 See you next time.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 On this precious day,

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I spent 20,000 yen in 5 hours.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 What's the point of having one cup noodle?

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Even though it's free of charge.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Damn it.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Hey!

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 This guy's good at acting in the summer.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Here's your change.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Thank you.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Thank you.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 You don't need it, do you?

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I'll send it to the police.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 This is the common sense of Japan.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 If you come to the police station later,

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I'll give you a favor.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I'll give you one noodle.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 You don't need it, do you?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 That was close.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 I'm a survivor before my pay.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Even one cup noodle is a precious food.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 That's a shame, too.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 It's a shame.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Hey, what are you doing?

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Yeah.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 We're looking for the treasure.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 We bought 40 pieces for four people.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Huh?

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 You've done something stupid during the break.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Let's talk about the world sometimes.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Like a Japanese soldier with a dirty belly.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 A dirty belly?

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Don't you know, sir?

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yugo has split up.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 If you say that, you'll lose to the boss.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Huh?

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 You're always playing the gamble.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 There's no way you can escape.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 The treasure is not gambling.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Gambling is your own power.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 You have to win with your own power.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 That's gambling.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 You're so persuasive.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 It's naive to bet money on a book like that.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 If you want to play, you have to spend time and money.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Leave him alone and investigate.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 That's right.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 There are four pieces left.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Oh, this is...

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 You're wrong.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 You're thinking wrong.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Work according to your expectations.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Ignore it.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 They're all missing.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Of course.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 There's no one like you.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 The goddess of good luck is smiling.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 That's right.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Maybe the same treasure was left last year.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Why don't you investigate?

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 There should be a year-end lottery number in this book.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 That's right.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 That's right.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I don't like the treasure because the winner hides it.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 The first prize is no good.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 The second prize is no good.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 The third prize is no good.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I won 3 million yen.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 In Japan, we don't announce the winner in front of the mass media.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 It's the Japanese's fault.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Isn't that right?

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 It's not good to be silent when you win.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 That's right.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 If you go there, it's good to play pachinko and horse racing.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Even if you win or lose, your emotions will be honest.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 You lost the pachinko today.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Shut up.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 It's a matter of time.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Chief.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 How was the treasure?

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 That's right.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 That's right.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Let's stop talking about the treasure and talk about Bosnia and Herzegovina.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Chief.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Are you hiding something?

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 A letter?

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Is that so?

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 The winner's action pattern is...

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 The first prize is no good when you win.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 The second prize is no good when you talk about the treasure.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Chief.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Please show me the treasure.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 It's a failure.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 If it's a failure, can I see it?

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 No, no.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Shut up.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I'm more suspicious when it's a failure.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 It's not a failure.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I'm saying it's a failure because it's a failure.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I'm sure because he said it.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I think it's a failure.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 No.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Then please break it at this place.

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 What?

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 It's a failure.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 If it's a failure, can I break it?

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 No, I'm collecting failures.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 When did you start doing that?

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Your eyes are lying.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Show me.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 What are you doing?

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Hey, you can break it.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Why?

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Stop it.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Ryo-chan, are you okay?

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Senior.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 What you're doing right now is not about 100,000 or 200,000.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 It's a lot of money.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Terai, give me that book.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Yes.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Which is the owner's share?

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It's the same as this year's.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 This is it.

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I'll read the prize money from the bottom.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Yes.

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 50,000 yen for five.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Wrong.

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 1,000,000 yen for four.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 This is also wrong.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Next.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 3,000,000 yen for three.

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 I got it.

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 It's 3,000,000 yen.

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Wrong.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 You're a fool like me.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 It's 3,000,000 yen.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Wrong.

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 It's wrong.

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 It's hard to check the prize money for more than 1 million yen.

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 The limit is today.

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 If you don't go today, you'll be out of luck.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 What?

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Chief.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Let's go for a drink today.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Until 0 o'clock in the morning.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I'm sorry.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Actually, it's 3,000,000 yen.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 You did it, Chief.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 But you didn't do anything wrong.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 You don't have to hide it.

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 That's right.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Next.

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 It's a bad habit of Japanese people who don't say anything.

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Really.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 You should be happy like a foreigner.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Like this.

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Happy.

169
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I won the lottery.

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 I'm so happy.

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I got it.

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Give me chocolate.

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I want you to express your happiness like this.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Do you understand?

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I'm not a foreigner like that.

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Let's call the office and let everyone know.

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Hey.

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 I checked it by chance, so I think I got it right.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 It's the same as the golf hole-in-one.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 It's common sense to have a party and celebrate it with everyone.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 But...

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Or were you going to pay 3 million yen alone?

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I didn't mean that.

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Then leave it to me.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 This is Ryotsu, the head of the park.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Prepare a special shabu-shabu for 200 people tonight.

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Shabu-shabu?

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Hey.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 I'll go to the office to inform them directly.

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Ryotsu.

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I was lucky to win the lottery.

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 It was unlucky that Ryo-chan was there.

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Director, do you have a day off today?

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 It's been like this since the day after that.

195
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 It's about time to recover.

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I was shocked.

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 You're doing too much.

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 You should stop doing shabu-shabu.

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 You have to set it up until 8 o'clock.

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 The director is on his way.

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Good morning.

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I'm sorry to bother you.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 How much did you spend on the party?

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I didn't have any money left.

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I'm sorry, but don't talk about that anymore.

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I'm getting hot again.

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 More importantly, director.

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Since then, I've been addicted to lottery.

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 What?

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 It's the lottery in America.

211
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 What's that?

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 You have to choose 6 numbers from 1 to 51 to win.

213
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 The prize money is 5.5 billion yen.

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 5.5 billion yen!

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I understand that you're addicted to lottery.

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 But is it that easy to win?

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Ryo-chan said there might be a law.

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 She collected the data from the past five years.

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 She's going to the math teacher.

220
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 She's going to study the combination of the numbers.

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 She's a hard worker.

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Hello.

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Director, did you finally come out?

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Damn it!

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Even though you made a fool of the lottery,

226
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 you seem to be buying a lot.

227
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Don't say that.

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 It's 5.5 billion yen.

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Ryo-san, there's a notice from overseas.

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 I'll keep giving you until you win.

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Would you like to have a bite of the dream of 5.5 billion yen?

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 No, it's okay.

233
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 You just have to finish your little dream in Japan.

234
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Did I get it right?

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 What was the previous winning number?

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 2, 16, 17.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 I got it right up to here.

238
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 The next one is 23.

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 2, 34.

240
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 I got it right!

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 No, I'll keep you happy until here.

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I'm going to disappoint you later.

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I knew it.

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 If I had chosen it, it would have been a 4-5 curve.

245
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Why did I choose 4-5 instead of 45?

246
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 4-5?

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Could it be...

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 45?

249
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 I got it right.

250
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 It's 5.5 billion yen.

251
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 I got it right.

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 It's amazing that you got it right.

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 The winning number is 5.5 billion yen.

254
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Right, Ryotsu?

255
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 What is it?

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 What's wrong?

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 You don't look well.

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Did I have a fever?

259
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 What about Lotokuji?

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 What are you talking about?

261
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 You were looking for the winning number of Lotokuji, weren't you?

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I'm surprised.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Anyway, why don't we talk about the cost of food?

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 What do you think?

265
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I think the winning number will change the topic and stop talking about the lottery.

266
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 What happened to Lotokuji, Ryotsu?

267
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 That's...

268
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 That's none of your business.

269
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I'm on duty.

270
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Please don't talk to me for a while.

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 If you talk to me for a while, you'll suddenly become silent.

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 I don't like it.

273
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I don't like to talk.

274
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I got it right.

275
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 What are you talking about?

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Don't play around. You got it right.

277
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 What is it?

278
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 You got it right, Lotokuji.

279
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 You got it right for 5.5 billion yen.

280
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 I got it right.

281
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 You got it right.

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 It's the same number as the number you chose.

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Hey, Nakagawa!

284
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 You have a bad eye.

285
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 You're dirty.

286
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 We were thinking about winning together.

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Stop it, Ryocchan.

288
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 You got it right.

289
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 5.5 billion yen.

290
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Really?

291
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 You got it right.

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Yes.

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 What is it?

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 You always say that people are noisy like foreigners.

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 You're the representative of the common people.

296
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Don't get me wrong.

297
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I'm going to be noisy like a foreigner from now on.

298
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 I'm going.

299
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I got it right.

300
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 5.5 billion yen.

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 I got it right.

302
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 I got it right.

303
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Give me a chance.

304
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 It's not a good chance for 5.5 billion yen.

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Look at him.

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 He's totally out of it.

307
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 I got it right.

308
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 5.5 billion yen.

309
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Give me a chance.

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It's rare to see someone who hides something like this.

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 It would be nice if he was happy.

312
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I'll let the press know about it.

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 I'm going to be noisy like a foreigner from now on.

314
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 You said you would let everyone know about it, didn't you, Ryocchan?

315
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 That's right.

316
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I want people all over Japan to know about it.

317
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Hello?

318
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 This is the delivery room in front of Kameari Park.

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 This is going to be a big deal from tomorrow.

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Yes.

321
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Ryocchan!

322
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Senpai, you're popular at night.

323
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Damn it.

324
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 He always thinks it's a piece of cake.

325
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 I got this letter.

326
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 What?

327
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 From Mr. M.K. who lives in Chiba Prefecture.

328
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 5.5 billion yen.

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 You bastard.

330
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 You can't use it.

331
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Why don't you go to hell?

332
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Because...

333
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Don't mess with me.

334
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Get out of the way.

335
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Naoko Komachi.

336
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Ryocchan, marry me.

337
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I've always wanted to marry you.

338
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Ryocchan?

339
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 What?

340
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Ryocchan, I thought you were going to do something big.

341
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I've always wanted to marry you.

342
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Wait a minute, Komachi.

343
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Naoko, listen up.

344
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I'm the one who's going to marry you.

345
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Until yesterday, Ryocchan was the number one man I didn't want to marry.

346
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Shut up!

347
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 If I'm going to marry you, it's better to throw away 5.5 billion yen.

348
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 What did you say?

349
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 I'm going to marry you.

350
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Ryocchan, do something.

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Fujiwara, if you don't get out of here, this panic will be over.

352
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 This guy and that guy.

353
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Hurry up and go home.

354
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I haven't got 5.5 billion yen yet, so no comment.

355
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 But...

356
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Don't make excuses.

357
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Don't make excuses.

358
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I'll tell you everything when I get the money.

359
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 I'll tell you how to use it.

360
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 So go home today.

361
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 See you.

362
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Bye-bye.

363
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Goodbye.

364
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 What?

365
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Okay.

366
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 I got it.

367
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 What's wrong?

368
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 There was an investment from America.

369
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 The investment was 5.5 billion yen.

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 That's a lot.

371
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 They're going to report it to the press.

372
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 They're going to report it to the press?

373
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Of course.

374
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Anyway, I'm going to get it.

375
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I'll leave the rest to you.

376
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I'm here.

377
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Please come in, Master.

378
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Thank you.

379
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 I'm here.

380
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 How are the civil servants doing?

381
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 What's with that outfit?

382
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 I ordered it for 3 million yen.

383
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 It's a brand product.

384
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Master, it's not a brand product.

385
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 It's a brand product.

386
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 I'm here.

387
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I'm sorry.

388
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Please introduce yourself.

389
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I'm Sato, and I'm going to work as a sheep.

390
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 I'm Sato.

391
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I look forward to working with you in the future.

392
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Hello, I'm Nakagawa.

393
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 I'm Reiko.

394
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I'm the director, Ohara.

395
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 By the way, you always take care of Mr. Nakagawa and Mr. Reiko.

396
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Please take care of them.

397
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 This much?

398
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Is it really okay to get it?

399
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Of course.

400
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Ryo, Ryo-tsu.

401
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Don't use it so much.

402
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Give me some money.

403
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I'm sorry.

404
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 I'll give the director something in return.

405
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 What is it?

406
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I spent 3 million yen at the party the other day.

407
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Please take it as an apology.

408
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Is it really okay to get it?

409
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Please.

410
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Oh, right.

411
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Let's do that.

412
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I'll give you 3 million yen.

413
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Yes, sir.

414
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 I'll give you 3 million yen.

415
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 What are you doing?

416
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 What is it?

417
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I wanted to try it once when I became rich.

418
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I can't stand this interpretation.

419
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Please give me some money.

420
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I can't stand it.

421
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Idiot.

422
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 How can you do that?

423
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 You're rich.

424
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 It's a good time to spend money.

425
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 That house?

426
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Ryo-tsu.

427
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Have you decided how to use it?

428
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Yes.

429
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 I ordered it on the day I got it.

430
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 It was delivered today.

431
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 It seems to have arrived.

432
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 What did he order?

433
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 It's a real combat helicopter.

434
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 And it's gold.

435
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Idiot.

436
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 If it's real, it'll cost more than 100 billion yen.

437
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Are you surprised?

438
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Of course, you can't buy the real one.

439
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 This is a one-fifth scale radio-con helicopter.

440
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 It looks like the real one.

441
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And it's made of gold.

442
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 It costs 500 billion yen.

443
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Idiot.

444
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Sir.

445
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Did you order that?

446
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Yes, I did.

447
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 All right.

448
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Let's start the first flight.

449
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Please wait a moment.

450
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Yes!

451
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 It's really flying.

452
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 What are you going to do?

453
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I can't help it.

454
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 It's like driving a real helicopter.

455
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 It's going to cost 500 billion yen anyway.

456
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 It's better for me to spend money.

457
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 All right.

458
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Let's spread it out in the park.

459
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 It looks like it's going to cost a lot of money.

460
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Dear citizens of Chodai.

461
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 I'm Kikichi Yotsu, who has been given 500 billion yen.

462
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 It's my pleasure to make this good fortune by myself.

463
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 So I'm going to share it with you.

464
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Thank you very much.

465
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 It's a treasure chest.

466
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 But it looks like it's going to cost a lot of money.

467
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 It's going to cost 500 billion yen anyway.

468
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 500 billion yen?

469
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Let's spread it out.

470
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 By the way, where is this?

471
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 It's fun.

472
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 By the way, this one too.

473
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 By the way, bring this one too.

474
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Oh, no.

475
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 The propeller...

476
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 The propeller is gone.

477
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 The pilot...

478
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Oh, no.

479
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 My propeller...

480
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 My 500 billion yen propeller...

481
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Excuse me.

482
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Where is my money?

483
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Ryo-san, we're in trouble.

484
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 The United States is going to pay a 30% tax on the lottery.

485
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 What?

486
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 They're going to pay a 30% tax of 500 billion yen as a tax.

487
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 What?

488
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 A 30% tax of 500 billion yen?

489
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 What?

490
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 1.65 billion yen?

491
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 A tax?

492
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 They're going to pay a 5.5 billion yen tax.

493
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 They're going to use it in no time.

494
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And they're going to make a tax of 1.65 billion yen.

495
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 What a stupid book.

496
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 The End

497
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Come and see us!

498
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 It's snowing in the middle of the summer!

499
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 On a hot day, we have shaved ice!

500
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Ryo-san's specialty, straight milk from Alaska!

501
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Don't you need a huge shaved ice?

502
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Next episode, I like shaved ice!

503
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Thank you for watching!

 Please subscribe to our channel!

505
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Please smile!

506
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You're in a good mood!

507
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Smile at me anytime!

508
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 A woman who's been to a foreign country is not pretty,

509
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 so you should smile right away!

510
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 If you're not a child,

511
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 don't be a child!
