00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 One-Shot at Big Bucks The Lottery Guy

2
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:40,942
 Thank you very much.

3
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,099
 See you next time.

4
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:45,426
 On this precious day,

5
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:47,662
 I spent 20,000 yen in 5 hours.

6
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,021
 What's the point of having one cup noodle?

7
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:53,046
 Even though it's free of charge.

8
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:53,995
 Damn it.

9
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,014
 Hey!

10
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,039
 This guy's good at acting in the summer.

11
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:02,913
 Here's your change.

12
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:04,929
 Thank you.

13
00:02:05,343 --> 00:02:06,975
 You don't need it, do you?

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I'll send it to the police.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 This is the common sense of Japan.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 If you come to the police station later,

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I'll give you a favor.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I'll give you one noodle.

19
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,590
 You don't need it, do you?

20
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:23,621
 That was close.

21
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:25,000
 I'm a survivor before my pay.

22
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:28,726
 Even one cup noodle is a precious food.

23
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:32,488
 That's a shame, too.

24
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:33,379
 It's a shame.

25
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,000
 Hey, what are you doing?

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Yeah.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 We're looking for the treasure.

28
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:40,760
 We bought 40 pieces for four people.

29
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:42,159
 Huh?

30
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:45,000
 You've done something stupid during the break.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Let's talk about the world sometimes.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Like a Japanese soldier with a dirty belly.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 A dirty belly?

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Don't you know, sir?

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yugo has split up.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 If you say that, you'll lose to the boss.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Huh?

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 You're always playing the gamble.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 There's no way you can escape.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 The treasure is not gambling.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Gambling is your own power.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 You have to win with your own power.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 That's gambling.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 You're so persuasive.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 It's naive to bet money on a book like that.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 If you want to play, you have to spend time and money.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Leave him alone and investigate.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 That's right.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 There are four pieces left.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Oh, this is...

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 You're wrong.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 You're thinking wrong.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Work according to your expectations.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Ignore it.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 They're all missing.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Of course.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 There's no one like you.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 The goddess of good luck is smiling.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 That's right.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Maybe the same treasure was left last year.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Why don't you investigate?

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 There should be a year-end lottery number in this book.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 That's right.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 That's right.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I don't like the treasure because the winner hides it.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 The first prize is no good.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 The second prize is no good.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 The third prize is no good.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I won 3 million yen.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 In Japan, we don't announce the winner in front of the mass media.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,272
 It's the Japanese's fault.

72
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:31,968
 Isn't that right?

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 It's not good to be silent when you win.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 That's right.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 If you go there, it's good to play pachinko and horse racing.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,662
 Even if you win or lose, your emotions will be honest.

77
00:04:44,687 --> 00:04:47,687
 You lost the pachinko today.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Shut up.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 It's a matter of time.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Chief.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 How was the treasure?

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 That's right.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 That's right.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,137
 Let's stop talking about the treasure and talk about Bosnia and Herzegovina.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Chief.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,203
 Are you hiding something?

87
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,492
 A letter?

88
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,000
 Is that so?

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 The winner's action pattern is...

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 The first prize is no good when you win.

91
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:29,415
 The second prize is no good when you talk about the treasure.

92
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:31,040
 Chief.

93
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:33,414
 Please show me the ticket.

94
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,399
 It's a failure.

95
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:37,438
 If it's a failure, can I see it?

96
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:38,846
 No, no.

97
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:40,838
 Shut up.

98
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,059
 I'm more suspicious when it's a failure.

99
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:46,637
 It's not a failure.

100
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:49,209
 I'm saying it's a failure because it's a failure.

101
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,115
 I'm sure because he said it.

102
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,780
 I think it's a failure.

103
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,778
 No.

104
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:57,803
 Then please break it at this place.

105
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:58,969
 What?

106
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:00,766
 It's a failure.

107
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,399
 If it's a failure, can I break it?

108
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:07,929
 No, I'm collecting failures.

109
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:10,000
 When did you start doing that?

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Your eyes are lying.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Show me.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 What are you doing?

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Hey, you can break it.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Why?

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Stop it.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,870
 Ryo-chan, are you okay?

117
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:24,644
 Senpai.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,567
 What you're doing right now is not about 100,000 or 200,000.

119
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:31,631
 It's a lot of money.

120
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,030
 Terai, give me that book.

121
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:34,916
 Yes.

122
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,858
 Which is the owner's share?

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It's the same as this year's.

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 This is it.

125
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,596
 You read the prize money from the bottom.

126
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:48,000
 Yes.

127
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:51,000
 50,000 yen for five.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Wrong.

129
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:57,000
 1,000,000 yen for four.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,382
 This is also wrong.

131
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:02,427
 Next.

132
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:04,000
 3,000,000 yen for three.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 I got it.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 It's 3,000,000 yen.

135
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:15,000
 Wrong.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,967
 You're a fool like me.

137
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:20,000
 It's 3,000,000 yen.

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Wrong.

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 It's wrong.

140
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:27,000
 It's hard to check the prize money for more than 1 million yen.

141
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:30,000
 The limit is today.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 If you don't go today, you'll be out of luck.

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 What?

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Chief.

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Let's go for a drink today.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Until 0 o'clock in the morning.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,594
 I'm sorry.

148
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:52,234
 Actually, it's 3,000,000 yen.

149
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,000
 You did it, Chief.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 But you didn't do anything wrong.

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 You don't have to hide it.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,503
 That's right.

153
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:00,338
 Next.

154
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,452
 It's a bad habit of Japanese people who don't say anything.

155
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:04,000
 Really.

156
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,790
 You should be happy like a foreigner.

157
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:08,828
 Like this.

158
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:10,667
 Happy.

159
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:12,000
 I won the lottery.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 I'm so happy.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I got it.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Give me chocolate.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I want you to express your happiness like this.

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Do you understand?

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I'm not a foreigner like that.

166
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:31,464
 Let's call the office and let everyone know.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Hey.

168
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,000
 I checked it by chance, so I think I got it right.

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,759
 It's the same as the golf hole-in-one.

170
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:43,000
 It's common sense to have a party and celebrate it with everyone.

171
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,000
 But...

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Or were you going to enjoy 3 million yen alone?

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I didn't mean that.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Then leave it to me.

175
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:58,000
 This is Ryotsu, the head of the park.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Prepare a special shabu-shabu for 200 people tonight.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Shabu-shabu?

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Hey.

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 I'll go to the office to inform them directly.

180
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Ryotsu.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I was lucky to win the lottery.

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 It was unlucky that Ryo-chan was there.

183
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:31,975
 Chief, do you have a day off today?

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 It's been like this since the day after that.

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,079
 It's about time to recover.

186
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:38,975
 I was shocked.

187
00:09:39,321 --> 00:09:41,376
 Senpai, You're doing too much.

188
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:43,000
 You should stop doing shabu-shabu.

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 You have to set it up until 8 o'clock.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Chief is on his way.

191
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,381
 Good morning.

192
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:57,000
 I'm sorry to bother you.

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 How much did you spend on the party?

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I didn't have any money left.

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I'm sorry, but don't talk about that anymore.

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I'm getting hot again.

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 More importantly, Chief.

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Since then, Senpai have been addicted to lottery.

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 What?

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 It's the lottery in America.

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,326
 What's that?

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,724
 You have to choose 6 numbers from 1 to 51 to win.

203
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,483
 The prize money is 5.5 billion yen.

204
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 5.5 billion yen!

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I understand that why he is addicted to lottery.

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 But is it that easy to win?

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Ryo-chan said there might be a trick.

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 He collected the data from the past five years.

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 He is going to the math teacher.

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 He's going to study the combination of the numbers.

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 He's a hard worker.

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Hello.

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Chief, did you finally come out?

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Damn it!

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Even though you made a fool of the lottery,

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 you seem to be buying lottary a lot.

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Don't say that.

218
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 It's 5.5 billion yen.

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Ryo-san, there's a latters from overseas.

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,363
 I'll keep giving you until you win.

221
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:16,324
 Chief, would you like to have a bite of the dream of 5.5 billion yen?

222
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:19,000
 No, it's okay.

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 You just have to finish your little dream in Japan.

224
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Did I get it right?

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 What was the previous winning number?

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 2, 16, 17.

227
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 I got it right up to here.

228
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 The next one is 23.

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 2, 34.

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 I got it right!

231
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 No, it'll keep you happy until here.

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 It is  going to disappoint you later.

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I knew it.

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 If I had chosen it, it would have been a 4-5 curve.

235
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Why did I choose 4-5 instead of 45?

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 4-5?

237
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Could it be...

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 45?

239
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 I got it right.

240
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 It's 5.5 billion yen.

241
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:27,382
 I got it right.

242
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:31,068
 It's amazing that you will get it right.

243
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:34,093
 The winning number is 5.5 billion yen.

244
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:35,692
 Right, Ryotsu?

245
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,826
 What is it?

246
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,000
 What's wrong?

247
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,529
 You don't look well.

248
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,402
 Did I have a fever?

249
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:51,000
 What about lottary?

250
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 What are you talking about?

251
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,699
 You were looking for the winning number of lottary, weren't you?

252
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:58,000
 I'm surprised.

253
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Anyway, why don't we talk about the cost of food?

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 What do you think?

255
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:12,000
 I think the winning number will change the topic and stop talking about the lottery.

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 What happened to lottary, Ryotsu?

257
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:17,359
 That's...

258
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:19,000
 That's none of your business.

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I'm on duty.

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Please don't talk to me for a while.

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 If you talk to me for a while, you'll suddenly become silent.

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 I don't like it.

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I don't like to talk.

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I got it right.

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 What are you talking about?

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Don't play around. You got it right.

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 What is it?

268
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 You got it right, the lottary .

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 You got it right for 5.5 billion yen.

270
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 I got it right.

271
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 You got it right.

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 It's the same number as the number you chose.

273
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Hey, Nakagawa!

274
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 You have a bad eye.

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 You're dirty.

276
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 We were thinking about winning together.

277
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Stop it, Ryocchan.

278
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 You got it right.

279
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 5.5 billion yen.

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Really?

281
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 You got it right.

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Yes.

283
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 What is it?

284
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 You always say that people are noisy like foreigners.

285
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 You're the representative of the common people.

286
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Don't get me wrong.

287
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I'm going to be noisy like a foreigner from now on.

288
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 I'm going.

289
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I got it right.

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 5.5 billion yen.

291
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 I got it right.

292
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 I got it right.

293
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Give me a dance.

294
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 It's not a good dance for 5.5 billion yen.

295
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Look at him.

296
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 He's totally out of it.

297
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 I got it right.

298
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 5.5 billion yen.

299
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Give me a dance.

300
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It's rare to see someone who hides something like this.

301
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 It would be nice if he was happy.

302
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I'll let the press know about it.

303
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 I'm not going to be noisy like a foreigner from now on.

304
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,748
 You said you would let everyone know about it, didn't you, Ryocchan?

305
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:30,000
 That's right.

306
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,805
 I want people all over Japan to know about it.

307
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,469
 Hello?

308
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:38,000
 This is the police station in front of Kameari Park.

309
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 This is going to be a big deal from tomorrow.

310
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Yes.

311
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,858
 Ryocchan!

312
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:54,000
 Senpai, you're popular at night.

313
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Damn it.

314
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 He always thinks it's a piece of cake.

315
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,209
 I got this letter.

316
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:01,234
 What?

317
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 From Mr. M.K. who lives in Chiba Prefecture.

318
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 5.5 billion yen.

319
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 You bastard.

320
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 You can't use it.

321
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Why don't you go to hell?

322
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Because...

323
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Don't mess with me.

324
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Get out of the way.

325
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Naoko Komachi.

326
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Ryocchan, marry me.

327
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I've always wanted to marry you.

328
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Ryocchan?

329
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 What?

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Ryocchan, I thought you were going to do something big.

331
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I've always wanted to marry you.

332
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Wait a minute, Komachi.

333
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Naoko, listen up.

334
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I'm the one who's going to marry Ryo.

335
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Until yesterday, Ryocchan was the number one man I didn't want to marry.

336
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Shut up!

337
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 If I'm going to marry you, it's better to throw away 5.5 billion yen.

338
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 What did you say?

339
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 I'm going to marry you.

340
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Ryocchan, do something.

341
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,367
 Chief.

342
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:12,834
 Fujiwara, if you don't get out of here, this panic will be over.

343
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,990
 This guy and that guy.

344
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Hurry up and go home.

345
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I haven't got 5.5 billion yen yet, so no comment.

346
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 But...

347
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Don't make excuses.

348
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Don't make excuses.

349
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I'll tell you everything when I get the money.

350
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 I'll tell you how to use it.

351
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 So go home today.

352
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 See you.

353
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Bye-bye.

354
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Goodbye.

355
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 What?

356
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Okay.

357
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 I got it.

358
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 What's wrong?

359
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 There was an investment from America.

360
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 The investment was 5.5 billion yen.

361
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 That's a lot.

362
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 They're going to report it to the press.

363
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 They're going to report it to the press?

364
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Of course.

365
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Anyway, I'm going to get it.

366
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I'll leave the rest to you.

367
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:18,802
 We are here.

368
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,827
 Please come in, Master.

369
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Thank you.

370
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 How are the civil servants doing?

371
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 What's with that outfit?

372
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 I ordered it for 3 million yen.

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 It's a brand product.

374
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:45,000
 Master, it's not a brand product.

375
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 It's a branded product.

376
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 I'm here.

377
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I'm sorry.

378
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Please introduce yourself.

379
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I'm Sato, and I'm going to work as a sheep.

380
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 I'm Sato.

381
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I look forward to working with you in the future.

382
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Hello, I'm Nakagawa.

383
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 I'm Reiko.

384
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I'm the chief, Ohara.

385
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 By the way, you always take care of Mr. Nakagawa and Mr. Reiko.

386
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Please take care of them.

387
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 This much?

388
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Is it really okay to get it?

389
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Of course.

390
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Ryo, Ryo-tsu.

391
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Don't use it so much.

392
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Give me some money.

393
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I'm sorry.

394
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 I'll give the director something in return.

395
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 What is it?

396
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I spent 3 million yen at the party the other day.

397
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Please take it as an apology.

398
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Is it really okay to get it?

399
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Please.

400
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Oh, right.

401
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Let's do that.

402
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I'll give him 3 million yen.

403
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,236
 Yes, sir.

404
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 What are you doing?

405
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 What is it?

406
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I wanted to try it once when I became rich.

407
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I can't stand this interpretation.

408
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Please give me some money.

409
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,645
 I can't stand it.

410
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,457
 Idiot.

411
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:10,482
 How can you do that?

412
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 You're rich.

413
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 It's a good time to spend money.

414
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 That house?

415
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Ryo-tsu.

416
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Have you decided how to use it?

417
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Yes.

418
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 I ordered it on the day I got it.

419
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,625
 It was suppose to be delivered today.

420
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 It seems, it have arrived.

421
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 What did he order?

422
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 It's a real combat helicopter.

423
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 And it's gold.

424
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Idiot.

425
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 If it's real, it'll cost more than 100 billion yen.

426
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,543
 Are you surprised?

427
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:48,732
 Of course, you can't buy the real one.

428
00:20:48,888 --> 00:20:51,000
 This is a one-fifth scale radio-con helicopter.

429
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 It looks like the real one.

430
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And it's made of gold.

431
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 It costs 500 billion yen.

432
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Idiot.

433
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Chief.

434
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:01,898
 Did you order that?

435
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:03,188
 Yes, I did.

436
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 All right.

437
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,707
 Let's start the first flight.

438
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Please wait a moment.

439
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:22,519
 It's really flying.

440
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:24,000
 What are you going to do?

441
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Senpai, I can't help it.

442
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 It's like driving a real helicopter.

443
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 If it's going to cost 500 billion yen anyway.

444
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,893
 It's better for me to spend money.

445
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 All right.

446
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Let's spread it out in the park.

447
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 It looks like it's going to cost a lot of money.

448
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Dear citizens of Chodai.

449
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 I'm Kikichi Yotsu, who has been given 500 billion yen.

450
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 It's my pleasure to make this good fortune by myself.

451
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 So I'm going to share it with you.

452
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Thank you very much.

453
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 It's a treasure chest.

454
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 But it looks like it's going to cost a lot of money.

455
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 It's going to cost 500 billion yen anyway.

456
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 500 billion yen?

457
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:21,000
 Let's spread it out.

458
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 By the way, where is this?

459
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 It's fun.

460
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 By the way, this one too.

461
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 By the way, bring this one too.

462
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Oh, no.

463
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 The controller...

464
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 The controller is gone.

465
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 The pilot...

466
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:06,234
 Oh, no.

467
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:10,000
 My helicoptere...

468
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,641
 My 500 billion yen helicopter...

469
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:14,666
 Excuse me.

470
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,760
 Where is my money?

471
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:18,705
 Ryo-san, you're in trouble.

472
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,781
 The United States is going to make you pay a 30% tax on the lottery.

473
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:24,273
 What?

474
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:28,865
 They're going to make you pay a 30% tax of 500 billion yen as a tax.

475
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,890
 What?

476
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 A 30% tax of 500 billion yen?

477
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 What?

478
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 1.65 billion yen?

479
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 A tax?

480
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 They're going to make you pay a 5.5 billion yen tax.

481
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 They're going to use it in no time.

482
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And they're going to make a tax of 1.65 billion yen.

483
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 What a stupid man.
