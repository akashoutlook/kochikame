1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Everybody can do!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Everybody can do!

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I don't want to say it even if it sticks out a little.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Don't worry about making a fuss.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 A strong and high-pitched voice.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 The Rockets

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 The Rockets

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 How is it? Look at it.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 The results of the health checkup before.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Is there anything wrong with that?

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 The blood sugar level is high.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 You should be careful of the blood sugar level.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Where are you looking?

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Here.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 You are only 35 years old.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 35 years old.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 35 years old.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 You are young.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Is there any secret?

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Actually,

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I went to an athletic club about three months ago.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I started building my physical strength.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Athletic club?

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 That's right.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 My friend invited me to go.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 It's effective.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I'm still young.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I can't lose to Ryotsu.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 By the way, Mr. President.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Your face looks good recently.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 That's right.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 My shoulders have been healed.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 How is it, Terai?

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 You should go, too.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 But I'm not good at sports.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I'm tired of going home.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Don't worry about that.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 At first, you should check your physical strength on the computer.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 You can start from the menu that suits you.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 It's really well done.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Good morning, Mr. President.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 What do you mean, good morning?

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 It seems that your life is not getting better.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Do you think you can work properly?

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Don't worry about that.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I have confidence in my physical strength.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 I'm still making plastic models.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I spend two nights.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 The night before that, I play two new games.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 The night before that, I drink with my friends.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Baka-mon!

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Baka-mon!

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It seems that your voice is more powerful than usual.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Is it because of the athletics?

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Athletics?

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Why, Mr. President?

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Don't talk about athletics.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I haven't eaten yet.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 You should train your head before you train your body.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 It's not food, Senpai.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Athletic club is a place where you do sports for physical strength and health.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 You can make physical strength with a fitness machine or a computer.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 You know that, don't you?

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 You're stupid.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 You don't have to spend money to exercise.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 You don't understand, do you, Ryo-chan?

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 It's common sense to spend money on beauty and health.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 In the United States, people who can't quit smoking and people who are dissatisfied with it are people who can't manage their own bodies.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 That's right.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 People who can't manage their own bodies should experience it once again.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 That's why I have physical strength even if I don't go there.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Baka-mon!

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I'm saying that you need a well-calculated exercise.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I'm sorry, but if I tell you, you're wasting money.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 What did you say?

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Okay, then let's see who has physical strength.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Let's have a match with athletics.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 A match?

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Stop it.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 You're not mature.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Are you scared now?

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Say it as many times as you want.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 What's so interesting about using physical strength for nothing?

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 You're stupid.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 You always talk a lot.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I can see the result.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I understand.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I'll accept your challenge.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 You're motivated.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 I don't care if you regret it.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 My physical strength is here.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 As you can see, I'm 35 years old.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 But let me decide the place.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 At Kamiyari Athletic Square from 2 a.m. tomorrow.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Fine.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Be prepared, Ryo-tsu.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 What's wrong, Senpai?

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 You're suspicious.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 No, it's nothing.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 What's this?

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Kamiyari Athletic Square Open Ceremony?

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 A million-yen consultation event.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 So this is what you wanted.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I thought it was strange.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 I understand, Yabu-chan.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I just happened to get a prize for athletics.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That's great.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 You don't have to participate.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I don't want a million-yen.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I'll be the head of the family.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Sorry to keep you waiting.

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Are you all together?

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Yes.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 We're going to do it together.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 You're a great person.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 What's going on?

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 I don't know.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 That voice!

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Kamiyari Athletic Square!

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 You're here, too?

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I can't believe we're here.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 We're here.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 We should go somewhere else.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 You said what you wanted to say.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Ryo-san!

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 You're here.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Ramen, moke, sake.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Ryo-san!

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Hurry up and pay.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Don't you have anything else to say?

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 We don't want to say anything.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 If you don't want to, give it back.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 I'll give it back to you when I get the prize.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 What prize?

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Nothing.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Welcome, everyone.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 We're going to have a 1-million-yen survival race.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 What's going on?

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Ryo-san, what's going on?

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 I don't know.

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 You're using me?

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 You're going to use me to make money?

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Chief, there's no change in the game.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Do you want to admit defeat without fighting?

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 No, I won't lose to you.

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Please enter.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Please change into this.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 What's this?

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 What's this?

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 It's a cockroach.

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Please move to this side.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Why do we have to dress like this?

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 I don't like it.

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Wow!

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 It's a huge kitchen.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 What's this?

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Are we going to be cockroaches?

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Welcome to the cockroach aesthetic.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 We're going to go through a lot of obstacles.

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 It's like a cockroach experiment.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 How did they make this?

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 If you're going to stop, do it now.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 What? Who said I'm going to stop?

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 It's a game.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 The goal is to win the first place in 30 minutes.

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 The first person to arrive in 30 minutes is the winner.

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 There are three courses on the floor.

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 You can choose which course you want to take.

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Choose the course you like.

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 It's the closest road from the front.

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 No, there are too many gaps.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 There seems to be some kind of trick.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Let's go through the stream.

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Let's start the game.

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Ready...

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Start!

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 This is the first place!

181
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 I'll do my best to win!

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 You're good at this.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Let's leave Ryo-chan to the cockroach tube.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 It's hard to climb.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I'm going to break through the front.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 There's another one.

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 The cockroach-resistant power supply is on the floor.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 What? What is this?

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 The electricity is not flowing.

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 I can't see well because it's dark.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 My tongue is sticky.

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Where is it?

193
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Ouch!

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 What is this?

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 No!

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Is this a cockroach-resistant power supply?

197
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 My tongue is panicking.

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 The flow rate is correct.

199
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 1 million yen is mine!

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Help me!

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Ryo-san, please help me!

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 I'll help you if you give me the power supply.

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 That's terrible.

204
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Then it's okay.

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Wait!

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 I understand, so please help me!

207
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Hold on to me!

208
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 I was late.

209
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I'll give you the power supply.

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Damn it!

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 It seems to disappear in about a minute.

212
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 When does it disappear?

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 In a minute.

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I can't wait a minute.

215
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I can't believe it.

216
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 It's not a human.

217
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 It's okay because it's a cockroach-resistant power supply.

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Chief!

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 The culprit of the cockroach-resistant power supply is over there!

220
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 What?

221
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Where is it?

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Where is it?

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 You can't get through the night just with your physical strength.

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 You have to use your head, too.

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Okay.

226
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 You're stubborn.

227
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Then I'll go ahead.

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 You dirty hand!

229
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 The culprit of the cockroach-resistant power supply is over there!

230
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Chief!

231
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 There is no idiot who is caught in the same hand!

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 There is a 10,000 yen coin over there!

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 What? 10,000 yen?

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 What a simple guy.

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 How is it, Ryotsu?

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Try to do something with your proud head.

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Damn it!

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 I'm still going to lose!

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Where did Ryotsu and the others go?

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 What the hell is this?

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 What?

242
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Ryotsu is inside the cockroach-resistant power supply?

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Yes.

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 It's impossible for Ryotsu to escape from there.

245
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 If he's not there, there's no need to panic.

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 He was a little angry and flew too far.

247
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Ryotsu!

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 How can something like this stick to me?

249
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Amazing!

250
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 It made the impossible possible!

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 It's exactly the same physical strength as cockroaches.

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 It's a wonderful physical strength.

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Chief!

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 The prediction is at a high pace.

255
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 At this rate, it seems that a considerable number of people will reach the goal in 30 minutes.

256
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 What?

257
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 That's why I told you.

258
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 What are you going to do with the prize money?

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Currently, we don't have the time to give out the prize money.

260
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Hmm.

261
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I can't believe we're going to use this.

262
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 It's late.

263
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 What?

264
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 What?

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 What?

266
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 What?

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Run away!

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Ryotsu!

269
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Ryotsu!

270
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Ryotsu!

271
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Ryotsu!

272
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Ryotsu!

273
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 What kind of athleticism is this?

274
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Did you see the power of the robot arm?

275
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 It's still too early to be surprised.

276
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 The chopsticks are in the way!

277
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 I can't stand this.

278
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 But thanks to you, I was able to get the chopsticks.

279
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Ryotsu!

280
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Huh?

281
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 What?

282
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Were you there, too?

283
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Yes.

284
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I was suddenly attacked and ran into this place.

285
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I couldn't get out.

286
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Damn.

287
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 One million yen.

288
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 I can't waste it here.

289
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 All right.

290
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Let's all jump out at the same time.

291
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Huh?

292
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 The opponent is a machine.

293
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 I can't move fast.

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 While someone is being sacrificed,

295
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 the others can move on.

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Interesting.

297
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Huh?

298
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Listen.

299
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 No matter who is killed, there is no grudge.

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Yeah.

301
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Go now!

302
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 What?

303
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Go now!

304
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 All right.

305
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 While they're being attacked.

306
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 I knew it.

307
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Huh?

308
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 You're all cheating!

309
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Which one is cheating?

310
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 All right.

311
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Now.

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Damn.

313
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 I can't do it alone.

314
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Don't do it!

315
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 You're so cruel, Senpai.

316
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Sorry to bother you.

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 You're no match for me.

318
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 How is it?

319
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 You don't like to fight, do you?

320
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Ryotsu!

321
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Is the chief alive?

322
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 I won't forgive you.

323
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Damn.

324
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Wow.

325
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 It's like a real cockroach.

326
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 It's like a real cockroach.

327
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 I'll get rid of you one by one.

328
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 All right.

329
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Give it to me.

330
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 No.

331
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 It won't reach this far.

332
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Don't follow me.

333
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 You're always imitating me.

334
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 You're the one who imitates me.

335
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 You're cowardly.

336
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Senpai was finally defeated.

337
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 He went to a good place.

338
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 He came out of that place.

339
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 It's a real cockroach.

340
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 The chief is pretty good, too.

341
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Chief!

342
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 It's a present!

343
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I'll get a million yen with this.

344
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I'll get a million yen with this.

345
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 There's nowhere to hide from now on.

346
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 The goalkeeper is tough.

347
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I can't get close to him.

348
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 The goalkeeper is tough.

349
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 I can't get close to him.

350
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 The goalkeeper is tough.

351
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 I'll get a million yen with this.

352
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 You're cowardly.

353
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 No.

354
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Chief.

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I won't forgive you.

356
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Calm down.

357
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 It's a small voice.

358
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 What's this, Chief?

359
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 I've found it!

360
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I've found it!

361
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Damn it! I was just about to reach the goal!

362
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 I can't believe I got beaten up this far!

363
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Alright, this is it!

364
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Ah, that felt bad! I'm going to make you fall!

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I can't believe I fell!

366
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 The captain has been crushed.

367
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 The two of them have been crushed?

368
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Hey, captain!

369
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 I'm not done yet!

370
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 One million yen!

371
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 I'm going to make you fall!

372
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 One million yen!

373
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 What kind of trick is that?

374
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 I'm going to take this!

375
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 No!

376
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 No! I'm going to be beaten up like this forever!

377
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 I'm going to reach the goal!

378
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 That felt bad!

379
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Damn it! I'm going to make you fall!

380
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I did it!

381
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 I got one million yen!

382
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 I got one million yen!

383
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Captain, didn't I tell you?

384
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It's no use paying money and going to an athletic club.

385
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Aren't you going to change?

386
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 I liked it, so I got it as a souvenir.

387
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 I'm going to live as a cockroach for the rest of my life.

388
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Hey, Ryo-san, you did it!

389
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Congratulations!

390
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 I knew you were going to do it!

391
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 And then, as promised...

392
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Ah, the Komuro family is over there!

393
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Hey, if you can do it, try it!

394
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 You can't lose to anyone with your physical strength!

395
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Hey, I got one million yen!

396
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Damn it!

397
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I did it!

398
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Hey!

399
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Hey! Wait for me! I got one million yen!

400
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Ah, this?

401
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 What's wrong?

402
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Please look at it.

403
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Recently, a witness who saw a giant cockroach on the island of dreams had appeared.

404
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And finally, we, the investigation team, were able to capture it on camera.

405
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 A cockroach?

406
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Then, please look at the shocking VTR.

407
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 One million yen...

408
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 My one million yen...

409
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Damn it! Where did it go?

410
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 My one million yen!

411
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 To be continued...

412
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 What should I do?

413
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I failed to capture the important photo that the chief asked me to capture!

414
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 This is bad! This is bad! This is bad!

415
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 If I get caught, I'm sorry!

416
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I have to do something!

417
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Next time, we will recreate the Gekisha trip to Kyoto!

418
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Thank you for watching!
