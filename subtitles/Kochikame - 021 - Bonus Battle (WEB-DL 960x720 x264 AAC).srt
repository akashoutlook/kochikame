1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Everybody can do!

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I don't want to say it even if it sticks out a little.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I want to hug the noisy Kouki.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Strongly and high, Lollipop!

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Well, everyone.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Over the past few years,

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 we have been troubled by a certain person.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 That is this man!

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 The leader of history,

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 every year at this time,

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 made all possible measures to challenge this man.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 However...

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 There was a loose end to everything,

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 and only a strong sense of defeat remained.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 The commitments were just one step away.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I will never forget the humiliation I felt two years ago.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 When I think of this man,

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I feel depressed and can't sleep at night.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 But that will end this year!

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Because I am the leader.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,800
 Yeah, but that's over this year, too!

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
 I'm going to be the leader, so I'm going to make sure to...

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,000
 This year, I'm going to get a debt from Ryotsu Kankichi!

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Um, it's just a simple pillow, but I think it's time for you to go inside.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I know.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 So, everyone, let's start the 21st Ryotsu Kankichi Bonus Consultation Battle.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Oh, good, good, good, good. It'll be over soon.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Kikuchi-san!

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 You know, it'll be a problem if you bring a baby to an important meeting.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 It can't be helped.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 His wife is a man who can't even take out a debt.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 He left the house.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I... I'm not paying Ryosu Kankichi for his debt.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 But in fact, I don't think Ryosu Kankichi can do anything to him.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 What are you talking about?

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 He's your father.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 He was the president of the 8th shopping district, and he risked his life to get his debt.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Yeah, he was passionate about everything.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 He was also the one who started the sports meeting.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 But thanks to that, he got out of it.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Sorry, but that was a masterpiece.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Yeah, right.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 So, this time, I prepared a new weapon to take away Ryosu Kankichi's bonus.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 A new weapon?

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I've been living in Plamoya for 30 years.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I've put all my technology into it, and I've developed it over 90% of the shopping district and three months.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 This is Ryosu Kankichi's navigation system.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 In other words, Ryonavi.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I'm ready.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 All I have to do is catch Ryosu Kankichi and take away his bonus.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 The name of the operation is the Sky Eye Operation.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Ryosu-san, Ryosu Kankichi, the district secretary.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Yes.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Ryosu-san.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Yes.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Here's the bonus for this time.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Yahoo!

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 It's been 180 days and two and a half.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I've been going to the office every day, even in the darkness of the chief.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Everything is for you, this cute bonus.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Ryosu-san, what are you going to use this year's bonus for?

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Actually, I've reserved a one-twelveth model of NASA's special Radicon Space Shuttle for the limited release.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 You're always like that.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Well, let's go to the bank right away.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 If you don't put in the money today, it will be canceled.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 It's late.

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 There are 30 people.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 They are more careful than usual.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 What's more?

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 It's late.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 It's about time for them to come out.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 I think they've already left.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Yes.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Those who are good at disguising with sunglasses are not good at all.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Oh, my bonus.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Hello, miss.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 I dropped this.

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Oh, thank you very much.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 No problem.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 What?

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 What is it?

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 I felt like it was similar to my wife who ran away.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I feel like it's similar to my wife who ran away.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 If you look closely, you'll see that she's more beautiful than her husband.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Oh, I'm scared.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Well then.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Be careful.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 That was close.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 But their eyes are so strange.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Hey, Ryosu-san.

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 What?

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 I forgot half of it.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Oh, I'm sorry.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 What?

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Oh, no.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 It's Ryosu-san.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Return my bonus.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 My pay.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 What?

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I thought something like this would happen.

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Take this, Nippo.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Take this, Nippo.

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Oh, you bastard.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Over there.

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Well then.

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I'll take the bonus.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Oh, it's Ramiya's camera.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Yeah.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 What's wrong?

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Over there.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 When did this happen?

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Damn it.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 I'm done for.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Ozaki-san, please respond.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 This is Katsushika Shomae.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 The ambush was a failure.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Ryo-san ran away.

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 The emergency operation has begun.

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Roger.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Ozaki-san, are you all right?

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 At this stage, it is expected that Ryo-san will be able to escape.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 This is the real story of the Sky Eye Operation.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Navigation computers are installed on Ryo-san's belt.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 The artificial satellite catches that signal and always knows where it is.

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 It's kind of exciting.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Is this really going to work?

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 It's a system used by the US Army.

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 It's more than 200% reliable.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 But I can't trust a new machine.

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Yes, yes.

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 This time, you just have to watch it.

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Start navigation.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 What is this shining spot?

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 This is Ryo-san's current location.

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 The target is heading to the Kamewari Association Bank through the back road.

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Go around and ambush them.

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Roger.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Ryo-san, it's no use trying to escape.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Your location is being monitored from the sky.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Welcome.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Ryo-san, wait.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Please go to the Kamewari Association Bank for the bonus.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Oh no, I'm in the way.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Okay, Street Riders, go!

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Start navigation.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Damn it.

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 I'll show you the skills of a motorcycle that I've been training for a long time.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 You've even prepared a motorcycle.

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Then...

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 What?

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 What?

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 You're ten years too early.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I'm sorry, Ryo-san.

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I used to be a professional racer.

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I've been told that you're ready to listen to me.

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Hello?

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Street Riders, annihilated.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 They're going to the neighboring town across the Nakagawa River.

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Ryo-san is heading to the neighboring town.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Use the center of the bridge to ambush them.

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Damn it.

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 They're not going to be in a good mood this year.

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 It's safer to get away from the town and go to the neighboring bank.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 We're not going in here, Ryo-san.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 That's ridiculous.

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 How did you know we were going through here?

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Ryo-san, there's no way out.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 What the hell is going on?

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 We're going to give you a bonus.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Ryo-san, give us a bonus.

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Everyone, give us a bonus.

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Bonus, bonus.

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Bonus, bonus.

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Let's go.

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 They're not going to jump into the river.

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 They're running away.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Wait up.

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Let go of me.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 We're not humans.

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 We're going to die if they jump into the river.

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Let go of me.

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 What are you doing?

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Did you drop this misbo-like gate ball?

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Or Nagashima Shigeo's sign ball?

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Nagashima's sign ball.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Of course it's a gate ball.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I'm going to change the fire.

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Damn it.

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 How do you know where I'm going?

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 What's this code?

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 A battery in a hand-held case?

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 You were monitoring me with a navigation system?

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 That's a good idea.

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 But I'm not going to get caught like that.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I'm not going to get caught.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I have an important mission.

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I'm going to the bank today.

201
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I'm going to the bank today.

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 What are you talking about?

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 That's right.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 It's not as fragile as it's broken into the river.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 The hot pot I made.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Is this really showing where Ryo-san is?

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I can't believe it.

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Hey, Ohara-san.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 How is it?

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Did Ryo-tsu get caught?

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 It's a matter of time.

212
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 This is only possible if Ohara-san's help is available.

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 It's cheap enough to replace Ryo-tsu's belt.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Ohara-san

215
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 I'm not going to bother you with him anymore.

216
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 No, no.

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Please feel free to get on the boat.

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Thank you.

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Mr. Osaki.

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 What is it, old lady?

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 It's been a while since it moved, but it's broken, isn't it?

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 It can't be.

223
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 It's closed.

224
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 It seems to be running away and taking a break.

225
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Ohara-san.

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I'm going to see Ryo-san for the last time.

227
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Oh, finally.

228
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Please get on.

229
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Yes, sir.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 It's coming. It's coming.

231
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Ryo-san is currently staying at the Kamewari Hybrid Hotel.

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 We're going to have a match here.

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 From now on, the overseas operation will enter the final stage.

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Everyone, head to the hotel.

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 It's coming.

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 It's coming.

237
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Is Ryo-san really here?

238
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Believe in the latest news.

239
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 This option CD-ROM is in sync with the radio transmission from the satellite.

240
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Find out where Ryo-san is in the hotel while standing.

241
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 This room.

242
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 To all.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Ryo-san is a veranda in room 817.

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Room A is a veranda in room 816.

245
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Room B is a veranda in room 818.

246
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Room C and D are in the inside of room 817.

247
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 The existence of the Kamewari Hotel is in this battle.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Everyone, head to the hotel.

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Be sure to win.

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Yuki.

251
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 It's finally the two of us.

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Let's go.

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Room B is in position.

254
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Room B, go ahead.

255
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Room B, room 818 is in position in the veranda.

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Room C and D.

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Room C and D are in position.

258
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Understood.

259
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Countdown, start.

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

261
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Go!

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 You bastard.

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Report.

264
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Did you successfully capture the target?

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It's a crow.

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 A crow?

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 The one on the veranda is not Ryo-san.

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 It's a crow with Ryo-san's belt on it.

269
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 It can't be.

270
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 I can't believe the strategy to use it is broken.

271
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 That's why I said I couldn't trust the machine.

272
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 I won again this year.

273
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Now, let's wash the money.

274
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Ah, the money is falling.

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Money?

276
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Money, money, money, money.

277
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I found it.

278
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 I got it.

279
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Children's bank?

280
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 What?

281
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Damn it!

282
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 You tricked me, you coward!

283
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Right?

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Even if you didn't use the machine, you could easily capture it.

285
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 That's right.

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 This is the best way for Ryo-san.

287
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 As expected of Toshinoko.

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 How pitiful.

289
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 What was the trouble I've had so far?

290
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Come on, come on.

291
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Line up, line up.

292
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Is that okay, Mr. Ohara?

293
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Please, please.

294
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Please take it.

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 I'm sorry, Ryo-san.

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 I'll take it.

297
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 What's wrong?

298
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Isn't it a bad omen?

299
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 No, it's worse not to pay for it.

300
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Please take it without hesitation.

301
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Is that so?

302
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 You're in a bad mood when I say it lightly, aren't you?

303
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I'm sorry, Sachiko.

304
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 It's going to be a long way to go to pick you up.

305
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Who is that girl?

306
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Sachiko, my sister.

307
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I'm Sachiko.

308
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Sachiko works in a cold place in the north where her limbs are numb and her bones are stiff.

309
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 What?

310
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 You're still a child, aren't you?

311
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Why?

312
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 It's a long story.

313
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I won't forget it.

314
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Sachiko was born on a cold night full of snow.

315
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Her parents were happy.

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 They wished for her to grow up to be a happy child.

317
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 They named her Sachiko.

318
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 However...

319
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 A sudden accident happened to her parents.

320
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 The insurance money that was supposed to come in was deceived by a bad broker.

321
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 The house collapsed as if it were being chased away.

322
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Her parents died.

323
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 They failed the class and found out that they had 2 billion yen in debt.

324
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Sachiko was taken away by a relative who was in charge of the debt.

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 However...

326
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 That relative is actually the president of a bad-for-nothing construction company.

327
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 He forced her to work even as a child.

328
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 He didn't even let her eat.

329
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 I tried to get Sachiko out of it.

330
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 However...

331
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Every time I tried to get her out of it, she gave me 2 billion yen.

332
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 And then I made up my mind.

333
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 If I didn't earn enough, I wouldn't be able to get Sachiko out of it.

334
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 My salary and my bonus would all go to the debtor.

335
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 I don't care how much people in the world hate me for that.

336
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 But my brother was wrong.

337
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Even though you were a bad-for-nothing,

338
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 you caused so much trouble to so many people.

339
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 My brother is a bad-for-nothing human.

340
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Is that so?

341
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Is that so?

342
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Please forgive me for making you a bad-for-nothing human.

343
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 It's all right.

344
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Everyone, you may have done it wrong.

345
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 However, he was trying to live as a human being.

346
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Please forgive me for making you a bad-for-nothing human.

347
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Please forgive me.

348
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 I didn't even think about Ryo's situation.

349
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 I was just trying to get a bonus.

350
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Ryo, this is your bonus.

351
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Please give it to your sister.

352
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 But this is...

353
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I don't care about the debt.

354
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Compared to Ryo, I'm a million times happier.

355
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Don't lose!

356
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I will never forget your kindness.

357
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I'm sure your sister will be happy.

358
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Hello, everyone.

359
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 What's going on?

360
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 What's this?

361
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 That's Ryo's sister, Sachiko.

362
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 That's strange.

363
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 This is a news report.

364
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And your sister is not here.

365
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 It's impossible for Ryo to steal my bonus.

366
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Thank you very much.

367
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 I'll just go to the bank tomorrow.

368
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 What's this?

369
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Who did this?

370
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 According to past data,

371
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 you will have a 95% chance of defeating us.

372
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 You will win at this cafe.

373
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 As I thought.

374
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 I was waiting for you.

375
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 What's this?

376
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 This is a debt-taking weapon.

377
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Shaking X.

378
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 It's Shaking X.

379
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I was secretly developing it for the next year's bonus fight.

380
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 But it's always 80% complete.

381
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I'm sure I can beat you.

382
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Are you going to the bank?

383
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Ryo is good at connecting with this Shaking X.

384
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I got it.

385
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 This is not good.

386
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Electric Shock.

387
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Are you going to kill me?

388
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Don't worry.

389
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 I'll consider your physical strength.

390
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 I'll give you a voltage that won't kill you.

391
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I'm sure you'll faint.

392
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Electric Shock.

393
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Shock.

394
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 This is my bonus.

395
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I don't want to do this.

396
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I don't want you to pay the debt.

397
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 I'll take the bonus.

398
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 What's wrong?

399
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 I was so close.

400
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Now you know.

401
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 It's impossible for you to take my bonus.

402
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Even if the director forgives you, God will not forgive you.

403
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 God is also...

404
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Wait.

405
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Wait.

406
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Don't come too close.

407
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Let go of me.

408
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 I'm sorry.

409
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 I'm sorry.

410
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 What are you doing?

411
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Even if you lose money, you can exchange it in the bank.

412
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 I'm sorry.

413
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 If you want to pay the debt, you can help me.

414
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Don't talk to me.

415
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 I'm focused.

416
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 This is my bonus.

417
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I'll take the bonus next year.

418
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Thank you.

419
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 I did it.

420
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I was selected as the number one exchange student.

421
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Men are not face and body.

422
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 It's heart.

423
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Do you understand?

424
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Thank you.

425
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Even if it rains today

426
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Tomorrow will be sunny

427
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Bye bye

428
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I wave my hand

429
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Goodbye to unpleasant things

430
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Oh yeah

431
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Let's live as we like

432
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 There is a good thing

433
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Outside the door

434
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 The sun is calling
