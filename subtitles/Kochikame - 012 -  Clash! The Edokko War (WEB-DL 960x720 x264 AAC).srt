1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Clash! The Edokko War

2
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,000
 You're doing great, Junpei-kun, Kappei-kun!

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,400
 Oh, it's the girls from Nippon-tachi!

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
 You girls are doing great too!

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,200
 Yeah, leave it to us!

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,800
 There's a lot of Amikoshi, it's really lively!

7
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,200
 It's natural that the festival is lively, right?

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
 It's going to be more lively from now on!

9
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,721
 Oh, Reiko-san!

10
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,291
 The main event of the festival is from now on!

11
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,563
 There's a lot of Amikoshi!

12
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:26,588
 That's right!

13
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,713
 After competing with the shrines up ahead,

14
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:31,738
 we're going to decide who's going to be the main event of the festival!

15
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:34,024
 It's the main event of today's festival!

16
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,410
 Oh, he's here!

17
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:36,895
 This way!

18
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,984
 You're late, Ryo-san!

19
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:39,009
 Sorry, sorry!

20
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:41,673
 I was so worried that you wouldn't come!

21
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:42,672
 It's true!

22
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:46,731
 After all, thanks to Ryo-san, our festival is three years in a row!

23
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,267
 Right now, Ryo-san seems to be the main event of Edokkogase!

24
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:53,578
 Is that so?

25
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:54,603
 That's right!

26
00:02:54,664 --> 00:02:56,378
 Edokkogase of Edokkogase!

27
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,554
 Ryo-san, Edokkogase No.1!

28
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,445
 Super Edokkogase, Ryo-san!

29
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:01,650
 Yo!

30
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,739
 The best Edokkogase in the universe!

31
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,542
 It feels good when you're told the truth!

32
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:09,471
 That guy is Edokkogase?

33
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,200
 Huh?

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,528
 You're making me laugh!

35
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,265
 He seems to be happy that he's being teased!

36
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,889
 I can't say that he's the real Edokkogase!

37
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:18,920
 What?

38
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,545
 You're a face that can't be seen!

39
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:22,037
 Where are you from?

40
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,200
 This guy is the real Edokkogase in Edokkogase, Kin-san.

41
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,279
 He's a spy in our town!

42
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,419
 What did you say?

43
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:34,200
 Every year, every year, I can't let you big guys do it!

44
00:03:34,342 --> 00:03:35,769
 You fake Edokkogase!

45
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,643
 I'll skin you!

46
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:38,923
 It's fun!

47
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:41,155
 Don't make me laugh!

48
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:08,203
 Amazing!

49
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,053
 I'm a real Edokkogase!

50
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,106
 You're really an Edokkogase ?

51
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:25,464
 You can't win over anyone!

52
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:28,489
 You have to look around from the top of the tree!

53
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:29,844
 This is the real Edokkogase!

54
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:31,400
 If you let me say it...

55
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:33,276
 Hey, Ryo-san!

56
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:36,352
 If you're an Edokkogase, you have to stand on the top of the tree!

57
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:38,567
 If you're sitting on the top of the tree,

58
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:40,541
 you're not a real Edokkogase!

59
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,478
 Yeah!

60
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:44,503
 I am a real Edokkogase!

61
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:47,528
 You're not a real Edokkogase!

62
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,200
 So that's why you're here!

63
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:51,698
 This is a good idea!

64
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:54,545
 I don't know this guy, so he can't be an Edokkogase!

65
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:57,964
 I'm not going to stand on the top of the tree!

66
00:04:58,104 --> 00:05:00,879
 I'm am an Edokkogase!

67
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:01,718
 What?

68
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:03,856
 This is the real Edokkogase!

69
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:06,923
 No, this is the real Edokkogase!

70
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:09,099
 This is the real Edokkogase!

71
00:05:12,637 --> 00:05:14,471
 This is the real Edokkogase!

72
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:16,346
 This is the real Edokkogase!

73
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:21,200
 Are you okay, Ryo-san?

74
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:28,695
 They're getting better at this!

75
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:31,126
 Ryo-san, they're getting better at this!

76
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:31,745
 That's right!

77
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,770
 We're not going to win!

78
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:33,571
 Shut up!

79
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,200
 If that's the case, I have no choice.

80
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:39,290
 Let's go!

81
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:40,315
 Let's go!

82
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:45,952
 If we do not perform well,

83
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:47,111
 We're going to lose!

84
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:53,473
 This is great!

85
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:17,260
 You dirty!

86
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:19,003
 Don't follow us!

87
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,389
 That's dirty!

88
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,728
 You're running in front of us!

89
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:23,200
 Damn it!

90
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,470
 You're beating us up!

91
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:26,461
 We're going to lose!

92
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,650
 Speed up!

93
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:30,128
 Don't run away!

94
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:31,153
 Hurry!

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
 We're the only ones left!

96
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:51,792
 We'll be the number 1 chance of你是场上的囚犯!

97
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:54,313
 I'll kill him, so you will die here with him.

98
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:07,294
 Here, take this!

99
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,699
 Idiot! Slow down!

100
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,495
 You'll crash into a ginger!

101
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,407
 You can't stop me now!

102
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:18,608
 I can't stop you!

103
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:27,536
 I forgot!

104
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:48,755
 Damn you, idiot!

105
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,762
 Are you okay, Senior?

106
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:51,929
 Damn!

107
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:54,808
 I'll miss the four consecutive wins,

108
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,888
 I'll be scolded for breaking the shrine and the shrine maiden,

109
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,541
 I'll get wet in the mud!

110
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:03,044
 It's all because of that bastard!

111
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,609
 Damn it!

112
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,200
 It's all because of him!

113
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:14,570
 Do you want to get in this bath too?

114
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,595
 I'll do it myself!

115
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:19,762
 Senior!

116
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:23,352
 Get out of here!

117
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:24,951
 You can't get in!

118
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:26,830
 You g et out of here!

119
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:30,200
 They don't feel like giving up at all!

120
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,114
 Dad!

121
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,339
 I'm here!

122
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,200
 Well,

123
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,613
 Ryo-san, you will be needing change, aren't you?

124
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:42,689
 I got one!

125
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:48,175
 It's 370 yen, so...

126
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:50,200
 Well...

127
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:52,533
 Dad!

128
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:54,589
 I don't need change today!

129
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,354
 What?

130
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,331
 I knew it!

131
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:04,206
 I'll get you!

132
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,779
 I'm the best!

133
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:15,813
 Senior, what was that scream?

134
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:18,087
 Scream?

135
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,316
 I didn't hear a scream.

136
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:21,878
 It's your imagination, right?

137
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:22,980
 But...

138
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:24,613
 It's your imagination!

139
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,376
 Um...

140
00:09:27,758 --> 00:09:30,468
 Senior, aren't you going to get in the first bath?

141
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:32,714
 What?

142
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:35,752
 I was just thinking about getting in right now.

143
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:38,200
 Oh, this way too!

144
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:47,405
 Don't shake it!

145
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:49,502
 The water is going to leak!

146
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:51,200
 That's right!

147
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:55,275
 Nakagawa!

148
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:57,725
 Help me with the boilers!

149
00:09:57,894 --> 00:10:00,349
 If it's this cold, I'll catch a cold!

150
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:04,806
 What?

151
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:06,221
 You're going to raise the temperature?

152
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:08,396
 Yeah, it's still cold.

153
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:09,781
 That's strange.

154
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:12,200
 I thought it was going to be pretty hot.

155
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:22,200
 It seems to have warmed up a little.

156
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
 If it warms up to this point,

157
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
 You make me laugh.

158
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
 It's still very cold.

159
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:32,869
 Nakagawa!

160
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,769
 It's not warming up at all!

161
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:37,141
 You have to warm it up more!

162
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:39,514
 It's still cold?

163
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,121
 It's hot!

164
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:46,200
 It's over 60 degrees!

165
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,601
 It's not the temperature that humans can enter!

166
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,413
 I said it's cold, so it's cold!

167
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:53,704
 I don't know if it's 60 degrees or something.

168
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:57,200
 It's still like ice water in Edo.

169
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,605
 Hurry up and go back to the boilers!

170
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,200
 I understand.

171
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,598
 It's unfair!

172
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,296
 I'm going to get a nosebleed!

173
00:11:09,457 --> 00:11:11,200
 Nakagawa, do something!

174
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,331
 Y-Yes!

175
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:37,448
 This is the enamel paste that is used in the Nakagawa ice iron mine.

176
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:40,507
 At a stretch of 10,000 degrees, this can be heated up!

177
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:42,361
 I see...

178
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 This bubble is good.

179
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,200
 After all, if I don't see the water boiling like this, I don't feel like I'm in the bath.

180
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:00,200
 You bastard.

181
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,755
 Don't make a fuss just because the water is boiling.

182
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:06,200
 It's still not warm yet.

183
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
 It's dangerous!

184
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:23,779
 Senpai!

185
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
 Senpai!

186
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
 Senpai!

187
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
 Senpai!

188
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:32,428
 Are you okay?

189
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:37,683
 If it didn't explode, I wouldn't be an Edo girl.

190
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,857
 I'm not that bad.

191
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
 I'm home!

192
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:51,991
 Ryo-chan, are you awake?

193
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,385
 No, not yet.

194
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:58,890
 I bought sushi for you.

195
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:01,851
 What? Sushi?

196
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,005
 Senpai, are you awake?

197
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,628
 Yes, I woke up because of the word sushi.

198
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,206
 Edo girls don't have eyes for sushi.

199
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,464
 As expected of Senpai. You're so mean.

200
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:15,584
 It doesn't matter, but you should wear your pants before eating.

201
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,586
 There's no delicacy.

202
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,954
 There's no such word in my dictionary.

203
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:22,200
 Let's eat!

204
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:26,200
 What's wrong, Senpai?

205
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:28,507
 What's this sushi?

206
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:31,200
 It's an avocado roll.

207
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:32,446
 Avocado?

208
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:35,522
 It's a sushi from the west coast of America.

209
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,495
 It's healthy and very popular.

210
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:41,455
 The west coast of America?

211
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:42,989
 Healthy?

212
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,823
 Are you kidding me?

213
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:49,673
 Do you know why they call sushi Edo-mae?

214
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:51,485
 Edo-mae.

215
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,764
 In other words, it's made of fish caught in the Tokyo Bay.

216
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:57,120
 That's why it's called Edo-mae sushi.

217
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:00,017
 This is not real sushi.

218
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:04,176
 What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

219
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:05,985
 It's not that, Senpai.

220
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,538
 She bought it for you, Senpai.

221
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:12,273
 That's right.

222
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:16,614
 I can't eat sushi other than Edo-mae sushi.

223
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,200
 Then let me eat what the real Edo-mae sushi is.

224
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,403
 What's the difference between the real Edo-mae sushi and the sushi I bought?

225
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:28,200
 If I don't compare them, I can't understand Ryo-chan's attitude.

226
00:14:37,414 --> 00:14:38,561
 I got it.

227
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,037
 You can take it with you.

228
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:41,372
 Take it with you.

229
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,070
 What kind of Edo-mae sushi do you want me to eat?

230
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,719
 I'm looking forward to it.

231
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:54,082
 It's the first time Senpai is treating me.

232
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,102
 Damn it.

233
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:56,858
 I can't believe it.

234
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,714
 Let's go over there.

235
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,276
 Senpai, how far are you going?

236
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:06,451
 Just a little further.

237
00:15:06,944 --> 00:15:10,111
 It's not the sushi restaurant over there, is it?

238
00:15:10,694 --> 00:15:13,931
 I thought it was someone else, but it's the real Edo-mae sushi.

239
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:16,669
 You're from Hiromaru!

240
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:19,789
 What?

241
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:21,508
 Ryo-chan's fighting partner?

242
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:23,083
 Was it a sushi restaurant?

243
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,414
 It's been 500 years since I went to Edo-mae sushi.

244
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:29,362
 When Toyotomi Hideyoshi was still in Hiriyoshi-maru,

245
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,064
 I often went there.

246
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,588
 Tokugawa Ieyasu-ko also went there.

247
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:36,200
 It's a very important sushi restaurant.

248
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,358
 Let's go, Reiko Nakagawa.

249
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:41,734
 If you fight with someone like this, your brain will rot.

250
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:43,849
 Hey, hey.

251
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:46,751
 You're not going to join that sushi restaurant, are you?

252
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,629
 I'm the one who's going to join it.

253
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:50,283
 Damn it.

254
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:52,651
 Tokuko also fell to the ground.

255
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:55,739
 She went to the sushi restaurant to feed her juniors.

256
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,326
 Hey, senpai.

257
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:00,118
 Isn't it that restaurant?

258
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:01,479
 It's not that restaurant.

259
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:03,042
 I'm going to join this restaurant.

260
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:06,524
 I'm sure you'll satisfy us enough.

261
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,380
 Sushi restaurant.

262
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:09,013
 Let's eat.

263
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:10,710
 This is the real pleasure.

264
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:22,200
 Well, what are you going to do?

265
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,755
 This kind of restaurant is very expensive.

266
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,647
 I'm going to make it as cheap as possible.

267
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:31,200
 There's a delicious sea urchin in it, miss.

268
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,889
 Then I'll take that.

269
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:35,369
 What's wrong?

270
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,479
 No, it's nothing.

271
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,419
 What do you want me to do?

272
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,022
 You have a good taste, customer.

273
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,200
 Then I'll take it.

274
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,345
 Hey, hey.

275
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,361
 Dad.

276
00:16:45,493 --> 00:16:46,475
 Why?

277
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,535
 Are you worried about the contents of your wallet?

278
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:50,200
 It's obvious.

279
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,090
 Real Edo people don't have enough money.

280
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,484
 Don't talk nonsense.

281
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:56,565
 I...

282
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:57,984
 Where's the toilet?

283
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:58,757
 Over there.

284
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:03,539
 Even that sea urchin and tuna cost 5,000 yen.

285
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,039
 Even if I order cheap ingredients from now on,

286
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:10,262
 20,000 yen will be a little over.

287
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:15,200
 I think I should do something about it and pull it up.

288
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
 Hey, wait.

289
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,950
 I was surprised.

290
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:25,475
 This guy.

291
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:29,432
 He's just going on about expensive things again.

292
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:31,397
 If this is the case...

293
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,433
 Dad, I'd like to order a roll of kanpyo.

294
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,252
 Hey.

295
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,579
 A roll of kanpyo.

296
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:41,983
 I'm looking forward to the cheapest roll of kanpyo in the story.

297
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,220
 Special move.

298
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:45,112
 How many tricks are you going to use?

299
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:48,434
 What's this?

300
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,906
 What? It's a roll of kanpyo.

301
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:53,788
 Oh, this is a roll of kanpyo?

302
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,114
 The seaweed is shining, and there's only one kanpyo in it.

303
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,469
 Do you think Edo people can eat such a small fish?

304
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:04,154
 I've been listening to that for 500 years.

305
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,337
 This is the real Edo rice sushi.

306
00:18:06,522 --> 00:18:08,290
 Let's go, Reiko Nagagawa.

307
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,075
 Yes.

308
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,144
 Where's the money?

309
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:16,200
 There's no need to pay fake Edo rice sushi.

310
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,610
 Operation successful.

311
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,568
 Wait a minute. Giku.

312
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,623
 That roll of kanpyo is just an appetizer.

313
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:26,490
 This is the real one.

314
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,768
 It's a roll of kanpyo.

315
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:34,915
 That's right.

316
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,673
 The Edo rice roll of kanpyo is this big.

317
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:42,526
 I'm glad you said that.

318
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,442
 It's not easy.

319
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,896
 I'll make you do what you want.

320
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,413
 What are you going to do next?

321
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
 That's right.

322
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,105
 I'm going to eat the sea urchin too.

323
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
 Hey!

324
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,667
 The sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

325
00:18:57,453 --> 00:18:58,263
 Yeah.

326
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,492
 The sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

327
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:03,617
 The sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

328
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,233
 You can't do it?

329
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:07,779
 Why not?

330
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:09,804
 There's something I can't do.

331
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:10,829
 Wait a minute.

332
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
 Um...

333
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
 Space battleship...

334
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
 Space battleship...

335
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
 Space battleship...

336
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
 Space battleship...

337
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
 Space battleship...

338
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
 Space battleship...

339
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:20,206
 This is it!

340
00:19:21,356 --> 00:19:22,555
 Hey, you!

341
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,284
 What do you think?

342
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:27,925
 The sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

343
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:29,582
 What's this?

344
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:31,498
 It's a roll of kanpyo.

345
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:32,764
 Isn't it cool?

346
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:34,442
 You fool!

347
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,872
 There's no way the sea urchin roll of kanpyo is the same.

348
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,598
 This is the sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

349
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:43,175
 That's a bit wrong.

350
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,542
 There aren't many people who ask for the sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

351
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:50,639
 This is the truth.

352
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:53,315
 The sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

353
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:00,175
 This is it.

354
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,827
 I don't think I've been to a sushi restaurant unless I eat this.

355
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:06,529
 As expected of Edokko.

356
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:09,868
 Then I'll eat it in one bite.

357
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:10,587
 What?

358
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,757
 If it's Edokko, I'll eat it in one bite.

359
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:15,912
 Of course.

360
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,022
 What's next?

361
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:27,150
 That's right.

362
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:29,555
 I'll get some snacks.

363
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:32,175
 There's nothing I can't do.

364
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,745
 That's right.

365
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,125
 I'm aiming for a bonito.

366
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,532
 Aiming for a bonito?

367
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:40,155
 Aiming for a bonito.

368
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:42,903
 A sea urchin sushi roll of kanpyo.

369
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,303
 A roll of kanpyo.

370
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,200
 Curry rice.

371
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:51,200
 Curry rice.

372
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
 A rice ball with salmon and salmon roe.

373
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
 Here it is.

374
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
 Making a tuna rice ball.

375
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
 It's completely a piece of art.

376
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
 It's like watching a child.

377
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,887
 What should I do next?

378
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,579
 I still have a lot to do.

379
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,072
 That's right.

380
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,556
 Then I'll get some octopus.

381
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:16,631
 It's alive.

382
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:19,200
 Octopus is dancing in the air.

383
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,947
 This is exactly octopus dance.

384
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:24,200
 I'll eat it in a fresh house.

385
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
 This is it.

386
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,290
 I have to eat this once in Edokko.

387
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:40,770
 Oh, thank you.

388
00:21:40,795 --> 00:21:42,795
 It seems to have a good breath.

389
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:46,831
 I'll eat it if I get it.

390
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,492
 Don't make a fuss about the octopus in Edokko.

391
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:18,754
 Senpai, are you okay?

392
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:24,586
 I got it.

393
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:31,277
 I ate it.

394
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,434
 Then it's over.

395
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,390
 2 million yen.

396
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:40,516
 Is it expensive?

397
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,699
 It's not expensive.

398
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:45,273
 I was surprised that it was so cheap.

399
00:22:45,306 --> 00:22:47,247
 Of course you're fine with the payment.

400
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,200
 After all, it's Edokko.

401
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:52,682
 I'll get the money.

402
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:54,253
 Wait a minute. I'll be right back.

403
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
 I'm sorry.

404
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:15,528
 Unfortunately, I only have small ones.

405
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:17,469
 Can you count them?

406
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:19,438
 I'm happy.

407
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:21,613
 I wanted small ones.

408
00:23:21,638 --> 00:23:22,769
 Lucky.

409
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:24,794
 I thought you would say that.

410
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:27,783
 I'm sorry.

411
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:28,929
 I don't care.

412
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:35,150
 Your eyes are not laughing at all.

413
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:38,238
 I want you to make Edokko more generous.
