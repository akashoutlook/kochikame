1
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:32,000
 Visit to Nakagawa-kun's house

2
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:38,000
 Everyone, I'm going to order lunch.

3
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:39,952
 What would you like?

4
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:42,755
 I'd like char siu noodles and gyoza.

5
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:44,864
 I'd like stir-fried lebanese.

6
00:01:45,212 --> 00:01:47,000
 I'd like fried rice.

7
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:48,648
 What about you, Ryo-chan?

8
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,200
 Oh, it's before payday, so I'd like ramen rice.

9
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:58,104
 What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

10
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,087
 Are you on a diet?

11
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:04,111
 I don't think Ryo-chan is on a diet.

12
00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:06,371
 I don't think I'm on a diet.

13
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,586
 I'm working out hard like this and I'm hungry.

14
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,604
 Oh, so you're not hungry?

15
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:15,049
 No, I'm not.

16
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:18,000
 There's a party at Nakagawa's house today.

17
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:20,049
 Oh, I see.

18
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:24,385
 So there's going to be a lot of food at tonight's party, right?

19
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:25,000
 Yes.

20
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:30,276
 I'm going to make it with the help of the best chefs.

21
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:33,196
 I don't think I can eat this kind of food.

22
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:36,032
 That's why you're hungry.

23
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:40,058
 I'm not bragging, but I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

24
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:41,000
 Idiot.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,520
 You can't work if you're hungry.

26
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:45,045
 Why don't you eat lunch?

27
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:50,195
 I'm sorry, but you don't have the right to order food for your subordinates.

28
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:56,365
 By the way, can I eat char siu noodles and gyoza?

29
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,867
 I can't eat it at the party.

30
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:00,634
 That's right.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Reigo-kun, gyoza is fine.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,164
 Just make me char siu noodles.

33
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:06,048
 Yes, sir.

34
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:09,629
 I'll stop eating lebanese noodles and ramen.

35
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:11,418
 Yes, sir.

36
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,834
 Nakagawa, what kind of party is Party Party?

37
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:30,711
 It's the birthday party of the prince of the Kingdom of Hondara.

38
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:32,359
 Kingdom of Hondara?

39
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:35,375
 It's a small country, so I don't think you'll know.

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,573
 The king and my father have been friends for a long time.

41
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:41,968
 They always stay at my house when they come to Japan.

42
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:52,655
 It's the first time I've been in a wide Ferrari like this.

43
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:56,234
 I asked the president of Ferrari to make it a wide body.

44
00:03:57,116 --> 00:04:00,015
 But isn't this a traffic jam?

45
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,192
 It's okay.

46
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:03,730
 This is the C U road in Nakagawa.

47
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:04,842
 What did you say?

48
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,688
 There was an entrance to Nakagawa that went down earlier.

49
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:11,000
 But maybe Mr. Nakagawa's Nakagawa?

50
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,785
 Yes.

51
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:14,828
 He made it for my house.

52
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,724
 Are you still not tired of that?

53
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,932
 I'm so hungry that I'm going to die.

54
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,537
 No, I'm already tired.

55
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:25,337
 What?

56
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:27,000
 I can't see anything.

57
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:29,213
 The peace is just going on.

58
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:31,862
 The other side of the peace is my house.

59
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:32,887
 What?

60
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:55,127
 How much is the common place?

61
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:58,623
 I think it's 100 times bigger than Disneyland.

62
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:00,472
 What?

63
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,388
 If it's that big,

64
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:06,437
 we have to put the door here and there, right?

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 There are 12 gates in total.

66
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,440
 We are heading to the closest gate, the Gate of the Land.

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,040
 The Gate of the Land?

68
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,800
 There are other gates, like the Gate of Youth, the Gate of the World, and the Gate of the Land.

69
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
 Here we go!

70
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:44,095
 Here we are! Let's go!

71
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:54,608
 Huh?

72
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:55,488
 What's wrong?

73
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:58,294
 I think I got lost on the road.

74
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:01,289
 Don't get lost on your own road!

75
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,008
 I'll navigate right away.

76
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:06,215
 Please confirm your destination.

77
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,092
 I can't get there without using the navigation system in the Land of the Land.

78
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:18,054
 I can finally see the house.

79
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,737
 It's the same as the chief's house.

80
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:21,830
 It's small, isn't it?

81
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:23,131
 It's too small for a house with a lot of land.

82
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,617
 What?

83
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:27,611
 Isn't it a great house?

84
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,313
 Excuse me, is that a dog house?

85
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,980
 So the chief has been paying the loan for 20 years for the same house as the dog house?

86
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
 Ryo-san

87
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,773
 You laughed too much.

88
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,192
 What?

89
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:54,110
 What?

90
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:55,718
 What?

91
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:57,847
 Is this your house?

92
00:06:58,121 --> 00:06:58,800
 Yes.

93
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:01,758
 To be exact, it's a room.

94
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:05,501
 My parents live in the house over there.

95
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,874
 And over there is my younger sister's house.

96
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:13,800
 It's a small, private house.

97
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:16,177
 Please come in.

98
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:23,271
 Is this the living room?

99
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,471
 Oh, that's...

100
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,661
 It's an old-fashioned invader game.

101
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,055
 And it's black and white.

102
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,552
 It's a cellophane body.

103
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:33,114
 Wow!

104
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,289
 It's amazing!

105
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,125
 It even has a pool.

106
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,697
 No, this is a bath.

107
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:41,624
 The pool is over here.

108
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,756
 The bath house is moving.

109
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:48,058
 No, it's not.

110
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:50,454
 The whole room is moving.

111
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
 This room?

112
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,307
 It's just the face of the pool in the amusement park.

113
00:07:57,548 --> 00:07:58,703
 It's a golf course.

114
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,509
 It's an airport.

115
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:03,458
 We did it!

116
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,856
 We got 50,000 yen!

117
00:08:05,073 --> 00:08:05,898
 Did you see that?

118
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:09,010
 Mr. Ryo's great house!

119
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:11,184
 Let's leave him alone.

120
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:15,229
 What's wrong?

121
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
 What's wrong?

122
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:30,669
 What happened?

123
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:55,812
 May I come in?

124
00:08:56,027 --> 00:08:56,951
 Yes, come in.

125
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,768
 Ms. Reiko, you look great.

126
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:05,219
 Thank you very much.

127
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:08,898
 We have to dress up like this.

128
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:12,433
 We have invited some famous people.

129
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,074
 Please be patient.

130
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:19,016
 But Ryo, you look the same even in a taxido .

131
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,588
 Thank you very much.

132
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:25,489
 What's going on?

133
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:28,239
 Calm down, everyone.

134
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:34,488
 We have to be calm and calm in any situation.

135
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:37,998
 Senpai, it's not an earthquake.

136
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:39,957
 This is an elevator.

137
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:40,654
 What?

138
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:43,141
 The whole room is an elevator?

139
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:48,468
 I live in a house that is smaller than an elevator.

140
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,210
 Welcome.

141
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:01,466
 He's a great man.

142
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:02,491
 Look, look.

143
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:04,563
 Mr. Hashimoto is here too.

144
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:12,648
 Over there, there are celebrities like Sala Takaoka and Sabu Kitahima.

145
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,271
 Will get an autograph here later.

146
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:15,321
 Here you go.

147
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:16,669
 Stupid.

148
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:20,005
 More importantly, the food.

149
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,183
 Senpai, please wait.

150
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,496
 What is it?

151
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,908
 I'm going to introduce you to Prince Hondara.

152
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:30,386
 Hey, please, Hondara.

153
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:34,374
 Oh, Kei-Chi.

154
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:37,080
 Happy birthday.

155
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:38,313
 Thank you.

156
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:45,054
 I thought Prince Hondara was cooler, but he's just a fat kid.

157
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:46,557
 Ryo-chan.

158
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,599
 What is it?

159
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:58,775
 Prince, I'm going to introduce you to my colleagues.

160
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:01,235
 This is my boss, Chief Ohara.

161
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:02,797
 Nice to meet you.

162
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:04,606
 Nice to meet you.

163
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:06,800
 And this is my senpai, Ryotsu-san.

164
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:10,352
 Hello, hello.

165
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:17,184
 What are you talking about, old man?

166
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:20,855
 The prince speaks Japanese fluently.

167
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:23,145
 Idiot, why didn't you say that first?

168
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,103
 I'm going to be the man who will lead the future of Japan!

169
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,663
 Ryotsu Kankichi!

170
00:11:34,103 --> 00:11:37,605
 Ahh, This gorilla is really annoying.

171
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,373
 I was told by a pig.

172
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:41,254
 What do you mean by a pig?

173
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 Well, it's my birthday party, so let's get along.

174
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:51,271
 If you're done greeting me, I'm going to go.

175
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:59,148
 Don't worry about the prince.

176
00:11:59,274 --> 00:12:01,274
 He's just a fool.

177
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,845
 What a stupid gorilla.

178
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:14,800
 Yoita-san, please grab 10 pieces of tuna and sea urchin.

179
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 I'm sorry.

180
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,208
 The prince told me not to grab until the candle of the cake is out.

181
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,407
 I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

182
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:24,184
 Please!

183
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,529
 Give me the food.

184
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,785
 Prince.

185
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:27,933
 I'll forgive you.

186
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:29,202
 Give me the food.

187
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:32,194
 You're a good guy.

188
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:37,472
 What's wrong?

189
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:42,256
 Keiichi-senpai told me to grab a special delicious sushi.

190
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,847
 You'll be a good prince.

191
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:46,800
 Then grab it quickly.

192
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,221
 Yes.

193
00:12:48,076 --> 00:12:49,076
 Here you are.

194
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:53,074
 It looks delicious.

195
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:57,640
 I can do it.

196
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:05,176
 Wasabi!

197
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:08,843
 I got you. I got you.

198
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:10,800
 It's my plan.

199
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:15,850
 Now, please turn off the candle for the prince.

200
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:19,231
 Prince, please come to the stage.

201
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,401
 Yes.

202
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,550
 I will remember this.

203
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:42,159
 I'm going to teach him a lesson.

204
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:16,397
 Now!

205
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,197
 We failed.

206
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,738
 What did you do to the prince?

207
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,534
 It's a joke.

208
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,273
 I'm going to teach this gorila a lesson.

209
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:46,449
 Prince, I have something to tell you.

210
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:47,766
 What is it?

211
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,509
 Is there something suspicious in this mansion?

212
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:56,612
 It seems to be the work of the people of the Hontara Kingdom.

213
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:57,898
 That means...

214
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:00,350
 What's wrong, Nakagawa?

215
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,978
 It's a big problem.

216
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:05,109
 The terrorists have invaded the mansion.

217
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:05,897
 What?

218
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:09,011
 Alright.

219
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,428
 Now, I'll teach you Chinese food.

220
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:16,204
 This one.

221
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:19,107
 This one.

222
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,244
 This one.

223
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:25,584
 This one.

224
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:26,609
 This one.

225
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,634
 This one.

226
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:28,659
 This one.

227
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,966
 I think this is enough.

228
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:39,801
 I'm hungry.

229
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:43,806
 You bastard!

230
00:15:44,148 --> 00:15:45,660
 Stop!

231
00:15:48,677 --> 00:15:51,267
 I'm so hungry that I can't run.

232
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:56,585
 Aim at him.

233
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,607
 I know.

234
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,156
 Let's find the terrorists.

235
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:06,135
 What about Ryo?

236
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,299
 He won't help us.

237
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:11,875
 First, we have to protect the guests.

238
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:19,783
 I was faster.

239
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:21,412
 I was faster.

240
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:23,930
 You're rude to the prince.

241
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:26,611
 The prince is not inferior to you.

242
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:28,227
 This is mine.

243
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,306
 I won!

244
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:50,554
 What's wrong?

245
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:51,463
 What happened?

246
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:52,250
 Everyone!

247
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:53,999
 It's dangerous.

248
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:54,800
 Please be careful.

249
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,800
 The terrorists have invaded the mansion.

250
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:03,935
 My meat...

251
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,766
 My meat...

252
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:09,488
 My meat...

253
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,532
 Damn it, we failed again.

254
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,032
 We have no choice.

255
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:16,646
 We have to go inside and find the prince.

256
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,426
 What's going on?

257
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,310
 What's this?

258
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:38,173
 Please calm down.

259
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:41,507
 The central part of this room is moving to the basement.

260
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:42,630
 It's okay now.

261
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,415
 The food!

262
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:46,044
 I'm not kidding.

263
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:48,373
 I haven't eaten anything yet.

264
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,410
 Ryo-chan!

265
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:53,209
 Senpai!

266
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:55,402
 Ryo-chan, come down!

267
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,289
 Let go of me!

268
00:17:57,404 --> 00:17:59,285
 The terrorists are after the prince.

269
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,051
 If we let the prince escape...

270
00:18:02,463 --> 00:18:03,365
 Prince!

271
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:05,619
 Prince!

272
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,752
 This is the worst situation.

273
00:18:07,884 --> 00:18:10,114
 Let go of me!

274
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,910
 I won't let you to eat!

275
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,765
 You idiot! Stop it!

276
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,661
 One last piece!

277
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:32,633
 How about this?

278
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,190
 Wait for me!

279
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,309
 Senpai! Prince!

280
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:44,538
 Please leave the room immediately!

281
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:46,762
 That's not enough!

282
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,448
 My favorite chicken ball!

283
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:06,055
 What?

284
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:08,768
 You couldn't find it before me!

285
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:10,679
 You can't find it before me!

286
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:11,562
 Idiot!

287
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,317
 This isn't the time for that!

288
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:14,579
 The terrorists are coming!

289
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:16,268
 They're here!

290
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,008
 Raise your hands!

291
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:22,800
 You idiot!

292
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:24,786
 I told you this isn't the time for that!

293
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,363
 You did it!

294
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,413
 Don't ignore us!

295
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:39,914
 The chicken ball!

296
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:40,800
 Damn it!

297
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 The chicken ball!

298
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:44,800
 Wait!

299
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,687
 It's mine!

300
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:47,426
 You idiot!

301
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,892
 He is so annoying!

302
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,662
 Got it!

303
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:56,635
 It's mine!

304
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:03,636
 Where did the chicken ball go?

305
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:04,285
 Now!

306
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,033
 What's going on?

307
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:18,546
 It's a timing gas.

308
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:20,547
 It should be fine now.

309
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:29,640
 Alright, let's arrest them!

310
00:20:32,687 --> 00:20:34,056
 The chicken ball!

311
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:35,085
 Where did it go?

312
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:36,106
 Prince!

313
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:37,890
 The chicken ball!

314
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:39,759
 Prince!

315
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,718
 Do you remember them?

316
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:47,175
 Chief!

317
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:48,486
 What a shame!

318
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,856
 Don't move!

319
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:52,879
 Everyone, drop your guns and raise your hands!

320
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,290
 This is the end.

321
00:21:02,616 --> 00:21:04,754
 Prince, please go back to that world.

322
00:21:07,617 --> 00:21:09,420
 Prince, it's alright.

323
00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:13,741
 Senpai, I just need you to put in that switch

324
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:14,996
 It's gone!

325
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:15,820
 It's gone!

326
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:17,172
 It's gone!

327
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,800
 Where's the chicken ball?

328
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,427
 Where's my chicken ball?

329
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,800
 Chicken ball, chicken ball!

330
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:25,827
 He is probably looking for a big chicken ball.

331
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:26,981
 No way.

332
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,193
 What are you talking about?

333
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:32,173
 Are you praying?

334
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:35,172
 Die as you wish!

335
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,629
 I got it!

336
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:38,711
 Chicken ball!

337
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:40,543
 I'm going to eat it!

338
00:21:54,383 --> 00:21:55,383
 We did it!

339
00:21:55,671 --> 00:21:56,422
 Senior!

340
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:57,447
 We did it!

341
00:21:57,472 --> 00:21:58,667
 What happened?

342
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,249
 We did it!

343
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:02,567
 Senpai put the switch in the pit.

344
00:22:02,592 --> 00:22:03,181
 Ryo?

345
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,254
 The chicken ball...

346
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:08,139
 Where did the chicken ball go?

347
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:12,876
 I found it!

348
00:22:14,631 --> 00:22:15,800
 You did it, Ryo-chan!

349
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:17,330
 It's from the Chief!

350
00:22:17,606 --> 00:22:19,607
 Thanks to you, I was saved.

351
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,464
 Thank you, Ryo-san.

352
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:25,196
 Well, that's how it is.

353
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:30,521
 What's this?

354
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,027
 That's...

355
00:22:37,393 --> 00:22:38,808
 Everyone, help him!

356
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,247
 It looks like they pushed the emergency self-destruct switch.

357
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,248
 Here, it's from the Chief of Katsushika.

358
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,489
 You did a good job, Ryo-chan.

359
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,292
 I don't want that.

360
00:23:06,572 --> 00:23:11,939
 I want to eat the chicken ball, the sushi, and the food!

361
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:16,188
 They were shocked that they couldn't eat the party's food.

362
00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:18,081
 Hey, wait!

363
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:20,803
 Who are you?

364
00:23:21,092 --> 00:23:22,798
 Thank you for saving me.

365
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:25,394
 Last night was really fun.

366
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:26,644
 Eat it for me.

367
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:28,214
 The Prince!

368
00:23:32,949 --> 00:23:34,619
 He's so considerate.

369
00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:43,063
 Wasabi!

370
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:45,800
 I got you again!

371
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
 You're such a fool!

372
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,485
 You brat!
