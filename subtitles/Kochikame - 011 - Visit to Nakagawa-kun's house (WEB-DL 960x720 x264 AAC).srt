00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 PURi PURi PURi

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 PURi PURi PURi PURi PURi

5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,000
 The wind blows from south

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 The wind blows from south

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 With the Nagisa

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Purr Purr

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 With the Nagisa

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 More!

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Visit to Nakagawa-kun's house

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Everyone, I'm going to order lunch.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 What would you like?

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I'd like char siu noodles and gyoza.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I'd like stir-fried lebanese.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I'd like fried rice.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 What about you, Ryo-chan?

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Oh, it's before payday, so I'd like ramen rice.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Are you on a diet?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I don't think Ryo-chan is on a diet.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I don't think I'm on a diet.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I'm working out hard like this and I'm hungry.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Oh, so you're not hungry?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 No, I'm not.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 There's a party at Nakagawa's house today.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Oh, I see.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 So there's going to be a lot of food at tonight's party, right?

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Yes.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'm going to make it with the help of the best chefs.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I don't think I can eat that kind of food.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 That's why you're hungry.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I'm not bragging, but I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Idiot.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 You can't work if you're hungry.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Why don't you eat lunch?

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I'm sorry, but I don't have the right to order food for my subordinates.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 By the way, can I eat char siu noodles and gyoza?

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I can't eat it at the party.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 That's right.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Reigo-kun, gyoza is fine.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Just make me char siu noodles.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Yes, sir.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I'll stop eating lebanese noodles and ramen.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Yes, sir.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Nakagawa, what kind of party is Party Party?

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 It's the birthday party of the prince of the Kingdom of Hondara.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Kingdom of Hondara?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 It's a small country, so I don't think you'll know.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 The king and my father have been friends for a long time.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 They always stay at my house when they come to Japan.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 It's the first time I've been in a wide Ferrari like this.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 I asked the president of Ferrari to make it a wide body.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 But isn't this a traffic jam?

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 It's okay.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 This is the C U road in Nakagawa.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 What did you say?

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 There was an entrance to Nakagawa that went down earlier.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Maybe Mr. Nakagawa's Nakagawa?

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Nakagawa's Nakagawa?

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Nakagawa's Nakagawa?

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 But maybe Mr. Nakagawa's Nakagawa?

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Yes.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 He made it for my house.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Are you still tired of that?

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I'm so hungry that I'm going to die.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 No, I'm already tired.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 What?

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I can't see anything.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 The peace is just going on.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 The other side of the peace is my house.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 What?

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Ninth District

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 How much is the common place?

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I think it's 100 times bigger than Disneyland.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 What?

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 If it's that big,

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 we have to put the door here and there, right?

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 There are 12 gates in total.

80
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,440
 We are heading to the closest gate, the Gate of the Land.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,040
 The Gate of the Land?

82
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,800
 There are other gates, like the Gate of Youth, the Gate of the World, and the Gate of the Land.

83
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
 The Gate of the Land?

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
 Here we go!

85
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
 Here we are! Let's go!

86
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
 Huh?

87
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
 What's wrong?

88
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
 I think I got lost on the road.

89
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
 Don't get lost on your own!

90
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
 I'll navigate right away.

91
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
 Please confirm your destination.

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
 I can't get there without using the navigation system in the Land of the Land.

93
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
 I can finally see the house.

94
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
 It's the same as the chief's house.

95
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
 It's small, isn't it?

96
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
 It's too small for a house with a lot of land.

97
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
 What?

98
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
 Isn't it a great house?

99
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
 Excuse me, is that a dog house?

100
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,800
 So the chief has been paying the loan for 20 years for the same house as the dog house?

101
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
 Mr. Yoh!

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
 You laughed too much.

103
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
 What?

104
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
 What?

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
 What?

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
 Is this your house?

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
 Yes.

108
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
 To be exact, it's a room.

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
 My parents live in the house over there.

110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
 And over there is my younger sister's house.

111
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 It's a small, private house.

112
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
 Please come in.

113
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,800
 Is this the living room?

114
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 Oh, that's...

115
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
 It's an old-fashioned invader game.

116
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
 And it's black and white.

117
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
 It's a cellophane body.

118
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
 Wow!

119
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
 It's amazing!

120
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
 It even has a pool.

121
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
 No, this is a bath.

122
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
 The pool is over here.

123
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
 The bath house is moving.

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
 It's moving.

125
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
 No, it's not.

126
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
 The whole room is moving.

127
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
 This room?

128
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
 It's just the face of the pool in the amusement park.

129
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
 It's a golf course.

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
 It's an airport.

131
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
 We did it!

132
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 We got 50,000 yen!

133
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
 Did you see that?

134
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
 Mr. Ryo's great house!

135
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 Let's leave him alone.

136
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
 What's wrong?

137
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
 What's wrong?

138
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 What happened?

139
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
 Ryo's House

140
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
 May I come in?

141
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
 Yes, come in.

142
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
 Ms. Reiko, you look great.

143
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
 Thank you very much.

144
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,800
 We have to dress up like this.

145
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
 We have invited some famous people.

146
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
 Please be patient.

147
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,800
 But Ryo, you look the same even in a taxi.

148
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
 Thank you very much.

149
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
 What's going on?

150
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
 Calm down, everyone.

151
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,800
 We have to be calm and calm in any situation.

152
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
 Senpai, it's not an earthquake.

153
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
 This is an elevator.

154
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 What?

155
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
 The whole room is an elevator?

156
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,800
 I don't live in a house that is smaller than an elevator.

157
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
 Welcome.

158
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
 He's a great man.

159
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
 Look, look.

160
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
 Mr. Hashimoto is here too.

161
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:11,800
 Over there, there are celebrities like Sala Takaoka and Sabu Kitahima.

162
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
 Sign here later.

163
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
 Here you go.

164
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
 Stupid.

165
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
 More importantly, the food.

166
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
 Senpai, please wait.

167
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
 What is it?

168
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,800
 I'm going to introduce you to Prince Hondara.

169
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
 Hey, please, Hondara.

170
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
 Okay.

171
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
 Happy birthday.

172
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
 Thank you.

173
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
 Thank you.

174
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,800
 I thought Prince Hondara was cooler, but he's just a fat kid.

175
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
 Ryo-chan.

176
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
 What is it?

177
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,800
 Prince, I'm going to introduce you to my colleagues.

178
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 This is my boss, Chief Ohara.

179
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
 Nice to meet you.

180
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 Nice to meet you.

181
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
 And this is my senpai, Ryotsu-san.

182
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
 Hello, hello.

183
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
 What are you talking about, old man?

184
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 The prince speaks Japanese fluently.

185
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
 Idiot, why didn't you say that first?

186
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,800
 I'm going to be the man who will lead the future of Japan!

187
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,800
 Ryotsu Kankichi!

188
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,800
 This gorilla is really annoying.

189
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
 I was told by a pig.

190
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
 What do you mean by a pig?

191
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 Well, it's my birthday party, so let's get along.

192
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,800
 If you're done greeting me, I'm going to go.

193
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
 Don't worry about the prince.

194
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
 He's just a fool.

195
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 What a stupid gorilla.

196
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,800
 Yoita-san, please grab 10 pieces of tuna and sea urchin.

197
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 I'm sorry.

198
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,800
 The prince told me not to grab until the candle of the cake is out.

199
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
 I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

200
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
 Please!

201
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
 Don't grab it.

202
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 Prince.

203
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
 I'll forgive you.

204
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
 Don't grab it.

205
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 You're a good guy.

206
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
 What's wrong?

207
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 Keiichi-senpai told me to grab a special delicious sushi.

208
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
 You'll be a good prince.

209
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
 Then grab it quickly.

210
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
 Yes.

211
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
 Here you are.

212
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
 It looks delicious.

213
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
 I can do it.

214
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,800
 Wasabi!

215
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
 I got caught.

216
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
 It's my fault.

217
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,800
 Now, please turn off the candle for the prince.

218
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,800
 Prince, please come to the stage.

219
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
 Yes.

220
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
 I don't remember.

221
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
 Thank you very much.

222
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 I'm going to teach him a lesson.

223
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
 Congratulations!

224
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
 Prince!

225
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
 Now!

226
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
 I failed.

227
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
 What did you do to the prince?

228
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
 It's a joke.

229
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,800
 I'm going to teach you a lesson.

230
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
 Prince, I have something to tell you.

231
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 What is it?

232
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
 Is there something suspicious in this mansion?

233
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,800
 It seems to be the work of the people of the Hontara Kingdom.

234
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
 That means...

235
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
 What's wrong, Nakagawa?

236
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
 It's a big problem.

237
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 The terrorists have invaded the mansion.

238
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
 What?

239
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
 Alright.

240
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,800
 Now, I'll teach you Chinese food.

241
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
 This one.

242
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
 This one.

243
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
 This one.

244
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
 This one.

245
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
 This one.

246
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
 This one.

247
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
 This one.

248
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
 This one.

249
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
 I think this is enough.

250
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
 I'm hungry.

251
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
 You bastard!

252
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
 Get up!

253
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,800
 I'm so hungry that I can't run.

254
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
 Aim at them.

255
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
 I know.

256
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
 Let's find the terrorists.

257
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 What about Ryo?

258
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
 He won't help us.

259
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,800
 First, we have to protect the guests.

260
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
 I was faster.

261
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
 I was faster.

262
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
 You're rude to the prince.

263
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,800
 The prince is not inferior to you.

264
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
 This is mine.

265
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
 I won!

266
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
 What's wrong?

267
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
 What happened?

268
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
 Everyone!

269
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 It's dangerous.

270
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
 Please be careful.

271
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
 The terrorists have invaded the mansion.

272
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
 My meat...

273
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
 My meat...

274
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
 My meat...

275
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
 Damn it, we failed again.

276
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
 We have no choice.

277
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,800
 We have to go inside and find the prince.

278
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
 What's going on?

279
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 What's this?

280
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
 Please calm down.

281
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
 The central part of this room is moving to the basement.

282
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 It's okay now.

283
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
 The food!

284
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 I'm not kidding.

285
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
 I haven't eaten anything yet.

286
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
 I'm not kidding.

287
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
 I haven't eaten anything yet.

288
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
 I haven't eaten anything yet.

289
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
 I haven't eaten anything yet.

290
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
 I haven't eaten anything yet.

291
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
 Ryo-chan!

292
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
 Senpai!

293
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
 Ryo-chan, come down!

294
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
 Let go of me!

295
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
 The terrorists are after the prince.

296
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
 If we let the prince escape...

297
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
 Prince!

298
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
 Prince!

299
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
 This is the worst situation.

300
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,800
 Let go of me!

301
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,800
 I won't let you eat me!

302
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,800
 You idiot! Stop it!

303
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
 One last piece!

304
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
 How about this?

305
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
 Wait for me!

306
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
 Senpai! Prince!

307
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
 Please leave the room immediately!

308
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
 That's not enough!

309
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
 My favorite chicken ball!

310
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 What?

311
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
 You can't find it before me!

312
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
 You can't find it before me!

313
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
 Idiot!

314
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
 This isn't the time for that!

315
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
 The terrorists are coming!

316
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
 They're here!

317
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
 Raise your hands!

318
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 You idiot!

319
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 I told you this isn't the time for that!

320
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
 You did it!

321
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
 Don't ignore us!

322
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
 The chicken ball!

323
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
 The chicken ball!

324
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
 Damn it!

325
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 The chicken ball!

326
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
 Wait!

327
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
 It's mine!

328
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
 You idiot!

329
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
 You're so annoying!

330
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
 Prince!

331
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
 It's mine!

332
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
 Where did the chicken ball go?

333
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
 Now!

334
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
 What's going on?

335
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
 It's a timing gas.

336
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
 It should be fine now.

337
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
 Alright, let's arrest them!

338
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
 The chicken ball!

339
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
 Where did it go?

340
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
 Prince!

341
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
 The chicken ball!

342
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
 Prince!

343
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
 Do you remember them?

344
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
 Chief!

345
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
 What a shame!

346
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 Don't move!

347
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,800
 Everyone, drop your guns and raise your hands!

348
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
 This is the end.

349
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
 Prince, please go back to that world.

350
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,800
 Prince, it's alright.

351
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,800
 I just need you to put in that switch.

352
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 It's gone!

353
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
 It's gone!

354
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 It's gone!

355
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
 Where's the chicken ball?

356
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
 Where's my chicken ball?

357
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
 Chicken ball, chicken ball!

358
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,800
 They're probably looking for a big chicken ball.

359
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
 No way.

360
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
 What are you talking about?

361
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 Are you praying?

362
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,800
 Die as you wish!

363
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
 I got it!

364
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
 Chicken ball!

365
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
 I'm going to eat it!

366
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
 We did it!

367
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
 Senior!

368
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
 We did it!

369
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
 What happened?

370
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
 We did it!

371
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,800
 Senior put the switch in the pit.

372
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 Ryo?

373
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
 The chicken ball...

374
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,800
 Where did the chicken ball go?

375
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
 I found it!

376
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
 You did it, Ryo-chan!

377
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
 It's from the Chief!

378
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,800
 Thanks to you, I was saved.

379
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
 Thank you, Ryo-san.

380
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
 Well, that's how it is.

381
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
 What's this?

382
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 That's...

383
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 Everyone, help me!

384
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,800
 It looks like they pushed the emergency self-destruct switch.

385
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,800
 Here, it's from the Chief of Katsushika.

386
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
 You did a good job, Ryo-chan.

387
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
 I don't want that.

388
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,800
 I want to eat the chicken ball, the sushi, and the food!

389
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,800
 They were shocked that they couldn't eat the party's food.

390
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
 Hey, wait!

391
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
 Who are you?

392
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
 Thank you for saving me.

393
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
 Last night was really fun.

394
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
 Eat it for me.

395
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 The Prince!

396
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
 He's so considerate.

397
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 Wasabi!

398
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
 I got you again!

399
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
 You're such a fool!

400
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
 You brat!

401
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,800
 To be continued...

402
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
 Teyandee!

403
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
 I, Ryotsu Kankichi, am an edokko!

404
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,800
 Edokkos don't have eyes for fighting and eating sushi!

405
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,800
 Can you put edokkos in such a lukewarm bath?

406
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
 Make it hotter!

407
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
 It's not hot at all!

408
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
 Next time, it's a fierce edokkoga battle!

409
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 See you!

00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,800
