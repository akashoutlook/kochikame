1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Everybody can do!

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I don't want to say it even if it sticks out a little.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Don't worry about making a fuss.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Strong and high-pitched voice.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Gyozutsuki Test Special Report

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Wow, this is great!

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 TXR-002 Robojack.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 40,000 yen.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I can't buy it even if it stands upside down.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I can't buy it.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 This tiger is also a short-tempered person in front of his payday.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Oh, no!

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Stop!

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Wait!

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Good job, Junpei!

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 You're having a hard time again.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Are you going to study?

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 You have a test tomorrow, right?

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 That's right, but even if I do it now, my head won't get better all of a sudden.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 That's right.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Ryo-san.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Gigu.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 What's the good thing about an adult who is so old with a child?

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 It's a masterpiece of a full action robot equipped with a radio channel.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Those who understand it will understand it.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Those who don't understand it won't understand it.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Is that so?

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 If Junpei gets at least 80 points on the test, I'll buy it no matter how much it costs.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Really?

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Really?

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Will you buy it no matter how much it costs?

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 It's an example.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 You can't get 80 points, right?

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Ryo-san.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I'll buy it no matter how much it costs.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 What?

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Look at the Nagashima Titans this year.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 They beat the 11.5 game difference in the first half and won the Miraculous League.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 If you have the will to do it, you can do anything.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 If Junpei gets 80 points, he'll really buy the radio channel.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Well, that's true.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Alright, it's decided.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Let's go, Junpei.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Hey, Ryo-san.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Ryo-san, wait for me.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Nene.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 What are you going to do, Ryo-san?

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 What are you going to do?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Leave it to me.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 In return, if you get the radio channel, I'll buy it for free.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Alright.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I'll do it.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I'll definitely do it.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Huh?

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 A home teacher?

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 A home teacher?

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 What happened to a home teacher?

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Why is Senpai here again?

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 You can do it.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Ryo-chan is a home teacher.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 What?

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Don't make fun of me.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 What are you going to do if you don't know how to study in elementary school?

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Alright, let's get started.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Get started?

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 The test is tomorrow, right?

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 That's why.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 From now on, don't sleep for 24 hours and study.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 What?

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 That's too much.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 It's not too much.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 When I was in high school, I studied without sleeping for three days and passed the test.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 You didn't sleep at all?

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Why are you saying that again?

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 If you sleep, you'll forget everything you've learned.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 It's too much.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 But normally, people's concentration doesn't last that long, right?

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Yes.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 They say that it's better to take a break at work.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 That's a commoner's story.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 In my case, my concentration is different.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Ordinary common sense doesn't work.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 It's right to say that there is no common sense.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Listen carefully.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Normally, the pace goes up and then it falls.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 But in my case, it starts from the peak.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And then it rushes into the test day.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 That's a lot of concentration.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I can't believe it.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I'll tell you why.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Even if a commoner is focused, it's still a lot.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 In my case, my whole body is focused on the test from my brain to my fingertips.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 I have 100% common sense.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 But if I don't pay attention to one thing, I'll fall to zero.

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I see.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 It's like a human airplane.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 It's like Ryo-chan.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I'm so happy.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 That's why I'm going to teach you how I do it.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Where did they go?

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Wow, that's amazing.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Oh, no.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I knew it.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 I hid my plan.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Wait a minute.

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Stop it.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Don't touch it.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Ryo-chan, are you really going to study?

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 I understand your concentration, but it's a different problem from your academic ability.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Where are you going to study?

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 How are you going to become a teacher?

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I don't know.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 How long are you going to play?

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Are you really going to study?

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Of course.

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 If it's for the radio, it's in the fire and in the water.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Come on, give me the problem sheet.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 What's the test range?

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 All right, let's start with the language problem.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Well, what's this?

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Answer the meaning of the next word.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 50 steps, 100 steps.

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 It's easy.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 That's you.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 You said 50 steps, 100 steps.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 This is the starting line.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 All right, Junpei.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Walk 100 steps from here.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 All right.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 One, two, three, four.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Is that so?

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 One, two, three, four.

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Oh, Ryo-chan.

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 It's dangerous to play on the road.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Grandma, this is studying.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Oh, my God.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 100 steps, 100 steps.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Good job, Ryo-san.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 All right.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Ryo-chan, what are you going to do?

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I don't know.

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Exactly.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Exactly.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 In other words, 50 steps, 100 steps.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 It means that even if you walk 100 steps with your feet,

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 you can walk 50 steps when you become an adult.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Yes, I got it.

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 I see.

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 That's the interpretation.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 That's not true.

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Sleeping pills from the second floor?

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Hey, Ryo-san.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 What do you mean?

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Well, you should try it.

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Let's go, Ryo-san.

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 All right, let's go.

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Aim well.

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Are you really going to take sleeping pills from the second floor?

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 We did it!

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 What do you think, Ryo-san?

167
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Did you get it?

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 I'm getting dizzy.

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Sleeping pills from the second floor

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 makes me feel so good.

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Hey, Ryo-san.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Yes?

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 That's a completely different explanation.

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Sleeping pills from the second floor

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 are useless because they are too round.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 50 steps, 100 steps,

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 is a saying that came from China.

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 People who ran 50 steps on the battlefield

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 can't help but laugh at people who ran 100 steps.

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 It means that there is no difference between them.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Oh, no.

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 I'm going to lose my job.

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Yes, hello?

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Shut up, Reiko!

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 You can't be so logical.

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 What did you say?

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Excuse me.

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 The neighbors are calling.

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 They want you to go with them

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 to pick up a car that is being parked illegally.

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Yes.

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Listen, Ryo-chan.

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 I'll be right back,

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 so don't tell them anything weird.

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 All right, all right.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 I'm going to work now.

197
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 You can take your time.

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Oh, no.

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Now, the noisy one is gone.

200
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 If you have any questions,

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 feel free to ask me.

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Yes, Ryo-san.

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 What?

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 What is Tsurukame-zan?

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 What?

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Tsurukame-zan?

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 This.

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Well, what is it?

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Is there a crane and a turtle?

210
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 If you count the number of heads,

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 there are a total of 20.

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 If you count the number of legs,

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 there are 62.

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 What is Tsuru?

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 How many turtles are there?

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Tsuru has two legs

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 and four turtles.

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 So...

219
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It's a radio turtle.

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Come on, come on.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Come on, help me.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Hey, Ryo-san.

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Did you catch the turtle?

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 You're annoying.

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Hey, how about the turtle?

226
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 There it is.

227
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Alright.

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 It's about time.

229
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Don't be angry.

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 The turtle is in your place.

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Hey, there's a turtle too.

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Alright, now it's finally Tsurukame-zan.

233
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Oh, no.

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Hey, hey.

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 If you hold your legs,

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 you won't understand.

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Stop it.

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Oh, no.

239
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Tsurukame-zan is good.

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 It's Rika.

241
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Rika, Rika.

242
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 This is a very important lesson.

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Is this Rika?

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 That's right.

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 The principle of the pet bottle rocket

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 is to use the law of left and right.

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 The law of left and right means

248
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 that the person who uses force

249
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 can only receive this much force.

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 If you send a lot of air into the water

251
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 and spray it at once...

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 ...the compressed air will blow out the water

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 and the pet bottle will fly away

254
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 with the same amount of force.

255
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 This is the same as the principle

256
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 of the real space rocket.

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Hey, hey, Ryo-san.

258
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Can you make a bigger one?

259
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 A bigger one?

260
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Alright.

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 It's a big problem.

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Alright, it's done.

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Drum rocket Ryo-tsugo.

264
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Let's launch it quickly.

265
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Alright, let's go.

266
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Ryo-san, please take care of it later.

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Please take care of it.

268
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Hey, you coward!

269
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Ryo-san, are you alright?

270
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Are you alright?

271
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Are you alright?

272
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Alright, let's go to the social club next.

273
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Turn right and there is a dance shop.

274
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I didn't think there was such a map with a symbol.

275
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 The release site is a punishment mark.

276
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Your acting is bad.

277
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 My acting is bad.

278
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Maru is better.

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Maru is a district office or a district office.

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Oh, it's a ninja mark.

281
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Oh, this is the mark of Manji Shuriken.

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 There are other Shurikens,

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Roppou Shuriken,

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 and Happou Shuriken.

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 You know a lot, Ryo-san.

286
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Of course.

287
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 By the way,

288
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Shuriken can be made with origami.

289
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Really?

290
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Here you are.

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Cool!

292
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 I used to make this and play ninja.

293
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Tell me!

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Alright.

295
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 First, fold the origami.

296
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Keiichi Nakagawa.

297
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 I'm back.

298
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Reiko Akimoto.

299
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I'm back.

300
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Reiko Akimoto.

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 I'm back.

302
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Reiko Akimoto.

303
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I'm back.

304
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I'm back.

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Thank you for your hard work.

306
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 How is the teacher doing?

307
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 He seems to be doing it quietly.

308
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 How is it, Ryo-chan?

309
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Are you moving forward?

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Damn it!

311
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Damn it!

312
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 How can Fuma Ryo-tsu hit such a bad Shuriken?

313
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 What?

314
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Fuma Ryo-tsu!

315
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Just as I thought.

316
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 I was surprised.

317
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 It's the same as when I was a child.

318
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Fuma Ninja Art!

319
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Hey, Ryo-chan!

320
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Ryo-chan!

321
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Oh, you're back.

322
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Well, this is...

323
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Damn it!

324
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I'm done for.

325
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I thought so, but I'm done for.

326
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 I'm done for.

327
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 History is simple.

328
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 If you do Maruan-Ki, you can get points for sure.

329
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Yeah.

330
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Well, how many years has Taika been?

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 What?

332
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Taika Katsushin?

333
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 No.

334
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 It's Kaishin.

335
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Taika Kaishin.

336
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 It's been 645 years.

337
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 The way to remember it is Muji-ko no Yozukuri, Taika no Kaishin.

338
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 What?

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 I see.

340
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 By the way, there's also the way to get drunk in the crowd.

341
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 That's the way to remember Heihou-kon.

342
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Sui-hei, Ri-bei, my ship.

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 That's the Gensokigo.

344
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 There's also Nakuyo, Uguisu, Heian-kyo, Iyoku-ni Moeru, Kolombusu.

345
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 There's something like that.

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Yeah, that's it!

347
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Iyoku-ni Moeru, Kolombusu.

348
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Suikin, Chikamoku, Dotten, Kaimei, Kyojin, Taiho, Tamagoyaki.

349
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Oh, Kaneda, Hirooka.

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Oh, Kaneda, Hirooka.

351
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 What?

352
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 What the hell is that?

353
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 What are you going to teach your child?

354
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I learned it when I was a child.

355
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 If you have any questions, tell me.

356
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Hey, hey.

357
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 You're the only one who's not excited.

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Tell me.

359
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Tell me.

360
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Sorry, sorry.

361
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 I remember that 645 was the peak of Taika.

362
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Yeah.

363
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Next is Ono no Imoko.

364
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Oh, I know that.

365
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Ono no Imoko is famous for eating sweet potatoes.

366
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It's a nostalgic name.

367
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 You ate sweet potatoes and became a swordsman?

368
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Swordsman?

369
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Wasn't Ono no Imoko just a person who ate sweet potatoes and got angry?

370
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Why does the name remain in history?

371
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Because it was the first time in Japan that someone ate sweet potatoes and got angry.

372
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 I don't like it anymore.

373
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I don't have any expectations.

374
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 There was also a swordsman, right?

375
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 There is.

376
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 It will be about 20 years later than swordsman.

377
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 There must have been a swordsman ship.

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Yes.

379
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 It's a ship that was used to go to China.

380
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Didn't that ship look like this?

381
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Did you see it?

382
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 It's a ship with a lot of people.

383
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 It's amazing.

384
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 I think it must have been like that.

385
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 You remember it well.

386
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 I'm starting to remember it.

387
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I remember that U-Boat was fishing at Gento Shisen.

388
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 I remember drawing a picture in the textbook.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 It's cool.

390
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 It's cool.

391
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 But you remember the small parts of the ship well.

392
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I imitated the ship and drew it many times.

393
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I'll also draw Kanrinmaru.

394
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Kanrinmaru is a small wooden ship with a length of about 50 meters made in the Netherlands.

395
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I think it was used as a training ship for the Bakufu Navy.

396
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 It has five cannons.

397
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 You know a lot.

398
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Someone rode this and went to America.

399
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Who was it?

400
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 It's not Katsushin.

401
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It's Kaishu Katsu, right?

402
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Yes, that person.

403
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 I don't have any knowledge of history, but I only remember the picture of the textbook.

404
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I'll also draw characters.

405
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 How about Ferry?

406
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Ferry?

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 I think it was like this.

408
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Please look at it.

409
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Amazing.

410
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Yes.

411
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 I think it's similar.

412
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Why did you draw it so quickly?

413
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 I was on the textbook.

414
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 I always drew like this in class.

415
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 There was also Sugita Genpak.

416
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It looks like this when you draw it like a picture.

417
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 How is it? It's good.

418
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 This hand's head is the most difficult to draw.

419
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I was happy at that time.

420
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Hey, Ryo-san.

421
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Can you draw Yoritomo Minamoto?

422
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 How about Hideyoshi?

423
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Yes, of course.

424
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 I can draw it.

425
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 I can draw Ieyasu, Nobunaga, Francis and Xavier.

426
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Senpai, do you know what kind of person Sugita Genpak is?

427
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 That's you.

428
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 It's decided by Rakuoka.

429
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 It's a famous person who drew a new chapter.

430
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I thought it was Rakuoka from the beginning.

431
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Was it a person who drew the Yajikita Road?

432
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 That's Juppenschaick.

433
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I think I learned a lot.

434
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I don't know.

435
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 No matter what the test is.

436
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Don't draw it.

437
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 You're good at drawing.

438
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Ryo-chan will teach you something boring.

439
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 I'm impressed, too.

440
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 That's all for today's lesson.

441
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Hey, what are you going to do with the radio?

442
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 I can't help it.

443
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It's a joke.

444
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Ryo-chan, bring it back.

445
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Me?

446
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 It's a lesson to teach you not to do this kind of thing.

447
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 What?

448
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Where did they go?

449
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Are they...

450
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 What is this?

451
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Ryo-san, are you okay?

452
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Shut up!

453
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Hey, I found it!

454
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Ryo-san!

455
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Are you guys going to stop?

456
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 You guys are really good at this.

457
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I'm sorry.

458
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Ryo-san, look!

459
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Are you going to use that hand?

460
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Look, it's the same as your brother's drawing.

461
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 What's that?

462
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Hey, isn't that Magushiro Tatsu?

463
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 I knew it.

464
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 He changed his clothes.

465
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Hey!

466
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Wait!

467
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 I won't let you get away!

468
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Ryo-san, punch!

469
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Magushiro Tatsu, arrest!

470
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 How did you know?

471
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 It's a piece of cake.

472
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I was just trying to teach them how fun it is to play pranks.

473
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 You're in a good mood.

474
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Now that the test is complete, there's nothing to say.

475
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Idiot, it's already done.

476
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Who do you think taught you?

477
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Ryo-san!

478
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Look, look!

479
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 You did it, 80 points!

480
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 You're the best, 50 points.

481
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 What? I didn't get 30 points, why?

482
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Because you helped the culprit arrest him.

483
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 The police officer bought you.

484
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 That's good.

485
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Yeah!

486
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Yeah!

487
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 There's nothing like studying on a desk in the world.

488
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 My practical way of studying is the true way of studying.

489
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Yeah!

490
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 For example, my boss came here with only one study.

491
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 That's why he's so stubborn.

492
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 He doesn't even smile when he sees a variety show on TV.

493
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 He gets angry.

494
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Wait, Senpai.

495
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 But it's true.

496
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 You can't have a subordinate with such a stubborn head.

497
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 He's just a stubborn old man.

498
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Good for you!

499
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 B-Boss!

500
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 You did a good job yesterday.

501
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You helped the citizens and arrested the culprit.

502
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 You're a good police officer.

503
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I'd appreciate it if you could erase your practical way of studying.

504
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 You're joking again, boss.

505
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 They did it on their own.

506
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Don't say that.

507
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Erase it now!

508
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Yeah!

509
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Why am I the only one who gets to see this?

510
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Kyoro-san!

511
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I heard you were busy.

512
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Yeah!

513
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Hey, you guys help too!

514
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Yeah!

515
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Ryo-san!

516
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 We're going to the park to play.

517
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Come when you're done!

518
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Come!

519
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Damn them!

520
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Idiots!

521
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 How can they do this?

522
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 It's fun to clean up.

523
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Ryo-kun.

524
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Did you forget what you said earlier?

525
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I'm going to ask you to pay for the broken show window.

526
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 What?

527
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 I don't need that, boss!

528
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Bonus! Bonus! I'm so happy!

529
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 What?

530
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Pay me back!

531
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 No!

532
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 I'm the one who made the money!

533
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I won't give it to anyone!

534
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Next time on Bonus Consulting Battle!

535
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Thanks for watching!

536
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 The End

537
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 The End

538
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 The End
