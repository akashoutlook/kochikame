1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Kachidoki Bridge, open!

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 That was a wonderful wedding ceremony.

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Yeah.

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Cheers!

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Hey, you came to Ginza after all.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Look at the Kachidoki Bridge and go home.

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 But the direction is the opposite.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 What are you complaining about?

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Oh, I understand!

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Well...

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Ryo-chan...

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Ryo-chan, it's the Kachidoki Bridge.

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Ryo-chan, we're here.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Get up.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Come on, tell him to go by himself.

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Kei-chan, stop!

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 What?

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 What is it?

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 There's a man on the bridge.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 What?

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 He's not a ghost, is he?

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Where are you, Reiko-san?

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I'm sure he's on top of this steel frame.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Are you sure?

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Yes, I'm sure I saw him.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 He looked like he was about to jump off.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 That was a wonderful wedding ceremony.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Yeah.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 In the morning, there was a teacup standing in the morning.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I feel really good.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Yes, is that so?

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Thank you for your help.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 It seems that there were no accidents or incidents near the Kachidoki Bridge.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Kachidoki Bridge?

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But why was there a man there?

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Good morning.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Senpai, good luck.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 The chief is in a good mood this morning.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Lucky.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Good morning.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I drank too much.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Idiot!

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 What do you think you're doing?

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Please don't yell at me.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 My head is pounding.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Come here.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 I'll squeeze you a lot.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I'm not a stray cat.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Hey, where are you in a good mood?

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Let's get out of here.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 What's wrong?

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 He was in such a good mood.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Idiot!

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Kachidoki Bridge

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 It's illegal parking.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Good morning.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Oh, it's Sapporo No.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Yes.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 It was illegal parking near Kachidoki Bridge since last night.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Kachidoki Bridge? Since last night?

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Yes.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 The neighbor saw a tall man in a white dress get off.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 White dress?

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Could it be from last night?

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Hello.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Please introduce the owner of the car.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 The number is Sapporo.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 It doesn't seem to be illegal parking.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Is it an accident?

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 No.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 It's not decided by the car of the man last night.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Yes.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Toyohirakku, Sapporo City.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Yes.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Shiratori.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 A pure white chicken and a pure white chicken.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 It's Shiratori Jun.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Thank you very much.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Did something happen to Shiratori Jun?

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Yes.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Ouch.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Do you know him, Byo-chan?

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 He's a friend from my junior high school days.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Well, it was only a short time ago.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 He left his car near Kachidoki Bridge and disappeared somewhere.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Kachidoki Bridge?

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Oh, that's right.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 He came to see the bridge.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 The bridge?

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 What do you mean, senpai?

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Well, that was when I was a cute junior high school student.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Yo, Kankichi.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Yes.

94
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:45,898
 Wow.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Big spin ball.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 My head is spinning.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Kankichi, who told you to spin in the air?

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It's a service.

99
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:09,389
 Kankichi, you're amazing.

100
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:09,881
 You're the best.

101
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:12,932
 Jun, did you have fun?

102
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,704
 Next time, I'll show you something more flashy.

103
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,780
 Kankichi.

104
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:17,689
 Yes.

105
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:24,187
 Hey, Jun.

106
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:26,294
 You went to Banpak, didn't you?

107
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,319
 That's great.

108
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:30,344
 But I couldn't see it very well because it was crowded.

109
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:31,975
 I heard you went on the Shinkansen.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Have you ever ridden a Tonkichi?

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I've only ridden the Toobu Line.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Would you like some tea?

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Thank you.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Please enjoy your meal.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Oh, it's a cake again.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I'm sorry all the time, auntie.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 It's okay.

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 From now on, get along with Jun.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Yes.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Well, take your time.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 When I go to the gym, I don't get bored at all when I look at Kanchan and the others.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Kankichi is the only one who is energetic.

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Next time, I'll show you a bomb.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 In return, show me again when you're testing.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 I have 2.5 vision.

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 I can't do canning.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Anyway, it's a great book.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Did everyone read this book?

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Roughly.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 I'll lend it to you anytime.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 We're not good at this kind of hot books.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Right, Tonkichi?

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Yes.

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Just the textbook is enough.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 That's right.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 I think this is interesting.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Japan's...

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 It's called Japan's Kado Bridge.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I like this kind of thing.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Isn't it Kachidoki Bridge?

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 It's true.

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Yes, it's Kachidoki Bridge.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Do you know it?

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I know much about bridges.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Shirahige, Kototoi, Azuma, Komagata, Umae, Kuramae, Ryogoku, Kiyosu, Eitae, Tsukuda, Kachidoki.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 That's it.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 It's a bridge on the Sumida River.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Wow.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I was reminded of it when I was in elementary school.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 My favorite is Kachidoki Bridge.

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 It moves like this.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I want to see it once.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 You haven't seen it?

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I want to see it, but it's far away.

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 It's close.

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 It's just over the bank.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 The car stops and the bridge opens slowly.

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 When you look at the bridge, the road is like a wall.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It's very powerful.

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 It's amazing.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I want to see it with my own eyes.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Let's go to Kachidoki Bridge.

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 It's about 20 minutes by bicycle.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Okay.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Let's go.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 This is the way of justice.

167
00:09:28,055 --> 00:09:29,460
 We're almost there.

168
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,679
 Look.

169
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,663
 That bridge opens.

170
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:47,095
 It's perfect from here.

171
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:50,319
 I always buy bread and look at it while eating.

172
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,950
 The boat is coming.

173
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:52,975
 It opens.

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 It opens.

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 It doesn't open.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 It's strange.

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 It should open at noon.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 What's wrong?

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 It doesn't open anymore?

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It opened yesterday.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,142
 It doesn't open anymore.

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 It's time to transport land.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 It's easier to transport water.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I didn't know that.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Kachidoki Bridge doesn't open anymore?

186
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,390
 Once you decide, it won't open again.

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,236
 It's always us who make people cry.

188
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,210
 I'm so disappointed that I came to see it.

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 I was looking forward to seeing it.

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Don't be upset, Jun.

191
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:15,483
 Kondo.

192
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,508
 Yes.

193
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:17,533
 Shibayama.

194
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:18,558
 Yes.

195
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,583
 Shiratori.

196
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:22,608
 Shiratori is a dead end.

197
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,367
 Sir, what's wrong with Jun?

198
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 He has a fever and is sleeping.

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It seems that he was shocked when he saw Kachidoki Bridge.

200
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,569
 Let's go back.

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 What?

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 The weather?

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 I moved to Hokkaido because of the good air.

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I was able to get along with everyone.

205
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:49,545
 Even if we go far away, we are friends.

206
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,419
 Right?

207
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:51,444
 Yes.

208
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,530
 That's right.

209
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,959
 However, the only regret is that I couldn't see the opening of Kachidoki Bridge.

210
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:02,584
 I wanted to see it with everyone.

211
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:05,609
 Jun, when are you going to Hokkaido?

212
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,179
 Tomorrow.

213
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:09,031
 That early?

214
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Is that so?

215
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 It's a pity that Jun moved.

216
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I can't eat such a delicious cake for the rest of my life.

217
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,297
 I'll go back to zero again.

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,204
 Jun was disappointed with Kachidoki Bridge.

219
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:41,522
 I wanted to show you the opening.

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 That's right.

221
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:46,449
 I'll show you the opening of the bridge.

222
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,474
 What?

223
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:49,499
 That's why it's impossible.

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 We'll open it.

225
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 We'll open the bridge and show it to Jun.

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 What?

227
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Kan-cha

228
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,294
 What's wrong?

229
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:25,319
 Come here.

230
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:27,000
 I'll show you the opening of Kachidoki Bridge.

231
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:28,025
 What?

232
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:29,616
 The opening of Kachidoki Bridge?

233
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:30,482
 Yes.

234
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:31,507
 Hurry up.

235
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:32,560
 Wait.

236
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:34,585
 I'll change my clothes now.

237
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 This way.

238
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:44,412
 Jun, I'll be right back.

239
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:45,437
 Yes.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 This is the best view.

241
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Jun, wait here.

242
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Are you really going to open it?

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Don't worry.

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,240
 Leave it to us.

245
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:06,624
 Let's go.

246
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:21,398
 There are four towers on Kachidoki Bridge.

247
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:26,921
 The only one with stairs is that tower.

248
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:29,360
 That must be the driver's room.

249
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,138
 I'll open the bridge.

250
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,975
 You two stop the car.

251
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Got it.

252
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,507
 Just as I thought.

253
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,648
 It's here.

254
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:47,023
 The key is locked.

255
00:14:47,757 --> 00:14:49,757
 But it's useless.

256
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 I'm good at opening.

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Stop.

258
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Stop.

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Kachidoki Bridge.

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 It's useless.

261
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I can't stop.

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 I can't stop either.

263
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:08,211
 It's open.

264
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:10,101
 It's open.

265
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 There are so many switches.

266
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I have to sell the electricity.

267
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,546
 How can I move it?

268
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:29,000
 Stop.

269
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Please.

270
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Stop.

271
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 The bridge is open.

272
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:37,219
 Stop.

273
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:39,724
 I did it.

274
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:40,749
 It stopped.

275
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:47,490
 What are you doing?

276
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:48,515
 What are you doing?

277
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,280
 What are you going to do by stopping the car?

278
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:54,328
 Look.

279
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Takishi.

280
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 We found Omawari.

281
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Wait.

282
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:16,317
 Takishi

283
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,342
 Close the door.

284
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,647
 Hey.

285
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
 Open it.

286
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,871
 What are you going to do?

287
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:25,749
 It's useless.

288
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:27,334
 The car won't stop.

289
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,037
 The plan is too reckless.

290
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,062
 Let's stop.

291
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:31,351
 Idiot.

292
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
 Jun is waiting.

293
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:34,638
 Really?

294
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:36,663
 Is it really going to open?

295
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 But how can we open it?

296
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Let's give up.

297
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Open it.

298
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Hurry up.

299
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 What are you going to do, Kankichi?

300
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I'll open the bridge.

301
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I have no chance now.

302
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:55,767
 Okay.

303
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,488
 I'm done.

304
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,075
 Don't turn on the power.

305
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
 Don't touch it.

306
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:10,131
 Turn on the power.

307
00:17:10,156 --> 00:17:11,156
 Okay.

308
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:12,181
 Turn on all the lights.

309
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:13,206
 Okay.

310
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:15,987
 Stop the car right now.

311
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:22,870
 Oh, the bridge light is on.

312
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:24,356
 That's ridiculous.

313
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:26,448
 That bridge should be closed.

314
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:29,792
 Move.

315
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:30,878
 The bridge is going up.

316
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:32,300
 Move! The bridge is going up!

317
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:42,237
 Please move! I'll win!

318
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:43,975
 Stop it!

319
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:48,429
 Don't come here! Open the door!

320
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:49,857
 I'll win!

321
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,882
 Open it!

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 The bridge...

323
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,030
 Open it! Open it!

324
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:40,077
 Open it more and more!

325
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,264
 The bridge...

326
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:48,429
 It was real after all.

327
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:01,578
 It's a battle car!

328
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 What's going on?

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,260
 Idiot! Hurry up and get the bridge back!

330
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,205
 Open it! Open it!

331
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:32,975
 The bridge...

332
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 We did it! We won!

333
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 We did it!

334
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 The winning bridge opened up!

335
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 It's like they're saying good-bye!

336
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 The bridge opened up again!

337
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 The winning bridge has to be A!

338
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 That's the face of Sumida!

339
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It's really amazing!

340
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:55,179
 It's more than I imagined, Kan-chan.

341
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 We did it!

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Did you see that, Jen?

343
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Open it! Open it!

344
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:19,000
 Get ready! I'll deal with you all!

345
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 No! We can't run away like this!

346
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 What should we do?

347
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,359
 Come on!

348
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 What are you going to do?

349
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Hey! Don't let the bridge open up and run away!

350
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,447
 What a bunch of people!

351
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:48,625
 Help me! Help me!

352
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,656
 Run away!

353
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,684
 Then they swam to Hamari-kyu.

354
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:11,709
 They ran away and came back again.

355
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:16,280
 They were watching the big fight at Kachidoki Bridge.

356
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:19,154
 It's been exciting for a long time.

357
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:20,975
He must be happy, Jun-kun.

358
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Jun-kun!

359
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Of course!

360
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I can't forget that excited smile.

361
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 But maybe that Jun-kun abandoned his car and climbed up to Kachidoki Bridge.

362
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 That's not true.

363
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 He was weak, but his heart was strong.

364
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 I'm sorry.

365
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:44,398
 The car in front of me...

366
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:45,851
 Jun!

367
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Kan-chan?

368
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Why are you here?

369
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 You look like a police officer.

370
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Kan-chan is your uncle?

371
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Don't laugh!

372
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 You're a law enforcement officer.

373
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 No, I was just thinking that the repairman would take me there.

374
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Oh, right.

375
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 This is...

376
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 A university professor?

377
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 You're a good student, Jun.

378
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 It's all thanks to Kan-chan.

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 I can't forget the day he raised the bridge with all his might.

380
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Now he's setting up the bridge.

381
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 So, what made you climb up to Kachidoki Bridge?

382
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 There was something I really wanted to investigate.

383
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Kachidoki Bridge is amazing!

384
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Oh, chief!

385
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 That's my friend, Professor Kougakuha.

386
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I think everyone heard about him.

387
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 What? Did you hear about him?

388
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Chief, you're acting strange.

389
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Yeah.

390
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 When the bridge was raised,

391
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 there was a police officer with him.

392
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 That's right!

393
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 I just remembered that he was struggling with his legs

394
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 and tried his best.

395
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 But in the end, he fell into the river.

396
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Do you remember the face of that police officer?

397
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Of course!

398
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 His eyes were so big,

399
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 and his eyebrows were so thick,

400
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 and his nose was so long,

401
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 and his mouth looked like a hippo.

402
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 I can't forget it!

403
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Ryo-chan!

404
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 The chief's face...

405
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 What's wrong with the chief's face?

406
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 A hippo's mouth, long nose, thin eyes, thick...

407
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 No way...

408
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:37,405
 I'm that police officer!

409
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:49,976
 I finally met the culprit of that conflict.

410
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:53,281
 Please calm down, chief!

411
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:57,226
 Hey, wait, Ryo-chan!

412
00:23:57,251 --> 00:23:58,251
It was just an accident.
