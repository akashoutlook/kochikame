1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Kachidoki Bridge, open!

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 That was a wonderful wedding ceremony.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Yeah.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Cheers!

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Hey, you came to Ginza after all.

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Look at the Kachidoki Bridge and go home.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 But the direction is the opposite.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 What are you complaining about?

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Oh, I understand!

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Well...

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Ryo-chan...

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Ryo-chan, it's the Kachidoki Bridge.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Ryo-chan, we're here.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Get up.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Come on, tell him to go by himself.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Kei-chan, stop!

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 What?

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 What is it?

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 There's a man on the bridge.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 What?

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 He's not a ghost, is he?

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Where are you, Reiko-san?

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I'm sure he's on top of this steel frame.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Are you sure?

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 No, I'm sure I saw him.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 He looked like he was about to jump off.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 That was a wonderful wedding ceremony.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Yeah.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 In the morning, there was a teacup standing in the morning.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I feel really good.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Yes, is that so?

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Thank you for your help.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 It seems that there were no accidents or incidents near the Kachidoki Bridge.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Kachidoki Bridge?

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But why was there a man there?

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Good morning.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Senpai, good luck.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 The chief is in a good mood this morning.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Lucky.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Good morning.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I drank too much.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Idiot!

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 What do you think you're doing?

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Please don't yell at me.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 My head is pounding.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Come here.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 I'll squeeze you a lot.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I'm not a stray cat.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Hey, where are you in a good mood?

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Let's get out of here.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 What's wrong?

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 You were in such a good mood.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Idiot!

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Kachidoki Bridge

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 It's illegal parking.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Good morning.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Oh, it's Sapporo No.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Yes.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 It was illegal parking near Kachidoki Bridge since last night.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Kachidoki Bridge? Since last night?

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Yes.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 The neighbor saw a tall man in a white dress get off.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 White dress?

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Could it be from last night?

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Hello.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Please introduce the owner of the car.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 The number is Sapporo.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 It doesn't seem to be illegal parking.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Is it an accident?

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 No.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 It's not decided by the car of the man last night.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Yes.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Toyohirakku, Sapporo City.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Yes.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Shiratori.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 A pure white chicken and a pure white chicken.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 It's Shiratori Jun.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Thank you very much.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Did something happen to Shiratori Jun?

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Yes.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Ouch.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Do you know him, Byo-chan?

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 He's a friend from my junior high school days.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Well, it was only a short time ago.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 He left his car near Kachidoki Bridge and disappeared somewhere.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Kachidoki Bridge?

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Oh, that's right.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 He came to see the bridge.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 The bridge?

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 What do you mean, senpai?

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Well, that was when I was a cute junior high school student.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Yo, Tsukankichi.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Yes.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Wow.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Big spin ball.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 My hands are spinning.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Kankichi, who told you to spin in the air?

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It's a service.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Kankichi, you're amazing.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 You're the best.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Jun, did you have fun?

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Next time, I'll show you something more flashy.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Kankichi.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Yes.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Hey, Jun.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 You went to Banpak, didn't you?

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 That's great.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 But I couldn't see it very well because it was crowded.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 I heard you went on the Shinkansen.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Have you ever ridden a Tonkichi?

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Have you ever ridden a Tonkichi?

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I've only ridden the Toobu Line.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Would you like some tea?

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Thank you.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Please enjoy your meal.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Oh, it's a cake again.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I'm sorry all the time, auntie.

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 It's okay.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 From now on, get along with Jun.

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Yes.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Well, take your time.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 When I go to the gym, I don't get bored at all when I look at Kanchan and the others.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Kankichi is the only one who is energetic.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Next time, I'll show you a bomb.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 In return, show me again when you're testing.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 I have 2.5 vision.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 I can't do canning.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Anyway, it's a great book.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Did everyone read this book?

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Roughly.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 I'll lend it to you anytime.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 We're not good at this kind of hot books.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Right, Tonkichi?

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Yes.

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Just the textbook is enough.

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 That's right.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 I think this is interesting.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Japan's...

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 It's called Japan's Kado Bridge.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I like this kind of thing.

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Isn't it Kachidoki Bridge?

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 It's true.

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Yes, it's Kachidoki Bridge.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Do you know it?

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I don't know much about bridges.

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Shirahige, Kototoi, Azuma, Komagata, Umae, Kuramae, Ryogoku, Kiyosu, Eitae, Tsukuda, Kachidoki.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 That's it.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 It's a bridge on the Sumida River.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Wow.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I was reminded of it when I was in elementary school.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 My favorite is Kachidoki Bridge.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 It moves like this.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I want to see it once.

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 You haven't seen it?

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I want to see it, but it's far away.

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 It's close.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 It's just over the bank.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 The car stops and the bridge opens slowly.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 When you look at the bridge, the road is like a wall.

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It's very powerful.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 It's amazing.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I want to see it with my own eyes.

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Let's go to Kachidoki Bridge.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 It's about 20 minutes by bicycle.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Okay.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Let's go.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 This is the way of justice.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 We're almost there.

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Look.

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 That bridge opens.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 It's perfect from here.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I always buy bread and look at it while eating.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 The boat is coming.

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I did it.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 It opens.

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 It opens.

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 It doesn't open.

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 It's strange.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 It should open at noon.

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 What's wrong?

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 It doesn't open anymore?

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It opened yesterday.

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 It doesn't open anymore.

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 It's time to transport land.

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 It's easier to transport water.

189
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I didn't know that.

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Kachidoki Bridge doesn't open anymore?

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Once you decide, it won't open again.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 It's always us who make people cry.

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Kachidoki Bridge

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 I'm so disappointed that I came to see it.

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 I was looking forward to seeing it.

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Don't be careless, Jun.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Kondo.

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Yes.

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Shibayama.

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Yes.

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Shiratori.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Shiratori is a dead end.

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Sir, what's wrong with Jun?

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 He has a fever and is sleeping.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It seems that he was shocked when he saw Kachidoki Bridge.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Let's go back.

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 What?

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 The weather?

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 I moved to Hokkaido because of the good air.

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I was able to get along with everyone.

211
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Even if we go far away, we are friends.

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Right?

213
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Yes.

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 That's right.

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 However, the only regret is that I couldn't see the opening of Kachidoki Bridge.

216
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 I wanted to see it with everyone.

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Jun, when are you going to Hokkaido?

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Tomorrow.

219
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 That early?

220
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Is that so?

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 It's a pity that Jun moved.

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I can't eat such a delicious cake for the rest of my life.

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 I'll go back to zero again.

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Jun was disappointed with Kachidoki Bridge.

225
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 I wanted to show you the opening.

226
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 That's right.

227
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 I'll show you the opening of the bridge.

228
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 What?

229
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 That's why it's impossible.

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 We'll open it.

231
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 We'll open the bridge and show it to Jun.

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 What?

233
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Kachidoki Bridge

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Kahn.

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 What's wrong?

236
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Come here.

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I'll show you the opening of Kachidoki Bridge.

238
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 What?

239
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 The opening of Kachidoki Bridge?

240
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Yes.

241
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Hurry up.

242
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Wait.

243
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 I'll change my clothes now.

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 This way.

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Yes.

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Yes.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Jun, I'll be right back.

248
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Yes.

249
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 This is the best view.

250
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Jun, wait here.

251
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Are you really going to open it?

252
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Don't worry.

253
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Leave it to us.

254
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Let's go.

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 There are four towers on Kachidoki Bridge.

256
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 The only one with stairs is that tower.

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 That must be the driver's room.

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I'll open the bridge.

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 You two stop the car.

260
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Got it.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Just as I thought.

262
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 It's here.

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 The key is locked.

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 But it's useless.

265
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 I'm good at opening.

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Stop.

267
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Stop.

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Kachidoki Bridge.

269
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 It's useless.

270
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I can't stop.

271
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 I can't stop either.

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 It's open.

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 It's open.

274
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 There are so many switches.

275
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I have to sell the electricity.

276
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 How can I move it?

277
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Stop.

278
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Please.

279
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Stop.

280
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 The bridge is open.

281
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Stop.

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I did it.

283
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I stopped.

284
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 What are you doing?

285
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 What are you doing?

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 What are you going to do by stopping the car?

287
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Look.

288
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Takishi.

289
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 We found Omawari.

290
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Wait.

291
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Takishi.

292
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Close the door.

293
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Hey.

294
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Open it.

295
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 What are you going to do?

296
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 It's useless.

297
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 The car won't stop.

298
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 We'll be found by Omawari.

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 The plan is too reckless.

300
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Let's stop.

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Idiot.

302
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Jun is waiting.

303
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Really?

304
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 It's useless.

305
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 It's useless.

306
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 It's useless.

307
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It's useless.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 It's useless.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 It's useless.

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 It's useless.

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Is it really going to open?

312
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 But how can we open it?

313
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Let's give up.

314
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Open it.

315
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Hurry up.

316
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 What are you going to do, Takishi?

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I'll open the bridge.

318
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I have no chance now.

319
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Okay.

320
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 I'm done.

321
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Turn on the power.

322
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Don't touch it.

323
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Turn on the power.

324
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Okay.

325
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Turn on all the lights.

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Okay.

327
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Stop the car right now.

328
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Okay.

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Stop.

330
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Open it.

331
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Oh, the bridge is on fire.

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 That's ridiculous.

333
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 That bridge should be closed.

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Move.

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 The bridge is going up.

336
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Move! The bridge is going up!

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Please move! I'll win!

338
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Stop it!

339
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Don't come here! Open the door!

340
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I'll win!

341
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Open it!

342
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Open the door!

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 The bridge...

344
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Open it! Open it!

345
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Open it more and more!

346
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 The bridge...

347
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 It was real after all.

348
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 It's a battle car!

349
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 What's going on?

350
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Idiot! Hurry up and get the bridge back!

351
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Open it! Open it!

352
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 The bridge...

353
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 We did it! We won!

354
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 We did it!

355
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 The winning bridge opened up!

356
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 It's like they're saying good-bye!

357
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 The bridge opened up again!

358
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 The winning bridge has to be A!

359
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 That's the face of Sumida!

360
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It's really amazing!

361
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 It's more than I imagined, Kan-chan.

362
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 We did it!

363
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Did you see that, Gen?

364
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Open it! Open it!

365
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Get ready! I'll deal with you all!

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 No! We can't run away like this!

367
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 What should we do?

368
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Come on!

369
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 What are you going to do?

370
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Hey! Don't let the bridge open up and run away!

371
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 What a bunch of people!

372
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Help me! Help me!

373
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Run away!

374
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Hey, Kan-chan!

375
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Then they swam to Hamari-kyu.

376
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 They ran away and came back again.

377
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 They were watching the big fight at Kachidoki Bridge.

378
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 It's been exciting for a long time.

379
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 You must be happy, Jun-kun.

380
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Of course!

381
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Jun-kun!

382
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Of course!

383
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I can't forget that excited smile.

384
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 But maybe that Jun-kun abandoned his car and climbed up to Kachidoki Bridge.

385
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 That's not true.

386
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 He was strong, but his heart was strong.

387
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 I'm sorry.

388
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 The car in front of me...

389
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Jun!

390
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Kan-chan?

391
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Why are you here?

392
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 You look like a police officer.

393
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Kan-chan is your uncle?

394
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Don't laugh!

395
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 You're a law enforcement officer.

396
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 No, I was just thinking that the repairman would take me there.

397
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Oh, right.

398
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 This is...

399
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 A university professor?

400
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 You're a good student, Jun.

401
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 It's all thanks to Kan-chan.

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 I can't forget the day he raised the bridge with all his might.

403
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Now he's setting up the bridge.

404
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 So, what made you climb up to Kachidoki Bridge?

405
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 There was something I really wanted to investigate.

406
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Kachidoki Bridge is amazing!

407
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Oh, chief!

408
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 That's my friend, Professor Kougakuha.

409
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I think everyone heard about him.

410
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 What? Did you hear about him?

411
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Chief, you're acting strange.

412
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Yeah.

413
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 When the bridge was raised,

414
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 there was a police officer with him.

415
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 That's right!

416
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 I just remembered that he was struggling with his legs

417
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 and tried his best.

418
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 But in the end, he fell into the river.

419
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Do you remember the face of that police officer?

420
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Of course!

421
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 His eyes were so big,

422
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 and his eyebrows were so thick,

423
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 and his nose was so long,

424
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 and his mouth looked like a hippo.

425
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 I can't forget it!

426
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Ryo-chan!

427
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 The chief's face...

428
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 What's wrong with the chief's face?

429
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 A hippo's mouth, long nose, thin eyes, thick...

430
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 No way...

431
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I'm that police officer!

432
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 I finally met the culprit of that conflict.

433
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Please calm down, chief!

434
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Hey, wait, Ryo-chan!

435
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 It's already an accident!

436
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Hey, wait, Ryo-chan!

437
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 It's already an accident!

438
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Hey, wait, Ryo-chan!

439
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 It's already an accident!

440
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 I did it!

441
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I got the full seat of Ozmo!

442
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 The four of us will sit in the full seat,

443
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 so I'll invite Reiko and take Nakagawa with me.

444
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Who else should I invite?

445
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Hey, chief!

446
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 I'm just kidding!

447
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 I'll invite the chief, too!

448
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Next time on Tokoton Ozmo!
