1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Ryotsu! Mecha-Pote Sengen!

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 It's going to be cold today.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Nothing's going to happen tonight.

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Let's stop patrolling and go home.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Chief!

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Isn't this the girls' dormitory of the Katsushika school?

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 How dare you!

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Nakago, turn around.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Yes, sir.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Hey!

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Where are you? Where are you?

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Where are you?

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 You, underwear thief!

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Ouch, ouch, ouch!

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I'm a police officer! Hey!

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 It's me!

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I'm Ryotsu Kankichi, the first officer of the park!

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Oh, you're right.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I'm Ryotsu Kankichi!

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I'm Ryotsu Kankichi, the first officer of the park!

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 If you're Ryotsu Kankichi, then you're the underwear thief!

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 I'm not the next one!

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Ryotsu!

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I'm going to arrest you!

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 I'm going to arrest you for being the underwear thief!

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Don't make fun of me!

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I'm not an underwear thief!

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Then what's that thing you're holding in your hand?

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Huh?

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 That's proof that you can't move!

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 N-No!

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 I just grabbed it when I fell!

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I came in here because I heard a scream!

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Do you think that excuse makes sense?

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 It's true!

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 There's another one here!

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 No, there isn't!

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 There's another one here!

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Mr. Nakagawa!

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Ryutsu!

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 It's a misunderstanding.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 We heard a scream that we were the underwear thief and came in here.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 It's no use. I said that too.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Oh, is that so?

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 No!

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 If you say that, I'll misunderstand you.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I'm sorry.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Speaking of which, we were doing a special training for the underwear thief.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I heard a scream.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Hey, you guys!

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 You're saying the same thing, but you don't believe what I'm saying.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Don't you doubt what Nakagawa is saying?

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Oh, that's natural.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Of course.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 What kind of people do you judge people based on?

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Of course, it's the face!

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 You can't trust what a man with such a hot face with eyebrows says.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 That's right. On top of that, he's short.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 He's tall.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He's hot.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 He's short, but he's tall.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 On top of that, he has smelly feet.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 You guys!

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Stop it!

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Let go of me!

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Let go of me!

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 That sound...

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Stop it, you idiot! Stop it!

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Mr. Ryo...

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 No, it was a misunderstanding.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Mr. Nakagawa, you tried to steal the underwear, didn't you?

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I said no!

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Stop it!

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I'm innocent!

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 That was a disaster, Ryo-tsu.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 But it's your fault for having such a bad dream.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 You should reflect on yourself.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Reflecting is a joke.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Women these days think men are nothing.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I don't understand what you're saying.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 It's true that women these days are beyond my understanding.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Even before this...

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 You're so mean!

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Right?

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 That's why you look so pitiful.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Please go out with me.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 No, what are you talking about?

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Even though you don't have a boyfriend?

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Hey, old man!

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 What are you looking at?

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 No, I'm not looking at anything.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 You bastard!

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 I'm done with him.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 He's clearly an alien.

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 I've decided!

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 What are you doing, senpai?

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 I'm done with her.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I'm not going to see her again.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 I'm not going to see her again.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I'm not going to see her again.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Really?

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Then you're not going to work?

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 No.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Excuse me.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Which way is the station?

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 No, no!

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 What?

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Don't come in from that line!

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 What did you say?

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 What?

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 You're the security guard, aren't you?

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Yes, it's the station.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 The station is...

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 You...

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 You...

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 You idiot!

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 No matter what anyone says,

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I'm never going to see a woman again!

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 What a shame!

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 I could have arrested Ryo-tsu a little earlier.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 You're right.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Huh?

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 In front of Ryo?

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Hey!

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Why is there a maruto in the garden?

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Hey!

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Hey!

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Naoko!

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 You're in trouble!

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Hey!

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 What's with this maruto?

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 You're Naoko Seisho, aren't you?

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Congratulations on winning the lottery.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Yes.

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I see!

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Look!

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 That's the winner!

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 That magazine's verification!

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I applied for it with a light heart,

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 but I didn't think I'd really win.

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 But Ryo's garden is spacious,

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 so it's fine, right?

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 That's right.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Look at Ryo's best!

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 It's wonderful!

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Well then,

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 the investigation has been completed,

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 so this is the summary video of the log-out assembly.

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Well then, please do your best to assemble it!

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 What?

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 We're going to make it?

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 What should we do?

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 We can't assemble something like this.

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Don't you know anyone who's good at this?

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 There he is!

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 But...

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 He's definitely not going to do it.

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 That's right!

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 There's a good way!

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Wait a minute!

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Gather everyone tomorrow.

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Wait a minute!

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 This is bad, Ryo-san!

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Look at this!

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 This month's log-out survey!

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 You don't know that!

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 He's always doing boring projects every month.

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 That's clearly Sekwafara.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 He's making a fool of men.

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 What?

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Ryo's number one again?

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 That means V7 has finally been completed.

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 What's wrong?

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 This is...

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 The number one that Katsushika Shofukei asked for,

179
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 doesn't have Senpai's name on it!

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 What?

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 By the way,

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Ryo-san is number one in the log-out survey.

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 This is...

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 The number one in the log-out survey, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 The number one I want to make my girlfriend, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 The number one I want to marry, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

187
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 He's always in the top three with Nakagawa.

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Isn't that some kind of misprint?

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I don't think so.

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 It doesn't matter if it's 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 That means...

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 You!

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 You've been acting like a coward again.

194
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Why would I do that?

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Chief,

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I don't think Senpai would do something that doesn't make money.

197
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Hmm?

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 That's true.

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 But you're number one all of a sudden from the beginning.

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 That's strange.

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 It's not strange!

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 The modern women have finally realized.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 The true manliness.

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 They're starting to choose the number one.

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Ryo-tsu Senpai.

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 The number one in the log-out survey.

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Congratulations!

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Congratulations Ichi!

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Congratulations Ryo-tsu!

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 We've been misunderstanding Ryo-tsu Senpai.

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 That's right.

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 We've finally realized the charm of Ryo-tsu Senpai.

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 He's popular.

214
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 I can't believe it.

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Hmph.

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 I'm going to lose.

217
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Didn't you choose Senno as your girlfriend?

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Huh?

219
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 You're so insolent.

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Don't cross that line!

221
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Huh?

222
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I've decided not to go out with a woman.

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Don't say that.

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Shut up!

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Get out!

226
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Senpai!

227
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Get out of here!

228
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 What's with that attitude?

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Calm down.

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 The first step is complete.

231
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 The first step is complete.

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 That idiot shouldn't have come to feed us.

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 How is it?

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 It's pretty good, isn't it?

235
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Here it comes.

236
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Next is Rai-Rai-Gen.

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Is he trying to disguise himself with that?

238
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 It's Rai-Rai-Gen.

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 I thought it was ramen.

240
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Ryo-tsu Senpai's charm is his manliness, isn't it?

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 That's right.

242
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 He's not like the other men.

243
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 He's more like a master.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 His eyebrows are sharp.

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 That's right.

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 A good man is more delicate than his appearance.

247
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 But it's sad.

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 He can't accept our passion.

249
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 We don't like men.

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 That's right.

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Ryo-sama!

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 But he's not popular.

253
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 We don't like men.

254
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Women's hearts are complicated.

255
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Hey, you two!

256
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Ryo-tsu Senpai!

257
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Senpai!

258
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Senpai!

259
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 You didn't accept our bouquet.

260
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Naoko was very sad.

261
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I'm sorry about that.

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Coffee?

263
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 That's nice.

264
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 On a cold day like this.

265
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Give me a bite.

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 What?

267
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Me?

268
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Naoko!

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Here you go.

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Thank you.

271
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 It's good.

272
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Here, have some.

273
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 What?

274
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Don't hold back.

275
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 But...

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 I'm happy, Ryo-tsu Senpai.

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Why did I do that?

278
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Good job, Naoko.

279
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Good job.

280
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 I won't let your precious sacrifice go to waste.

281
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 I'll do that for you.

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Hey, Ryo-tsu Senpai!

283
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Are you free tonight?

284
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 How is it?

285
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Do you want to go out for a drink?

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I thought it was someone else, but it's you.

287
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 What's with that outfit?

288
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I have an appointment tonight.

289
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Sorry, but I don't have time to go out with you.

290
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Appointment?

291
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Ryo-san, I heard you're being invited to the girls' dorm tonight.

292
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 To the girls' dorm?

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 You must be jealous.

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 I can't take you there.

295
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I'm the only one who's being invited.

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Women these days know the budget of men very well.

297
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 It's totally different from what I usually say.

298
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Girls' dorm!

299
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Good evening!

300
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 I'm sure you know this place.

301
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 This place is actually for men.

302
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Only Ryo-tsu Senpai is here.

303
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 It's special.

304
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I'm impressed.

305
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 This is great.

306
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Naoko.

307
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Ryo-tsu Senpai, the moon is so beautiful.

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Let's go see it.

309
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 It was cloudy earlier.

310
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 It's okay.

311
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Okay, now.

312
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Roger.

313
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Roger.

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Oh!

315
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Isn't this an illusion?

316
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 What's that?

317
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 That's a log house kit.

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 All the log materials are here.

319
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Just put them together.

320
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 The gas and the water are one-touch.

321
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 If we put it in the garden, it'll be a good place for everyone.

322
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 But there's no log builder.

323
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 We can't build that.

324
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Isn't there a strong and talented man?

325
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 No, no.

326
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Men these days are all satisfied.

327
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 A man who works with sweat on his forehead is wonderful.

328
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 That's right.

329
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 The recent trend is a man who smells like sweat.

330
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 I don't know if it's a trend or something,

331
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 but don't you guys forget someone?

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 What?

333
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 A man who is strong, talented, and reliable.

334
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Eh?

335
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Who?

336
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Eh?

337
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Are you talking about Ryo-tsu Senpai?

338
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 No.

339
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I can't ask Ryo-tsu Senpai to do that.

340
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Why not?

341
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Because Ryo-tsu Senpai has already decided on a suit.

342
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Right?

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 This is my true form.

344
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 This is my true form.

345
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Wonderful!

346
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And this is my army.

347
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Even though it's an emergency...

348
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 It's forced.

349
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Shut up!

350
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Don't talk nonsense!

351
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 First of all, the basic construction.

352
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 You guys know that, don't you?

353
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Attack!

354
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Hey!

355
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Don't do it like that!

356
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Hey, what's with that face?

357
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Men aren't that simple.

358
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Hey, Sasato and Hagomi!

359
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Eiji, let those two do what they want.

360
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Everyone!

361
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 It's lunch time!

362
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 This is our homemade lunch.

363
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 The cookies are homemade too.

364
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Wow, amazing.

365
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 It looks delicious.

366
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Terai-san and Honda-san, thank you.

367
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Please do your best.

368
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 I'm counting on you.

369
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Honda-san is more talented than he looks.

370
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Is that so?

371
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Terai-san's thick arms seem to have power.

372
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 No, it's almost all of it.

373
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 You guys go home!

374
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Eh?

375
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Oh no.

376
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Oh, but we came all the way here.

377
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 It would be better if everyone cooperated.

378
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 This is enough for me alone.

379
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Come on, let's go home.

380
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 It's not done yet.

381
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 It's not done yet.

382
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 It's not done yet.

383
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 It was a bit of a strategy.

384
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 It was impossible to do it alone.

385
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 I can't ask them to do it now.

386
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 After all, the pace is slow.

387
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 If this is the case, you have to praise it,

388
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 praise it, put it on, and make it work.

389
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Okay.

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Ryoko-san, do your best.

391
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Huh?

392
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 The way you work is wonderful.

393
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 It's cool.

394
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Is that so?

395
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 I'm surprised.

396
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 It's very powerful.

397
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 What is this?

398
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 It's wonderful.

399
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 It's manly.

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Is that so?

401
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Kyosuke-san!

402
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It's like a trip.

403
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 It's easy to handle.

404
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 At this rate, let's continue to switch for 24 hours.

405
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Kyosuke-san!

406
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 It's manly.

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Kyosuke-san!

408
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Ryotsu-senpai, you're the best!

409
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Ryotsu-san, do your best!

410
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 It seems that only 1000 yen is not enough.

411
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 We need to use one can full.

412
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Ryotsu-san, are you okay?

413
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I'm a little tired.

414
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 I'll give you a massage.

415
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Do your best.

416
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Make our log house as soon as possible.

417
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Of course, Tomoe.

418
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Revival!

419
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 We did it!

420
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Let's do it!

421
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Here's your lunch.

422
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 See you.

423
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 See you.

424
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Are you leaving already?

425
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 I'm on a business trip.

426
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Another convenience store lunch?

427
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 It used to be a handmade lunch box.

428
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 The completion rate of the house and the grade of the lunch box are decreasing.

429
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 This again?

430
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 The days of bread and butter continue.

431
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Recently, no one has come to 1000 yen.

432
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 It seems that they are forced to work.

433
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 If this continues, I'll break my body.

434
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 I feel like my seniors are being manipulated by their girlfriends.

435
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Nakagawa-kun, I know how you feel about being taken away by me.

436
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 I'm jealous, but I don't want you to have a strange feeling.

437
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 I don't think I'm too jealous.

438
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I don't think so.

439
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 But I'm really tired.

440
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Senpai! Ryo-tsu-senpai!

441
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Ryo-tsu-senpai! Senpai!

442
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It seems that Ryo-tsu hasn't come yet.

443
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 It's a mess.

444
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 It's a little more, but it's useless.

445
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 When will it be completed?

446
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 I'm tired of making fun of it.

447
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 I did my best to get first place in the survey.

448
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Just a little more.

449
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I'm sorry.

450
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 I didn't mean to be mean.

451
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 What's wrong? Did you say something?

452
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 It's nothing. It's nothing.

453
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Don't worry about it.

454
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 I'll do my best.

455
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 I'm glad I didn't hear it.

456
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I'm glad I was really stupid.

457
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I can hear you.

458
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Look at this.

459
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Amazing!

460
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 It's finally completed.

461
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Our villa.

462
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Amazing!

463
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 It smells good.

464
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 It's a curtain window.

465
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 The bath is bigger than I thought.

466
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Let's stay here tonight.

467
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Yes!

468
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I'll teach you how to get angry at me.

469
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Let's go.

470
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It smells good.

471
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I feel like I'm in a hot spring in the mountains.

472
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 But he's good at making such a great log house.

473
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 I agree.

474
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 He did his best.

475
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 I've seen it again.

476
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Komachi.

477
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 What?

478
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 You fell in love with Ryotsukan.

479
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 I'm not kidding.

480
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 It's red.

481
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 It's not.

482
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Everyone.

483
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Be quiet.

484
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 The special seat is 5,000 yen.

485
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 The camera is 5,000 yen.

486
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Let's go.

487
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Let's go.

488
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Let's go.

489
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Did you see that?

490
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 This is the real job of a man.

491
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 What are you doing?

492
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 You bastard.

493
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 It's too hot.

494
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 The mini bath is too hot.

495
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 I can't stand it.

496
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 I can't stand it.

497
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 I'm not done yet.

498
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Don't bully a weak woman.

499
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I can't stand it.

500
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Where are you weak?

501
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Wait.

502
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 He's going to be number one again.

503
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 To be continued.

504
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

505
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

506
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 The sun is calling outside the door.
