1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Fresh Spring Patrol Karuta!

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's strange, isn't it?

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No, it's weird.

4
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Alright, it's done.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you for your hard work on the New Year's work.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We'll take over the rest.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thank you for your hard work.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I heard that you've been working since New Year's Eve.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Of course.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Unlike Nakagawa and Reiko, I put my life on my work.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
During the New Year, I was on a hot mission to protect the safety of the people.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's wrong with you?

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Riy-san, stop joking around.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What?

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I know.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Last year, we had a summer vacation.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So, we had a meeting on New Year's Eve.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You knew that, didn't you?

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Alright, let's go home.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ryo-san, what are you going to do from now on?

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm just going to sleep.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We don't have a New Year's party at the chief's house this year.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's strange.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I met Terai at Hatsumode yesterday.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He told me that he was going to the chief's house to celebrate New Year's Eve.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's a mistake.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The chief told me that he was going on a family trip with his family.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
A New Year's party?

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes, it's a New Year's party at the chief's house.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
When are you going to do it next year?

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Next year, I'll cancel it.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,351
I was looking forward to New Year's Eve when I ate at the chief's house.

33
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,812
Ryo-chan, you're exaggerating.

34
00:03:21,297 --> 00:03:23,703
Don't be so disappointed.

35
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:27,000
It's been a long time since the three of us went on a trip to the hot spring.

36
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:31,156
Are you taking care of your family more than your subordinates?

37
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:32,461
Don't say that.

38
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:34,000
Hiromi is also old.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can't go on a trip without seeing my parents.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well, that's what it is.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,583
Everyone, the New Year's party is next year.

42
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,599
Really? That's too bad.

44
00:03:49,224 --> 00:03:53,000
Now that I think about it, I feel like everyone was out of their minds.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Maybe I wasn't the only one who wasn't invited.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,310
All right.

47
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:05,000
Are you Mr. Terai's otaku?

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,458
I'm Ryotsu.

49
00:04:06,483 --> 00:04:08,000
Congratulations.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
By the way, I have something to do at Terai.

51
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:16,516
What?

52
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,000
You did it for me.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That actor director.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You made me an outcast.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Damn it.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Then I'll eat anything.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll eat your food.

58
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:36,789
I won't forgive you.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ryo-san, he didn't have a chainsaw just now.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is a blood test.

61
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:48,404
Happy New Year.

62
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:49,326
Thank you for coming.

63
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:52,000
I look forward to working with you again this year.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hiromi-chan, you're cute.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Reiko-san looks good on you, too.

66
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:58,055
Thank you.

67
00:04:58,569 --> 00:04:59,400
Huh?

68
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,594
Senpai haven't come yet?

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You know, dad.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hiromi.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't want to remember anything like that from the New Year.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Anyway, Nakagawa.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Did you park the car in front of the house?

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Come on.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's a small place, but come in.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Huh?

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Director.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why are you closing the window in the middle of the day?

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's a devil's curse.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Devil's curse?

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Senpai, please forgive me.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm going to Hatsumode with my sister from now on.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You can always go to Hatsumode.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But the director's New Year's party is only today.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's ridiculous.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't you regret it?

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're not invited to the New Year's party.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Of course.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm a white-collar and I'm not a department team.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't say that.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,782
I'm your best friend.

93
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:02,000
You can take me to the director's house.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You're a tough guy.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I got it.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's get on the bike.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's go!

98
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:44,382
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,156
What's wrong, Nakagawa?

100
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:52,000
Isn't that Honda's CBX engine?

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Maybe Senpai's here, too.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't believe it.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The devil's curse doesn't work.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Listen, no matter what happens,

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
don't say anything or come out on the street.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Damn it.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You've made up your mind.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I thought you went on a family trip.

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's not like that.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Look at that.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What's that?

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're using your dirty hands to cover it with a sheet.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's a Ferrari F50.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's different from the one I always ride,

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
but it's definitely a Nakagawa Ferrari.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Is that so?

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Maybe the neighbors' cars are cars, too.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Look around.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Where the hell do people live?

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Look at the license plate.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's a Shonan license plate.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Nakagawa lives in Tokyo,

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
but he's dressed up to make all the cars his Shonan license plate.

125
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:11,000
Ohara-san?

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's a delivery.

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Please send it to me.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Ohara-san, please come out.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Ryo-chan is so mischievous.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't know what to do.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Damn it.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Are you going to pass through the house?

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,300
The windows and curtains of the house are closed.

134
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm going on a long trip.

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The enemy is still inside.

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Look at this.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Isn't this just an electric meter?

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Look at the meter.

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If it's a house, it should only work with a refrigerator and a phone.

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The meter doesn't work like this.

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I see.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Everyone, would you like some sukiyaki?

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Sounds good.

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,687
I'm tired for the food.

145
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,288
I'll help you.

146
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:03,429
Chief!

147
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,000
I know you're inside.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,186
He's stubborn.

149
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:10,436
Put us inside as soon as possible.

150
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,000
Dad, I feel sorry for you.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,419
Please put us inside.

152
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:15,045
No.

153
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:20,000
You may not know, but every time I went on a trip, he made my house a mess.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If I do something to him, he will destroy my precious bonsai.

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If I do something to him, he will destroy my tatami.

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If I do something to him, he will paint ink on my face.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He made my room black.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I will never let him stay in my house again.

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't know how to make you a scarecrow.

160
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:44,000
You are completely surrounded.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Give up and come out.

162
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,000
Ignore him.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,364
He doesn't react at all.

164
00:09:50,552 --> 00:09:51,000
Damn it.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,927
If that's what you're going to do, I'll do it with the back of my hand.

166
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:57,000
Back of your hand?

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's quiet now.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It seems that he gave up.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
When it comes to food, he'll show you a terrible end.

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can't rest assured.

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Is it a power outage?

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There is no electricity in the New Year.

174
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:19,294
The gas in the kitchen suddenly stopped.

175
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:20,410
What?

176
00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:22,000
Damn it.

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's all Ryotsu's doing.

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Senpai.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Let's stop here.

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Shut up.

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If this is the case, I'll eat you.

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Anyway, it's tough.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's good to make these guys panic by reversing the waterway and the waterway.

184
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Let's break the door faster.

185
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Senpai.

186
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Senpai.

187
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's a mess.

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Honda, it's okay.

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Don't worry.

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
For the time being, only the minimum is scary.

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I can't rest assured.

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Let's go.

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Ryotsu.

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Chief, please don't open the door.

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The life expectancy has been reduced.

196
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I was the one who reduced the life expectancy.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Senpai, what are you doing here with a chain saw?

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The door...

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, the chief asked me to take care of the farm.

200
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:38,000
Liar.

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't remember asking you to do that.

202
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I hate it.

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
When I get older, I forget it.

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Right, Honda?

205
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes.

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
No, no, no.

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Anyway, Chief.

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Didn't you go on a trip to the hot spring?

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes.

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's...

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I couldn't get a ticket because of the difference in the travel agency.

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So I decided to stay at home.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Then why are you in Nakagawa?

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Well...

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,467
I suddenly got bored, so I called Nakagawa and Reiko.

216
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:13,000
Of course, I contacted Niconico, too.

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Of course.

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I've been working in the hot spring for a long time.

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Is that so?

221
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was surprised.

222
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Well, it's a coincidence.

223
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Let's get closer, Honda.

224
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Chief, of course you don't mind, do you?

225
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm glad, Honda.

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You came all the way to Chiba to take care of the farm.

227
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, then, let's have a meal.

228
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, before that...

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Thank you for waiting.

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm glad you came to take care of the farm.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I brought it so that you don't have to worry about this kind of thing.

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Honda, it's a little rude to dress like that.

233
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Well, whatever.

234
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's the chief's house.

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Ryotsu, remember what to do.

236
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:24,427
Ryotsu, Honda.

237
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:26,000
Happy New Year.

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Come on, sit down.

239
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Thank you.

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Happy New Year, everyone.

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Happy New Year.

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Terai, You look good in Japanese clothes.

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Why do you say that?

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If you wear such good clothes and come to the New Year's party,

245
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
why don't you say a few words to me?

246
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,775
Honda, I'm really happy to have a good colleague.

247
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:55,000
Senpai.

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Ryotsu, don't be so mean as if you've got something in your teeth.

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What?

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, it's New Year's Eve, so let's have fun.

251
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm tired of New Year's food, so I'm going to make sukiyaki.

252
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
How about you guys?

253
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What kind of stupid thing are you doing?

254
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We eat New Year's food.

255
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
This is the common sense of the Japanese.

256
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Chief.

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But...

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's not that there's no New Year's food.

259
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's the wisdom of the Japanese from the old days

260
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
that we put in a lot of things that make us feel like we're going to take a break from work on New Year's.

261
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:38,000
But it's not like you're going to take a break from work on New Year's.

262
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:41,891
Even if it's about New Year's food,

263
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,664
I'm happy with the omumaki.

264
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:45,828
Black beans work for beans.

265
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:47,000
Shrimp is an act.

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There's a meaning to it.

267
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What are you thinking about from New Year's to sukiyaki?

268
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,876
New Year's in Japan is of course New Year's.

269
00:14:56,901 --> 00:15:00,000
It looks like the New Year's is coming, so it's better to give it out.

270
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,000
It seems so.

271
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Mom.

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's still some osechi.

273
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Give it out.

274
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes.

275
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yay!

276
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Osechi is here!

277
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,000
We're going to make sukiyaki here.

278
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Ryosu, you can eat the osechi there.

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Huh?

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's an imposter again.

281
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, as long as the osechi comes.

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, here it comes.

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Here you go.

284
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,255
Thank you.

285
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:31,398
What?

286
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Um, I can't see Kinton or Kazunoko.

287
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I ate that one.

288
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
All that's left is there.

289
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What?

290
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Black beans?

291
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Omumaki?

292
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Kamaboko?

293
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So the best three of the unpopular osechi are supposed to be left.

294
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Osechi cooking without the main character is not good.

295
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:03,000
It looks delicious.

296
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
All right, it's boiling.

297
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,844
Excuse me, boss.

298
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:09,327
Let's eat.

299
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:10,772
Thank you for the food.

300
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:12,328
Excuse me, boss.

301
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:14,000
What is it?

302
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If you don't mind, can you help me with the sukiyaki over there?

303
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I made the osechi dish for you.

304
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Ryosu, I'll leave the sukiyaki to you until you finish eating the osechi.

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
All right.

306
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I can eat the osechi, right?

307
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Of course.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm glad.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I was wondering how to get rid of the rest of the osechi.

310
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's just right to get rid of it.

311
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Ryosu's stomach is as big as a bug.

312
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's right.

313
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll introduce it to you even if it hurts a little.

314
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Anyway, Ryosu, you'd better eat the meat before you finish eating the osechi.

315
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
All right.

316
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I can finally eat the sukiyaki.

317
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Let's eat.

318
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
There's only one piece of meat.

319
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What?

320
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What a shame.

321
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I was faster.

322
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No, I was faster.

323
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Honda, right?

324
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Honda, you'll tell us the truth.

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't want to.

326
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's better to avoid meat than to get old.

327
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You're the one who ate so much of the osechi, so don't do it.

328
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:35,975
You bastard.

329
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's not good to put a wisp on the meat.

330
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I can see your despicable ways.

331
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,891
You two are not children.

332
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:47,717
That's right.

333
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's decide who wins the game.

334
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,484
Game?

335
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:55,000
How about we settle it with karta like ginger?

336
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:57,427
That sounds interesting.

337
00:17:58,074 --> 00:17:59,245
All right.

338
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:01,000
I think there was a police karta.

339
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,800
Police karta?

340
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:06,000
I did it with my sister yesterday.

341
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If you walk around, you'll get into an accident.

342
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Be careful, you'll get hurt.

343
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,507
That's good, isn't it?

344
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:17,000
It's not interesting to have a karta like that.

345
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What do you think?

346
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Let's do it with my karta.

347
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,198
Did you bring the karta?

348
00:18:22,223 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes.

349
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,364
I made it when I was working on New Year's day.

350
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:30,000
You bastard.

351
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Are you going to do the karta game?

352
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Are you not going to do it?

353
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Let's do it.

354
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I won't let you eat meat.

355
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm the one who eats meat at the end.

356
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:44,000
I'll eat it.

357
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:48,937
Then I'll go.

358
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,588
What's wrong?

359
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,000
Hurry up and read it.

360
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:56,052
I can't read it.

361
00:18:56,077 --> 00:18:57,568
Mr. Nakagawa, please change.

362
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:58,210
What?

363
00:18:58,374 --> 00:18:59,427
It doesn't matter who it is.

364
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,000
Hurry up and read it.

365
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I understand.

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Reiko's big pie that will someday fall.

367
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What did you say?

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,722
No, I...

369
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:11,905
Yes.

370
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Chief, you're going to pray first, aren't you?

371
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What are you writing?

372
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Idiot.

373
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,802
I'll go next.

374
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:27,668
The last one is definitely the chief, Ryotsu Kankichi.

375
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:29,000
What?

376
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:31,000
I'll take it.

377
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You like this card the most, don't you?

378
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I just made it.

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's a weird karta.

380
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm hungry.

381
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Chief Ohara is soaked.

382
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What is it?

383
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm sorry I met you a long time ago.

384
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:52,000
My home.

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Terai-kun of Lone Hell.

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Not yet.

387
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I found it.

388
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You're naive, Chief.

389
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You don't seem to be my enemy.

390
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You made this karta.

391
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,591
You made it yourself, so you're better than me.

392
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,613
Are you trying to make fun of me for losing?

393
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:17,000
That's not it.

394
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's hard to read because the words are dirty.

395
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You're the only one who knows it's not fair.

396
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Chief, where are you going with that picture book?

397
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm making it fair.

398
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Don't make it messy.

399
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Are you going to spread it all over the house?

400
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This is fair.

401
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:46,000
Okay, this is good.

402
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We'll find out what Nakagawa is reading here.

403
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:52,248
When we find it, we'll bring it to Nakagawa.

404
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:54,000
That sounds fun.

405
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Okay, let's get started.

406
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Nakagawa-kun is doing it for fun.

407
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What is it?

408
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Okay, I found it.

409
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Damn it.

410
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yotsu, Kankichi, Kameyari Ichi's good man.

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Honda-kun, who is more impolite than Tora-san.

412
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I did it, Ryo-san.

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Pachinko Dai Fever.

414
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Chief, raise the salary rather than raising the blood pressure.

415
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Ryo-chan has 20 sheets.

416
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Chief has 19 sheets.

417
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There are only two sheets left.

418
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I can't lose to Yotsu.

419
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I remember.

420
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This is the second-floor library school.

421
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,063
I told you not to eat only Aisai bento.

422
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,000
Toilet.

423
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Damn it.

424
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:54,000
I found it.

425
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This is my victory.

426
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This is a tie.

427
00:22:01,702 --> 00:22:04,000
You're a dirty handler.

428
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Then I'll go to the last sheet.

429
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'll definitely turn it over.

430
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
This year.

431
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's not 4, it's 1.

432
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
This is my victory.

433
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What?

434
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It won't open.

435
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You're naive, Ryo-chan.

436
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I put the key in the book just in case.

437
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Damn it.

438
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
After all, the last thing to laugh at is...

439
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
There's no key.

440
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's strange.

441
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That means you can't get in.

442
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Alright.

443
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Sorry.

444
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:42,000
Both of them are late.

445
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
They went outside.

446
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Huh?

447
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:53,477
I knew it.

448
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What's that sound?

449
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Inside here?

450
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What's going on?

451
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Damn it.

452
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,152
My book.

453
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:22,000
You're a little late.

454
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's my victory.

455
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,890
You did a good job.

456
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:29,000
Next year's New Year's party.

457
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Next year's New Year's party.

458
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You're the only one who can't get in.

459
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Damn it.

460
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
I knew it.

461
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:52,585
This year's New Year's party is going to be like this.

462
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Watch this year's New Year's party.

463
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
This is Katsushikaku.

464
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Kameyari Park.
