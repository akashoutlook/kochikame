1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Batsumatsu police officer, Ryotsu appears!

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Batsumatsu police officer, Ryotsu appears!

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 He's coming!

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 He's here!

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 You're so excited, Ryousa!

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I'm late!

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I can't believe he's stopping at a place like this.

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 What kind of nerves does he have?

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Don't get in the way!

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Ryousa...

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Wait!

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 What's wrong with him?

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Ryotsu Kankichi...

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 He's so clumsy, he's so strong, and he's a real man!

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Police officer, wait!

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 He's coming!

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 You think you can catch me, Ryotsu Kankichi?

21
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I'm 30km per hour!

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And 40km per hour!

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 40km per hour!

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 50km per hour!

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 60km per hour!

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 70km per hour!

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 80km per hour!

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 The tachometer is entering the red zone!

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Hang on, 90 degrees!

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 This is terrible!

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Ryotsu Kankichi

32
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I did it!

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I made it in time!

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I made it in time!

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I did it!

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I'm so glad!

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 That's not good, Ryousa!

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 You broke the glass, and the police officer will get mad at you again!

39
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Hey, Ryousa!

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I watered that flower every day, and it finally bloomed!

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I won't forgive you if you touch it again!

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 He's as noisy as ever.

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 What?

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 The police officer isn't here yet?

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 He's not here yet.

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Usually, people who stand on top of people have to come 30 minutes earlier.

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Ryousa!

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 What's wrong?

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Chief!

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 You came early today, too.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 It's great that you have to walk two and a half hours every day from the countryside.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 You're the mirror of the entire police force.

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 It doesn't have to be loud, right?

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I didn't get late today, so I'm going to slide in a minute.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Chief!

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 No matter how many times you do it, it's the same as the neighborhood police officer!

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I feel like I've written a few letters of resignation.

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Are you going to sign up for the Guinness Book of Records?

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 That's why you don't have a wife.

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Live your life to the fullest!

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 There's a song like this in my favorite Suizenji Kiyoko's song.

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 One day, one step.

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Three steps in three days.

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Three steps forward, two steps back.

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Donkuna!

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 No, no, no!

67
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 I'm Suizenji Kiyoko, the chief's wife!

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 That's right, that's right.

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Three steps forward in life, two steps back.

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 It's the same if you take a step forward and rest.

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 It's the same if you take a step forward and rest.

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 I was a fool to try to teach you the modesty of life.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 My head hurts.

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 It's finally over.

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 The second word is stupid.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I'll remember one of those stupid things.

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Chief!

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Did you forget something?

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 That's right.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Today was payday.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I don't want to do it for you, but I can't help it.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Listen, Ryo-tsu.

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 You can't use it right away because you have money.

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Think about the future.

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Try to use it strategically.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Yes, sir.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 I'll add another radio.

88
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 What are you doing?

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Chief!

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 My one month's sweat and tears are going to be paid off!

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Door and glass.

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And a bicycle compensation bill.

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 You're so stubborn.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Well, as long as I have this.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 We'll be back on Sunday!

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 What?

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I'm here to receive the compensation.

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Everyone in the shopping district is here.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Damn it.

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 What if this happens?

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Run away!

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Chief!

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Don't come out!

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Hold Ryo-tsu's legs!

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Yes, sir!

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Let go! Let go!

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Don't come out!

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Let go!

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Now, everyone, please take it.

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Let go!

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I'm sorry, Ryo-san.

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I'll take the Game Sock and the Plamodive for 38,000 yen.

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I'll take it.

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Plamodive for 32,000 yen.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Beer and whiskey for 28,000 yen.

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Let's get some money.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 How much is it?

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 It's 18,000 yen.

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 3,000 yen for the fishing pole.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 What?

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 What?

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 My money!

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 150 yen.

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Are you going to spend this much this month?

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 You're self-sufficient.

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 That's why I'm telling you that you have to live a real life.

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Chief!

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 You can't be greedy!

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Try to live a month just like a man.

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 No way!

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 It's not good to lend money to Ryo-tsu.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 There's a house loan in the house.

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 It's okay.

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Ryo-chan can live on that alone.

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 That's right.

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 You can't be greedy for Ryo-tsu.

137
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Chief!

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 You don't have to say that.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 50,000 yen, no, 30,000 yen is fine.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Then, 20,000 yen.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 10,000 yen.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 At least 1,000 yen.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 No!

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I won't cry to anyone anymore.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 If you're going to cry to these cold guys,

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 it's better to starve to death.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 You said it.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Don't forget that word.

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 I don't care if you're hungry and crying.

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I'll give you a luxurious life with 150 yen.

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It's a child's fight.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 You're right.

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 My stomach clock is really accurate.

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 It's closed.

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Reiko isn't here.

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I wonder if I can get a lunch box in the meantime.

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Ouch!

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Ryo-chan, if you're going to cry to these cold guys,

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 it's better to starve to death.

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 You said it.

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Who was it?

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Damn it.

163
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I was reading the pattern of action.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Give me your bed.

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 No!

166
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 This is mine!

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Ryo-chan,

168
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 stealing is a crime.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Shut up!

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Is there a name on the rice grain?

171
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Give it to me.

172
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Ryo-chan, stop it.

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Give it to me.

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 No!

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Hehehe.

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Reiko,

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 okay,

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 this is good.

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 It's great to talk about food.

180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Damn it.

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Ouch!

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I'll make you a roll of eri next time.

183
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 I'm hungry.

184
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Is there anything to eat?

185
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 I found it.

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 It's a mirror.

187
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 There must be something to eat.

188
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 I'll add a little bit of ponzu.

189
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I put too much.

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 This is too much.

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I'll add some salt.

192
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I put too much.

193
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I'll add some sugar.

194
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 It's okay.

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 It's like this.

196
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I'll season it with pork cutlet sauce.

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Ryo-san's pot is ready.

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I still have the mirror from the New Year.

199
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 What?

200
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Isn't that the one that you chewed?

201
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 You're an idiot.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Mushrooms are also a kind of hair.

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 It contains the leaves of mackerel,

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 and it's well balanced.

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Eating the leaves of mackerel...

206
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 It's about the taste of mackerel,

207
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 so it must be delicious.

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 The color is not good.

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Ryo-san, that's Reiko-san's...

210
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 The color is important in cooking.

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 I'll eat it.

212
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Ryo-chan, what are you doing?

213
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I told you not to touch it again.

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 You're an idiot.

215
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Damn it.

216
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I'll leave it for a while.

217
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 I'm hungry.

218
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 This is...

219
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Over there!

220
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Over there!

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Isn't that Junpei and Kappei from the tofu shop?

222
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Good luck, Junpei-chan!

223
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 You're doing well, everyone.

224
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 You're doing well.

225
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 It looks delicious.

226
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 What do you think, Junpei?

227
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Do you want to compete with me?

228
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 With Ryo-san?

229
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 That's right.

230
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 It's a one-on-one game.

231
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 If I win, I'll get this takoyaki.

232
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 What if Ryo-san loses?

233
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I'll give you whatever you like,

234
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 whether it's my collection of plastic models or game software.

235
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 What? Plastic models?

236
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 What do you think?

237
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Do you want to do it, Junpei?

238
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Yeah!

239
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Good luck, Junpei!

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Good luck, Junpei!

241
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 That was easy.

242
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Oh, Ryo-san.

243
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 I did it!

244
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 You got 980 points out of 1000.

245
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 You're pretty good.

246
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Alright, it's my turn next.

247
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Start!

248
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Start!

249
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I won't give up!

250
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I won't give up!

251
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 It's over!

252
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I'm in the lead!

253
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 He won!

254
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Amazing!

255
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 How was it?

256
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 I lost.

257
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 You should have stopped, Onii-chan.

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 As promised, I'll get the takoyaki.

259
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Junpei!

260
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 You bastard!

261
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Are you alright?

262
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Ryo-san, I got you!

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Leave it to me!

264
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Wait!

265
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Wait!

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 This is bad!

267
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 My bike's going to break!

268
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Ultra Power Turbo, on!

269
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Ryo-san!

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Oh no! He's chasing us with his bike!

271
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I won't let you catch me!

272
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I'll get you if you let me!

273
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I won't let you catch me!

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Are you serious?

275
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I won't let you get away!

276
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I won't let you get away!

277
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 You bastard!

278
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Alright, it's my turn!

279
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Missile Jump!

280
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Missile Jump!

281
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Damn! It's a shortcut!

282
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Oh no! I made a wrong turn!

283
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Ryo-san, what are you doing?

284
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Damn!

285
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Missile Jump, on!

286
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Missile Jump, on!

287
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 What are you doing, Ryo-san?

288
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 He's chasing us!

289
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Wait for me!

290
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 He's chasing us!

291
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 He's still chasing us!

292
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Hurry up!

293
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 He's so stubborn!

294
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Don't underestimate me!

295
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 He's chasing us at 80 km per hour!

296
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Hurry up!

297
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Move, you idiot!

298
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Missile Jump, on!

299
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Looks like he finally gave up.

300
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 No way!

301
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Wait for me, you bastard!

302
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 He's a monster!

303
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Missile Jump, on!

304
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 He's not following us anymore.

305
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 You did it, Ken-chan.

306
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 What do you mean?

307
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Missile Jump, on!

308
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Damn! It's an exit!

309
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 The culprit has been arrested, Ryo-san.

310
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Well done!

311
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 You bastard!

312
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

313
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Give me back my takoyaki!

314
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 It's takoyaki, takoyaki!

315
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Give me back my takoyaki!

316
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 You did it, Ryo-chan.

317
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 It's been eight years since the culprit was arrested.

318
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Congratulations!

319
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Well, it's because Nowaru Taka has been hiding his takoyaki for a while.

320
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Nowaru Taka hides his takoyaki, right?

321
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 It doesn't suit you, Ryo-chan.

322
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Ryo-san!

323
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Hey, Jumpei.

324
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Are your legs okay now?

325
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 This isn't a big deal!

326
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Ryo-san, I'm going to win the game this time!

327
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Yeah, yeah.

328
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 You should practice hard, Jumpei.

329
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything yet.

330
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Oh, right.

331
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 I heard that the driver's license was a two-month traffic violation.

332
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 This is probably a special award and a gold medal.

333
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 A gold medal!

334
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 I did it!

335
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 I'm going to be saved this month!

336
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Are you ready?

337
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Huh?

338
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Yes!

339
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 I'm here to arrest Kameyari's excellent police officer, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

340
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 You're going to give me a gold medal, right?

341
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Idiot!

342
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Look outside!

343
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Ryo-tsu Kankichi

344
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Ryo-tsu!

345
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 I heard that you caused trouble to your neighbors again.

346
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 I'll pay you back next month!

347
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 No way!

348
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Please forgive me!

349
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Please!

350
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 A new police officer is coming to the Kameyari Park.

351
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 He's the only son of a rich man named Nakagawa Zaibatsu.

352
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Don't tell me you're going to be a police officer!

353
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Next time on A New Police Officer from the Sky!

354
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 I'm going to give you a gold medal!

355
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 I'm going to be saved this month!

356
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 A gold medal!

357
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 I heard that you caused trouble to your neighbors again.

358
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 I'll pay you back next month!

359
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 No way!

360
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I heard that you caused trouble to your neighbors again.

361
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 I'll pay you back next month!

362
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Please forgive me!

363
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I'm in a good mood, yeah

364
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Smile at me anytime

365
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Because a dark-skinned woman is not pretty

366
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 You should smile right away

367
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 If you're not a child

368
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Smile at me anytime
