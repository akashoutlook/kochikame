1
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:33,279
The XX Cop Ryotsu Appears!?

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,072
 He's coming!

3
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:17,300
 He's here!

4
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:25,000
 You're so excited, Ryousa!

5
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:27,813
 I'm late!

6
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:31,000
 I can't believe he's parking at a place like this.

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 What kind of sense does he have?

8
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Don't get in the way!

9
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,525
 Move

10
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,395
 Ryousa...

11
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,993
 Wait!

12
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,061
 What's wrong with him?

13
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:04,663
 Ryotsu Kankichi...

14
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:10,340
 He's so clumsy, he's so strong, and he's a real man!

15
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:13,335
 Police officer, wait!

16
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,090
 We are coming!

17
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:21,357
 You think you can catch me, Ryotsu Kankichi?

18
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:24,786
 I'm 30km per hour!

19
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:28,000
 40km per hour!

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 50km per hour!

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 60km per hour!

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 70km per hour!

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,619
 80km per hour!

24
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:37,114
 The tachometer is entering the red zone!

25
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:39,517
 Hang on, 90 degrees!

26
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,514
 This is terrible!

27
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:22,786
 I did it!

28
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:24,293
 I made it in time!

29
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:27,412
 I made it in time! I made it in time!

30
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,921
 I'm so glad that I did it!

31
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:34,849
 That's not good, Ryousa!

32
00:04:34,877 --> 00:04:38,857
 You broke the glass, and chief will get mad at you again!

33
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,857
 Hey, Ryousa!

34
00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:45,039
 I watered that flower every day, and it finally bloomed!

35
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:47,217
 I won't forgive you if you touch it again!

36
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:50,060
 She's as noisy as ever.

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 What?

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,107
 The chief isn't here yet?

39
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:55,697
 He's not here yet.

40
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,830
 Usually people who stand on top of people have to come 30 minutes earlier.

41
00:05:02,997 --> 00:05:04,544
 Ryousa!

42
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,201
 What's wrong Tera..?

43
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:22,996
 Chief!

44
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,067
 You came early today, too.

45
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:30,000
 It's great that you come two and a half hours every day from the countryside.

46
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:32,776
 Chief, you're the mirror of the entire police force.

47
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:34,286
 You idiot!

48
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,151
 It doesn't have to be loud, right?

49
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:45,345
 I didn't get late today, so I'm going to slide in a minute.

50
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,390
 You idiot!

51
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:53,580
 No matter how many times you do it, it's the same as the neighborhood police officer!

52
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:56,221
 I feel like I've written a few letters of resignation.

53
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,403
 Are you going to sign up for the Guinness Book of Records?

54
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,757
 That's why you don't have a wife.

55
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:03,509
 Live your life to the fullest!

56
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:07,804
 There's a song like this in my favorite Suizenji Kiyoko's song.

57
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:11,619
 One day, one step.

58
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:13,576
 Three steps in three days.

59
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:17,936
 Three steps forward, two steps back.

60
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:18,796
 Donkuna!

61
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:19,546
 Yes, yes, yes!

62
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:21,805
  Chief, you are really good in Suizenji Kiyoko.

63
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:23,455
 That's right, that's right.

64
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:25,839
 Three steps forward in life, two steps back.

65
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,719
 It's the same if you take a step forward and rest.

66
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,970
  You idiot!

67
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,045
 I was a fool to try to teach you the modesty of life.

68
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:42,021
 My head hurts.

69
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:45,403
 It's finally over.

70
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:47,676
 The second word is stupid.

71
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,134
 I won't remember one of those stupid things.

72
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:55,672
 Chief!

73
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:58,148
 Did you forget something?

74
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:02,339
 That's right.

75
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:03,911
 Today was payday.

76
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,224
 I don't want to do it for you, but I can't help it.

77
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,375
 Listen, Ryotsu.

78
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:11,895
 You can't use it right away because you have money.

79
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:13,920
 Think about the future.

80
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:16,024
 Try to use it strategically.

81
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:17,755
 Yes, sir.

82
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:24,849
 I'll add another radio.

83
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:28,346
 What are you doing?

84
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:29,000
 Chief!

85
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:32,074
 My one month's sweat and tears are going to be paid off!

86
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:34,000
 Door and glass.

87
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,000
 And a bicycle compensation bill.

88
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:39,000
 You're so stubborn.

89
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:41,628
 Well, as long as I have this.

90
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:44,233
 We'll be back on Sunday!

91
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:45,042
 What?

92
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:51,804
 I'm here to receive the compensation.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,637
 Everyone of the shopping district is here.

94
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:57,959
 Damn it. What if this happens?

95
00:07:58,265 --> 00:08:00,000
 Run away!

96
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:00,975
 Chief!

97
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:04,162
 Terai, hold Ryotsu's legs!

98
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:05,975
 Yes, sir!

99
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:08,050
 Let me go! Let me go!

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,666
 Terai, Let me go!

101
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:14,466
 Now, everyone, please take it.

102
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:15,599
 Let me go!

103
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:17,199
 I'm sorry, Ryo-san.

104
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:20,408
 I'll take the Game Sock and the Plamodive for 38,000 yen.

105
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,395
 I'll take it.

106
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,175
 Plamodive for 32,000 yen.

107
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:27,438
 Beer and whiskey for 28,000 yen.

108
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:29,000
 Let's get some money.

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 How much is it?

110
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:32,300
 It's 18,000 yen.

111
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:34,666
 3,000 yen for the fishing pole.

112
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,298
 My money!

113
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:44,158
 150 yen.

114
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,059
 Am I going to spend this much this month?

115
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:49,753
 You're self-sufficient.

116
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:53,136
 That's why I'm telling you that you have to live a real life.

117
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:54,289
 Chief!

118
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:55,903
 You can't be greedy!

119
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:58,912
 Try to live a month just like a man.

120
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,324
 No way!

121
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,387
 Terai, Reiko, It's not good to lend money to Ryo-tsu.

122
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,580
 There's a house loan in the house.

123
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:08,770
 It's okay.

124
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:11,690
 Ryo-chan can live on that alone.

125
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:12,854
 That's right.

126
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,210
 You can't be greedy for Ryo-tsu.

127
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:16,444
 Chief!

128
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:17,719
 You don't have to say that.

129
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:20,130
 50,000 yen, no, 30,000 yen is fine.

130
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:22,995
 Then, 20,000 yen.

131
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:24,389
 10,000 yen.

132
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:26,945
 At least 1,000 yen.

133
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:28,571
 No!

134
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:31,745
 All right!

135
00:09:34,112 --> 00:09:35,765
 I won't cry to anyone anymore.

136
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:38,344
 If you're going to cry to these cold guys,

137
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,370
 it's better to starve to death.

138
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:42,204
 You said it.

139
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:44,025
 Don't forget that word.

140
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:47,152
 I don't care if you're hungry and crying.

141
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,730
 I'll give you a luxurious life with 150 yen.

142
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:56,734
 It's a child's fight.

143
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,859
 You're right.

144
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,195
 My stomach clock is really accurate.

145
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,959
 It's closed.

146
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,147
 Reiko isn't here.

147
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:33,745
 I wonder if I can get a lunch box in the meantime.

148
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,621
 Ouch!

149
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:44,897
 Ryo-chan, if you're going to cry to these cold guys,

150
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:46,865
 it's better to starve to death.

151
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,576
 You said it. Isn't it?

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,882
 Damn it.

153
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,172
 I was reading the pattern of action.

154
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:05,000
 Give me your lunch.

155
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,252
 No! I won't.

156
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:08,371
 This is mine!

157
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:09,931
 Ryo-chan,

158
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:12,489
 stealing is a crime.

159
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,000
 Shut up!

160
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Is there a name on the rice grain?

161
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:18,057
 Give it to me.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,292
 Ryo-chan, stop it.

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Give it to me.

164
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:25,206
 No! No!

165
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,570
 Hehehe.

166
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,000
 Reiko,

167
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:42,000
 okay,

168
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:43,609
 this is good.

169
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:56,117
 It's great to talk about food.

170
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:03,788
 Damn it.

171
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,002
 Ouch!

172
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,322
 I'll make you a roll of eri next time.

173
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,047
 I'm hungry.

174
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,317
 Is there anything to eat?

175
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:30,160
 I found it.

176
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:32,000
 It's a mochi.

177
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,298
 There must be something to eat.

178
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:38,316
 I'll add a little bit of ponzu.

179
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:40,590
 I put too much.

180
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:42,184
 This is too much.

181
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,196
 I'll add some salt.

182
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,536
 I put too much.

183
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,215
 I'll add some sugar.

184
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:53,890
 It's okay.

185
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,132
 It's like this.

186
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:58,485
 I'll season it with pork cutlet sauce.

187
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,066
 Ryo-san's pot is ready.

188
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:04,418
 I still have the mochi from the New Year.

189
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:05,599
 What?

190
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:08,823
 Isn't that the one that you chewed?

191
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:10,038
 You're an idiot.

192
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:12,000
 Mushrooms are also a kind of hair.

193
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:14,000
 It contains the leaves of mackerel,

194
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 and it's well balanced.

195
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:19,000
 Eating the leaves of mackerel...

196
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,996
 It's about the taste of mackerel,

197
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:22,760
 so it must be delicious.

198
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:26,754
 The color is not good.

199
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:33,141
 Ryo-san, that's Reiko-san's...

200
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,001
 The color is important in cooking.

201
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,545
 I'll eat it.

202
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:47,182
 Ryo-chan, what are you doing?

203
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:51,337
 I told you not to touch it again.

204
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:52,406
 You're an idiot.

205
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,079
 Damn it.

206
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:03,675
 I'll leave it for a while.

207
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,945
 I'm hungry.

208
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:16,772
 This is...

209
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:22,975
 Over there!

210
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:24,136
 Over there!

211
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:28,074
 Isn't that Junpei and Kappei from the tofu shop?

212
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,000
 Good luck, Junpei-chan!

213
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:42,449
 You're doing well, everyone.

214
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:45,000
 You're doing well.

215
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:47,884
 It looks delicious.

216
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:49,000
 What do you think, Junpei?

217
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:50,628
 Do you want to compete with me?

218
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:53,000
 With Ryo-san?

219
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:53,769
 That's right.

220
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,872
 It's a one-on-one game.

221
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,640
 If I win, I'll get this takoyaki.

222
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:01,562
 What if Ryo-san loses?

223
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,000
 I'll give you whatever you like,

224
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 whether it's my collection of plastic models or game software.

225
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:09,000
 What? Plastic models?

226
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:12,026
 What do you think? Do you want to do it, Junpei?

227
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:13,190
 Yeah!

228
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:15,705
 Good luck, Junpei!

229
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,493
 Good luck, Junpei!

230
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:22,085
 That was easy.

231
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:23,550
 Oh, Ryo-san.

232
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:29,827
 I did it!

233
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,491
 You got 980 points out of 1000.

234
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,939
 You're pretty good.

235
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,716
 Alright, it's my turn next.

236
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:41,000
 Start!

237
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:42,997
 Start!

238
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,726
 I won't give up!

239
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,823
 It's over!

240
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:05,000
 I'm in the lead!

241
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:18,203
 He won!

242
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,582
 Amazing!

243
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:22,351
 How was it?

244
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:23,909
 I lost.

245
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:26,668
 You should have stopped, Onii-chan.

246
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:29,652
 As promised, I'll get the takoyaki.

247
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,089
 Junpei!

248
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,775
 You bastard!

249
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:48,024
 Are you alright?

250
00:16:50,161 --> 00:16:52,430
 Ryo-san, I got it!

251
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:54,209
 Leave it to me!

252
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:56,234
 Wait!

253
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:02,529
 Wait!

254
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,601
 This is bad!

255
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:14,478
 Your bike's going to break!

256
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:18,240
 Ultra Power Turbo, on!

257
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:20,209
 Ryo-san!

258
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:34,039
 Oh no! He's chasing us with his bike!

259
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,695
 I won't let him to catch me!

260
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:38,246
 You'll get me if I let you!

261
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,594
 Are you serious?

262
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:59,375
 I won't let you get away!

263
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:15,000
 You bastard!

264
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,766
 Alright, it's my turn!

265
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:21,133
 Missile Jump!

266
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:44,342
 Damn! There's a shortcut!

267
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,123
 Oh no! I made a wrong turn!

268
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,280
 Ryo-san, what are you doing?

269
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,250
 Damn!

270
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:00,898
 I will come back to you.

271
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:28,007
 What are you doing, Ryo-san?

272
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:30,132
I am on a chase

273
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:36,000
 Wait for me!

274
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,000
 He's still chasing us!

275
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,305
 Hurry up! Hurry up!

276
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:45,970
 He's so stubborn!

277
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Don't underestimate me!

278
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,477
 He's chasing us at 80 km per hour!

279
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:04,916
 Hurry up!

280
00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:15,054
 Move, you idiot!

281
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:33,973
 Looks like he finally gave up.

282
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:35,832
 No way!

283
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:41,000
 Wait for me, you bastard!

284
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:45,585
 He's a monster!

285
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:13,430
 He's not following us anymore.

286
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,258
 You did it, Ken-chan.

287
00:21:15,362 --> 00:21:16,487
 What do you mean?

288
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:28,028
 Yes! It's an exit!

289
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:53,029
 The culprit has been arrested, Ryo-san.

290
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:54,202
 Well done!

291
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:57,716
 You bastard!

292
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,975
 I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

293
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:04,340
 Give me back my takoyaki!

294
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,300
 It's takoyaki, takoyaki!

295
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,856
 Give me back my takoyaki!

296
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:21,282
 You did it, Ryo-chan.

297
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,273
 It's been eight years since the culprit was arrested.

298
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:25,295
 Congratulations!

299
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,293
 Well, it's because Nowaru Taka has been hiding his takoyaki for a while.

300
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,000
 Nowaru Taka hides his takoyaki, right?

301
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,966
 It doesn't suit you, Ryo-chan.

302
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:35,572
 Ryo-san!

303
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:37,907
 Hey, Jumpei.

304
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:39,735
 Are your legs okay now?

305
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:42,530
 This isn't a big deal!

306
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:46,123
 Ryo-san, I'm going to win the game this time!

307
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,491
 Yeah, yeah.

308
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:49,943
 You should practice hard, Jumpei.

309
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:54,694
 Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything yet.

310
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:56,451
 Oh, right.

311
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,290
 I heard that the driver's license was a two-month traffic violation.

312
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:04,795
 This is probably a special award and a gold medal.

313
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:05,869
 A gold medal!

314
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:06,930
 I did it!

315
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,320
 I'm going to be saved this month!

316
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:11,936
 Are you ready?

317
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:12,961
 Huh?

318
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,665
 Yes!

319
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:22,987
 I'm here to arrest, Kameyari's excellent police officer, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

320
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,000
 You're going to give me a gold medal, right?

321
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:30,163
 Idiot!

322
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:33,985
 Look outside!

323
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,630
 Ryo-tsu!

324
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:43,282
 I heard that you caused trouble to your neighbors again.

325
00:23:43,376 --> 00:23:47,847
 I'll pay you back next month!

326
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:49,856
 No way!

327
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,819
 Please forgive me! Chief
