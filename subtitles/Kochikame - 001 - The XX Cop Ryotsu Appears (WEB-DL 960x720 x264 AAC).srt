1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,718
The XX Cop Ryotsu Appears!?

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 He's coming!

3
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,607
 He's here!

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 You're so excited, Ryousa!

5
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I'm late!

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I can't believe he's stopping at a place like this.

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 What kind of nerves does he have?

8
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Don't get in the way!

9
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:37,525
 Move

10
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Ryousa...

11
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,210
 Wait!

12
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,061
 What's wrong with him?

13
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:05,086
 Ryotsu Kankichi...

14
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:09,940
 He's so clumsy, he's so strong, and he's a real man!

15
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,283
 Police officer, wait!

16
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:15,773
We are coming!

17
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,799
 You think you can catch me, Ryotsu Kankichi?

18
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:25,101
 I'm 30km per hour!

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 40km per hour!

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 50km per hour!

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 60km per hour!

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 70km per hour!

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 80km per hour!

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 The tachometer is entering the red zone!

25
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Hang on, 90 degrees!

26
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 This is terrible!

27
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I did it!

28
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I made it in time!

29
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I made it in time!

30
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I did it!

31
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I'm so glad!

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 That's not good, Ryousa!

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,455
 You broke the glass, and the police officer will get mad at you again!

34
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:41,000
 Hey, Ryousa!

35
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I watered that flower every day, and it finally bloomed!

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I won't forgive you if you touch it again!

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 She's as noisy as ever.

38
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 What?

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 The chief isn't here yet?

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 He's not here yet.

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Usually, people who stand on top of people have to come 30 minutes earlier.

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Ryousa!

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 What's wrong?

44
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:23,000
 Chief!

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 You came early today, too.

46
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 It's great that you have to walk two and a half hours every day from the countryside.

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 You're the mirror of the entire police force.

48
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,796
 You idiot!

49
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 It doesn't have to be loud, right?

50
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I didn't get late today, so I'm going to slide in a minute.

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 You idiot!

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 No matter how many times you do it, it's the same as the neighborhood police officer!

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I feel like I've written a few letters of resignation.

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Are you going to sign up for the Guinness Book of Records?

55
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 That's why you don't have a wife.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Live your life to the fullest!

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 There's a song like this in my favorite Suizenji Kiyoko's song.

58
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,000
 One day, one step.

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Three steps in three days.

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,801
 Three steps forward, two steps back.

61
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:18,389
 Donkuna!

62
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:19,000
 No, no, no!

63
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,391
 I'm Suizenji Kiyoko, the chief's wife!

64
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:23,000
 That's right, that's right.

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Three steps forward in life, two steps back.

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 It's the same if you take a step forward and rest.

67
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 It's the same if you take a step forward and rest.

68
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:30,336
  You idiot!

69
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,000
 I was a fool to try to teach you the modesty of life.

70
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:42,242
 My head hurts.

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 It's finally over.

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 The second word is stupid.

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,375
 I'll remember one of those stupid things.

74
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:55,403
 Chief!

75
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:58,269
 Did you forget something?

76
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:02,339
 That's right.

77
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:03,911
 Today was payday.

78
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:07,224
 I don't want to do it for you, but I can't help it.

79
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,216
 Listen, Ryo-tsu.

80
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:11,895
 You can't use it right away because you have money.

81
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
 Think about the future.

82
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:15,945
 Try to use it strategically.

83
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,303
 Yes, sir.

84
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:25,523
 I'll add another radio.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 What are you doing?

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Chief!

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,199
 My one month's sweat and tears are going to be paid off!

88
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:34,000
 Door and glass.

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And a bicycle compensation bill.

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 You're so stubborn.

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,325
 Well, as long as I have this.

92
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,233
 We'll be back on Sunday!

93
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,258
 What?

94
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:51,804
 I'm here to receive the compensation.

95
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,786
 Everyone in the shopping district is here.

96
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:56,839
 Damn it.

97
00:07:56,864 --> 00:07:58,000
 What if this happens?

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Run away!

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Chief!

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Don't come out!

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Hold Ryo-tsu's legs!

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Yes, sir!

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Let go! Let go!

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Don't come out!

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Let go!

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Now, everyone, please take it.

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Let go!

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I'm sorry, Ryo-san.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I'll take the Game Sock and the Plamodive for 38,000 yen.

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I'll take it.

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Plamodive for 32,000 yen.

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Beer and whiskey for 28,000 yen.

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Let's get some money.

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 How much is it?

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 It's 18,000 yen.

116
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 3,000 yen for the fishing pole.

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 What?

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 What?

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 My money!

120
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:44,565
 150 yen.

121
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:48,059
 Are you going to spend this much this month?

122
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:49,000
 You're self-sufficient.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,059
 That's why I'm telling you that you have to live a real life.

124
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:54,000
 Chief!

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 You can't be greedy!

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,809
 Try to live a month just like a man.

127
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,324
 No way!

128
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:04,387
 It's not good to lend money to Ryo-tsu.

129
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:07,000
 There's a house loan in the house.

130
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 It's okay.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,645
 Ryo-chan can live on that alone.

132
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:12,854
 That's right.

133
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,000
 You can't be greedy for Ryo-tsu.

134
00:09:15,444 --> 00:09:16,444
 Chief!

135
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:17,719
 You don't have to say that.

136
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:21,104
 50,000 yen, no, 30,000 yen is fine.

137
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,290
 Then, 20,000 yen.

138
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:25,315
 10,000 yen.

139
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,253
 At least 1,000 yen.

140
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:28,921
 No!

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I won't cry to anyone anymore.

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 If you're going to cry to these cold guys,

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 it's better to starve to death.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 You said it.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Don't forget that word.

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 I don't care if you're hungry and crying.

147
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:55,007
 I'll give you a luxurious life with 150 yen.

148
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:56,443
 It's a child's fight.

149
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,468
 You're right.

150
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,078
 My stomach clock is really accurate.

151
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,959
 It's closed.

152
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:22,371
 Reiko isn't here.

153
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,296
 I wonder if I can get a lunch box in the meantime.

154
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:42,621
 Ouch!

155
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:44,563
 Ryo-chan, if you're going to cry to these cold guys,

156
00:10:44,588 --> 00:10:46,301
 it's better to starve to death.

157
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:47,326
 You said it.

158
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:49,351
 Who was it?

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Damn it.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I was reading the pattern of action.

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Give me your lunch.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 No!

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 This is mine!

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Ryo-chan,

165
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 stealing is a crime.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Shut up!

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Is there a name on the rice grain?

168
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:18,273
 Give it to me.

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Ryo-chan, stop it.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Give it to me.

171
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,359
 No!

172
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,570
 Hehehe.

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Reiko,

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 okay,

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 this is good.

176
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 It's great to talk about food.

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Damn it.

178
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:09,002
 Ouch!

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,322
 I'll make you a roll of eri next time.

180
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,047
 I'm hungry.

181
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:29,317
 Is there anything to eat?

182
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:30,342
 I found it.

183
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,000
 It's a mochi.

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 There must be something to eat.

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 I'll add a little bit of ponzu.

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I put too much.

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 This is too much.

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I'll add some salt.

189
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I put too much.

190
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I'll add some sugar.

191
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 It's okay.

192
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 It's like this.

193
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I'll season it with pork cutlet sauce.

194
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Ryo-san's pot is ready.

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I still have the mochi from the New Year.

196
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 What?

197
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Isn't that the one that you chewed?

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 You're an idiot.

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Mushrooms are also a kind of hair.

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 It contains the leaves of mackerel,

201
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 and it's well balanced.

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Eating the leaves of mackerel...

203
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 It's about the taste of mackerel,

204
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 so it must be delicious.

205
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 The color is not good.

206
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:33,141
 Ryo-san, that's Reiko-san's...

207
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:36,529
 The color is important in cooking.

208
00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:39,545
 I'll eat it.

209
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,703
 Ryo-chan, what are you doing?

210
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:51,750
 I told you not to touch it again.

211
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:54,124
 You're an idiot.

212
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,560
 Damn it.

213
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:04,585
 I'll leave it for a while.

214
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:09,945
 I'm hungry.

215
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:17,593
 This is...

216
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:22,975
 Over there!

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Over there!

218
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,258
 Isn't that Junpei and Kappei from the tofu shop?

219
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Good luck, Junpei-chan!

220
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 You're doing well, everyone.

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 You're doing well.

222
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 It looks delicious.

223
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 What do you think, Junpei?

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Do you want to compete with me?

225
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 With Ryo-san?

226
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 That's right.

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 It's a one-on-one game.

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 If I win, I'll get this takoyaki.

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 What if Ryo-san loses?

230
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I'll give you whatever you like,

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 whether it's my collection of plastic models or game software.

232
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 What? Plastic models?

233
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 What do you think?

234
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Do you want to do it, Junpei?

235
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Yeah!

236
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Good luck, Junpei!

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Good luck, Junpei!

238
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 That was easy.

239
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Oh, Ryo-san.

240
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:30,000
 I did it!

241
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,491
 You got 980 points out of 1000.

242
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,000
 You're pretty good.

243
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Alright, it's my turn next.

244
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Start!

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Start!

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I won't give up!

247
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I won't give up!

248
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 It's over!

249
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I'm in the lead!

250
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 He won!

251
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Amazing!

252
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,351
 How was it?

253
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,012
 I lost.

254
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:27,037
 You should have stopped, Onii-chan.

255
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:30,062
 As promised, I'll get the takoyaki.

256
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,851
 Junpei!

257
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:46,876
 You bastard!

258
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:48,901
 Are you alright?

259
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,430
 Ryo-san, I got you!

260
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:54,209
 Leave it to me!

261
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:56,234
 Wait!

262
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Wait!

263
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:04,976
 This is bad!

264
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,000
 My bike's going to break!

265
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Ultra Power Turbo, on!

266
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,733
 Ryo-san!

267
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Oh no! He's chasing us with his bike!

268
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I won't let him to catch me!

269
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I'll get you if you let me!

270
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,564
 Are you serious?

271
00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:59,796
 I won't let you get away!

272
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:15,000
 You bastard!

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Alright, it's my turn!

274
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:21,133
 Missile Jump!

275
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Damn! It's a shortcut!

276
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:53,749
 Oh no! I made a wrong turn!

277
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,280
 Ryo-san, what are you doing?

278
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,530
 Damn!

279
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,107
 What are you doing, Ryo-san?

280
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:30,132
I am on a chase

281
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Wait for me!

282
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 He's still chasing us!

283
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,404
 Hurry up!

284
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:46,429
 He's so stubborn!

285
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Don't underestimate me!

286
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:03,537
 He's chasing us at 80 km per hour!

287
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:04,916
 Hurry up!

288
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:15,054
 Move, you idiot!

289
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,562
 Looks like he finally gave up.

290
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:36,991
 No way!

291
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Wait for me, you bastard!

292
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,585
 He's a monster!

293
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:14,000
 He's not following us anymore.

294
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 You did it, Ken-chan.

295
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 What do you mean?

296
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:28,330
 Damn! It's an exit!

297
00:21:51,294 --> 00:21:53,387
 The culprit has been arrested, Ryo-san.

298
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,319
 Well done!

299
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:57,950
 You bastard!

300
00:21:57,975 --> 00:22:00,975
 I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

301
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:04,601
 Give me back my takoyaki!

302
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:08,756
 It's takoyaki, takoyaki!

303
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:10,781
 Give me back my takoyaki!

304
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:21,155
 You did it, Ryo-chan.

305
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 It's been eight years since the culprit was arrested.

306
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Congratulations!

307
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Well, it's because Nowaru Taka has been hiding his takoyaki for a while.

308
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Nowaru Taka hides his takoyaki, right?

309
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 It doesn't suit you, Ryo-chan.

310
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Ryo-san!

311
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Hey, Jumpei.

312
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Are your legs okay now?

313
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,530
 This isn't a big deal!

314
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:46,123
 Ryo-san, I'm going to win the game this time!

315
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,491
 Yeah, yeah.

316
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:50,000
 You should practice hard, Jumpei.

317
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:54,694
 Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything yet.

318
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:56,451
 Oh, right.

319
00:22:56,717 --> 00:23:00,397
 I heard that the driver's license was a two-month traffic violation.

320
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:04,795
 This is probably a special award and a gold medal.

321
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,000
 A gold medal!

322
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 I did it!

323
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,248
 I'm going to be saved this month!

324
00:23:09,358 --> 00:23:11,975
 Are you ready?

325
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Huh?

326
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Yes!

327
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 I'm here to arrest Kameyari's excellent police officer, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

328
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:28,000
 You're going to give me a gold medal, right?

329
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:30,163
 Idiot!

330
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:34,122
 Look outside!

331
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:39,630
 Ryo-tsu!

332
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:43,000
 I heard that you caused trouble to your neighbors again.

333
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,847
 I'll pay you back next month!

334
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:50,000
 No way!

335
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Please forgive me!

336
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:54,025
 Please!
