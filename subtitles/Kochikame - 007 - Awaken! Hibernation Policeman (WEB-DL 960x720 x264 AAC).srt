1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Wake Up! Civilian Police!

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 The fire in the sky in Atlanta is about to go out.

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 See you next year at Shidori.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 The Olympics are almost over.

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Hmm.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 But it's not enough.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Not enough?

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 The amount of medals?

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 No.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 When it comes to the Olympics, there must be something.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 The Olympics?

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Minami Haru from the Tokyo Olympics was good, wasn't she?

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 No.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 There must be something more impactful.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Yeah.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 The one where a woman puts powder on her face.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 That's compact.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Hmm.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I can't remember.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Huh?

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 That's right.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 It's a cicada.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 It has something to do with cicadas.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 A cicada?

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 The one that's crying right now is an oil cicada, right?

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 It's not an oil cicada.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Then is it a cicada?

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Huh?

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 It's getting closer.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Is there anything else?

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Yeah.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 The one that's crying right now.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Huh?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Is it a cicada that can't cry?

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 No, it's not.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 It's a sunflower.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Huh?

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 A sunflower?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I see.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I forgot about it.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 It's not impossible.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 It's the same as the Olympics.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 It's only once every four years.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 It's already been four years since then.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 What are you talking about?

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 There's someone called Higurashi working here.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Huh?

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I don't know such a person.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Me neither.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I don't know that you've started working here recently.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I guess so.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I think the last time he came here was four years ago.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 It was the year of the Barcelona Olympics.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Does that mean he's been working here for four years?

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Higurashi is a very naughty man.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 He's been resting since he was a kid.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 He only came here for three days a month.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 As time went by,

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 he only came here once every four years.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Once every four years?

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Yeah.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 That's why he's called the Olympic man.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I can't believe it.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 There's a man who's more naughty than Ryo-chan.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 He's not good with his head.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Higurashi has a special ability.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 A special ability?

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 You'll see when you bring him here.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 What?

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I won't do it.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 You're the only one who knows about Higurashi.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Get out of here!

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Sorry to keep you waiting.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Yes, sir.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 What?

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Senpai, you just woke me up.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Why do you need such heavy equipment?

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 You'll know when you hear it.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Did Higurashi live in the same dormitory as Senpai?

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I think it was this room.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Senpai, it's a storage room.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 This isn't a storage room.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 It's where people live.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 It's here.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 It's here.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 It's here.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 It's so rusty.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Nakagawa, open the door.

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Yes, sir.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Get out of the way, Nakagawa!

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Hey, Higurashi!

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Are you there?

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Yes, sir.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 It's not a place where people live.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 It's been abandoned for four years.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 But you can't see anything in the dark.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Nakagawa, open the window.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Yes, sir.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Ouch!

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 There's something stuck in my face!

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Is it a spider?

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 What are you doing?

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 The spider is scary.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Can't you see anything?

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 There's a bunch of spiderwebs.

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 It's so bright.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Give me my sunglasses.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 You're so annoying.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Give them to me.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Here you go.

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Thank you.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Every time I wake him up, he reacts like Dracula.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Is that voice Ryo-tsu?

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 That's right.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 I'm here to pick you up.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 What?

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 It's still summer in Heisei.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 No, I slept a little, so isn't it autumn?

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 It's been a long time.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 It's been eight years in Heisei this year.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 You're stupid.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Then what happened to the Japanese Shinto that was booming?

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 It's gone a long time ago.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 What?

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 What about the Japanese Shinto that was booming?

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Some of them went out and made another tower.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So the prime minister is not Miyazawa?

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Miyazawa?

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 By the way, it was like that four years ago.

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 While you were asleep, you changed to Hosokawa, Hada, and Murayama.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Now you're Hashimoto.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Did I change that much?

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Even the governor is in Aoshima.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 You shouldn't think of me like that.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 You're going to say that the governor of Osaka will knock on Yokoyama.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 You got it right.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Really?

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Then what about Wakahana and Takahana?

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Then I changed to Wakano Hana and Takano Hana.

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Onii-chan is in Ozeki, and my brother is in Yokozuna.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Did the world change that much?

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 It's like Urasima Taro.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Ryotsu, who is that young man?

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Nakagawa, who has become the head of the police station since this year.

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 More importantly, don't sleep forever and wake up!

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Don't make such a big noise.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 It will sound loud.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 First, I'm hungry.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 No, I can't do it.

153
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Please help me.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 This refrigerator is broken.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 I bought it when I was sleeping.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 I can't eat rice balls and bread.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Yes, it's a mess.

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 What about milk?

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 It's no good.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 It's heavy.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 What?

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It's cheese.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Lucky.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I can do this.

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 How about you?

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 It's okay.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 He's a shy guy.

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Then I'll watch TV until I finish eating.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 What?

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 It's good to watch while sleeping.

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Next, I need to take a bath.

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Ryotsu, I'm sorry, but can you take me to the home bath?

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Where is there a bath in this room?

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Is the washing machine a bath?

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Please put on the sheets and pillowcases.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 I'll wash them with you.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Please turn the water tank upside down.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 It's the best way to turn the water tank upside down.

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 It feels so good.

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 It's the best place.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Change into this.

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 I'm sorry, but please spread it out.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 He's a troublesome guy.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Are you okay?

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I'm sleepy because I'm tired.

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 You're sleeping too much.

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Is that so?

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 I'm sorry.

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Are you okay?

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 When did you build a staircase here?

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 It's been here for a long time.

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Did you forget it?

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 It feels like it fell four years ago.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 It fell eight years ago and twelve years ago.

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 It's decided.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 What?

197
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Didn't you come in a car?

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I walked for 15 minutes.

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Let's go.

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 It's boring. Let's go in my car.

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Did you have a car?

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 It's a new car.

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 It's a new car.

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 I bought it 20 years ago.

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 It's a new car because I've only driven it twice.

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Two times in 20 years?

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Isn't it better to take a taxi?

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 It's a hassle to pick it up.

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It's scary that the meter is only three kilometers away.

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I've never been out of town.

211
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Let's go.

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 The engine started.

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 What's next?

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I'll step on the clutch and put the shift lever in.

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 That's right.

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I'll put the clutch in.

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 It's amazing to drive a new car in three seconds.

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 It's amazing.

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 But I woke up.

220
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Next Episode

221
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 I brought the chief.

222
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Thank you.

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 I'm tired from walking for a long time.

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 I'm sleepy.

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 You're still the same old Guttala.

226
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 You're the same old Guttala.

227
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 You're a big help.

228
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Get up.

229
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 It's daytime.

230
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 I'm awake.

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Say hello to the chief.

232
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,500
 Director, it's been a while.

233
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,800
 Are you still the director?

234
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,300
 Thank you for your help.

235
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,800
 I'm Terai, who resigned three years ago.

236
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,700
 Hi, I'm Higurashi.

237
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,600
 Nice to meet you.

238
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,200
 I'm a fan of Risa Miyazawa.

239
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,400
 I bought a very popular photo book called YONTAFE the other day.

240
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,300
 Let's look at it together next time.

241
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,800
 Okay.

242
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,900
 There's no one who's going to talk about that kind of photo book.

243
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,800
 Next is...

244
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
 I'm home.

245
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,400
 Hey, Reiko, let me introduce you.

246
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,800
 Oh, this is the man from the rumor.

247
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
 Hi, I'm Higurashi.

248
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
 People call me that Higurashi.

249
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
 Nice to meet you.

250
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,400
 I'm Reiko Akimoto.

251
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
 Oh, Higurashi has completely awakened.

252
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,200
 You're weak against women.

253
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,800
 I can feel it.

254
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,000
 What's going on?

255
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,800
 The case is calling me.

256
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,400
 W-What's going on?

257
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,900
 It's finally time for Higurashi to show his true colors.

258
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,800
 Terai, bring me the second case file.

259
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 Y-Yes, sir!

260
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,200
 First, an unknown man.

261
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
 I can see him.

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,600
 This man works at a construction site in Yamagata City in the northeast.

263
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,400
 Terai, contact the head office immediately.

264
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,600
 Y-Yes, sir!

265
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,000
 This is Higurashi, the head of the Kameyari Park.

266
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,800
 He has awakened.

267
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,200
 The second case is a gem.

268
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,600
 What's going on?

269
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,600
 Higurashi has awakened.

270
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,200
 The second case is a gem thief.

271
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,600
 The criminal is hiding in a mansion in Sumida River, called Nakayama.

272
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,200
 The Yamanawa family of the Oka family is heading to Fukagawa's apartment.

273
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,800
 The next family is heading to Asakusa Kaminari-mon.

274
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,200
 That's amazing.

275
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,000
 It's his ability to invest.

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,800
 Every time Higurashi wakes up, he solves unsolved cases like this.

277
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
 Next!

278
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
 Next!

279
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
 Next!

280
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
 Next!

281
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
 Next!

282
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
 Next!

283
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,600
 Ah, I'm tired. I'm getting sleepy.

284
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
 Idiot!

285
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,400
 I haven't worked for four years yet!

286
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
 Reiko, rub my shoulders.

287
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
 What?

288
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,600
 Good work.

289
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
 Higurashi-san, you have amazing abilities.

290
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Good.

291
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,000
 Ryotsu, take the camera.

292
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Okay.

293
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
 I can see it. I can see it.

294
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
 What are you doing?

295
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
 I'm burning it.

296
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,600
 Higurashi can show the case that will happen within 24 hours.

297
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,000
 He can do that?

298
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 What is it?

299
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 What is it?

300
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 What is it showing?

301
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 It's a underwear thief!

302
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 There are a lot of injuries in the ship recently.

303
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 But I don't know who the culprit is in this photo.

304
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 He looks very cool when he gets burnt and becomes a shadow.

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Let's take a picture again.

306
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Four in a row. That's amazing.

307
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Every year, there's a new trick.

308
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Huh? What's that? A dog?

309
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 It's a dog that's often seen in patrols.

310
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Alright, let's go!

311
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Yeah!

312
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 This house...

313
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 What's this?

314
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 It's the house that's often seen in patrols.

315
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 It's the house that's often seen in patrols.

316
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 It's the house that's often seen in patrols.

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 The owner of this house is a woman that Amura hates.

318
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Amura? What's that?

319
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 What's that?

320
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Amura is the fashion lover of the top idol, Amuro Nanae.

321
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 What?

322
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Isn't the top idol Risa Miyazawa?

323
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Risa-chan has lost weight and is charging now.

324
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 No way...

325
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Don't get depressed, Higurashi.

326
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Let's go.

327
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Why is my Taku-chan the culprit?

328
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 You're the ones who can't arrest the culprit, so why are you so stubborn?

329
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 What?

330
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 W-What's this?

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Higurashi also has the ability to move.

332
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 It's a hole.

333
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 It's a stolen underwear.

334
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 N-No way...

335
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Higurashi-san, you did it.

336
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 I can feel it again.

337
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Nakagawa, it's the camera.

338
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Yes.

339
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Is it a bank robbery this time?

340
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 I remember this bank.

341
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 It's the bank in front of the station.

342
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Look, the watch is also on.

343
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 35 minutes ago...

344
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 There's only 10 minutes left.

345
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 There's only 10 minutes left.

346
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Okay, Reiko.

347
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 I'll go straight to the bank.

348
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 I'll leave this to you.

349
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Roger.

350
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Hurry, Nakagawa.

351
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Yes.

352
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 To be continued...

353
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Everyone, raise your hands!

354
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Be proud and give out the money!

355
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Welcome!

356
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It's a gorilla!

357
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 What gorilla?

358
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 You bastard!

359
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Senpai!

360
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Damn it, you're in my way.

361
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I'll kill you!

362
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 W-What?

363
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Now!

364
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Damn it!

365
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 It's a handkerchief!

366
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Hey, Higurashi!

367
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Put your handkerchief on it!

368
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 You're sleeping, you bastard!

369
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Everyone did a good job.

370
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 But Higurashi-san, you really have amazing abilities.

371
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I understand why you can't do it.

372
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 What about you, Higurashi?

373
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Huh?

374
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I've been here before.

375
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I'm tired.

376
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I can't do it anymore.

377
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 If you can't do the whole race,

378
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 just the main race is fine.

379
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Tell me how many you can do.

380
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 What are you doing, Ryotsu?

381
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Let's go!

382
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Chief!

383
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 I was just trying to get Higurashi to solve another case.

384
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 There are two cases?

385
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Did you hear that?

386
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Chief!

387
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Oh, I can feel it.

388
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I can feel it.

389
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Where's the horse?

390
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 What number is it?

391
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Idiot!

392
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 I knew it!

393
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Huh?

394
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Hey!

395
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I-I'm being pulled by a truck!

396
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Oh, this is Ryotsu.

397
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 It's an ominous picture.

398
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Hey, Higurashi!

399
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Why did you take a picture like this?

400
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 I don't know.

401
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I just took a picture.

402
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 It's not a quick death.

403
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 You might be saved by a truck.

404
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 I'm not a follower.

405
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I'm not going to be pulled by a truck.

406
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Ryotsu, don't worry.

407
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 There's a mistake.

408
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 My abilities are perfect and I'm confident,

409
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 but I don't think I can get away with a hundred million.

410
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Are you encouraging me?

411
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Are you proud of me?

412
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Which one is it?

413
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I definitely don't believe it.

414
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 You have a straight face when you say that.

415
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 I'm not joking.

416
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Senior!

417
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 As long as you look at the picture, it's outside.

418
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 It's safe if you don't go out for 24 hours.

419
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Shut up!

420
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 I'm scared of the train.

421
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Can the police do it?

422
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 I definitely don't believe it!

423
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Senior!

424
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Ryotsu, don't do it!

425
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Shut up!

426
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Don't worry about me!

427
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I told you it's dangerous to go out!

428
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Get out of here!

429
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Senior!

430
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Ryotsu!

431
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Are you okay, Senior?

432
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 It hurts.

433
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 So this picture is the moment you hit the truck that was parked by you?

434
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Hey, Higurashi!

435
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 You should be sleeping for a million years!

436
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Don't wake up!

437
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Idiot!

438
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 I'll do that.

439
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Chief, before that...

440
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Oh, it's the usual ceremony.

441
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Reigo-kun,

442
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 10 servings of Tendon,

443
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 10 servings of Una-don,

444
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 20 servings of Yakiniku,

445
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 and 10 servings of Sushi.

446
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Please order.

447
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 What?

448
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 10 servings of Tendon

449
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Here it is.

450
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Everyone, please bring it to the back room.

451
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Okay.

452
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 The food is really good.

453
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 I've been sleeping for four years, so I've been eating a lot.

454
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 It looks like a bear before it's born.

455
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 See you later.

456
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 How can he gain so much weight?

457
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 He looks like a different person.

458
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Well, I'll see you in four years.

459
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Shut up!

460
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Go home and sleep!

461
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Bye.

462
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 See you tomorrow.

463
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Good night.

464
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 When we meet next time, let's meet in 2000.

465
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 I can't wait for the next Olympics.

466
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 I'm not kidding!

467
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Try to be like me when I go to wake you up.

468
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 You can say that.

469
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Kachidoki Bridge

470
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Everyone, do you know Kachidoki Bridge?

471
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 When a big ship comes, the bridge breaks in two

472
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 and goes up.

473
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Unfortunately, it's not open now,

474
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 but this bridge is a nostalgic memory of my childhood.

475
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Next time, open Kachidoki Bridge.

476
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Thank you.

477
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Let's smile anytime

478
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 No matter what happens

479
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Smile cutely

480
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 You can go out with a face that doesn't matter

481
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Hey, smile at me

482
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 You're not bad

483
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Hey, smile at me

484
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 You're still in good shape

485
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Smile at me anytime

486
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 A woman with a dark skin is not beautiful

487
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 You should smile right away

488
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 If you're not a woman
