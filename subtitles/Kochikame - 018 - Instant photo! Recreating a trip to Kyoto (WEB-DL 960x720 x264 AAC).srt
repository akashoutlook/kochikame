 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Everybody can do!

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I don't want to say it even if it sticks out a little.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I want to give up the noisy.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 A strong and high-pitched voice.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Gekisha! Recreation of Kyoto Travel

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Do you know him?

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Yes.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 He's the security guard at the station over there, right?

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 He's good. He's young.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 The two of them are here again.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Good morning, Ryo-chan.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Good morning.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I think the driver is missing.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I don't have time to answer.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Ryo-san.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 It's a newspaper article published by Aoshingo.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 The other day, I went to the principal's office.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 By the way, my hair is broken.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I'll ask for a little softer hair from now on.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 What are you doing?

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I'm going to take the newspaper that we made with all our might.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Don-Kan! Yabanchin!

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 You're going too far, Ryo-san.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 No, it's a valid recycling.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Carbohydrate!

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Bacteria, viruses, etc.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Shut up!

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 If you have time to make such a useless newspaper,

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 take one of the illegal vaccines.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 You, drug thief!

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 The Katsushika Women's Police Department is disbanded!

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Announcement of the result of the investigation!

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 The number one man who doesn't want to get married, Ryo Tsukan-kichi!

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 What?

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 The number one man who doesn't want to get married, Ryo Tsukan-kichi!

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 The number one man who doesn't want to date, Ryo Tsukan-kichi!

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Why?

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 The worst man, number one!

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 The animal man, number one!

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 The man who can't be saved, etc.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 The top 17 in the worst ranking!

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 No. 1!

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Ryo Tsukan-kichi has been in the top 6 years in a row!

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Congratulations!

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Please look forward to the results of this survey.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Stop the survey!

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Stop it, Ryo Tsukan-kichi!

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 By the way, the number one man who was hugged was Mr. Nakagawa.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 The number one man who was hugged by my brother was Mr. Terai.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Really?

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Damn it!

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I'm so proud of you.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 The wall for the interview.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 The man who can't be saved, Ryo Tsukan-kichi!

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 The wall for the interview.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 The wall for the interview.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I'll go to Patron.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 The wall for the interview.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 That's right.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 That's right.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Anyway, there are no illegal shots.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Do you remember?

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Senpai, what are you going to do?

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I'm going to help you with the interview.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I'm going to make you stupid and show you everything about me.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Here, there, and here.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And here, too.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 If you do that, you'll be the worst man, senpai.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 That's right.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 You don't understand my feelings.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Senpai.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I'm going to show you everything about me.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Show me.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 What?

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Hurry up. They're coming.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Well, I'm going to go.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Yes, cheese.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Damn it! Don't underestimate me.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I don't have to worry about falling anymore.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I have to think about something.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Thank you for your cooperation.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 You're welcome.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Are you done with the interview?

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Yes.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Mr. Nakagawa, Mr. Deiko, thank you for coming.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Here's an important camera.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Don't forget it.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 That's not ours.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 What?

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Whose camera is that?

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Ohara director, thank you for your hard work.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Don't tell me the director...

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Oh, that's my camera, Ryo.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Did you forget about it?

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 I was looking for it.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Senpai.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Ryo, what are you going to do?

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 I'm going to take a break.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 I'll leave the rest to you.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Mr. Nakagawa, Mr. Deiko.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 It's going to be a long time.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 It's only five or ten years.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Ryo-tsu!

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Ryo-tsu, are you there?

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Director, what's wrong?

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Ryo-tsu, where are you going?

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 I'm going to patrol.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 You idiot!

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Go wherever you want.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Don't ever show your face again.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 You're fired.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I don't need an arrogant person like you.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 No, director.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 This is a deep conversation.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Director, it's a joke, right?

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 It's not a joke.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 You're fired.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 No way.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Nakagawa, explain to Ryo-tsu.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Goodbye.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Nakagawa, Reiko.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 You betrayed me.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Terai.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Hey, open it.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 If you open it and break it,

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 what will happen if you don't make me angry?

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 This cake that Reiko made is delicious.

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 If you like, there are still more.

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Ryo-san.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Let's take a break.

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Let's go home.

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Wait for me.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I'll definitely pay you next time.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 If you're fired, the bonus is...

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Nakagawa, Reiko.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Help me.

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Oh, you're here, Ryo-tsu.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 That's my camera.

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Give it back.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 This is a good camera.

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 It's a Micon F50.

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I wanted it too.

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 As expected, you have a good eye.

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 It's a camera I'm not used to.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I don't know how to use it,

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 but I forgot to bring it.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Is that so?

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 I'm glad.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I thought it was a mistake,

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 but I forgot it in the delivery room.

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 If you find out, you'll be in trouble.

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Will that do?

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Give it back to Genzo.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Genzo is a little...

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Shut up, Ryo-tsu.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 It's a joke, isn't it?

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 It's not a joke.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 You're fired.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Wait a minute.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Where are you going to put it?

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 It's a camera in the shopping district.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 No, not there.

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 In this day and age,

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 even if you take a 20-yen print,

169
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 you're underestimating consumers.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Is there a cheaper store?

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Yes.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 I know a store with a 0-yen print.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Don't lie.

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Will it be a deal with 0 yen?

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 It will.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 A 24-priced Genzo is 600 yen.

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 The highest price is

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 about 30% of 180 yen.

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Even if you take a 40%

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 of human rights,

181
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 about 30% of 180 yen

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 will be used as a profit.

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I understand.

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I'll give you that photo tomorrow

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 at the bus station.

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 I'll order it by 10 o'clock in the morning.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Leave it to me.

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I'll be waiting for you tomorrow.

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 It's not that difficult

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 to use a Genzo kit like this.

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Just cut the part

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 where I'm in the picture.

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Excuse me.

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Please take the ball.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 What are you doing, you brat?

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I failed.

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Anyway, my photo

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 disappeared, so it's a success.

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 But what are you going to do

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 with the photo?

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Did you say it was in Kyoto?

202
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 What?

203
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 In the next newspaper,

204
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 you said you were going to post a photo

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 of the Kyoto trip to Ohara.

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Really?

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I did.

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 I can imagine.

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Anyway,

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 I took a lot of pictures

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 without people in Kyoto.

212
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 I don't remember what I took.

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I'll use a copy of the picture.

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 I wonder if it will work.

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 It's okay.

216
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 This is Kamewari Park.

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Ryotsu, are you there?

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Yes, what is it?

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Ryotsu?

220
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I forgot to tell you,

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 but please print it carefully.

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 I took it with my best friend Maiko.

223
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Did you take it?

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 A bonus picture was taken.

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 It may be in the newspaper.

226
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 It's an important picture.

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Please print it carefully.

228
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Yes, please leave it to me.

229
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 I'm the head.

230
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I'm the head.

231
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I won't let you cheat.

232
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 If you don't do it well,

233
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 you'll be ruined soon.

234
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 It's your fault.

235
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I have nothing to do with it.

236
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 This is what happened

237
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 because you took my picture.

238
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 But you...

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 When I become the head,

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 you will be the same.

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 It was a short life.

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I understand.

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Boss!

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Let's go to Kyoto.

245
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 I'm working.

246
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 If you want to get off,

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 go ahead.

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Do you remember the picture

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 you took with the chief?

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 It's from last week.

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Please make it clear.

252
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Yes, sir.

253
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 How is it?

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 I sent all the data

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 about the chief.

256
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 All that's left is the bag.

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 That's right.

258
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I think it was

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 a brown line and a tie.

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Yes, sir.

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 That's it.

262
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 What's the color?

263
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 It's clear.

264
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 The color is...

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 That's it.

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Let's go.

267
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Tomorrow,

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 our staff will be waiting.

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I'm sure it will work.

270
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 We're finally here.

271
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Chief!

272
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Chief!

273
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 When did you get here?

274
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Sir.

275
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 It's a doll

276
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 I made with the data

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 you sent me.

278
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 A doll?

279
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 It would be perfect

280
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 if you lied to me.

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 The color

282
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 and the touch of your skin

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 are perfect.

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 It's a form latex

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I use for special effects.

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 You can't see it unless you're close.

287
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Look at this face.

288
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 The chief gets nervous

289
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 when he sees this face.

290
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 But why did you make this?

291
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Don't listen to him.

292
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 But...

293
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Sir,

294
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 we have a staff

295
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 who will help us.

296
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Let's go!

297
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Let's go!

298
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Are they all here?

299
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Yes.

300
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Sir.

301
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I think this is

302
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Mr. Maiko.

303
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Welcome.

304
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 It's been a week.

305
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Oh, it's you.

306
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 All right. Let's start shooting.

307
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 What do you think?

308
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 This is what

309
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 a ray looks like.

310
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 All right.

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Let's start shooting.

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Here we go.

313
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Next,

314
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Kamogawa.

315
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Recently,

316
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 our special effects staff

317
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 has been working on

318
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 countermeasures for both

319
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 the ray and the ray.

320
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Are you going to shoot a movie?

321
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Yes.

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 I think we can go home

323
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 before it's too late.

324
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Thank you for waiting.

325
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Enjoy your meal.

326
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 I thought it was a movie,

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 but there's even a food truck.

328
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 It's common in America.

329
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 This is delicious.

330
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Yes. He used to work at Sheraton in Hong Kong.

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 He used to work as a general manager.

332
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 I pulled him out.

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Where should we put the chief?

334
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 No.

335
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Chief Ohara took a picture of a turtle,

336
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 so he won't go into the river.

337
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Hurry up and say that.

338
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 I don't have a chief.

339
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I think the turtle is flying.

340
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It's a turtle. Let the turtle fly.

341
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Yes.

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 What's wrong?

343
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 I think he's drowning.

344
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 He's drowning.

345
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 I thought it was a turtle.

346
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 It's a turtle.

347
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 It's a turtle.

348
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 It's impossible.

349
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 I don't think it was a turtle.

350
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Hurry up.

351
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Don't you remember clearly?

352
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 If you attack so much,

353
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 you won't remember what you remember.

354
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 It's love.

355
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 It's love.

356
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 There are three loves.

357
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Get ready.

358
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 How is it?

359
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Yes. It seems to be okay.

360
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 All right.

361
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Let the rain fall.

362
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 It's the wind.

363
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 The chief flew.

364
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 All right. One more.

365
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 It's easy.

366
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Excuse me.

367
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Don't move.

368
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Push the shutter.

369
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 At that time,

370
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 the cherry blossoms in the back were in full bloom.

371
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Make the cherry blossoms in full bloom.

372
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Yes.

373
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 There are 50 people on the old man's tour.

374
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 50 people on the old man's tour.

375
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Yes.

376
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 It's a sunset.

377
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 It's a sunset.

378
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 It's a sunset.

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 It was a sunset.

380
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 It was a sunset.

381
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Don't say that.

382
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Excuse me.

383
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Can you see the sunset?

384
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 I'm afraid you can't see it in this darkness.

385
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Let's do something.

386
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 This is it! This is the sunset of that day!

387
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Hurry up and turn off the shutter!

388
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Yes.

389
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 We managed to finish it safely.

390
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Yeah.

391
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 You did a great job too.

392
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Good job!

393
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 You didn't have to kick anything off.

394
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Shut up!

395
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 I'm sorry.

396
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I'm sorry.

397
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 I'm sorry.

398
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 I'm sorry.

399
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 I'm sorry.

400
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I'm sorry.

401
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I'm sorry.

402
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I'm sorry.

403
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I'm sorry.

404
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 I'm sorry.

405
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Shut up!

406
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Even though it's a doll, if you think there are two of them, you'll be disappointed.

407
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 12th Line, No. 21, 34th Street, No. 304, Nozomi Street, Tokyo.

408
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 We managed to make it to the last bullet train.

409
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 We'll be at Tokyo Station by 12 o'clock.

410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 When we get home, we'll be in a good mood.

411
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 What is it?

412
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 There's another picture.

413
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 What?

414
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 I forgot the most important picture of the Buddhist temple.

415
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Wait, wait, wait!

416
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Yes, yes.

417
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 I understand.

418
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 It's no good.

419
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 The movie crew is about to leave for Alaska.

420
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Where's the helicopter?

421
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 The engine is broken.

422
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 It's in Tachiojo in Nagoya.

423
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 It won't be able to fly for a couple of hours.

424
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Darn it.

425
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 I guess I have no choice but to take a picture of it.

426
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Senpai!

427
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Are you there?

428
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Darn it.

429
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 How much longer are you going to make me suffer?

430
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Senpai!

431
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Are you okay?

432
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Open it!

433
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Open it!

434
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Show me the Buddha statue!

435
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Open it!

436
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Hey!

437
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 This Buddha statue looks like a Buddha statue.

438
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 This isn't just a Buddha statue.

439
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 It was released once every 1,000 years for only three minutes.

440
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 It's a very high-class Buddha statue.

441
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Show me the Buddha statue!

442
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 What do you want at this hour?

443
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Show me this Buddha statue!

444
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I only show it once every 1,000 years.

445
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Don't say such things!

446
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 I'm going to take a punishment!

447
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Are you okay?

448
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Darn it.

449
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Darn it!

450
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 If this happens, I'm going to beat you up!

451
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Darn it!

452
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Senpai, this is bad.

453
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 This is illegal.

454
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Is this the time to say that?

455
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Who's there?

456
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Who's there?

457
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Senpai!

458
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Let's run away!

459
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Anyway, let's run away!

460
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 It's impossible to keep the guards in check.

461
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Do you want us to give up after coming all this way?

462
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 No.

463
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 But the next time I see you, it's after 1,000 years.

464
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Did you come up with a good idea?

465
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 I see.

466
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I have an idea.

467
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Yes.

468
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 What is it?

469
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Huh?

470
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Huh?

471
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 What is it?

472
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 What is it?

473
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 What is it?

474
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 What is it?

475
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 What is it?

476
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 What is it?

477
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 What is it?

478
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 What is it?

479
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 What is it?

480
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 What is it?

481
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 What is it?

482
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 What is it?

483
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 What is it?

484
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 It's kidding.

485
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Yuck, why do we have to do such a thing?

486
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Awesome!

487
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 So you are the same.

488
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Sure?

489
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Time up!

490
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Come on, who's up?

491
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,200
 Let's take a picture!

492
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,240
 Yes. First, turn your back, put your body in front of you, and turn your face this way.

493
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,400
 The right arm goes from the back of the neck to the left cheek, and the finger goes into the mouth.

494
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,480
 It looks like this!

495
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,800
 If you look closely, you can see that only the thumb of the one leg with the front of the seat is standing.

496
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,680
 The left arm goes from the inside of the leg with the front of the seat to the nose.

497
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,920
 The right eye looks to the north, and the left eye looks to the south.

498
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,920
 Hurry up and take a picture!

499
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
 I'm going to take a picture.

500
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,480
 What are you doing?

501
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,400
 Ryo-chan won't come back.

502
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,480
 That's right.

503
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,600
 Ryo, is Ryo-tsu here?

504
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,320
 T-that's...

505
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,120
 What?

506
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,760
 Did you get the camera wrong?

507
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,200
 That's right.

508
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,200
 I put the film in, but I completely forgot that I put the camera in before I went out because it was heavy.

509
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,600
 Is that so?

510
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,520
 Chief!

511
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,280
 I did it!

512
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,880
 Chief, I took a picture.

513
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,840
 You're Ryo-tsu?

514
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,720
 Ryo-chan?

515
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,080
 Why are you dressed like that?

516
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,960
 Look, it's a picture of the chief.

517
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,200
 A picture?

518
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
 This is...

519
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,800
 There are two of us.

520
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,400
 What's going on?

521
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,880
 The pose and everything is exactly the same.

522
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,880
 But the details are a little different.

523
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
 What do you mean?

524
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,280
 You're up to something again, aren't you, Ryo-tsu?

525
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,880
 No, Chief!

526
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,680
 I did it!

527
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,880
 I took a decisive picture!

528
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,480
 Please look forward to the next O-Shingo!

529
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
 Damn you!

530
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
 This is bad!

531
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,480
 Now, let's hear the story slowly, Ryo-tsu.

532
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
 Chief, please wait!

533
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
 There's a deep reason for this!

534
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

535
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

536
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,880
 The food critic, Omaeda Chouhoro!

537
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,880
 I can't count the stores that were crushed by his ferocious criticism!

538
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,880
 The grudge of the food is terrible!

539
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
 Next is my opponent!

540
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,880
 Come at me!

541
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,880
 Next time, on Soba-ya's Reconstruction Plan!

542
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
 Looking forward to it!

543
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,880
 Let's fly, let's live

544
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
 Even if today

545
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,880
 is a rainy day

546
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,880
 Tomorrow will be sunny

547
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
 Bye-bye!

548
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
 Let's wave our hands

549
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,880
 Goodbye to the bad things

550
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
 Oh yeah

551
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 Let's live the way we want

552
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
 There's something good

553
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
 Outside the door

554
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,880
 The sun is calling

555
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
 To be continued
