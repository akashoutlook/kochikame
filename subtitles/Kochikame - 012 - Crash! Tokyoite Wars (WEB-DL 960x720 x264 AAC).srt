1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 The Battle of Edokkogase

2
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,000
 You're doing great, Junpei-kun, Kappei-kun!

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,400
 Oh, it's the girls from Nippon-tachi!

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
 You girls are doing great too!

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,200
 Yeah, leave it to us!

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,800
 There's a lot of Amikoshi, it's really lively!

7
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,200
 It's natural that the festival is lively, right?

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
 It's going to be more lively from now on!

9
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
 Oh, Reiko-san!

10
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
 The main event of the festival is from now on!

11
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
 There's a lot of Amikoshi!

12
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
 That's right!

13
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
 After competing with the shrines up ahead,

14
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
 we're going to decide who's going to be the main event of the festival!

15
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
 It's the main event of today's festival!

16
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 Oh, he's here!

17
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
 This way!

18
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
 You're late, Ryo-san!

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
 Sorry, sorry!

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
 I was so worried that you wouldn't come!

21
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
 It's true!

22
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,200
 After all, thanks to Ryo-san, our festival is three years in a row!

23
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,200
 Right now, Ryo-san seems to be the main event of Edokkogase!

24
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
 Is that so?

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
 That's right!

26
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
 Edokkogase of Edokkogase!

27
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
 Ryo-san, Edokkogase No.1!

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
 Super Edokkogase, Ryo-san!

29
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
 Yo!

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
 The best Edokkogase in the universe!

31
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
 It feels good when you're told the truth!

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
 That guy is Edokkogase?

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
 Huh?

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
 You're making me laugh!

35
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,200
 He seems to be happy that he's being teased!

36
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
 I can't say that he's the real Edokkogase!

37
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
 What?

38
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
 You're a face that can't be seen!

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
 Where are you from?

40
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,200
 This guy is the real Edokkogase in Edokkogase, Kin-san.

41
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
 He's a spy in our town!

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
 What did you say?

43
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,200
 Every year, every year, I can't let you big guys do it!

44
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
 You fake Edokkogase!

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
 I'll skin you!

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
 It's fun!

47
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,200
 Don't make me laugh!

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
 Yuriyo!

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
 Amazing!

50
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
 He's a guy with no manners!

51
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
 You're really an Edokkogase!

52
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
 You're the real Edokkogase!

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 I'm not a real Edokkogase!

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
 You're really an Edokkogase!

55
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,200
 You can't win over anyone!

56
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,200
 You have to look around from the top of the tree!

57
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
 This is the real Edokkogase!

58
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
 If you let me say it...

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
 Hey, Ryo-san!

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,200
 If you're an Edokkogase, you have to stand on the top of the tree!

61
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
 If you're sitting on the top of the tree,

62
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 you're a real Edokkogase!

63
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
 Yeah!

64
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
 You're a real Edokkogase!

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,200
 You're a real Edokkogase!

66
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
 So that's why you're here!

67
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
 This is a good idea!

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,200
 I don't know this guy, so I can't be an Edokkogase!

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
 I'm not going to stand on the top of the tree!

70
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
 I'm not an Edokkogase!

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
 What?

72
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
 This is the real Edokkogase!

73
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,200
 No, this is the real Edokkogase!

74
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
 This is the real Edokkogase!

75
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
 This is the real Edokkogase!

76
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
 This is the real Edokkogase!

77
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
 This is the real Edokkogase!

78
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
 Are you okay, Ryo-san?

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
 You're getting better at this!

80
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
 Ryo-san, you're getting better at this!

81
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
 That's right!

82
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
 We're going to win!

83
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
 Shut up!

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,200
 If that's the case, I have no choice.

85
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
 Let's go!

86
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
 Let's go!

87
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
 Let's go!

88
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
 We're going to lose!

89
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
 We're going to lose!

90
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
 We're going to lose!

91
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
 This is great!

92
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 We're going to lose!

93
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
 We're going to lose!

94
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
 We're going to lose!

95
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
 We're going to lose!

96
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
 That's dirty!

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
 Don't follow us!

98
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
 That's dirty!

99
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
 That's dirty!

100
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 You're running in front of us!

101
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
 Damn it!

102
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 You're beating us up!

103
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
 We're going to lose!

104
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
 Speed up!

105
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
 Don't run away!

106
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
 Hurry!

107
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
 En Blessed!

108
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
 We're the only ones left!

109
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
 We'll be the number 1 chance of你是场上的囚犯!

110
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
 I'll kill him, so you will die here with him.

111
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
 Here, take this!

112
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
 Idiot! Slow down!

113
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
 You'll crash into a ginger!

114
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
 You can't stop me now!

115
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
 I can't stop you!

116
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
 I forgot!

117
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,940
 The

118
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
 Damn you, idiot!

119
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
 Are you okay, Senior?

120
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
 Damn!

121
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
 I'll miss the four consecutive wins,

122
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
 I'll be scolded for breaking the shrine and the shrine maiden,

123
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
 I'll get wet in the mud!

124
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,200
 It's all because of that bastard!

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
 Damn!

126
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
 Damn it!

127
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
 It's all because of him!

128
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
 Do you want to get in this bath too?

129
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
 I'll do it myself!

130
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
 Senior!

131
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
 Get out of here!

132
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
 You can't get in!

133
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
 Get out of here!

134
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,200
 I don't feel like giving up at all!

135
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
 Damn it!

136
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
 Dad!

137
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
 I'm here!

138
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
 Well,

139
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
 Ryo-san, you're a fisherman, aren't you?

140
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
 I got one!

141
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,200
 It's 370 yen, so...

142
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
 Well...

143
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
 Dad!

144
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
 I don't need fishing today!

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
 What?

146
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
 I knew it!

147
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
 You're the best!

148
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
 I'll get you!

149
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,200
 I'm the best!

150
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
 Senior, what was that scream?

151
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
 Scream?

152
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
 I didn't hear a scream.

153
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 It's your imagination, right?

154
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
 But...

155
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
 It's your imagination!

156
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
 Um...

157
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,200
 Senior, aren't you going to get in the first bath?

158
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
 What?

159
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,200
 I was just thinking about getting in right now.

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
 Oh, this way too!

161
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
 Don't shake it!

162
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
 The water is going to leak!

163
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
 That's right!

164
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
 Nakagawa!

165
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
 Help me with the boilers!

166
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,200
 If it's this wet, I'll catch a cold!

167
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
 What?

168
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
 You're going to raise the temperature?

169
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
 Yeah, it's still wet.

170
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
 That's strange.

171
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
 I thought it was going to be pretty hot.

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,200
 It seems to have warmed up a little.

173
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
 If it warms up to this point,

174
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
 I'll make you laugh.

175
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
 It's still very wet.

176
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
 Nakagawa!

177
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
 It's not warming up at all!

178
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,200
 You have to warm it up more!

179
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
 It's still wet?

180
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
 It's hot!

181
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
 It's over 60 degrees!

182
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
 It's not the temperature that humans can enter!

183
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
 I said it's wet, so it's wet!

184
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
 I don't know if it's 60 degrees or something.

185
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
 It's still like ice water in Edo.

186
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
 Hurry up and go back to the boilers!

187
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
 I understand.

188
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
 It's unfair!

189
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
 I'm going to get a nosebleed!

190
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
 Nakagawa, do something!

191
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
 Y-Yes!

192
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
 Who are you?!

193
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
 This is the enamel paste that is used in the Nakagawa ice iron mine.

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,200
 At a stretch of 10,000 degrees, this can be heated up!

195
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
 I see...

196
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 This bubble is good.

197
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,200
 After all, if I don't see the water boiling like this, I don't feel like I'm in the bath.

198
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
 You bastard.

199
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
 Don't make a fuss just because the water is boiling.

200
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,200
 It's still wet.

201
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
 It's dangerous!

202
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
 Senpai!

203
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
 Senpai!

204
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
 Senpai!

205
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
 Senpai!

206
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 Are you okay?

207
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,200
 If it didn't explode, I wouldn't be an Edo girl.

208
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,200
 I'm not that bad.

209
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
 I'm home!

210
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
 Ryo-chan, are you awake?

211
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
 No, not yet.

212
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
 I bought sushi for you.

213
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
 What? Sushi?

214
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
 Senpai, are you awake?

215
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
 Yes, I woke up because of the word sushi.

216
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
 Edo girls don't have eyes for sushi.

217
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
 As expected of Senpai. You're so mean.

218
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,200
 It doesn't matter, but you should wear your pants before eating.

219
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
 There's no delicacy.

220
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,200
 There's no such word in my dictionary.

221
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
 Let's eat!

222
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
 What's wrong, Senpai?

223
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
 What's this sushi?

224
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,200
 It's an avocado roll.

225
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
 Avocado?

226
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,200
 It's a sushi from the west coast of America.

227
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,200
 It's healthy and very popular.

228
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
 The west coast of America?

229
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
 Healthy?

230
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
 Are you kidding me?

231
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
 Do you know why they call sushi Edo-mae?

232
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
 Edo-mae.

233
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
 In other words, it's made of fish caught in the Tokyo Bay.

234
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
 That's why it's called Edo-mae sushi.

235
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
 This is not real sushi.

236
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
 What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

237
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
 It's not that, Senpai.

238
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,200
 You bought it for Senpai.

239
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
 That's right.

240
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,200
 I can't eat sushi other than Edo-mae sushi.

241
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,200
 Then let me eat what the real Edo-mae sushi is.

242
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,200
 What's the difference between the real Edo-mae sushi and the sushi I bought?

243
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,200
 If I don't compare them, I can't understand Ryo-chan's attitude.

244
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
 Edo-mae Sushi

245
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
 I got it.

246
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
 You can take it with you.

247
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
 Take it with you.

248
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
 What kind of Edo-mae sushi do you want me to eat?

249
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
 I'm looking forward to it.

250
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
 It's the first time Senpai is treating me.

251
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
 Damn it.

252
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
 I can't believe it.

253
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
 Let's go over there.

254
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,200
 Senpai, how far are you going?

255
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
 Just a little further.

256
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,200
 It's not the sushi restaurant over there, is it?

257
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,200
 I thought it was someone else, but it's the real Edo-mae sushi.

258
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
 You're from Hiromaru!

259
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 What?

260
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
 Ryo-chan's fighting partner?

261
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
 Was it a sushi restaurant?

262
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,200
 It's been 500 years since I went to Edo-mae sushi.

263
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
 When Toyotomi Hideyoshi was still in Hiriyoshi-maru,

264
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
 I often went there.

265
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
 Tokugawa Ieyasu-ko also went there.

266
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,200
 It's a very important sushi restaurant.

267
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
 Let's go, Reiko Nakagawa.

268
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,200
 If you fight with someone like this, your brain will rot.

269
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
 Hey, hey.

270
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
 You're not going to join that sushi restaurant, are you?

271
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,200
 I'm the one who's going to join it.

272
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
 Damn it.

273
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
 Tokuko also fell to the ground.

274
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
 She went to the sushi restaurant to feed her juniors.

275
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
 Hey, senpai.

276
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
 Isn't it that restaurant?

277
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
 It's not that restaurant.

278
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
 I'm going to join this restaurant.

279
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
 I'm sure you'll satisfy us enough.

280
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
 Sushi restaurant.

281
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
 Let's eat.

282
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
 This is the real pleasure.

283
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
 Well, what are you going to do?

284
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
 This kind of restaurant is very expensive.

285
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,200
 I'm going to make it as cheap as possible.

286
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
 There's a delicious sea urchin in it, miss.

287
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
 Then I'll take that.

288
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
 What's wrong?

289
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
 No, it's nothing.

290
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
 What do you want me to do?

291
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
 You have a good taste, customer.

292
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
 Then I'll take it.

293
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
 Hey, hey.

294
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
 Dad.

295
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
 Why?

296
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
 Are you worried about the contents of your wallet?

297
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
 It's obvious.

298
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,200
 Real Edo people don't have enough money.

299
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
 Don't talk nonsense.

300
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
 I...

301
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
 Where's the toilet?

302
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
 Over there.

303
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,200
 Even that sea urchin and tuna cost 5,000 yen.

304
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,200
 Even if I order cheap ingredients from now on,

305
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
 20,000 yen will be a little over.

306
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,200
 I think I should do something about it and pull it up.

307
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
 Hey, wait.

308
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
 I was surprised.

309
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
 This guy.

310
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,200
 He's just going on about expensive things again.

311
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
 If this is the case...

312
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 Dad, I'd like to order a roll of kanpyo.

313
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
 Yes.

314
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
 A roll of kanpyo.

315
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,200
 I'm looking forward to the cheapest roll of kanpyo in the story.

316
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
 Special move.

317
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
 How many tricks are you going to use?

318
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
 What's this?

319
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
 What? It's a roll of kanpyo.

320
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
 Oh, this is a roll of kanpyo?

321
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,200
 The seaweed is shining, and there's only one kanpyo in it.

322
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,200
 Do you think Edo people can eat such a small fish?

323
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
 I've been listening to that for 500 years.

324
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
 This is the real Edo rice sushi.

325
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
 Let's go, Reiko Nagagawa.

326
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
 Yes.

327
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
 Where's the money?

328
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,200
 There's no need to pay fake Edo rice sushi.

329
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
 Operation successful.

330
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
 Wait a minute, Giku.

331
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
 That roll of kanpyo is just an appetizer.

332
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
 This is the real one.

333
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
 It's a roll of kanpyo.

334
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
 That's right.

335
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,200
 The Edo rice roll of kanpyo is this big.

336
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
 I'm glad you said that.

337
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
 It's not easy.

338
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
 I'll make you do what you want.

339
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
 What are you going to do next?

340
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
 That's right.

341
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
 I'm going to eat the sea urchin too.

342
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
 Hey!

343
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
 The sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

344
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
 No.

345
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
 The sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

346
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
 The sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

347
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
 You can't do it?

348
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
 Why not?

349
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
 There's something I can't do.

350
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
 Wait a minute.

351
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
 Um...

352
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
 Space battleship...

353
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
 Space battleship...

354
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
 Space battleship...

355
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
 Space battleship...

356
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
 Space battleship...

357
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
 Space battleship...

358
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
 This is it!

359
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
 Hey, you!

360
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
 What do you think?

361
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
 The sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

362
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
 What's this?

363
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
 It's a roll of kanpyo.

364
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
 Isn't it cool?

365
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
 You fool!

366
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
 There's no way the sea urchin roll of kanpyo is the same.

367
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
 This is the sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

368
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
 That's a bit wrong.

369
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,200
 There aren't many people who ask for the sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

370
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
 This is the truth.

371
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
 The sea urchin roll of kanpyo.

372
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
 This is it.

373
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,200
 I don't think I've been to a sushi restaurant unless I eat this.

374
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
 As expected of Edokko.

375
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
 Then I'll eat it in one bite.

376
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
 What?

377
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
 If it's Edokko, I'll eat it in one bite.

378
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
 Of course.

379
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
 What's next?

380
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
 That's right.

381
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
 I'll get some snacks.

382
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
 There's nothing I can't do.

383
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
 That's right.

384
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
 I'm aiming for a bonito.

385
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
 Aiming for a bonito?

386
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
 Aiming for a bonito.

387
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
 Aiming for a bonito.

388
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
 A sea urchin sushi roll of kanpyo.

389
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
 A roll of kanpyo.

390
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
 Curry rice.

391
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
 Curry rice.

392
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
 A rice ball with salmon and salmon roe.

393
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
 Here it is.

394
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
 Making a tuna rice ball.

395
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
 It's completely a piece of art.

396
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
 It's like watching a child.

397
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
 What should I do next?

398
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
 What should I do next?

399
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
 I still have a lot to do.

400
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
 That's right.

401
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
 Then I'll get some octopus.

402
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
 It's alive.

403
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
 Octopus is dancing in the air.

404
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
 This is exactly octopus dance.

405
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
 I'll eat it in a fresh house.

406
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
 This is it.

407
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
 I have to eat this once in Edokko.

408
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
 Oh, thank you.

409
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
 It seems to have a good breath.

410
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
 I'll eat it if I get it.

411
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
 Don't make a fuss about the octopus in Edokko.

412
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
 Don't make a fuss about the octopus in Edokko.

413
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
 Senpai, are you okay?

414
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
 I got it.

415
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
 I ate it.

416
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
 Then it's over.

417
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
 2 million yen.

418
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
 Is it expensive?

419
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
 It's not expensive.

420
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
 I was surprised that it was so cheap.

421
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
 Of course you're fine with the payment.

422
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
 After all, it's Edokko.

423
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
 I'll get the money.

424
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
 Wait a minute.

425
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
 I'll be right back.

426
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
 I'm sorry.

427
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
 Unfortunately, I only have small ones.

428
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
 Can you count them?

429
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
 I'm happy.

430
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
 I wanted small ones.

431
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
 Lucky.

432
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
 I thought you would say that.

433
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
 I'm sorry.

434
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
 I don't care.

435
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
 Your eyes are not laughing at all.

436
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,200
 I want you to make Edokko more generous.

437
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
 The End

438
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
 What is it?

439
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
 Why is it that Reiko and I are connected by hand?

440
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
 What?

441
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
 There's no key?

442
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,200
 Then, then, Reiko and I are going to live in this state for the rest of our lives?

443
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
 I don't like that.

444
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
 Next time, don't tell me that Ryotsu and Reiko are...

445
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
 Nice to meet you.

446
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,200
 Let's smile at any time.

447
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,200
 Even if something ridiculous happens.

448
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,200
 Smile cutely.

449
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,200
 You can go out with a face that's nothing.

450
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,200
 Hey, smile at me.

451
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,200
 You're not bad.

452
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,200
 Hey, smile at me.

453
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,200
 You're not bad.

454
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 You're always smiling.

455
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,200
 A woman who is deeply in love is not beautiful.

456
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,200
 You should smile right away.

457
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,200
 If you're not a child, then,

458
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,200
 If you're not a child, then,
