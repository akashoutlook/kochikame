1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Everybody can do!

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I don't want to say it even if it sticks out a little.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Don't worry about the noise.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 A strong and high-pitched voice.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Like Zou-san!

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Well, I'm going to work until 10.30.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 No, wait.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I'm going to work until 11.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 What have you been doing for a while?

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 What, Nakagawa?

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I thought you were the head of Ohara.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I'm free tomorrow.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 I'm going to set up a tight schedule and have a meaningful day.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 It's really a valuable day outside of work.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Of course.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 There are few days off for work days.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I also want 5 days off for work days.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 2 days off for work days.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I'm working hard for the safety of the citizens.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 It's a natural demand.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Ryo-chan is always on 7 days off.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 However, if you do all these tight schedules, you need a lot of stamina.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Yes?

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 This is Kamayari.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 What?

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 What is it?

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I'll take a break here and have lunch and talk.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 It's a big problem.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 What?

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 What's going on?

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 What's going on?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 What's going on?

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 What's going on?

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 What's going on?

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 It's dangerous.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Please go down.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Please go down.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 It's dangerous.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Please don't go in.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Please don't go in.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Please go down.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 It's dangerous. Please go down.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Okay?

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 If you get in trouble, you'll get in trouble.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Get out of the way.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 You're late.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I'm sorry.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Mr. Nakagawa.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Is there anyone injured?

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 No.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Where is the elephant?

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 It's in the warehouse in the back.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Hurry up and catch it.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 That's right.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 You're used to it, aren't you?

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 I'm not used to it, elephant.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 I'll go with you.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Mr. Nakagawa is dangerous.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 What's that?

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 It's discrimination.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 It's discrimination.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Hurry up and go.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Here you are.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 I don't want it anymore.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 It's a little elephant.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Come on, elephant.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It's okay.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 It's quiet.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Is it okay?

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Senior.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 It's dangerous, Mr. Nakagawa.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Let go of me.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Let go of me.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Nakagawa.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Bring milk and a bottle of milk.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 What?

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Hurry up.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Yes.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Mr. Nakagawa.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Mr. Nakagawa.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I'm glad you're okay.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Excuse me.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Do you have milk and a bottle of milk?

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 What?

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 It's okay.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 It's okay.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 It's okay.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 It's okay.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 It's okay.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 It's okay.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 It's okay.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 It's okay.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 It's okay.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 It's okay.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Nakagawa, you're still not good at this.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I'm done.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Do you drink milk?

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Milk is the basic of dairy.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Here's milk.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Please forgive me, my father.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Here.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Here.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Here.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Like this.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Here.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Here.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Try drinking it.

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Here.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 He drank it.

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Good boy.

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Good boy.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Good boy.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Good boy.

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Don't touch it.

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 The elephant will be surprised.

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Here.

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 It's okay.

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Don't be afraid.

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Don't be afraid.

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 He's getting used to the farmland.

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 It's the same wild animal.

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 It's big, but it's still a child.

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 If you don't excite it, it'll be quiet.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 But where did this elephant come from?

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I don't think it was a pet.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 I don't think it swam from Africa to the sea.

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 If that's the case, it's probably from the zoo.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I see.

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Then, take care of it here until it comes back.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 I'm going home, Nakagawa.

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Please forgive me, Mr. Omari.

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Nakagawa!

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 It's no good, Senpai.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 We can't leave.

139
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 The wild animal and the elephant.

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 They're the best couple.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Why is the elephant here?

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It's lost.

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Ryo-chan picked it up.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Why is it in the excretory?

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 It's connected to the surface.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 If you trample it even if you're drunk, it'll be a problem.

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 We can't leave it here until morning.

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Ryo-chan was kind to it, and it seems to have gotten used to it.

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Ryo-tsu likes it other than humans.

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Look.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 It's real. It's big.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I'll put it on if you give me 100 yen.

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Really?

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Ryo-tsu!

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 It's a joke.

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Try it on.

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Put it on.

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 I can't help it.

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 It's amazing.

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 It's expensive.

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Brother, it's rotten.

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 It's true.

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Did you get the search request?

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 I reported it to the head of the department.

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 There's nothing yet.

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 If it's difficult, let me drink milk again.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Don't tell me it's a frog.

168
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Ryo-tsu!

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Why?

170
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Don't look at me like that.

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 My work hours are over.

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 I'll be free until tomorrow.

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 You'll be sleeping all day long.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Why don't you take care of him until he comes to pick you up?

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 No.

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 What is it?

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 It's your schedule for tomorrow.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I have a lot of plans.

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 9 o'clock, 3 o'clock, breakfast, 9 o'clock, 30 minutes,

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 10 o'clock, lunch, 10 o'clock, meter, 12 o'clock,

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 You're responsible!

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 If you're here, you should act more posteriorly.

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Yes, Ryo-chan.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 This isn't my constellation.

185
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Did he follow us?

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 This is your vacation.

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I'm not going to let you get away with this!

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Good work!

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 See you later!

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Hey, I'm definitely going home!

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I'm going home no matter what you say!

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Let me go! Let me go!

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 I'm not going to let you get away with this!

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I'll take you with me, Ryo-chan!

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Don't be stupid!

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Do as you wish, Ryo-tsu!

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 This is an order from the chief!

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Wh-what is it, Ryo-san? What's that big thing?

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 It's an order from the chief!

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 If you have any complaints, tell it to Chief Ohara!

201
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 I just cleaned the floor!

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 I don't want to walk on dirty feet!

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 That's enough!

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I'm sorry, Tokura!

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 What are you doing, Ryo-san?

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Don't put that in the bath!

207
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 It's an order from the chief!

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 If you have any complaints, tell it to the chief!

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Ah!

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Okay, the other side!

211
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Okay, now the back!

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Okay, it's clean now!

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Listen, you stay here and wait quietly!

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 This guy seems to know only what's good for me!

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 I don't get it at all, Ryo-san!

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I'm asking you, so stop asking me for a favor!

217
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 What's wrong?

218
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 T-that's...

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 As much as you want!

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 This is my food!

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 What are you going to do with our breakfast?

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 This is what happens when Ryo-san brings in an elephant!

223
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 If you're the owner, take responsibility!

224
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 That's why this isn't my elephant!

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Please do something, Ryo-san!

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Listen!

227
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Don't say anything!

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Bring him here right now!

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 But there's no sign that the elephant is gone yet!

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Then where did he come from?

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Is he from Norazo?

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Then contact the health center!

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Anyway, I'll contact you as soon as I get any information!

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 So please do until then!

235
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 This guy and that guy...

236
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 They're all following my good personality!

237
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 To be continued...

238
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Look at this!

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 It's 9.30 a.m.!

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Ryo-san!

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 That guy is coming in!

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Yeah!

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 It's Douglas A-1 Skyray from Mologram!

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 This is it! I've been wanting this for so long!

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 8,000 yen, right?

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I forgot my wallet!

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Don't say that again!

248
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 No, it's true!

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I'll bring the money next time!

250
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Ryo-san!

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 He's already here!

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 This is the back door!

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Oops!

254
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 You can't go in there, Ryo-san!

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Ryo-san, there are two other people who are asking for money.

256
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 If you want it, bring the money.

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 That's not fair!

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I'll definitely pay for it, so please don't sell it!

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Please!

260
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 No!

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 I'm going to get caught!

262
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 I'm going to get caught!

263
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 You're a cop!

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Why do I have to go on a date with an elephant during this time of the day?

265
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Don't do it!

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 You're not going to die!

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I'm thirsty after running around.

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Huh?

269
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Damn it!

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 If I have 10 yen left...

271
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 10 yen left...

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Oh, there's a grain of grape!

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 A grain of grape...

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 A grain of...

275
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 10 yen...

276
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Ah...

277
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Ah...

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 In the case of a small grain,

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 it's difficult to identify the owner even if it's sent to the police station.

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I'll just have to return it when I get back to the station.

281
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Alright, alright.

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Good job.

283
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Good job, good job.

284
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Then, a grain of grape...

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Ah!

286
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I spilled the juice!

287
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 I can't drink juice when my throat is dry!

288
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Give me back the 100 yen, you bastard!

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Huh?

290
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Two more?

291
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 If it's the case, give me another one!

292
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Ah...

293
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 My throat is getting dry.

294
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 It's troublesome to go back to pick up my wallet.

295
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 The 10 o'clock check-in is cancelled.

296
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Thanks to you, I can eat breakfast.

297
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And the long-awaited scheduled dinner is a bar!

298
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Ah!

299
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Ah!

300
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 What should I do now?

301
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Did you pick it up again?

302
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Ah!

303
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 It's my wallet!

304
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And it's really heavy!

305
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Ah!

306
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 It's a big one!

307
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Ah!

308
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Oh, that wallet...

309
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I was looking for it.

310
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 No, thank you.

311
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 You saved me.

312
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Is this your wallet? What's the proof?

313
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 I think it's a picture I took with my granddaughter.

314
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Unfortunately, it's the only thing I can prove.

315
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I don't really care about the atmosphere.

316
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Thank you.

317
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I'll be careful.

318
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 But it's a rare pet.

319
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I've heard that in Asia, there are few countries that value elephants as gods.

320
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 God?

321
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 This one?

322
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Oh, it's a small one, but it's the second food for this elephant.

323
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 What?

324
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 This much?

325
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 I'm sure it's a good deal to give thanks.

326
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Well, have a nice day.

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 I have 30,000 yen.

328
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 It seems to have come with me.

329
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 In that case, the afternoon schedule will continue again.

330
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Come with me firmly, God!

331
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 How much is the elephant's ticket?

332
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 There is no elephant ticket.

333
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Then it's free.

334
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It's free.

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 What?

336
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 You ate too much and gained too much weight.

337
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 If you can't get through, you have to say goodbye here.

338
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 If you're upset, try jumping.

339
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Hey, customer!

340
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Hey, customer!

341
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 The train will arrive shortly on the second line.

342
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Hurry up!

343
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 The train is coming!

344
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 The first one to get off is the first one.

345
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Excuse me.

346
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Please slow down a little.

347
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 It's coming!

348
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Damn it!

349
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 What is it?

350
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 It's not coming at all.

351
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 What is it, God?

352
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 That old man said he would pay attention.

353
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 It's the last 1,000 yen.

354
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 If I take this off, I'll be able to walk back to Kameyari.

355
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 It's 20 times more than 47.

356
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 However, there is also a line called 36.

357
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 The person behind you is waiting.

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Please line up again after you decide.

359
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 The sixth train will depart shortly.

360
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 This is the second train that connects to the next train.

361
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 It's the second train.

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 It's the first train.

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 No, it's not the first train. It's the second train.

364
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 The next person.

365
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 The next person.

366
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 No, it's not like that.

367
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 37, 38, 100 yen.

368
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 It's the second train.

369
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 It's the second train.

370
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 I've never heard of it.

371
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 What?

372
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Both of them are old-timers.

373
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 They're so far away.

374
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 They're so far away.

375
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 This old man.

376
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 God damn it.

377
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 No way.

378
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 I got it.

379
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I got it!

380
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I got the 100 yen!

381
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 I got it!

382
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 It's good.

383
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 I got it!

384
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 You're going to be rich!

385
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Here you go, Mr. Ryo.

386
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Here, it's a new train.

387
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I'm sorry.

388
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 It was a great elephant.

389
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Okay, I'll treat you to anything for the sake of Manba.

390
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I wonder where Ryo went with the elephant.

391
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Yes.

392
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 This is the Kameyari Park.

393
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 What?

394
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 I saw an elephant.

395
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 I feel like I can be a good friend with you.

396
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 It's cold.

397
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 You're really something.

398
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 You're really something.

399
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I'm sorry.

400
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 I'm sorry.

401
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I'm sorry.

402
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I'm sorry.

403
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 You look cute when you look at me.

404
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Tonto!

405
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Tonto?

406
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Ryo!

407
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Boss!

408
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 What do you want to do with the elephant?

409
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I got a message from the zoo that they were looking for an elephant.

410
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 But Ryo is missing.

411
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Anyway, I'm glad the elephant and Senpai are safe.

412
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Thank you for the trouble.

413
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Tonto's mother died yesterday.

414
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 What?

415
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 We took care of Tonto's mother.

416
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 He was lonely and escaped from the cage.

417
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Tonto helped us a lot.

418
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 What?

419
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 What are you talking about?

420
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Hey!

421
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 What do you want to do with my elephant?

422
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Ryo!

423
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 What are you doing?

424
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Let me go.

425
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 It's okay.

426
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Don't be afraid.

427
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 What are you going to do?

428
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Let me go.

429
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Boss!

430
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 He's gone too.

431
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 I'll take care of him.

432
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Idiot!

433
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Nakagawa!

434
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Come here!

435
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Yes!

436
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Let me go!

437
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Senpai!

438
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Don't let Nakagawa go!

439
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 It's dangerous.

440
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Let me go!

441
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Yes!

442
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Please help us!

443
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Yes!

444
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Let me go!

445
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Yes!

446
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Ready!

447
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Go!

448
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Stop!

449
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Stop!

450
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Let me go!

451
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Do you understand now?

452
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Tonto is my elephant!

453
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I'll never forget your kindness even when I return to the zoo, Tonto.

454
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Tonto!

455
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Wait for me, Tonto!

456
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Tonto!

457
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Wait for me, Tonto!

458
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Wait for me!

459
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Tonto!

460
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Senpai!

461
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Ryo-chan, you're so kind even though you look like that.

462
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Tonto!

463
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Tell me!

464
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 What's going to happen to the next elephant show?

465
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 I want him to win with me at the zoo.

466
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Tonto!

467
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Tonto!

468
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 If the elephant show doesn't work, I won't give up!

469
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 What's going to happen to the derby?

470
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Did you fall in love with Megumi-chan from Aijo bento?

471
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Good job!

472
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 You did well, Honda!

473
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Get it on the second episode of the show!

474
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I, a nice middle-class guy, who has a lot of experience, will teach you the points of a date!

475
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Next time, on Fasile Honda, for the sake of love!

476
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 The End

477
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Let's live the way we want

478
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 There's something good

479
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Outside the door, the sun is calling
