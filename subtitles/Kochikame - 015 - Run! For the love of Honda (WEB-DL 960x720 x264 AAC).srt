1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Honda, for the sake of love!

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Hey, Nakagawa, are you hungry?

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Do you want to eat gyoza today?

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Chinese food? Sounds good.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Honda, you're in danger!

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Don't be so angry, Ryotsu's boss.

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Anyway, I'm going to buy some bento. I'll buy it with you.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 It's okay, I'll buy it today.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Can I treat you?

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Honda, why don't you say that first?

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 I'm a special Hirekatsu staff.

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I'll give you a tonjiru after a long time.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 You're a lively old man.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Nakagawa, how about you?

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Can I join you?

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Yes, you can.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Hey, Nakagawa, this is for you.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Make it cheaper.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Then, fried chicken bento.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Okay.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Okay.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Well, Senpai Nakagawa, I'm going.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 It's rare for a person to change his personality.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Thank you very much.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Hello.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Oh, welcome.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Are you going to buy bento today?

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 This bento is the best and delicious.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 I'm so happy.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 What would you like to eat today?

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Special Hirekatsu bento and fried chicken bento.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I'll have nori bento and two more tonjiru.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Okay.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Special Hirekatsu bento and fried chicken bento and nori bento.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 What?

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Did I make a mistake?

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 No, that's fine.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And tonjiru.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Oh, six tonjiru.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Oh, okay.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Captain, I'll have two special Hirekatsu bento and fried chicken bento and two tonjiru.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Okay.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Here you are.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Thank you for waiting.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I'm sorry that you have to do this for us.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 No, I'm always in your care.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 That kind of attitude is important.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 It's a big difference from someone else.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 That's what the chief says.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Someone else.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 It's about you.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Is the food here a little dry?

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 That's right.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 That's not true.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I'm using the best light.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 The buttocks are a little short.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 This is just right.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 This bento is the best.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 No matter what you say, it's full of love.

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I read it.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 What?

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 You made a lot of mistakes with the number of bento.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 You're getting paid to advertise the bento shop.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 That's not true.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I understand.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Honda-san, you like the girl from the bento shop, don't you?

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 No, that's not true.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I see.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 That clerk is cute.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 How do you know that?

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 If you look at her face, you'll know who she is.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 You're annoying.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 What does that clerk say?

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 She's Megumi-chan from Hoshino.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Don't say bad things about her.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Give up on her.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Why?

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Ryo-chan, are you still friends with her?

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Please help her.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Reiko, how many times do you think she's been in love?

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Not once or twice.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 100 times.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 101 times.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 That much?

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Try to be her boyfriend.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 But...

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Reiko, stop it.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 You can't be in love forever.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 You can't be in love forever.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I won't listen to that.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Grandpa!

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 What is it?

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 What is it?

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 You're being rude to me, a nice middle for a girl killer.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 What?

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 A nice middle for a girl killer?

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Stop joking around.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Come on!

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 If this is the case, I'll get her and Honda together.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Really?

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Yes.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Leave it to me.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 It's a big boat, right?

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Anyway, I'll get Megumi-chan and you together.

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 I'm counting on you, Senpai.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Yeah.

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Senpai, how was it?

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 No, no.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 There's a man I like.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 No way.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 What kind of person is that man you like?

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 He said he's been longing for a white boy who passes by here at 9 a.m. every morning.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Don't thank him.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Megumi-chan, give up already.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 I'm also a white boy.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I also pass by here at 9 a.m. every morning.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 What did you just say?

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I also pass by here at 9 a.m. every morning.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Come on!

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Honda!

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Hey, Megumi-chan.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Yes?

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Isn't that the white boy you were talking about?

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Look.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 He always comes to buy things.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Hello.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 What do you think?

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Doesn't he look like him?

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 No, he doesn't look like him at all.

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I'm sorry.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 He looks a little slim, but his face is tighter.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 He's always wearing a scarf and a scarf.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 He's really manly and cool.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 It's me after all.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Look at me!

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Senpai!

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 His face is different after all.

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 You may not believe it, but when this Honda rides a bike,

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 his face and personality become completely different.

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 You mean Mr. Honda?

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 This Honda is the number one in the current white boy unit.

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 That's right.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 If you're the same white boy unit,

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 you know who passes by this store every morning, right?

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 No, that's not it.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Yes, it's okay.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Please leave it to me.

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Huh?

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Mr. Honda, please tell me if you know his name.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Okay.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 You made an unnecessary promise.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 I'm sorry.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 I see.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 It's getting complicated.

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Mr. Megumi, you like the Honda when you ride a bike.

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Does that mean you can't ride the Honda now?

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Honda, there's only one way.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 What should I do?

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 From now on, you can keep riding the bike in front of Megumi.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Huh?

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 That's impossible.

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I know it's impossible.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 If you ask for a date while riding a bike,

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 it's absolutely okay.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 That may be true, but...

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 It's a bit forced.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Men and women are the first priority.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 If you decide right away,

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 the rest will be fine.

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Is that so?

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I'm sure it's because a nice middle-aged woman who kills women says so.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 I'll do it.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Mr. Honda.

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I like her.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 If I can go on a date with such a nice person,

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I don't care what happens next.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Okay, it's settled.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 All that's left is to attack.

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Yes, senpai.

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Good morning.

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Mr. Honda told you, didn't he?

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Well, yes.

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 I'm sorry. Nice to meet you.

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 I'm Megumi Hoshino.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 What's your name?

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 I'm Honda.

190
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Are you also Mr. Honda?

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 No, I'm Suzuki from Honda.

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Are you Mr. Suzuki?

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 It's strange that I can't ride a bike.

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Do you want to risk your life and feel the wind with me?

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Yes, I'd love to.

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I'll pick you up here at 9 a.m. on Sunday.

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Okay.

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 See you.

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 I'll get the prize.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Thank you.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 I did it.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I'm going on a date on Sunday.

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Really? You did it.

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Listen, don't get off the bike during the date.

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Okay.

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Suzuki-sen.

207
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Suzuki-sen.

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 What is it?

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 I didn't think the wind was so nice.

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Really?

211
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 That's good.

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 I was Suzuki.

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Don't go that way!

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Don't run around with me.

215
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Who are you guys going after?

216
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Mr. Honda!

217
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 I'm not Honda.

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 I'm Suzuki.

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I'm sorry.

220
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 I didn't think you were Mr. Honda.

221
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Suzuki, you idiot!

222
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Please forgive me, Suzuki-san.

223
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Please forgive me, Suzuki-san.

224
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Please forgive me, Suzuki-san.

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 I understand.

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I'll forgive you for today.

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 But if you do that again, I won't forgive you!

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Yes!

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Are you okay?

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Yes.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 If you're with me, I won't be scared.

232
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Okay.

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Hold on tight.

234
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Okay.

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 That's strange.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 I'm sure you're Mr. Honda.

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Suzuki-san is really strong and manly.

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I'm impressed.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Idiot.

240
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Do you want to watch a movie?

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Yes.

242
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 The seats are open.

243
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 I always watch like this.

244
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Don't worry.

245
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 You've changed.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Suzuki-san, you really like bikes, don't you?

247
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Yes.

248
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I'm the best partner.

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Bikes and I are the same.

250
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 The best partner, huh?

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 What's wrong?

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Actually, my ex-boyfriend is going to the U.S. today.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 He has a girlfriend?

254
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 He's going to the U.S.?

255
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Megumi-san, will you go to the U.S. with me?

256
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 What?

257
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 No, it's nothing.

258
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Two years is too short.

259
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 We'll see each other again.

260
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Is that all you want to say?

261
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 You can go to the U.S. or anywhere else.

262
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Goodbye.

263
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Megumi-san.

264
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 But it's okay.

265
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 It's over.

266
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 I'm the one who wants to get rid of that man.

267
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 After all, a man has to be manly like Suzuki-san.

268
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I see.

269
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Let's go home.

270
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Yes.

271
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Excuse me.

272
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Welcome.

273
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 What's wrong?

274
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Wait here.

275
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 All right, it's done.

276
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 It's leaking.

277
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 How was the date?

278
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 As you said, I've been riding my bike all the time.

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 It's perfect.

280
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 I see.

281
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 You have to do it.

282
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Megumi-san.

283
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Yamamoto-san.

284
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Senpai, please don't bother me.

285
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Who do you think you're dating?

286
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Who is that man?

287
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 I don't know.

288
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Who is that man?

289
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Actually, he's going to the U.S. today.

290
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Hey, Honda.

291
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Explain yourself.

292
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Who are you?

293
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Wait, you bastard.

294
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 I really want to tell you how I feel before I leave.

295
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 What?

296
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Megumi-san.

297
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I like you.

298
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I want to marry you.

299
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 This is a ticket for your flight.

300
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I want you to come with me if you can.

301
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 You suddenly said that.

302
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 That's right.

303
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 It's impossible.

304
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I'm always like this.

305
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Take care.

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It was late.

307
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Do you have a passport?

308
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 I'm asking if you have one.

309
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Yes.

310
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 If you get drunk,

311
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 let's go touring to Narita next time.

312
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Damn it.

313
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 You're a curse.

314
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Next time, I'm going to the U.S.

315
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 I'm going to the U.S.

316
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I'm going to the U.S.

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 I'm going to the U.S.

318
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I'm going to the U.S.

319
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 If you do that again, I'll shoot you.

320
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Honda.

321
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Why is it him?

322
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I like you.

323
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 I like you.

324
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 I like men.

325
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 I like men.

326
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Suzuki-san.

327
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 I can't believe I'm stuck in a place like this.

328
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 What time is the departure time of the aircraft?

329
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 It's seven o'clock.

330
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Damn, I can't make it in time.

331
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Hold on tight!

332
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Ah!

333
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

334
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Hey, hey, don't look like that.

335
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Going to Los Angeles means that I'm on the departure course.

336
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 I'll be going now.

337
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Do your best.

338
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Yeah.

339
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Take care!

340
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Call me if you need me!

341
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Do your best!

342
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Mr. Megumi!

343
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Go ahead.

344
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Go ahead.

345
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 I decided to go with you.

346
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Take me with you.

347
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Mr. Megumi...

348
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 How long are you going to hold on to me?

349
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 If you don't hurry, you'll get on too late.

350
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Mr. Suzuki, how can I thank you?

351
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 You don't have to thank me.

352
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Let's go.

353
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Yes, thank you very much.

354
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Mr. Honda, it's you.

355
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Thank you, Mr. Honda!

356
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Thank you, Mr. Honda!

357
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Good-bye, Mr. Megumi.

358
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 He was such a good boy.

359
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 It's the second time I'm seeing him.

360
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 I know, so don't cry.

361
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 I'm sorry.

362
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 It's been six months since I last saw him.

363
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 It can't be helped.

364
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 But, Honda,

365
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 to play the role of Cupid in a woman's love,

366
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 you're too good.

367
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 You're stupid.

368
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 You're just like Ryo-san when he was young.

369
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Just like you,

370
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Ryo-san got drunk here every time he fell in love.

371
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Dad, don't say that.

372
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Well, it doesn't matter.

373
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Hey, Mr. Honda,

374
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 falling in love a hundred times is too much.

375
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Ryo-san is over 300 times.

376
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Really?

377
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Yeah.

378
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 I'm feeling better now.

379
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Let's drink, Mr. Honda.

380
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Come on.

381
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 We're going to be drunk for two days

382
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 and get hit by the boss again.

383
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 It's normal.

384
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 What?

385
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Come on.

386
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I'm sick of this.

387
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 I'm going to drink all the booze in the store.

388
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Yes, Mr. Honda.

389
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Next Episode

390
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Thank you for coming.

391
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Would you like some tea?

392
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Our cute subordinates came all the way here.

393
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Please treat us to something.

394
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Next time,

395
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 we'll show you the secret of the Ohara family.

396
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 To be continued

397
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Even if it rains today

398
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Tomorrow will be sunny

399
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Bye bye

400
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Wave your hand

401
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Say goodbye to the unpleasant things

402
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Oh yeah

403
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Let's live the way we want

404
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 There's something good

405
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Outside the door,

406
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 the sun is calling
