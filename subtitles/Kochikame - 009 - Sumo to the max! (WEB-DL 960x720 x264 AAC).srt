1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Sumo to the max!

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 There! Go, Takanoyama!

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 There, there! Go fast!

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Alright! Alright!

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 There, there! Use your left hand!

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Takanoyama!

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 We did it! We did it!

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 It was really powerful!

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Takanoyama of Konbashi is the president without any complaints.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I don't want to miss the best part of Yokozuna Takanoyama.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Even if you watch it on TV, you won't understand the real fun of Osmo.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 So have you ever seen the real thing?

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 If it's a real sumo wrestler, I sometimes see him walking in his yukata.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Even I watch it!

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Why don't you come to see the real thing?

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 It's not that easy to get Osmo's tips.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Oh, really? I didn't know that.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 You can't get Osmo's tips if you're not good enough to be a member of the national team.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 It's my dream to see Osmo in the national team.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 The dream is to be a member of the national team.

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 By the way, it's the Fukubiki of Shoten-Gai.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Hey, where are you going?

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I'm going to patrol.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 It's rare for Ryo-chan to leave the soup.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 This is the Fukubiki of Kamiwari Shoten-Gai.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 This is Osmo's ticket.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 It's right in front of the town hall.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 He hasn't left yet.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Support ticket, support ticket.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 It's pretty low.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 This is bad.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Ryo-san is trying to do the Fukubiki.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Oh, no.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I'm going to die today.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 What's wrong with Ryo-san?

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Don't you know?

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 He's a very lucky man.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 He went on a trip to Hokkaido the other day.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Last year, he went on a trip to Guam for four days.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 He's got a copy of a computer.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 What are you doing?

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 All right, let's go.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Gold-colored stone sword.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Gold-colored stone sword.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Gold-colored stone sword.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I hit it again.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 You did it.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 You're back already?

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Yeah.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 You've just been wandering around, haven't you?

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Can I say that?

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Oh, no.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I dropped my support ticket.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 What?

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 What's wrong with that?

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 I have a big face, too.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Ryo-chan, you're amazing.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 No, I'm not.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Well, that's...

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Well, how about it?

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Who wants to buy this ticket?

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Sumo is a Japanese traditional martial art.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Flowers are sakura, mountains are Fuji.

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 You have to watch sumo to be a Japanese.

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Oh, right.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Don't you forget the Japanese spirit soon?

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 But...

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 This is a ticket to Masseki and Seishuraku.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 It's not something you can buy with a salaryman's salary.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Is he gone?

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I don't think so.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I don't know. Let's go to Nagagawa.

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Let's go see it together.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Yes.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 There's only one person left.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Oh, right.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I forgot the important person.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I have to invite my father to the ramen shop.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Senpai, you're doing too much.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 That's right.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I'm not good at it.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 It's a joke.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 You don't have to invite your boss.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Boss, you're going too, right?

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Well, if you invite me, I'd like to see it.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 That's right, boss.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 You had a high-class brandy, didn't you?

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 The one you were proud of.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 No, that's...

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 The brandy you drink in Masseki is delicious.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 You can bring it to me.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 All right, it's decided.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Let's get back to work.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 That's a lot of work.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I can't help it.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I'm excited.

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 You're a great person.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 You're right.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 And you have a big sense of patriotism.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 That's because I'm a patriot in Japan.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Excuse me.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Oh, sorry.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 I'm sorry.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 You're a great person.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 This is no problem.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I have no problem.

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Oh, thank you.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Bye.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 A lot of foreigners are coming to see you.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The popularity of Osmo is quite international.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 The popularity of Osmo is quite international.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 You can see Osmo in Masseki in a great mood.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Well, well, who is it?

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 By the way, someone gave you a ticket to Masseki at Fukubiki in Shoten-gai the other day.

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Giku.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 That's right.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I heard you were in uniform.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 What?

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 What do you mean?

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 If you're not satisfied with the ticket, you can go home.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It doesn't matter whether it's Fukubiki or something else.

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 It doesn't matter whether it's Fukubiki or something else.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I'm really grateful to you.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Well, let's go.

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Did you all get the ticket?

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Yes.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 All right.

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Don't be late after me.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 My ticket!

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Wait!

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Idiot!

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 The wind in Ryogoku is so nice.

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Now we can see each other slowly.

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Leave him alone.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Let's go.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Yes.

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Wait!

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 The flow of Sumida River was great.

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Did you jump into the Sumida River?

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Of course.

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 I'm going to lose the ticket.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I can't believe it.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 I'm going to lose the ticket.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 He's doing it.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 The flow of the river is great.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 This way.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 It's quite small.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 But it's close to the ticket.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 It's great.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 What's that?

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 It's snacks and sake.

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 You're so considerate.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 It's great.

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I heard you can get souvenirs on your way home.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 There's also a manager's brandy.

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It's going to be a grand banquet.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 I'm not here for a banquet.

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 I'm here for Sumo Kansen.

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 It's a great view.

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 It's a product of Kansen.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 You're smart.

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Let me see.

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Wait, I'll go first.

167
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Who did this for?

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 You again?

169
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Okay, I'll show you.

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Thank you.

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 You don't eat much.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 It's the blonde girl.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 If you don't want to see Sumo, give it back.

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 It's fine.

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 That's not the problem.

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Let's have a toast.

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 I forgot.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Cheers!

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Did you forget something?

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 What?

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 You should be thankful to Mr. Ryotsu.

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 What are you talking about?

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Really?

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Wait a minute.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 He's in a bad mood.

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Okay, I'll say it.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Thank you to Mr. Ryotsu.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Cheers!

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 This is Takanoyama.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Look!

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 It's Takanoyama.

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 You can tell by looking at it.

193
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 I'm looking forward to it.

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 That's right.

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 What will you show us?

196
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 I'm looking forward to it.

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I see.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 This is Makunochi bento.

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Why don't you calm down and look at Sumo?

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 I've already eaten.

201
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Can I eat sushi for Reiko?

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Sure.

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Sorry.

204
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Senpai is eating silently.

205
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 It's okay.

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 It's better to give food quietly.

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 The East Sea

208
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 The Sea of Plum Blossoms

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 The Sea of Plum Blossoms

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 The Sea of Plum Blossoms is full of energy.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Unlike TV, it's full of energy.

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 It's a good shot!

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 It's a good shot!

214
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 It's a good shot!

215
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 It's a good shot!

216
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Shut up!

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Can I eat this yakitori?

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Don't call me like that.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 It's over!

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 It's over!

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 The Sea of Plum Blossoms

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 It's amazing!

223
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Thank you!

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's my first time seeing it.

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Idiot!

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 You didn't see the match.

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 You'll get angry if I eat silently.

228
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 I won't get angry because of that.

229
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 It's not a big deal.

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 What did you say?

231
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 That's enough.

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I'm going to the toilet.

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 What a guy!

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 He's making a fuss because he missed the first match.

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 That's right.

236
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I was looking forward to the first match of the Sea of Plum Blossoms.

237
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Why don't you watch it on TV?

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Then you don't know why you came.

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Thanks to who?

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Don't say that.

241
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 You're the one who got lucky.

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 You're late.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 You're lost somewhere.

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 I'm the one who's in trouble.

245
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Who are you?

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Are you all right?

247
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 There's been a lot of damage recently.

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Be careful.

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I'm sorry.

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Are you hurt?

251
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 I'm fine.

252
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 It's nothing.

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Really?

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 I'm really sorry.

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 What?

256
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 That's strange.

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I thought you were coming from here.

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I'm in trouble.

259
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 It looks the same from any entrance.

260
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Did something happen?

261
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 I don't know.

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 I don't know where my seat is.

263
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Sir!

264
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 This way!

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Ryosuke!

266
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 I just got a call.

267
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Is that so?

268
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 There's been a lot of damage in the ship today.

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Be careful.

270
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Thank you.

271
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Thank you for your help.

272
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I almost got lost.

273
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Let's go back.

274
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Ryotsu!

275
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 We're in front of the store.

276
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Let's buy some souvenirs.

277
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Hurry up.

278
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 It's almost the second half.

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 What should we buy?

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I have an idea.

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Takanoyama is really big.

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 This isn't bad.

283
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 We can sell it to the women in the department store.

284
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 It's well made.

285
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 I'll buy one as a souvenir.

286
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 How much is this?

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 What?

288
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 What's wrong?

289
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I don't have a wallet.

290
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 That's strange.

291
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 I don't like this.

292
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Didn't you forget your wallet at home?

293
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I bought a ticket and got on the train.

294
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I'll lend you my wallet.

295
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 I'll give you the money.

296
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 What?

297
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 That's not my wallet.

298
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 That's my wallet.

299
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Wait a minute.

300
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 It's a woman's wallet.

301
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 It's Sully.

302
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 No, it's not.

303
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Where is Sully?

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 This is Sully.

305
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I said no.

306
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Let's run away.

307
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Stop.

308
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Stop.

309
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Why do I have to run away?

310
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Ryotsu, what's going on?

311
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I don't know.

312
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 That's right.

313
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 That woman is guilty of Sully.

314
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Damn it.

315
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Where is she?

316
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 She should be in that room.

317
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Ryotsu, explain yourself.

318
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Stop.

319
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 If this continues, we will both be arrested.

320
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Please be a little victim for the sake of justice.

321
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 What?

322
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 That's the board.

323
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Where?

324
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I'm sorry.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Wait.

326
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 You two are late.

327
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 What are you doing?

328
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Don't tell me you're lost together.

329
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Those two are scary.

330
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 I'm going to look for them.

331
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 All right.

332
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I'll be back in a while.

333
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 I'm going to eat lunch now.

334
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 That's right.

335
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Hey.

336
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Ryotsu.

337
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 What are you doing?

338
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Go away.

339
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Typhoon.

340
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Excuse me.

341
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 I'm going.

342
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 All right.

343
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 This is Sully.

344
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 No.

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 That's not it.

346
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 But it's not different from a friend.

347
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 That's why I...

348
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I don't know.

349
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Where is it?

350
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Where is that blonde?

351
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I sacrificed my head.

352
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 I'll definitely catch you no matter where you are.

353
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 There it is.

354
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Sorry.

355
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Are you all right?

356
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Yes.

357
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 It's Sully.

358
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 That's Sully.

359
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Oh my God.

360
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Arrest him.

361
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Arrest him.

362
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Wait.

363
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Senpai.

364
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Help.

365
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Wait.

366
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 What are you going to do?

367
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I caught you, Sully.

368
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 I won't let you get away.

369
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 No.

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 You bastard.

371
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Get your dirty hands off me.

372
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Shut up.

373
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 You were arrested by me for Sully's crime.

374
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Be quiet.

375
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 What are you talking about?

376
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 You're Sully.

377
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Let her go.

378
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Let her go.

379
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Sully is this blonde woman.

380
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 You're not Sully.

381
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 You're a villain.

382
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Don't judge me by my face.

383
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 He's not Sully.

384
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 He was trying to save me.

385
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Sully is that woman.

386
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 That's right.

387
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 But...

388
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 What?

389
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 What's wrong with you?

390
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Damn it.

391
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Wait.

392
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 What are you doing?

393
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 That's my mouth.

394
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Ryotsu.

395
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 You abandoned me.

396
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Well, well, well.

397
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 For the sake of the criminal,

398
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 you can't give up a little sacrifice.

399
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And if you run that much,

400
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 you can get rid of your shortcomings.

401
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 What?

402
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 No way.

403
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 What?

404
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 You put so many things in my jacket.

405
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 I'll do it with a cute face.

406
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 That's my wallet.

407
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I didn't have time to be careless.

408
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Even if I told you.

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 What?

410
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 What?

411
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 What?

412
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 You always make trouble.

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 I don't think so.

414
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 I may be a man who makes trouble,

415
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 but I'm a doji who can at least take my wallet.

416
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Can you say that?

417
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 You put your wallet in your pocket.

418
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 What did you say?

419
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Ouch.

420
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 My pants are broken.

421
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Hurry up.

422
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 There's only one knot left.

423
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 It's a final match between Yokosuna and Ryotsu.

424
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 It's hard.

425
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 At least I have to see that.

426
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Ryotsu.

427
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I'll talk to you later.

428
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Hurry up.

429
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 We have to do something.

430
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 I'll do anything.

431
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 You came to see me with my ticket.

432
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 I'll forget everything.

433
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 I got it.

434
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I got it.

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 How did you do it?

436
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 If I had seen this match, I would have come to the museum.

437
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Go.

438
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 There it is.

439
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 What?

440
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I can't see anything.

441
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Senpai.

442
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Here it is.

443
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 I can't see anything.

444
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Let me go.

445
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 It's a big match.

446
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 What happened?

447
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 It's over.

448
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 I can't see anything.

449
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 It's a big match.

450
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 It's a waste.

451
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 As of now, the winner is Takanoyama.

452
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Ryotsu.

453
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 What do you have against me?

454
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 You're just saying useless things.

455
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 What?

456
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Young lady.

457
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 How dare you.

458
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 What did you say?

459
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 You're useless.

460
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 I'll cut your head off.

461
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 You're saying too much.

462
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Shut up.

463
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Of course I'm useless.

464
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 What did you say?

465
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 What is this?

466
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 What is this?

467
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 The match has started.

468
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 I can't see anything.

469
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 What are you doing?

470
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 I can't help it.

471
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 I have to wait until it's over.

472
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 But...

473
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 I shouldn't have come.

474
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 I'm going to die now.

475
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Red is stopped.

476
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Blue is recommended.

477
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Let's raise our hands and cross the road.

478
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 What?

479
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 That's common sense.

480
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Are you guys following that common sense?

481
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Alright.

482
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I'll guide you through the traffic safety.

483
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Next time, we're going to have a blast.

484
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Thank you for watching.

485
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
