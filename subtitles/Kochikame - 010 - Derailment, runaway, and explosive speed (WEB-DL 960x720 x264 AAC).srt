1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 The Great Explosion!

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 In the city, especially in our area, there is a traffic accident.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 So, next week, the traffic safety training course will be held in this area.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 On that day, the students of this training center will also participate as a guide, so they will be able to understand the idea of a guide that is easy for children to understand.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 There are a lot of accidents, so it's troublesome, Ryo-tsu.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 That's right.

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Like someone who breaks the speed with a bicycle.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I don't like it.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Someone who ignores the traffic light because it's a bicycle.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I don't like that either.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Someone who goes into the shop with a bicycle and destroys the shop.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It's stupid.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Someone who makes plastic and doesn't listen to people.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 It's ridiculous.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Idiot! It's about you, about you!

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I'm listening!

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I'm making plastic for mental health!

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Don't make fun of me!

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Do you think I'm going to go through such a helix?

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 It's just like tea!

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Don't make plastic and tea together!

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 What about traffic safety?

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Darn it.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Anyway, think of an idea to prevent traffic accidents by the end of the course!

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I'm not kidding.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 An idea to prevent accidents?

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 It's easy.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Everyone has to get in the car.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I'm busy making plastic.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Darn it.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Excuse me.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Yes?

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 What can I do for you?

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Um...

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Is Ryo-tsu-senpai here?

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 It's you!

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Long time no see.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Ryo-chan's junior?

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 I'm Honda from the traffic control team.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Actually, I'm going to join the same company as you.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 So I'd like to say hello to you today.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Wow, it looks delicious.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I baked chocolate cake.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Look at this.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Surara-chan's face is cute, isn't it?

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Surara-chan?

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 The main character of the anime.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Surara, the girl of light source, is quite popular now.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Surara-chan's voice is so cute.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Don't do that today.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 But...

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Darn it!

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I'm going to beat you up!

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 This is a riot!

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Stop! Stop!

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I can't stop!

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Stop!

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I'm scared!

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I'm scared! I'm scared of the riot!

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 It's going wild.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Are they chasing Komachi and Naoko?

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 It's a cool mini-pato!

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 The performance of the machine is different!

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 I can't catch up!

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Stop!

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I can't catch up!

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Stop!

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Stop!

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Stop!

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Stop!

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I can't catch up!

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Honda!

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Hey!

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 You came by bike today, didn't you?

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Yes.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I always come by bike.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Okay, Honda!

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 You follow me!

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I'm scared.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I'm not good at that.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Just get on the bike!

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I have to.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 If you're here, you can do it.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 It's impossible for you, Honda.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 I can't do it!

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Just get on the bike!

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Stop it, Ryo-chan!

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I feel sorry for you, Honda.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Just get on the bike!

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 I can't do it!

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I can't do it!

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Alright!

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Let's go!

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Who is he?

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I'm Honda.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I'm Kouki's Honda!

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 The bike technique is amazing!

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Are you ready, Ryo-chan's husband?

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Yes!

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Let's go!

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Go!

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 What is he doing?

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 He looks like a different person.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Wait!

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Hey!

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I can't see him anymore.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 What was that?

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It looked like a white horse.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 The sound of the exoskeleton that shakes the soul of Ibuki Gin.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And the sound of his heart beating fast.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 His heart is beating fast.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Look!

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 The cockroaches are chasing him.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Oh, no!

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 It's a white horse!

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Do you think you can get away from me?

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Stop it, you bastard!

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Oh, no!

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 What is this?

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 What happened?

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 You're late, girls.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 That's what this Honda did to you.

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 So cool!

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 What is this?

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Don't tell me...

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 This is...

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Honda's...

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Yes, that's right!

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Honda used to be a bandit.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Now he's a police officer.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 But his personality changes when he rides a motorcycle.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 He's a man who is feared as a two-wheeled devil.

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 A two-wheeled...

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Devil?

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 The engine has warmed up.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Do you want to race again?

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Yes!

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Let's race!

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 A two-wheeled devil...

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 No way!

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 The signal was red just now, wasn't it?

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 You don't know?

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 It's not a crime if you don't find it.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 If you don't find it...

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I found it!

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 He's the one who made the signal in front of Honda.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 He's a coward.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Hey, you!

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Don't you have to stop?

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I have to stop.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 What are you going to do?

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 I'm going to destroy the universe.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Hey, you!

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 What are you doing?

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 You ignored the signal.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 What are you doing?

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Yes.

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Is this the end?

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Move the car as fast as you can.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 But the engine...

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 What?

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Is it my fault?

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 No, it's...

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Don't you have a problem?

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Idiot!

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Even though you're a criminal,

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 you destroyed three bikes and one passenger car,

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 and caused a huge traffic jam.

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 What kind of person are you?

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I'm sorry.

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 It's a big deal.

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Well, well, well, chief.

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Honda is also reflecting on itself.

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Today, we have a lot of things to do.

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 You're the one who made Honda disappear, aren't you?

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 No, I'm not.

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 I don't have a female driver.

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I just want to drive this guy.

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Didn't Ryotsu-senpai tell you to go?

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 You don't like it, do you, Honda?

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 When did I say that?

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Oh, so you're the one who died.

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 No, that's...

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 No more questions!

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Ryotsu!

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 I'll give you a high-speed safety poison hundred-shot set!

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Oh, I'm sorry!

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Poison all of them by the end of this week!

193
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 What?

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Are you going to read all of this?

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 It's done.

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 1750 horsepower, two-speed, three-speed, high-speed engine,

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 with a great output engine,

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 it's a masterpiece made by Germany,

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 who ran through the big sky of Europe.

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Junkers Yumo 213H,

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 another name is Tank 152.

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Hey, are you studying traffic safety?

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 If you don't read it, the chief will scold you again.

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 How can I read something like this?

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 By the way, you're not playing with dolls, are you?

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 I'm not playing.

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 I'm making it because the chief asked me to.

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 I'm going to use it at the traffic safety workshop tomorrow.

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I'm going to hit a doll that looks like Ryo-chan in the car

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 and do an experiment on a traffic accident.

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 What? Hit in the car?

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 A doll that looks like me?

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I won't let you do that.

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 That's what the chief would think.

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 You're going to turn your daily grudge into a doll.

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Who's the chief?

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 The chief is the chief.

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 No, no, no.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I want to eat human tonight.

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 I'm sorry, but it's boring.

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Anyway, I'm fine.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 You promised to read a hundred books

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 on traffic safety until the workshop tomorrow, didn't you?

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 That's right.

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 I'm definitely coming tomorrow.

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Of course.

227
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 I wonder if I'll be able to sleep tonight.

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I'm going to make you do a lot of work.

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 What's with that creepy laugh?

231
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Is Ryo-chan still not here?

232
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Did he run away?

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 I think he's coming.

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Even if he complains or complains,

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 he's a person who can't resist what the chief says.

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 It's about him.

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Even if he's late, he walks around with a calm face.

238
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Maybe he's skipping.

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Hello, hello.

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 While saying that, he's definitely coming.

241
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 I don't like his attitude.

242
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Why are you so...

243
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I'm sorry I'm late, chief.

244
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 What do you think you're doing?

246
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 The alarm suddenly stopped.

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 It's not my fault.

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Besides, the bicycle will puncture and the bus won't come.

249
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 I ran all the way here.

250
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 It's true.

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Idiot.

252
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Don't blame anyone.

253
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Chief, the general public is watching.

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I see.

255
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It can't be helped.

256
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 The alarm broke and the bus was late.

257
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Ryo-chan, you've learned how to drive, haven't you?

258
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Of course.

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 From the tip of my head to the tip of my toes,

260
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 I'm full of traffic safety.

261
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 He's picking up.

262
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Don't mess with me.

263
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Chief, look ahead.

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 It's not a good idea to make a joke

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 about a difficult traffic pattern

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 and teach it to everyone.

267
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 It's okay.

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 You have your own role.

269
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 What are you doing, chief?

270
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I'm going to help you.

271
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 It's scary.

272
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 It's going to be a traffic safety issue.

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I wonder if it's going to be okay.

274
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 We are working day and night

275
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 to protect everyone from traffic accidents and crimes.

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 However, traffic safety...

277
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 I thought it was over when I was late.

278
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I'm going to start the next operation.

279
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Honda, can you hear me?

280
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I can't do that.

281
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Besides, I'm on patrol.

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 I'm a little lazy.

283
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Are you listening to me?

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 I understand.

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 I'm going.

286
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Okay.

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 It can't be helped.

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I'm going.

289
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Wait for me.

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 I'm going.

291
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Please use this opportunity

292
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 to prevent traffic accidents.

293
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I don't have an old man's body.

294
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 How long do I have to hold the microphone?

295
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Chief Ryosu.

296
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 What is it?

297
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Please prepare for the good kids' corner.

298
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Good kids.

299
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 You are small,

300
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 so it's hard to see from the driver's point of view.

301
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Please be careful.

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Yes.

303
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Okay.

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Chief Ryosu,

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I'm hungry to enjoy myself.

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 When you cross the road,

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 raise your hand and cross it.

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Yes.

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Yes.

310
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Yes.

311
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Yes.

312
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Yes.

313
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Yes.

314
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Yes.

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Yes.

316
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 It's dangerous.

317
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 I don't know when the car will come out,

318
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 so be careful.

319
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Okay.

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Next,

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 it's a bicycle accident

322
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 that often happens between elementary school students.

323
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 It's often a traffic accident

324
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 caused by a truck.

325
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Let's recreate that scene here.

326
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Let's do it.

327
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Damn it.

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 It's ridiculous.

329
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Why should I be sad

330
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 when I have to dress like this?

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Hey,

332
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 elementary school students shouldn't call me that.

333
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Kankichi-kun.

334
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 I'm sorry.

335
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Okay.

336
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 In the case of left-hand traffic,

337
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 please be careful

338
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 especially for large trucks.

339
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 At such an intersection,

340
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 when a large truck turns,

341
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 this boy,

342
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 this boy,

343
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 may get involved.

344
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 I'm going to use this boy

345
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 to practice,

346
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 so please keep an eye on him.

347
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Chief,

348
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 don't beat around the bush.

349
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I'm not a chief.

350
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 I'm a driver of a large truck.

351
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 You have to practice hard,

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 elementary school students.

353
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It's good, everyone.

354
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Please pay attention to this guy.

355
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Let's practice.

356
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 When the car turns,

357
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 the rear tire

358
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 comes out inside,

359
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 and in this case,

360
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 that boy will be pulled out.

361
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Damn it.

362
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I'm going to get involved

363
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 in the chief's trap.

364
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Please watch.

365
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 The rear tire comes out here,

366
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 and the boy...

367
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 He dodged it on purpose.

368
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 At this rate,

369
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 my position will be...

370
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I'm sorry,

371
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Ryotsume.

372
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 What about now?

373
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 If you run away like this,

374
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 you might be saved.

375
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 But if you think

376
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 you can run away every time,

377
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 you're mistaken.

378
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Next.

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Next is the real game.

380
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Watch, Ryotsu.

381
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 I won't miss this time.

382
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 This is the end of the game.

383
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 I'll run away as many times as I can.

384
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I won't let the chief

385
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 do what he wants.

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Here we go.

387
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 In this way,

388
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 you need to be careful

389
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 when you run

390
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 parallel to the truck.

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Hey,

392
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 the bicycle

393
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 runs faster than the truck.

394
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 It's to survive

395
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 in a sudden battle.

396
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 In this way,

397
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 the truck

398
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 will never come

399
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 parallel to the truck.

400
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Please be careful.

401
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Everyone,

402
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 be careful.

403
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Damn it.

404
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 The truck jumps,

405
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 spins,

406
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 and comes in.

407
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 How can it be parallel?

408
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 That's right.

409
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 It's like

410
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 a child's fight.

411
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 I don't think

412
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 it's a good idea

413
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 to have traffic safety.

414
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Protect the rules

415
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 of the traffic war

416
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 that you don't know what will happen.

417
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Yes.

418
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Don't you know

419
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 what will happen?

420
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Don't tell me.

421
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 I'll tell you

422
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 the meaning

423
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 of that word,

424
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 chief.

425
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Next,

426
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 is the accident

427
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 of a 50cc bike

428
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 that often happens

429
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 to women.

430
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 It's a 50cc scooter,

431
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 but the speed

432
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 is quite high,

433
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 so please

434
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 keep in mind

435
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 how to ride it.

436
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Thank you for waiting.

437
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 What?

438
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Chief,

439
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 please show me

440
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 how to drive safely.

441
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 I got it.

442
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 I've been waiting for this moment.

443
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Now,

444
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 get in.

445
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Get in.

446
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 What the hell

447
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 are you planning?

448
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 First,

449
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 bend while standing.

450
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Of course,

451
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 don't forget to wear a helmet.

452
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Before

453
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 you bend,

454
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 make sure

455
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 that you turn well.

456
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Ouch!

457
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Ouch!

458
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 What's going on?

459
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I started running on my own.

460
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 I can't even

461
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 use the brake.

462
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Everyone,

463
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 this is a bad omen.

464
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 This scooter

465
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 is modified

466
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 so that I can

467
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 control this radio.

468
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 What's going on?

469
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 What's going on with this scooter?

470
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Now,

471
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 get in,

472
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 radio.

473
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 I'm going to drive safely today.

474
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 What the hell

475
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 are you doing here?

476
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I'll show you.

477
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 What the hell

478
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 are you doing?

479
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Please don't

480
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 ride like this.

481
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 No one is listening.

482
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 What are you

483
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 doing?

484
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Look at Honda.

485
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Idiot!

486
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Honda,

487
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 please be careful.

488
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Now,

489
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 let's try

490
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 a more dangerous car

491
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 with this

492
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 ugly doll.

493
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Damn it.

494
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 The chief

495
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 is going to

496
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 make fun of me.

497
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 As you can see,

498
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 this doll

499
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 is not only

500
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 20kg,

501
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 but also

502
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 a lot of damage.

503
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Now,

504
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 let's speed up

505
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 and see

506
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 how long

507
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 this doll can last.

508
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Poor

509
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Ryo-chan doll.

510
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 It looks like

511
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 the real me

512
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 is being hurt.

513
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Mr. Ryotsu,

514
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 can you

515
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 just shut up?

516
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 No,

517
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 I'm not

518
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 a man

519
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 who

520
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 will

521
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 show my shame.

522
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Now,

523
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 let's try

524
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 with 60kg

525
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 at once.

526
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Will

527
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 that doll

528
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 be able to

529
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 last?

530
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Even though

531
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 it's a doll,

532
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I'm a little

533
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 worried.

534
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 I don't care.

535
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Come on.

536
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 I finally

537
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 made it.

538
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Hey,

539
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 the bike

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 is coming from the sky.

541
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 I don't know

542
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 what's going to happen.

543
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 It's a traffic

544
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 war,

545
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 isn't it?

546
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Damn it.

547
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 You're

548
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 going to

549
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 get in the way

550
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 if you don't

551
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 hurry up.

552
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Yes.

553
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 What are you

554
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 doing?

555
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Can't you catch up?

556
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 No,

557
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 the bike

558
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 is more advantageous

559
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 if it's narrow.

560
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 What are you doing?

561
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Hurry up and

562
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 move on.

563
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 No,

564
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 there's oil

565
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 on the road.

566
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I can't

567
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 move on

568
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 because

569
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 of the

570
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 oil.

571
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Look at

572
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 the traffic

573
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 war.

574
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 It's

575
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 scary.

576
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Oil is

577
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 suddenly

578
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 on the

579
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 road.

580
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Damn

581
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Ryotsu's

582
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 vacation.

583
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 All right,

584
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I'll

585
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 take care of you

586
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 at once.

587
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Is it really

588
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 good?

589
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Ryotsu's

590
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 boss.

591
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 What are you

592
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 afraid of?

593
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 If you do it,

594
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 do it

595
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 thoroughly.

596
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Okay,

597
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I'll do it

598
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 thoroughly.

599
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 I'll do it

600
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 thoroughly.

601
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 I'll do it

602
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 thoroughly.

603
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 I'll do it

604
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 thoroughly.

605
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 What are

606
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 they?

607
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Ryotsu.

608
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Hey,

609
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 is this

610
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 possible?

611
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 It's

612
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 hard to see.

613
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Let's go.

614
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 It's

615
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 cool.

616
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 It's

617
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 cool.

618
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 It's

619
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 cool.

620
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 It's

621
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 cool.

622
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 It's

623
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 cool.

624
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 It's

625
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 cool.

626
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 It's

627
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 cool.

628
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 It's

629
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 cool.

630
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 It's

631
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 cool.

632
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 It's

633
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 cool.

634
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 It's

635
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 cool.

636
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 It's

637
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 cool.

638
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 It's

639
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 cool.

640
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 It's

641
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 cool.

642
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 It's

643
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 cool.

644
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 It's

645
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 cool.

646
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 It's

647
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 cool.

648
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 It's

649
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 cool.

650
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 It's

651
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 cool.

652
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 It's

653
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 cool.

654
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 How

655
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,440
 Thank you for your hard work during this time.

656
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,960
 We will now begin the last practice session.

657
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,160
 The two policemen who are prepared to die will compete in the shock test of the two cars.

658
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,640
 Please don't try this at home.

659
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,800
 Do it, Nakanoa!

660
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,160
 Do it with all your might!

661
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,080
 Are you sure?

662
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
 Do it, Kamawa!

663
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,320
 Chief!

664
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
 Please help me!

665
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,120
 Chief! I'm sorry!

666
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,320
 Stop it!

667
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,520
 I'm not a dummy doll!

668
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
 We did it!

669
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
 Tomorrow we'll have a party at Nakagawa's house!

670
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,680
 It's like the birthday party of the prince of the Kingdom of Hondara!

671
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,080
 It's at Nakagawa's house!

672
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,400
 The food will definitely come out like a mountain!

673
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,200
 Alright!

674
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,600
 I won't eat anything from now on, and I'll make you hungry!

675
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,320
 Next time on Nakagawa-kun no Otaku Haiken

676
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
 Thank you for watching!

677
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
 Thank you for watching!
