1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Ohara family's secret recipe!

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Hey, hey, are you sure this road is safe?

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Yes, I think it's a road that's been made recently.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 If it's not on the map...

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 I haven't seen a single car in this area.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 How about you, Honda?

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 There's no doubt that it's an old road.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 It's always a one-way road.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 But, chief, are you really commuting from here?

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Yes.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 It takes 20 minutes from JR to the train station and the bus.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 It will take at least two and a half hours.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Five hours?

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 By the way, Ryo-chan.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 What did you buy for the chief's birthday present?

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 This.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 It's a secret until it arrives.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 What is it?

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 We all gave each other money, so it's okay to tell me.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Don't worry.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 It's something I specially chose.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 There's no doubt about it.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 That's not what I meant.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I'm just saying that it's strange that the people who give the presents don't know what they're giving away.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 That's right.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I'll just say that it's the best.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Chief, if you see this, you'll surely be impressed and lose your mind.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Huh?

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 We're already in the residential area.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 It should be about time.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 But this looks like a dangerous scene.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Wait, wait, wait.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 What are you doing all of a sudden, senior?

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Huh?

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Sen-senior?

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Um, I'd like to ask you something.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Yes?

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Do you know the otaku named Ohara?

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Oh, if that's the case, it's about a kilometer away.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Is that so?

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 If you don't mind, please get in the car and show me the way.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 I'll take you there.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 But it's a one-way street.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 There's no need to get lost.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Well, well, without saying it, it's called a road trip, isn't it?

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 When I see a beautiful woman, it's this right away.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Get off, Honda.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 This person will get on.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Huh?

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Then what should I do?

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Well, it's right away.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Then you don't have to show me the way.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Um, I don't have to get on forcibly.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I'm sorry. Please wait a minute.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Oh, it's me.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Senpai, this car can fit five people.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Shut up, Nakagawa.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 I don't like small cars.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Ryo-chan, I feel sorry for Mr. Honda.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Reiko, sit in front of me.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Honda!

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Do you think it's bad to let the lady wait?

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 No, no.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Shino, don't go.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Get off quickly.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Come on, come on.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Oh, my God.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Why is it like this?

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Oh, why is it like this?

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Well, let's celebrate your boss's birthday.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 That's right.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 This is also the last day of the week.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 It's hard.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 It's been a long day off.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 I didn't have to go into the mountains.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Yeah, you're right.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I built a house in a place that looks like a raccoon.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Excuse me.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Do you live around here, too?

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Yes.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Well, even so,

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I can't believe you're celebrating my birthday.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 You must be very fond of your subordinate.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It's ridiculous.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I don't listen to what you say.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 What about Ibaru?

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 What will happen?

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 It's suspicious.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 It's not easy to be loved.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Oh, my God.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I can't believe I have to work under such a person.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Well, sometimes you have to take care of yourself.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 In the case of Senpai,

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 I'm bothering you with a lot of things.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 I'm being bothered.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Oh, over there.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I see.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 This is the chief's house.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 A small veranda.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 A garden that I made forcibly.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 But what is it?

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 To build this small house,

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I spent half my life sweating and crying.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 That's right.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 You have to send it to Otaku.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 It's okay.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 I'm here, too.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 What?

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Because this is my house.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 What?

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I mean, maybe...

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 That's right.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 My feet stink.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And I'm Hirobi, the daughter of a boss who doesn't listen to numbers.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Welcome, everyone.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Oh, you're...

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 The chief's?

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Yes.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Well, I've been noticing you for a while.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Yes.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I've heard a lot about you from my father.

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 No, I've always respected you.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 You're really like a mirror to the police.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Yes.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 It's okay.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Don't overdo it.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Because my father is really like that.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 That's right.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Senior!

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I'm here, too.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 I'm home.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Hey, father.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 We have a guest.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Yeah.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Who is it?

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Oh!

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Hello.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 You guys.

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 What are you doing here?

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 What do you mean, what are you doing here?

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Your cute subordinates came all the way here, didn't they?

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 It's cute.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Wait a minute.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 I hate you a thousand times.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Oh, welcome, everyone.

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I'm sorry.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I was suddenly pushed by a crowd.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Thank you.

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Well, get up.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Thank you for your time.

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Here you go.

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Chief, you're a great man.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The construction of this house is well organized.

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 The chieftain has a good personality.

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Yes.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 In addition, the taste of this turtle god.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I'm not going to give this tension to the guests.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 You don't have to get up.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 What are you talking about, father?

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 You came all the way here.

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Come on, Ryozu, get up.

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I didn't know the chieftain had such a cute daughter.

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Should I say that the chieftain gave birth to her?

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Hey, Ryozu.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I'll tell you a little bit, but don't get angry.

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I don't think Hiromi will have an interest in an overbearing man like you.

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 I'm an overbearing man anyway.

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I'll lose to the chieftain.

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 What?

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Father, stop it.

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 This is not a workplace.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Oh, sorry.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 But again.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 What's wrong?

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Why are you suddenly pushing me?

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Oh, are you really not interested?

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Father, happy birthday.

182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Birthday?

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Chieftain, congratulations.

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Congratulations.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Congratulations.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Congratulations, chieftain.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Yes, father.

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Chieftain, do you have anything to say?

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Oh, thank you, everyone.

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Congratulations.

191
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Then you guys.

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 To celebrate my birthday.

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Chieftain, are you crying?

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Idiot.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I'm not crying.

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Yes, father.

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 This is from my mother and me.

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Thank you.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Oh, leather shoes.

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 I'll use it carefully.

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Chieftain.

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 This is a small gift from us.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 What is it?

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 It's pretty big.

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 After all, what did you buy?

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 What is this?

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 What do you think, chieftain?

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It's nostalgic, isn't it?

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I'm doing a nostalgic candy fair in the department store.

210
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Look.

211
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Gindama and menko.

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Gindama and pachinko.

213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Sconbu and sauce senbei.

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 There is also a squid suzuke.

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And this Bakuchiku.

216
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 It used to be 2B.

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 It was a bigger one.

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Chieftain, are you going to use all the money you collected?

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Of course.

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 If you have 20,000 yen, you can buy a lot.

221
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Didn't you know?

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Yes.

223
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Senpai didn't ask me to choose the gift myself.

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 After all, it was a mistake to leave it to Ryo-chan.

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Hey, hey.

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 What is this?

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 What?

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 You don't know menko either?

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Alright.

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Look.

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 This is how you do it.

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 You can get it if you turn it over.

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Wow.

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 It's interesting.

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Menko is like this.

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 You put your hips in like this.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And you do it.

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 What?

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Are you going to lose to me?

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 You did it.

241
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 How was it?

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Gentlemen.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Thank you very much for today.

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 I'm very happy that everyone celebrated my birthday,

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 regardless of whether it was a gift or not.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Regardless of whether it was a gift or not.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 You were playing with it.

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 That's why.

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I want to treat everyone to tea as a sign of gratitude.

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Tea?

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 What is this room?

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 There's nothing here.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 This is a tea room.

254
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 It's a place to drink tea.

255
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Tea room?

256
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Oh, my.

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Even though it's a small house,

258
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 did you make this room just by drinking tea?

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Ryo-chan.

260
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 You have to sit here.

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Is that so?

262
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 What is this?

263
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Oh.

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Please.

265
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Thank you.

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Thank you for being so careful.

267
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Then, I'll be able to...

268
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Ouch.

269
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 You can't touch it right away.

270
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Wait until the manager comes.

271
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 I'm not a fool.

272
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Then, please wait a while.

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Hey, Ryo-chan.

274
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Do you know?

275
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 When you drink tea,

276
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 you can drink it slowly like this.

277
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 What?

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 I know that much.

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 You have to turn it three times like this.

280
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 You're an idiot.

281
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 If you turn it vertically, the tea will spill.

282
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 What a waste.

283
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 It's already started.

284
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Next day

285
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Mr. Honbo,

286
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 is something wrong?

287
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 I got a slipped foot.

288
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,320
 Oh, I was waiting for you.

289
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,200
 Oh, I finally got a bite.

290
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,680
 Well then, I'll take it.

291
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,200
 Hey, you pervert!

292
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,440
 You know nothing about the heart of tea!

293
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
 You don't have to do anything, so just sit there quietly!

294
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,840
 Huh? I understand.

295
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,920
 Hmph.

296
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,640
 Anyway, you pervert.

297
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,760
 I'd like you to taste it with my prideful tea bowl.

298
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
 Tea bowl?

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,680
 This is the most precious thing I have right now.

300
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,360
 Oh, my.

301
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,120
 I found it when I traveled to Kyoto, and I really wanted it.

302
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,760
 I thought I'd use it for the rest of my life, so I bought it.

303
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,680
 It's a black javanese tea bowl.

304
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,240
 It looks like it's pretty good.

305
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,760
 I wonder if it's made by Koetsu.

306
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,600
 Oh, you know what I mean?

307
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,480
 The black koutaku is wonderful.

308
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,440
 I'll make tea for everyone with this tea bowl.

309
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,840
 I'll make tea for everyone with this tea bowl.

310
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,920
 You're an otaku, aren't you?

311
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,560
 You're just a black javanese tea bowl.

312
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
 R-Ryotsu!

313
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,760
 Hey, stop it!

314
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,000
 I said stop it!

315
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,240
 Let me see it!

316
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,960
 Ryotsu!

317
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,480
 Oh!

318
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,840
 Ah!

319
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,280
 Ah!

320
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,720
 Ah!

321
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,240
 Ah!

322
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,920
 Ah!

323
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,120
 Hey, chief, that was close.

324
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
 That was a nice catch.

325
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,280
 You idiot!

326
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,440
 Be careful.

327
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,400
 This tea bowl is worth 400,000 yen.

328
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,920
 Huh? 400,000 yen?

329
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,960
 That cheap tea bowl!

330
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,600
 There are things in the world that you can't understand.

331
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,160
 Ah...

332
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,680
 That was a good catch.

333
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,520
 Yeah.

334
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,880
 You're so slow.

335
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,520
 That was a very good catch.

336
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,560
 Uh, it was very delicious.

337
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,200
 You don't need to know the recipe, you just need to taste it properly.

338
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,640
 Now then,

339
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,400
 I'm not going to tell everyone that I can't make only Ryotsu.

340
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,440
 Yeah, chief.

341
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,200
 I'm better at making tea than making tea.

342
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,160
 Yeah, that might be more suitable for you.

343
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,000
 But,

344
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,320
 I'm not going to tell anyone that I can't make only Ryotsu.

345
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,000
 But,

346
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 I'm preparing the meal right now, so just wait a little longer.

347
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,680
 Dad?

348
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,520
 There's a phone call.

349
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,440
 I see.

350
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,320
 Then Ryotsu,

351
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
 wait for me.

352
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 Don't touch the tea bowl again and again.

353
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,480
 Got it?

354
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,520
 I know.

355
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,920
 Are you sure you're going to be okay?

356
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,960
 Ah, man.

357
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,040
 What the hell is 400,000 yen worth of tea bowl?

358
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,600
 If you're going to be so generous,

359
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
 just put it on your bedside table.

360
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,000
 But,

361
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,440
 I was very nervous to drink tea with 400,000 yen worth of tea bowl.

362
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,560
 The tools of tea look simple,

363
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,680
 and they're all things that can help you sleep.

364
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,480
 I see.

365
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,760
 Oh, this is just right for ear cleaning.

366
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,600
 Senior,

367
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,320
 it's not good for you to do that.

368
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,520
 That's right.

369
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,840
 I don't care.

370
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,720
 Well,

371
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,960
 this time I'll make your tea and pay you.

372
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,080
 I'll just write down the real method,

373
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
 like a washing machine.

374
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,080
 Ah, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...

375
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,640
 Hey, don't do that.

376
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,360
 Ah, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...

377
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,640
 Hey, Ryou-chan,

378
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
 stop it.

379
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
 ...gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...

380
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,560
 Ah, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle!

381
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,320
 Senior!

382
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,920
 Ah...

383
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
 Ow, ow, ow...

384
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,880
 Ah...

385
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,240
 I think I got carried away.

386
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,040
 Ah...

387
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
 Huh?

388
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,800
 R-Ryou-chan...

389
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,040
 Senior...

390
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,640
 Huh?

391
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,040
 W-Why?

392
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,760
 Ah!

393
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,080
 Ah!

394
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,120
 W-W-What?

395
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,760
 I-It's finally...

396
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,600
 ...broken.

397
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,320
 I-It's so easy to break...

398
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,840
 ...the chief must have been fooled.

399
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,040
 Run!

400
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,760
 No, sorry to keep you waiting.

401
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,560
 Hm?

402
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,360
 Ryou-chan, what are you doing?

403
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,200
 Ahem...

404
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,520
 No...

405
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,080
 But, Chief, you're really a beautiful young man, aren't you?

406
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,640
 Hmph.

407
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,320
 Do you know what's good about you?

408
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,480
 Of course I do!

409
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,320
 I feel like I don't want to let go of this wonderful thing.

410
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,280
 Really?

411
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,040
 Then I'll make you some tea, so hurry up and give it back to me.

412
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,600
 N-No, no...

413
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,000
 Please let me sit here for a while longer.

414
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
 No, no!

415
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,360
 It's no use letting you keep it.

416
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,000
 Now, hurry up and give it back to me.

417
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,760
 N-No, just a little bit more...

418
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,680
 No!

419
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,240
 Just a little bit more...

420
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
 Hey, Ryou-chan, that's enough!

421
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,760
 Huh?

422
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,920
 Ah, what's that?

423
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,880
 Huh?

424
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,720
 Gah...

425
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,080
 Hey, wait, Ryou-chan!

426
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
 Don't you want to wait?

427
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,400
 Is the tea party over?

428
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,240
 I'm preparing for the barbecue right now, but...

429
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,720
 That's...

430
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,960
 Barbecue?

431
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,680
 It'll be ready soon.

432
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,080
 Oh, thank you.

433
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,920
 Where are you, Ryou-chan?

434
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,040
 There you are.

435
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,120
 Here, hurry up and give it back to me.

436
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,120
 Hey, Ryou-chan!

437
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,240
 Hey, Chief, when you look at it in nature,

438
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,640
 it's even more beautiful, isn't it?

439
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,800
 That's enough.

440
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,760
 Hurry up and give it back to me.

441
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
 What's wrong with you?

442
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,120
 N-No...

443
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,800
 You?

444
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,840
 You're being rude to our guest.

445
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,280
 Here, Ryou-chan.

446
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,760
 Please eat up.

447
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,680
 I'm sorry.

448
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,440
 I'll forgive you if you give it back now.

449
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,760
 Here, hurry up and give it back to me.

450
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,880
 You're right.

451
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
 If you give it back now, you'll forgive me, right?

452
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,080
 Yeah, men don't have a second thought.

453
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,720
 What should I do?

454
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,240
 Please, give it back to me.

455
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,880
 Raku-chan is easy to break.

456
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,720
 What should I do if something happens to him?

457
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
 I'll have to take it back.

458
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,720
 You!

459
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
 Why are you acting like a child?

460
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,480
 Ryouchi-san can't eat meat, can he?

461
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,320
 That's enough, Dad.

462
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,680
 If you give that tea bowl to Ryouchi-san for a while...

463
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,520
 I-I'm not going to do that, you idiot!

464
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,680
 It's terrible to call your daughter an idiot.

465
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,640
 Oh, no.

466
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,360
 I'm sorry.

467
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
 Then it's fine.

468
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
 Mr. Honda, over there, it's burnt.

469
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
 Then, I'll eat it.

470
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
 Ryou-chan, why aren't you eating it?

471
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,360
 You're such a good boy.

472
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
 That's right.

473
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
 Hurry up and eat it.

474
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
 Reiko, let me eat it.

475
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,360
 I refuse.

476
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,360
 Hey, Ryouchi.

477
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,360
 Here, drink it for the time being.

478
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
 No, I won't.

479
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
 That's not for drinking beer.

480
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
 Here, drink it.

481
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
 No, it's not for drinking beer.

482
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
 Here.

483
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
 No, it's not for drinking beer.

484
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
 That's not for a senior like you.

485
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
 It's fine.

486
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
 Here.

487
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
 Here.

488
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,360
 Honey, the meat is burnt.

489
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
 What was that?

490
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
 What?

491
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
 It was my imagination.

492
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
 I felt like I saw two tea bowls.

493
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360
 You're drunk already, aren't you?

494
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
 There's no way that would happen.

495
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
 Ryouchi, show me the tea bowl.

496
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
 That's...

497
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
 Ryouchi!

498
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,360
 What did you do to that tea bowl?

499
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,360
 I can't take it anymore for someone like you to make an important tea bowl into a toy.

500
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
 Hey, give it back!

501
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
 Wait, Ryouchi.

502
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
 I can't take it anymore for someone like you to make an important tea bowl into a toy.

503
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
 I can't take it anymore for someone like you to make an important tea bowl into a toy.

504
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
 Hey, Ryouchi.

505
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
 My tea bowl...

506
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,360
 It broke because of the chief.

507
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
 It was my...

508
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
 It was my...

509
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,360
 It was my only treasure.

510
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,360
 What should I live for tomorrow?

511
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
 Hey, Dad.

512
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
 Don't be so depressed.

513
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
 Why don't you buy a new one?

514
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
 Okay?

515
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
 It's so good.

516
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
 Ryouchi!

517
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
 What?

518
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,360
 Hurry up and eat it.

519
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
 I'll eat it all by myself.

520
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
 Ryouchi, apologize to him.

521
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
 I feel sorry for the chief.

522
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,360
 Chief, things that have shape will eventually break.

523
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
 That's the truth of all things.

524
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,360
 Anyway, let's eat meat. It's delicious.

525
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
 I don't need it. You eat it.

526
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
 Then I won't have to.

527
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,360
 Ryouchi!

528
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
 Chief, actually...

529
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
 Hey, idiot! Stop it!

530
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,360
 That's what happened.

531
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
 What?

532
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,360
 Chief, I didn't mean to be mean.

533
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
 Ryouchi...

534
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
 I won't forgive you!

535
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
 Chief...

536
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
 Hey, chief!

537
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,360
 I don't like barbecue!

538
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
 Stop it!

539
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
 Ouch, ouch, ouch!

540
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,360
 You're self-sufficient, Ryouchi.

541
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,360
 It's been a long time, Hiromi.

542
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,360
 But it looks like you're having fun, father.

543
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
 Ryouchi's charcoal barbecue.

544
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
 Ouch, ouch, ouch!

545
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,360
 This is the best present for me.

546
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
 Please forgive me.

547
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,360
 Nakagawa, Reiko, Honda, Hiromi, please help me!

548
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,360
 The End

549
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,360
 The End

550
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,360
 The End

551
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
 The End

552
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,360
 Height 167 cm. Weight 71 kg.

553
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
 Both of them have 2.0kg.

554
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,360
 Chief, are you going to challenge this perfect body?

555
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
 Fine.

556
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,360
