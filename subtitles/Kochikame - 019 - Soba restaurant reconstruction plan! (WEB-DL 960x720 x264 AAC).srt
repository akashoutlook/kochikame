1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Nobaya Rebuild Plan

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 It's so rusty.

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Do you want some hot soba?

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Sounds good.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 It wasn't a very popular restaurant before.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 It's about time we could go in.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Hey, you!

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 You're in danger!

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 You bastard!

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Senpai!

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 This guy...

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 He's been on TV a lot lately.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 He's a food critic.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 It's you, Chogoro.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 This taste...

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 It's not ordinary.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 There's a restaurant that's not ordinary as usual.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Is the owner here?

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Yes, yes, yes, yes!

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Oh, this is for you, Sensei.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Please come in.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Hey, hey!

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 This is for you, you bastard!

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Oh, well, Senpai.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Here you go.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 It's not ordinary.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It's like a hand-made dish.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 You're so generous.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 We've been waiting for three hours under the cold sky.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I'm hungry.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 This soba is not ordinary.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Thank you very much!

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 There's a restaurant that's not ordinary as usual.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 As I thought, the soba here is top-notch.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 It doesn't matter if it's just soba or not.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 When the winter is over, hurry up and open the seats.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Master, I want to show my acquaintance

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 that this is not just soba.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Please give me 200 people.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 200 people is more than 100,000 yen.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Master, am I a Japanese food critic?

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 It's you, Cho Goro.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Of course, I don't need an offer.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Please enjoy your meal.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Keep up the good work.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Thank you very much.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 It's finally gone.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Well, it's our turn next.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 What?

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Hey, old man.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 What's going on?

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 We wanted to eat warm soba,

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 so we waited for three hours under this cold sky.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 It's you.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Master took all the soba.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 What?

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 No way.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I want to cry here.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 You shouldn't have put it on a magazine like this.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Damn it.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I see.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Because it was introduced in this magazine,

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 the number of customers suddenly increased.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 He put this on and ate it.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 He's ridiculous.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Damn it.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 It doesn't matter if it's just soba or not.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Hey, isn't there a restaurant to eat warm soba?

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Master, how about this soba restaurant?

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 What?

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Sorry.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 It's like there's no sign of customers.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 It's dangerous here.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Why?

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 You don't know?

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 It's not normal that it's not popular here.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 If you eat a lot of soba,

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 you can't eat warm soba.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Are you a customer?

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 I was going to say that.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Thank you.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 What's wrong?

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Actually, you are the fifth customer.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 The fifth today?

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 I guess so.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 No, I'm the fifth customer since I started the restaurant.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 What?

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Wait.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 When did you start the restaurant?

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Three years ago.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Three years ago?

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I'll make it right away.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 What are you going to do?

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Actually, my stomach is getting weird all of a sudden.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Senior, I feel sorry for you.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Let's eat it.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 If you eat soba here and your stomach gets weird,

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 what are you going to do?

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 If something happens,

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 I'll do something with the medical team of Nakagawa Corp.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I'll be the fifth customer.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Please.

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Okay, okay.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I'll be the fifth customer.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Thank you for waiting.

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 This soba looks bad.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Let's eat it and go back to the restaurant.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Don't look at me.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 I'm sorry.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 You're worried about the customer's reaction, aren't you?

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Yes.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I'll tell you what I think after I finish eating.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 So go over there while I'm eating.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Yes.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 It's a normal soba.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 It's not that bad that I can't eat it.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 This is...

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 What's wrong, Nakagawa?

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Master, I have something to ask you.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Yes, what is it?

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Are you using the soba that was made at the Yamada Farm?

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Yes, that's right.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 What is the Yamada Farm?

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 People who know know.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 It's the farm of the master of making soba, Mr. Yamada Dengoro.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 The soba made here is said to be the best in Japan,

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 but it's difficult to get it.

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Even in the cooking department of the Nakagawa Group,

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 only a small part of the shop is used.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I've been close to Mr. Yamada for a long time,

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 so he makes it cheaply at home.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I see.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And the soy sauce used for the soup.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Isn't this made with sugar syrup?

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Yes.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 The sugar syrup is made from handmade soy sauce.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 It is said to be the birthplace of soy sauce,

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 and it has the traditional taste of Kishu.

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 The soy sauce made here is called soy sauce in soy sauce.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 No, not only soy sauce.

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Katsuobushi and kelp.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 It is a must-have ingredient to make this rich soup stock.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 The leek is well-sealed and used for a glossy and wonderful thing.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And seven-spice chili.

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 The seven flavors create an exquisite harmony.

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 It works well on the body,

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 and it is no doubt that it uses a very well-chosen material.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Hey, hey.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 How can you use such a great ingredient

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 to make such a normal soba?

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Normal?

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Senpai, please look at your bowl.

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Huh?

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Huh? When did you say that?

158
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 That's what a really delicious thing is.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 It naturally enters the body.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Hey, dad.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 One more cup, please.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Y-Yes.

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Hmm.

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 It is certainly quite delicious if you taste it carefully.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Isn't it?

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 It has this much flavor.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Please promote it more.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I'm not very good at flashy things.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Besides, it's strange.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 If it has this much flavor,

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 it's likely that customers will come.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 But there is a deep reason why customers don't come.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 A deep reason?

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 A deep reason?

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Three years ago, I didn't even forget.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 On the day I went to Koiki,

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I opened this store.

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I was nervous,

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 and I was waiting for the first customer to come.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Then...

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Sorry.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 What?

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Omaeda?

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Did Omaeda-sensei come to eat on purpose?

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 No.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 I came to borrow the toilet.

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Hmm.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 So this is a soba restaurant.

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 I didn't notice it because it was too simple,

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 but it's just right.

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Let's eat here for lunch.

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Yes. I'll make it right away.

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 After all, it was my first customer,

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 so I put a lot of effort into it.

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Please.

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Omaeda

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 How was it?

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 It's a simple dish,

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 but it has a unique taste.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I see.

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Excuse me.

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 It will be 700 yen.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Master,

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 I don't think anyone knows who I am.

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 I'm Omaeda Chogoro, a gourmet philosopher.

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Yes.

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 So it will be 700 yen for a bowl of soba.

208
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I'm Omaeda Chogoro, a gourmet philosopher in Japan.

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 So it will be 700 yen for a bowl of soba.

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 I'm Omaeda Chogoro, a gourmet philosopher in Japan.

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 So it will be 700 yen for a bowl of soba.

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 I'm Omaeda Chogoro, a gourmet philosopher in Japan.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 So it will be 700 yen for a bowl of soba.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Unfortunately, I don't have any cash.

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Please forgive me.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 It should be about 20,000 to 30,000 yen.

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Thank you very much.

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Master, what's the name of this restaurant?

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 It's Tanaka Soba.

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Tanaka Soba.

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 I'll remember it.

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 In the end, the dining room was a fake.

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 It's a big story.

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I was surprised a week later.

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I was very upset about my restaurant.

226
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It's not a human food.

227
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Even if the world forgives me, I won't forgive you.

228
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Minus seven stars.

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 That's terrible.

230
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 That's terrible.

231
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Don't say that.

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 But my restaurant is being introduced.

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 It's only a negative image.

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 It's a terrible article.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 It's just a criticism.

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 It's because I couldn't eat it.

237
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I can't forgive you for taking my soba.

238
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I can't forgive you for taking my soba.

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 It's strange that a person who doesn't know the taste is a gourmet philosopher.

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 If you make me angry, I'll let you know what will happen.

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Okay, master?

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Yes, if I can do it.

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Leave it to me.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 I have a good idea.

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Wash your head and wait.

246
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Omaeda Chogoro.

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 In order to make Omaeda say it, you need to make a sacrifice.

248
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Are you ready?

249
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Yes.

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 From now on, Omaeda Chogoro will make you say it.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 What are you doing?

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 It's not good to be treated like a gourmet philosopher.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 You need to be taught a lesson.

254
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I see.

255
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 You're trying to make me feel like I've been suffering for years.

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 That's right.

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 This bowl should be a little lively.

258
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Myeden!

259
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 You're a gourmet philosopher.

260
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Do you have any help?

261
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I'm fine with anything.

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Use anything that can make you feel traditional and distant.

263
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Okay.

264
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Next...

265
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Ryo-san, what are you doing?

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Oh, I came to a good place.

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I remember you said that you made a bowl of rice during the time you were at school.

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Yeah, but it's covered in dust, and it also contains shrimp.

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 It's more convenient this way.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Bring it here.

271
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Lend it to your friends.

272
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Okay, Ryo-san.

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 You're here.

274
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 The World's Greatest Museum

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 I came back from the World's Greatest Museum.

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 All of them tell the history of mankind.

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Good, good.

278
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Excuse me.

279
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I think it's unnatural to have something like this in a simple soba restaurant.

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 It's okay.

281
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 It's better to have something like this.

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 That's right.

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Let's make this a celebration from Cleopatra.

284
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 It's a mess.

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Something like this, huh?

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 All right.

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 By the way, I'll take one of the pillars.

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Please stop.

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 If you cut this, the building itself will break.

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 That's true.

291
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Ryo-san!

292
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Ryo-san!

293
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 I brought it!

294
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 All right, all right.

295
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 It's perfect.

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Now the restaurant is okay.

297
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 All that's left is...

298
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 No, no way!

299
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Please stop!

300
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 That's all!

301
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 That's all!

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I'm the owner of the restaurant.

303
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 I'm the owner of the restaurant.

304
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Oh, come on.

305
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Stop it!

306
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Don't make a bad voice!

307
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Huh?

308
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 That bike is...

309
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 You're being naughty again, Kankichi!

310
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Hey!

311
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Mr. Nakagawa!

312
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 It's over.

313
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Come on.

314
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But...

315
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Why are you embarrassed?

316
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 You're being naughty again.

317
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I'll tell Chief Ohara.

318
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Hey!

319
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Hey!

320
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Hey!

321
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Hey!

322
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I'm a pervert.

323
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Are you that happy?

324
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 He's lamenting my misfortune.

325
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Now the stage is ready.

326
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Nakagawa, prepare the cherry blossoms.

327
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Yes, sir.

328
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 All that's left is to chase after the prey.

329
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Is there really a good soba restaurant that can line up like this?

330
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Yes.

331
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 According to the information from the viewers,

332
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 they can line up two kilos of food every day.

333
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Isn't that it?

334
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 That's amazing.

335
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Soba restaurants are all lined up like this?

336
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Today, I'm going to interview

337
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Ohmaeda Chogoro, the best gourmet philosopher in Japan,

338
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 and the owner of this fantastic soba restaurant.

339
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I'm Ohmaeda Chogoro.

340
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Who are you guys?

341
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Mr. Ohmaeda is going to interview this restaurant.

342
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Would you like to come with us?

343
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Yes.

344
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Make sure you don't get in the way.

345
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Sir,

346
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 what's your first impression of the restaurant?

347
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Hey, do you know?

348
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Mr. Ohmaeda,

349
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 this restaurant has been running for 20 generations since its opening.

350
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Yes.

351
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 It's said that it's the most important cultural asset in the country.

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Most important in the country?

353
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Yes.

354
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 This restaurant probably has been running since its opening.

355
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 This wound must have been caused by a fierce battle

356
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 between the Ishin army and the Baku army

357
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 in front of this restaurant during Meiji Isshin.

358
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Even though it's a wound made by your senior.

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 It's easy to be fooled, isn't it?

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 This Meira has been left behind.

361
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 It's one of the best restaurants in the world.

362
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 This restaurant isn't just any ordinary restaurant.

363
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 The restaurant isn't just any ordinary restaurant.

364
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 I can't wait to see it.

365
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Excuse me.

366
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 You idiot, get out of here.

367
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 This restaurant has only one chili pepper.

368
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 And you're going to use it twice.

369
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Please tell the manager.

370
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 What are you doing?

371
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Hurry up.

372
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Are you really going to wear this costume?

373
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Of course.

374
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Get ready.

375
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Because of the article he wrote,

376
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 only five people have been here for three years.

377
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Only five customers came.

378
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Remember that.

379
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Go.

380
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I'm sorry, manager.

381
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 The one who doesn't follow the rules of the restaurant

382
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 is a customer.

383
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Don't come here again.

384
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Amazing.

385
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 It's a restaurant for craftsmen.

386
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 What do you think, Mr. Omaeda?

387
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 With the current situation,

388
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 the people of the British royal room have been kicked out, haven't they?

389
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Yes.

390
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 But now that they're back,

391
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 they're going to eat at Buckingham Palace every week.

392
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 The British royal room.

393
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 He's just trying to protect the taste of soba.

394
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And look at this angel.

395
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 He's wearing a traditional geta,

396
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 but he's actively taking the Western style

397
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 that doesn't fit the tradition.

398
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 He's in a very warm and friendly posture.

399
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 The owner of the restaurant.

400
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 He's not an ordinary person.

401
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 He's not an ordinary person again.

402
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Why, why, you guys?

403
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Don't you know me?

404
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 I'm Omaeda Chogoro, a gourmet critic.

405
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 We're here to interview you.

406
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 What?

407
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Interview me?

408
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Idiot!

409
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Don't interview me.

410
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 If you interview me on TV,

411
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 people who don't know the taste of soba will come to you.

412
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 If there are more customers,

413
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 I'll be busy and it won't work.

414
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Come on.

415
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Don't shoot me.

416
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 The customers are the customers.

417
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 We just serve the soba as usual.

418
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Yes, sir.

419
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Wonderful!

420
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 I've eaten all kinds of food in the world,

421
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 but I've never had so delicious soba before.

422
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I'll put the money here.

423
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 As expected, the president of the United Nations is just a regular customer.

424
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 People who say this is bad are not human.

425
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 The president of the United Nations.

426
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I'll wait for you.

427
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Well, how about the taste of the important soba?

428
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 The texture of the soba, the way to take the soup stock,

429
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 the way to cut the leek,

430
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 and this artistic bowl.

431
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I made it.

432
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 It doesn't matter which one you take.

433
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 It's not just anything.

434
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I'll give you the seven stars,

435
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 which is not just anything.

436
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 You must be happy, too.

437
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Hey, you!

438
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 What's going on?

439
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 What are you doing?

440
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Shut up!

441
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Look at this!

442
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Tanaka Soba?

443
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Even if you look at this, you can't remember it.

444
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 This store is...

445
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 You finally remember it.

446
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Yes, it's Tanaka Soba,

447
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 which you put the minus seven stars three years ago.

448
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 What's going on?

449
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Nothing has changed here since three years ago.

450
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 They've been using high-quality materials

451
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 to make the best soba since long ago.

452
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Is that so?

453
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 It seems that you confessed yourself.

454
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You really don't know the taste of soba.

455
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Oh, no!

456
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 You're not the kind of guy who can name food critics.

457
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 The truth is just a taste test.

458
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Mr. Tanaka!

459
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Is what you said true?

460
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Please explain it to me, sir!

461
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 No comment!

462
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Mr. Tanaka!

463
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 The plan was a great success!

464
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 The magical soba shop was a success,

465
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 but Ohmaeda was a taste test.

466
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Tanaka's soba shop seems to be in a good shape since then.

467
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Yeah.

468
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 But since then, Ohmaeda has been

469
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 not listening to the news at all.

470
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 What?

471
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 What's wrong?

472
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 A mysterious family food critic has appeared.

473
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Recently, a person who calls himself a family food critic

474
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 has entered the city,

475
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 and is eating with him.

476
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 This is Ohmaeda, isn't it?

477
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 He's a cool guy.

478
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 He's not an ordinary person.

479
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 He's not an ordinary person.

480
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 The End

481
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 I don't care about real studies.

482
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I just want to remember.

483
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Life is meaningful when it's useful.

484
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 I'll teach you how to enjoy your life

485
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 and how to study in a practical way.

486
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Next time,

487
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 the test method of the quantum formula.

488
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 See you next time!

489
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 The End

490
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Even if it rains,

491
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 tomorrow will be sunny.

492
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Bye-bye!

493
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Shake hands!

494
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Say goodbye to the unpleasant things.

495
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Oh yeah!

496
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Let's live the way we like.

497
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 There are good things.

498
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Outside the door,

499
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 the sun is calling.
