1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,940
 Ah!

5
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,860
 The southern wind blows

6
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,860
 Ah!

7
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,820
 The southern wind blows

8
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,780
 Ah!

9
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,240
 Nagisa-de!

10
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,060
 Nagisa-de!

11
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,340
 Ureborii!

12
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,780
 Hugely popular! Flying food stalls

13
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,700
 The Big Rebellion

14
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,700
 The Sky-Flying Yatai

15
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
 What's this?

16
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,700
 A wish for a long-distance relationship?

17
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,700
 A wish for a long-distance relationship?

18
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
 You're going to quit, senpai?

19
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,700
 I don't like it, chief!

20
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,700
 Please call it a wish for a vacation!

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,700
 A wish for a vacation!

22
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
 Idiot!

23
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,700
 You're an adult and you don't even write kanji!

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
 You're going to quit, senpai?

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
 Are you going to go out with me?

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
 No way.

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
 I'll write the reason in detail.

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
 Reason?

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
 The reason for the Tameyari Fireworks Festival?

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
 The reason for the Tameyari Fireworks Festival?

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
 I've never seen a firework festival since I was a kid.

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
 I've never seen a firework festival since I was a kid.

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
 Idiot!

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,100
 Do you know what kind of job you're doing?

35
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
 Of course! I'm a police officer!

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:40,100
 Do you think it's okay for a police officer to take a vacation at a firework festival?

37
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,100
 The firework festival is held every year by amazing people.

38
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,100
 I want to borrow a cat's hand as a guard.

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,100
 It can't be helped. I'll pay for it.

40
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,100
 If you do that, you'll be fired right away!

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,100
 It's a joke! It's a joke!

42
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,100
 The firework festival is held every year by amazing people.

43
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,100
 The head of the department store is using the firework festival every day.

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,100
 It would be great if I rode him and saw the fireworks.

45
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
 Damn!

46
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,100
 There's no way I can rest well.

47
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,100
 Hey, Ryo!

48
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
 Yes?

49
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
 Hey!

50
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
 What?

51
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
 What?

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
 I just thought I'd pay you back.

53
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
 I can't pay you back.

54
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 Is it that expensive?

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
 Yes.

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,800
 If Ryo pays me back, I'll have to pay for the firework festival.

57
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
 This is a step ahead of us.

58
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 There are big apartments all over the place.

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 Aren't there more people eating ramen?

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 In a high-rise apartment, you can't even hear the sound of the firework festival.

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 You should pay me back.

62
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
 I have a cell phone.

63
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
 No, I can't.

64
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 I'm alone.

65
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,500
 I can't ride the elevator while pulling the bar.

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 It takes too much money to pay with a helicopter.

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
 And the engine is noisy.

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
 It's easier.

69
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
 The firework festival

70
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,900
 Hey, Kazushika Balloon Club!

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 Hey, Ryo.

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 Are you nervous about the firework festival?

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
 Yes, I borrowed money.

74
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 Where's the old guy?

75
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
 He's in the warehouse.

76
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 If you don't mind, could you lend him to me?

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
 He has a friend who's interested in it.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
 Yes.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
 It's a great honor for us to have more friends.

80
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
 I don't mind.

81
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
 The firework festival

82
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,300
 Are we going to ride this and go out?

83
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,300
 We can use propane gas for fuel.

84
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,300
 Are we going to make ramen in this?

85
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
 What do you think?

86
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
 Oh, no.

87
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,300
 He seems to like it.

88
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,300
 He said he wanted to ride it.

89
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,300
 Oh, please.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Let's try it.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 It's inflating.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Remember the procedure.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 What?

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 We'll drive it on the show.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 What?

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 You're not asking him to do it?

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Do you think he'll be happy to do it?

98
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,700
 Besides, in Japan, it's not allowed to fly at night.

99
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,700
 What if the bearded man knows about this plan?

100
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,700
 Beards are scary when they get angry.

101
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,700
 They might bite you to death.

102
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
 Ryo, get in the car.

103
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
 Okay.

104
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,700
 Calm down.

105
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,700
 It's flying.

106
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
 You're a pro.

107
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
 The basic movement of the hot air balloon is adjusted with this burner.

108
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,400
 It can fly high.

109
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
 It doesn't have to fly that high.

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
 It can fly as high as a high-rise apartment.

111
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
 What?

112
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
 What?

113
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,400
 It can also release the heat when it is fast.

114
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
 Releasing the heat?

115
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
 You're enthusiastic.

116
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
 What?

117
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
 It's a business.

118
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
 No.

119
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
 I want to be a professional in the hot air balloon.

120
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,100
 I want to do business flying in the sky in elementary school.

121
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
 That's what you wrote, right?

122
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
 Yes.

123
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
 I'm counting on you.

124
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
 I'll help you.

125
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
 Thank you.

126
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
 I'm hungry.

127
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
 We're running out of time.

128
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
 It's a hassle to go to the convenience store.

129
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 What's that?

130
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
 What?

131
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
 It says ramen.

132
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
 No way.

133
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 The phone number is also written.

134
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
 I'll try calling it.

135
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
 Yes, it's an emergency ramen.

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
 Are you on your way?

137
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,800
 Can I have two ramen, please?

138
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
 Yes.

139
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
 Two ramen, please.

140
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
 Which one do you want?

141
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
 No. 8, 3011, Yamada.

142
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
 30 times, right?

143
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 Every time.

144
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
 I was able to order it properly.

145
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
 But how do I deliver it?

146
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
 It's getting closer.

147
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
 I'm scared.

148
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
 It's delicious.

149
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
 You're Yamada, right?

150
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
 Yes.

151
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
 I got it.

152
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
 You're fast.

153
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
 Thank you.

154
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
 You're welcome.

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
 Sorry to keep you waiting.

156
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
 It's 1,000 yen.

157
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
 It's an emergency ramen.

158
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
 Hello.

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
 Three ramen, please.

160
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 4023, Beat.

161
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
 All right.

162
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
 It's that room.

163
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
 I got it.

164
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
 I'm on my way.

165
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,900
 Here's your ramen.

166
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
 It's 700 yen.

167
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,900
 Five ramen, please.

168
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
 I got it.

169
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
 I'm busy.

170
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
 Ryo-san.

171
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
 Someone called the police.

172
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
 What should we do?

173
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,900
 It's an emergency.

174
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
 Formation.

175
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
 It's an emergency.

176
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
 Where is it?

177
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
 It's dark.

178
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
 It's too dark to see.

179
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
 It's a plan to destroy the world.

180
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,900
 That's why I painted the ground black.

181
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
 I'm not good at it.

182
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
 If you get caught,

183
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,900
 your business will go up.

184
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,900
 I didn't think it would go up so much.

185
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,900
 If you do it like this,

186
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
 I'll do it on purpose.

187
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
 I'm not good at it.

188
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
 Good.

189
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,900
 But is it okay for the police to do part-time jobs?

190
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
 Is it okay?

191
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,900
 I'm a police officer.

192
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
 I have a duty to help people in need.

193
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,900
 If there are people hungry at night,

194
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
 it's the way to help people.

195
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,900
 A suspicious situation

196
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
 has been witnessed in the neighborhood

197
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
 of a high-rise apartment in the city.

198
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,900
 It's likely to appear tonight.

199
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
 It's a big deal.

200
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
 Enhance the night patrol

201
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
 and work on the discovery.

202
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,900
 Do you understand?

203
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
 Do you understand?

204
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,900
 But I don't think it will appear tonight.

205
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,900
 Why do you understand that?

206
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,900
 That's what he said.

207
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
 I'm a police officer.

208
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
 Did you know

209
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,900
 that you were a police officer?

210
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,900
 What?

211
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
 What do you want to bet?

212
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,900
 1,000 yen.

213
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,900
 Idiot!

214
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,900
 Do you think it's okay

215
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,900
 to do part-time jobs?

216
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
 Sir, how about this?

217
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,900
 If Ryo-chan

218
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,900
 gets a clue about a suspicious situation,

219
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
 he can make the fireworks day

220
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,900
 a holiday.

221
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,900
 I see.

222
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
 What do you think, Ryo-tsu?

223
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,900
 Is it okay?

224
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
 That's right.

225
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,900
 Whatever.

226
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
 I want to

227
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
 sing and dance

228
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
 in the summer.

229
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
 Thank you for your hard work.

230
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,900
 Senpai.

231
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
 It's up there.

232
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,900
 What?

233
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,900
 What are you doing?

234
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,900
 It's not like that.

235
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
 Then what is it?

236
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,900
 Can you see a woman?

237
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,900
 Well, please take a look.

238
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,900
 A bird?

239
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,900
 What?

240
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,900
 It's a bird.

241
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
 It's so dark

242
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,900
 that I can see it clearly.

243
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,900
 It's a starlight scope

244
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,900
 used by the U.S. military.

245
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
 If you look at it with this,

246
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
 you can immediately

247
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
 find the black, suspicious balloon.

248
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,900
 That's not good.

249
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,900
 Oh, no.

250
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
 I got something amazing.

251
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
 Senpai, why don't you

252
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,900
 find the balloon together

253
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,900
 and get a reward?

254
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,900
 I'll give it to you.

255
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,900
 Hey, what are you doing here?

256
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
 Oh, Ryo-san.

257
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,900
 Well, Ryo-san always

258
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
 let me make a living,

259
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,900
 so I thought I'd deliver a late-night meal.

260
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
 Idiot!

261
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
 What if I get caught

262
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
 and get suspicious?

263
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
 Oh, a ramen shop?

264
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
 I was just hungry.

265
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,900
 Oh, it's my first time

266
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
 eating ramen at a ramen shop,

267
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
 so I'd like to try it.

268
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
 It smells delicious.

269
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,900
 What?

270
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,900
 Is a ramen shop

271
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,900
 like this?

272
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
 Huh?

273
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,900
 Yes, it's a ramen shop

274
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,900
 run by a police officer

275
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,900
 in Onzo City, Nakagawa District.

276
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,900
 I don't eat ramen often.

277
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
 That's not a hobby.

278
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
 You sell ramen, don't you?

279
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,900
 Huh?

280
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
 The phone is ringing.

281
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
 Oh, hello.

282
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,900
 Yes, hello.

283
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
 Kikyu Ramen...

284
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
 No, it's just a ramen shop.

285
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
 Huh?

286
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,900
 Just a ramen shop?

287
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,900
 It's a Kikyu Ramen shop, isn't it?

288
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,900
 What time do you come here tonight?

289
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,900
 Oh, sorry.

290
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
 I'm off today.

291
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
 Oh, yes.

292
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
 Nice to meet you.

293
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
 You're closed

294
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
 because you're closed, aren't you?

295
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
 Oh, no.

296
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
 I was going to get up early

297
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
 tonight.

298
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
 Hey, Ryo-san.

299
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
 Don't ask me.

300
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
 I don't know anything.

301
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
 That's right.

302
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
 Kikyu Ramen

303
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
 Cat.

304
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,900
 Air gun.

305
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,900
 Triangle.

306
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,900
 Oh, Ryo-san.

307
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,900
 I'll open it now.

308
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
 What's with that luggage?

309
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
 You can make a profit

310
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,900
 just by eating ramen.

311
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,900
 The theory of business

312
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
 is to develop it

313
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
 according to the needs of the times.

314
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
 Oh.

315
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
 It's called

316
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,900
 the flying convenience store.

317
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,900
 Everyone,

318
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,900
 sorry to keep you waiting.

319
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
 Kikyu Ramen is here.

320
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
 Hi, Kikyu Ramen.

321
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
 Oh, hi.

322
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,900
 Three char siu noodles, please.

323
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
 Can I have a rice ball, too?

324
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
 Sure.

325
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,900
 The idol hell limited edition

326
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
 set, please.

327
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
 Oh, I wanted this.

328
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,900
 Hey, can I have a cigarette?

329
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,900
 Sure.

330
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,900
 Oh, you have everything.

331
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,900
 I want chocolate.

332
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,900
 I'll have yakisoba with oolong tea.

333
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
 Thank you.

334
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,900
 I'll have coffee when I'm sleepy.

335
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
 Please go home.

336
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
 Hey, melon and strawberry milk.

337
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,900
 Which one would you like?

338
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
 Oh, thank you.

339
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
 Oh, by the way, can I get two or three weekly magazines?

340
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
 Sure.

341
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
 Oh, I'm in a hurry.

342
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
 This is a big profit.

343
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
 Oh, look.

344
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,900
 It's Kikyu.

345
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
 It's here.

346
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
 Okay, I'll go after it.

347
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
 This is Naoko.

348
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,900
 I found it.

349
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
 Okay.

350
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
 Kei, please prepare the starlight scope.

351
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
 Okay.

352
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,900
 It was worth it.

353
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
 Hello.

354
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,900
 I'm sorry.

355
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
 It's sold out today.

356
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
 Let's go.

357
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
 Ryo, it's a mini-pato.

358
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
 What?

359
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
 That's for Kobachi and Naoko.

360
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
 Okay.

361
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
 It's a mini-pato for formation.

362
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
 It's gone.

363
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,900
 It's okay.

364
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,900
 I can see it with the moonlight.

365
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
 Oh, that's it.

366
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
 That's it.

367
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,900
 This is my strategy.

368
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
 I'm working hard.

369
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
 I can't see the moon.

370
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
 I just need to see the smoke.

371
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
 But I can't see the road.

372
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
 It's gone.

373
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
 Damn it.

374
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
 I can't see anything.

375
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
 It's gone.

376
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,900
 I thought I was going to die.

377
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
 Damn it.

378
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
 Kikyu seems to be heading this way.

379
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,900
 I can't see it at all.

380
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
 It's okay even in the dark.

381
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
 That telescope.

382
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
 It should be perfect

383
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
 until a few kilometers away.

384
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
 Oh, Kei.

385
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,900
 This lens.

386
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,900
 What's wrong?

387
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
 This is a black pen.

388
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
 Who did this?

389
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
 If you say so.

390
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
 If you say so.

391
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
 I don't want to be caught so easily.

392
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
 I'm sorry, Ryo.

393
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,900
 I helped you until the last minute.

394
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
 I can pay you back in a little while.

395
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
 Where is the other person?

396
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
 Hey, it's a convenience store ramen.

397
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
 I'd like to ask for your number.

398
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
 This voice.

399
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,900
 After all, Ryo-chan.

400
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,900
 I'm sorry, Ryo-chan.

401
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
 Today is the last day.

402
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
 Good night.

403
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
 That's right, Reiko.

404
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
 Why did you give me this phone number?

405
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
 There is no doubt.

406
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
 Because the suspicious Kikyu

407
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
 always appears when Ryo-chan is not around.

408
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
 If this is the case.

409
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
 I was caught by that woman.

410
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
 You're a good woman.

411
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
 You're a good woman.

412
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
 I think it's better to open it soon.

413
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
 Even though I'm in a good mood.

414
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
 It's okay.

415
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
 I have to clean up this stock market.

416
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
 Let's make a lot of money at the end.

417
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
 If it goes well.

418
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
 You can also be popular at the store.

419
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
 How can you be so popular?

420
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
 Use the fireworks competition.

421
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,900
 Fireworks competition?

422
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
 But Ryo-san, can you rest on that day?

423
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
 Can you rest on that day?

424
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,900
 It's unfortunate to have relatives.

425
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,900
 If you make excuses, you can rest.

426
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
 I have a lot of relatives who are older than me.

427
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
 Chief, actually...

428
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
 I know.

429
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
 I know.

430
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
 It's about the holiday.

431
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
 I'm listening to the report.

432
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
 You seem to be looking for the suspicious Kikyu

433
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
 until the last day.

434
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,900
 You seem to be looking for the suspicious Kikyu.

435
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,900
 I'm impressed with you.

436
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
 Tomorrow's fireworks competition is a special holiday.

437
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
 Please continue to investigate.

438
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
 Yes.

439
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,900
 What?

440
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,900
 You don't seem to be very happy.

441
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,900
 It's nothing.

442
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
 It's nothing.

443
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
 It's nothing.

444
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900
 It's nothing.

445
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,900
 I was looking forward to the fireworks competition.

446
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
 I was looking forward to the fireworks competition.

447
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
 The wild guy's enthusiasm.

448
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
 Hey,

449
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
 isn't it strange?

450
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
 Those two have been there for a while.

451
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,900
 Don't you move while standing still at the window?

452
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,900
 Don't you move while standing still at the window?

453
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,900
 Don't you move while standing still at the window?

454
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
 I'm not going to let Reiko get in the way of my business.

455
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
 I'm not going to let Reiko get in the way of my business.

456
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
 Ryo-san,

457
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
 it's finally time to decorate the finale.

458
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
 Yes.

459
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
 The last Kikyu Ramen at the convenience store.

460
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,900
 The last Kikyu Ramen at the convenience store.

461
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
 I'll make it more exciting like fireworks.

462
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
 I'll make it more exciting like fireworks.

463
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
 Thank you for waiting.

464
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
 The Kikyu Ramen has arrived at the convenience store

465
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,900
 that is familiar to everyone.

466
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
 The beer that you drink while looking at the fireworks

467
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
 is the best in Japan.

468
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,900
 What is the best?

469
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
 The first-class seat at the fireworks exhibition.

470
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
 Everyone in the high-rise apartment.

471
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
 Beer, snacks, shaved ice.

472
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,900
 The convenience store that has everything

473
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,900
 is going to sell you happiness.

474
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,900
 Yes, everyone,

475
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,900
 together.

476
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
 Let's go.

477
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
 Hey, give me beer.

478
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
 Give me shaved ice.

479
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
 Yes, I'm coming.

480
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,900
 I knew it.

481
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,900
 I got beaten up.

482
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
 Ryo-san,

483
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
 if you keep this up, you're going to break everything.

484
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,900
 This is a great joke.

485
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,900
 Hey.

486
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
 What is it? What's wrong?

487
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,900
 The burner is not in a good condition.

488
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
 It's old.

489
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,900
 I can't stop.

490
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,900
 I can't stop.

491
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,900
 Hey, what is the Kikyu?

492
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,900
 I have an illusion.

493
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
 I have an illusion.

494
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
 I have an illusion.

495
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
 This is no doubt.

496
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
 I was good at it,

497
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
 wasn't I?

498
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
 Idiot!

499
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,900
 I'm going to the fireworks exhibition.

500
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
 What?

501
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,900
 What!

502
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,900
 I'm going to the fireworks exhibition.

503
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,900
 He seems to be involved in the shock wave and doing a dutch roll.

504
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
 He's a crazy guy.

505
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
 Ryo-chan!

506
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
 Is it over?

507
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,900
 No, there should be a 15th ball left at the end.

508
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
 15th ball?

509
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,900
 It's 300 meters straight, so if he gets involved...

510
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
 If he gets involved?

511
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
 It's the end of the system!

512
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,900
 It's a miserable end for an idiot.

513
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
 What?

514
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,900
 Hey, money is falling from the fireworks!

515
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,900
 It's a great service!

516
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,900
 Ryo-san, the money...

517
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,900
 It can't be helped.

518
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,900
 I was able to see the fireworks of the 15th ball up close.

519
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,900
 I'll give it to everyone as a gift.

520
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
 Gege!

521
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,900
 The foreign lottery has won 5.5 billion yen!

522
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,900
 It's 5.5 billion yen!

523
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
 I'll return the money and buy a plastic model.

524
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
 I'll make an eel steak.

525
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,900
 I can't use it all!

526
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,900
 Next time, we'll do a one-time lottery lottery!

527
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,900
 Thank you for watching!
