1
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,780
 Hugely popular! Flying food stalls

2
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:41,700
 What's this?

3
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:45,914
 A wish for a long-distance relationship?

4
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,700
 You're going to quit, senpai?

5
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,179
 I don't like it, chief!

6
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,865
 Please call it a wish for a vacation!

7
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,523
 A wish for a vacation!

8
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:58,503
 Idiot!

9
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,810
 You're an adult and you don't even write kanji!

10
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:03,400
 You're going to quit, senpai?

11
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
 Are you going to go out with me?

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,397
 No way.

13
00:02:06,422 --> 00:02:10,210
 I'll write the reason in detail.

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
 Reason?

15
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,849
 The reason for the Tameyari Fireworks Festival?

16
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,375
 I've never seen a firework festival since I was a kid.

17
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
 Idiot!

18
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,100
 Do you know what kind of job you're doing?

19
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
 Of course! I'm a police officer!

20
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:40,100
 Do you think it's okay for a police officer to take a vacation at a firework festival?

21
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,100
 The firework festival is held every year by amazing people.

22
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,100
 I want to borrow a cat's hand as a guard.

23
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,100
 It can't be helped. I'll pay for it.

24
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,100
 If you do that, you'll be fired right away!

25
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,100
 It's a joke! It's a joke!

26
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,100
 The head of the department store is using the firework festival every day.

27
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,100
 It would be great if I rode him and saw the fireworks.

28
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
 Damn!

29
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,100
 There's no way I can rest well.

30
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,100
 Hey, Ryo!

31
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
 Yes?

32
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
 Hey!

33
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
 What?

34
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
 What?

35
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,522
 I just thought I'd pay you back.

36
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
 I can't pay you back.

37
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 Is it that expensive?

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
 Yes.

39
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,800
 If Ryo pays me back, I'll have to pay for the firework festival.

40
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
 This is a step ahead of us.

41
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 There are big apartments all over the place.

42
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 Aren't there more people eating ramen?

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 In a high-rise apartment, you can't even hear the sound of the firework festival.

44
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 You should pay me back.

45
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
 I have a cell phone.

46
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
 No, I can't.

47
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 I'm alone.

48
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,500
 I can't ride the elevator while pulling the bar.

49
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 It takes too much money to pay with a helicopter.

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
 And the engine is noisy.

51
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
 It's easier.

52
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,900
 Hey, Kazushika Balloon Club!

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 Hey, Ryo.

54
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 Are you nervous about the firework festival?

55
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
 Yes, I borrowed money.

56
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 Where's the old guy?

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
 He's in the warehouse.

58
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 If you don't mind, could you lend him to me?

59
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
 He has a friend who's interested in it.

60
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
 Yes.

61
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
 It's a great honor for us to have more friends.

62
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
 I don't mind.

63
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,300
 Are we going to ride this and go out?

64
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,300
 We can use propane gas for fuel.

65
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,300
 Are we going to make ramen in this?

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
 What do you think?

67
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
 Oh, no.

68
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,300
 He seems to like it.

69
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,300
 He said he wanted to ride it.

70
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:40,300
 Oh, please.

71
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:43,159
 Okey, Let's try it.

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 It's inflating.

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Remember the procedure.

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 What?

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 We'll drive it on the show.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 What?

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 You're not asking him to do it?

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Do you think he'll be happy to do it?

79
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:12,700
 Besides, in Japan, it's not allowed to fly at night.

80
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,700
 What if the bearded man knows about this plan?

81
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:19,700
 Beards are scary when they get angry.

82
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,700
 They might bite you to death.

83
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
 Ryo, get in the car.

84
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
 Okay.

85
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,700
 Calm down.

86
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,700
 It's flying.

87
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
 You're a pro.

88
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
 The basic movement of the hot air balloon is adjusted with this burner.

89
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,400
 It can fly high.

90
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
 It doesn't have to fly that high.

91
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
 It can fly as high as a high-rise apartment.

92
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
 What?

93
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
 What?

94
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,400
 It can also release the heat when it is fast.

95
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
 Releasing the heat?

96
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
 You're enthusiastic.

97
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
 What?

98
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
 It's a business.

99
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:07,075
 Business?

100
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
 No.

101
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
 I want to be a professional in the hot air balloon.

102
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:17,237
 I want to do business flying in the sky in elementary school.

103
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:18,278
 That's what you wrote, right?

104
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:20,371
 Yes.

105
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:22,260
 I'm counting on you.

106
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:24,552
 I'll help you.

107
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:26,100
 Thank you.

108
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
 I'm hungry.

109
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
 We're running out of time.

110
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,281
 It's a hassle to go to the convenience store.

111
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 What's that?

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
 What?

113
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
 It says ramen.

114
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
 No way.

115
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 The phone number is also written.

116
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:06,436
 I'll try calling it.

117
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:15,191
 Yes, it's an emergency ramen.

118
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:16,606
 Are you on your way?

119
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,800
 Can I have two ramen, please?

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
 Yes.

121
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
 Two ramen, please.

122
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,164
 Which one do you want?

123
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:27,584
 No. 8, 3011, Yamada.

124
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:28,800
 30 times, right?

125
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 Every time.

126
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
 I was able to order it properly.

127
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
 But how do they deliver it?

128
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:46,606
 It's getting closer.

129
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:47,872
 I'm scared.

130
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:50,062
 It's delicious.

131
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:54,869
 You're Yamada, right?

132
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:55,752
 Yes.

133
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:57,190
 I got it.

134
00:08:57,215 --> 00:08:58,838
 You're fast.

135
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
 Thank you.

136
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:04,700
 You're welcome.

137
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,200
 Sorry to keep you waiting.

138
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
 It's 1,000 yen.

139
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
 It's an emergency ramen.

140
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,530
 Yes.

141
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,397
 Three ramen.

142
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:19,163
 Three ramen, please.

143
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 4023, Beat.

144
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,348
 All right.

145
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:23,551
 It's that room.

146
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,652
 I got it.

147
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:30,121
 I'm on my way.

148
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:36,747
 Here's your ramen.

149
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:38,134
 It's 700 yen.

150
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:39,622
 Five ramen, please.

151
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,022
 I got it.

152
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
 I'm busy.

153
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,437
 Ryo-san.

154
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,411
 Someone called the police.

155
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:50,232
 Who called the police?

156
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:51,215
 What should we do?

157
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,082
 It's an emergency.

158
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:53,900
 Formation.

159
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
 It's an emergency.

160
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
 Where is it?

161
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
 It's dark.

162
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
 It's too dark to see.

163
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
 It's a plan to destroy the world.

164
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,900
 That's why I painted the ground black.

165
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
 I'm not good at it.

166
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
 If you get caught,

167
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,142
 your business will go up.

168
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,858
 I didn't think it would go up so much.

169
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:20,451
 If you do it like this,

170
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:22,680
 I'll do it on purpose.

171
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,842
 I'm good at it.

172
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:25,900
 Good.

173
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,080
 But is it okay for the police to do part-time jobs?

174
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:29,900
 Is it okay?

175
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,900
 I'm a police officer.

176
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
 I have a duty to help people in need.

177
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,900
 If there are people hungry at night,

178
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
 it's the way to help people.

179
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:41,900
 A suspicious situation

180
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
 has been witnessed in the neighborhood

181
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
 of a high-rise apartment in the city.

182
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,900
 It's likely to appear tonight.

183
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
 It's a big deal.

184
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
 Enhance the night patrol

185
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
 and work on the discovery.

186
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
 Do you understand?

187
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,315
 But I don't think it will appear tonight.

188
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,596
 Why do you think that?

189
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:03,915
 That's what I said ?

190
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:09,071
 I'm a police officer.

191
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
 Did you know

192
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,655
 that you were a police officer?

193
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,900
 What?

194
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
 What do you want to bet?

195
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,844
 1,000 yen.

196
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,711
 Idiot!

197
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:25,305
 Do you think it's okay to do part-time jobs?

198
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:28,303
 Sir, how about this?

199
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:29,900
 If Ryo-chan

200
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,900
 gets a clue about a suspicious situation,

201
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,875
 he can make the fireworks day a holiday.

202
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,900
 I see.

203
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,242
 What do you think, Ryo-tsu?

204
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,445
 Is it okay?

205
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
 That's right.

206
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:53,072
 Whatever.

207
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
 I want to

208
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
 sing and dance

209
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,698
 in the summer.

210
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:01,900
 Thank you for your hard work.

211
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,590
 Senpai.

212
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,900
 It's up there.

213
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,900
 What?

214
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,870
 What are you doing?

215
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:12,589
 It's not like that.

216
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:13,900
 Then what is it?

217
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,900
 Can you see a woman?

218
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,900
 Well, please take a look.

219
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,900
 A bird?

220
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,900
 What?

221
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,900
 It's a bird.

222
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
 It's so dark

223
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,421
 that I can't see it clearly.

224
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:29,900
 It's a starlight scope

225
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:32,674
 used by the U.S. military.

226
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:33,900
 If you look at it with this,

227
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
 you can immediately

228
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
 find the black, suspicious balloon.

229
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,900
 That's not good.

230
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,900
 Oh, no.

231
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
 I got something amazing.

232
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,541
 Senpai, why don't we find the balloon together

233
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,885
 and get a reward?

234
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:51,252
 I'll give it to you.

235
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,900
 Hey, what are you doing here?

236
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
 Oh, Ryo-san.

237
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,900
 Well, Ryo-san always

238
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
 let me make a living,

239
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,900
 so I thought I'd deliver a late-night meal.

240
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,886
 Idiot!

241
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:12,386
 What if I get caught

242
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:13,621
 and get suspicious?

243
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:16,300
 Oh, a ramen shop?

244
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:20,085
 I was just hungry.

245
00:13:20,226 --> 00:13:21,900
 Oh, it's my first time

246
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
 eating ramen at a ramen shop,

247
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
 so I'd like to try it.

248
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
 It smells delicious.

249
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,929
 What?

250
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:32,112
 Is a ramen shop like this?

251
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:33,167
 Huh?

252
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:41,208
 Yes, it's a ramen shop run by a police officer in Onzo City, Nakagawa District.

253
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:44,160
 I don't eat ramen often.

254
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:45,900
 That's not a hobby.

255
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
 You sell ramen, don't you?

256
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,900
 Huh?

257
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:52,747
 The phone is ringing.

258
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:54,233
 Oh, hello.

259
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:55,521
 Yes, hello.

260
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:56,425
 Kikyu Ramen...

261
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
 No, it's just a ramen shop.

262
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:01,900
 Huh?

263
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,900
 Just a ramen shop?

264
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,900
 It's a Kikyu Ramen shop, isn't it?

265
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,900
 What time do you come here tonight?

266
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,900
 Oh, sorry.

267
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
 I'm off today.

268
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
 Oh, yes.

269
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
 Nice to meet you.

270
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
 You're closed

271
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
 because you're closed, aren't you?

272
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
 Oh, no.

273
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:25,095
 I was going to wrap up early tonight.

274
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,383
 Hey, Ryo-san.

275
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,719
 Don't ask me.

276
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:29,751
 I don't know anything.

277
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:32,415
 That's right.

278
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:42,178
 Cat.

279
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:43,093
 Air gun.

280
00:14:43,118 --> 00:14:44,070
 Triangle.

281
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:46,211
 Oh, Ryo-san.

282
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:47,484
 I'll open it now.

283
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
 What's with that luggage?

284
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
 You can make a profit

285
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,900
 just by eating ramen.

286
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,900
 The theory of business

287
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
 is to develop it

288
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
 according to the needs of the times.

289
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
 Oh.

290
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:07,900
 It's called

291
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,900
 the flying convenience store.

292
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,900
 Everyone,

293
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,900
 sorry to keep you waiting.

294
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,833
 Kikyu Ramen is here.

295
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
 Hi, Kikyu Ramen.

296
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
 Oh, hi.

297
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,413
 Three char siu noodles, please.

298
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:34,327
 Can I have a rice ball, too?

299
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:35,900
 Sure.

300
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,900
 The idol hell limited edition

301
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
 set, please.

302
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
 Oh, I wanted this.

303
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,691
 Hey, can I have a cigarette?

304
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:44,976
 Sure.

305
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,900
 Oh, you have everything.

306
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,900
 I want chocolate.

307
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,900
 I'll have yakisoba with oolong tea.

308
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
 Thank you.

309
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,900
 I'll have coffee when I'm sleepy.

310
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
 Please go home.

311
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
 Hey, melon and strawberry milk.

312
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,900
 Which one would you like?

313
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
 Oh, thank you.

314
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,857
 Oh, by the way, can I get two or three weekly magazines?

315
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,900
 Sure.

316
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
 Oh, I'm in a hurry.

317
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
 This is a big profit.

318
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:15,900
 Oh, look.

319
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,443
 It's Kikyu.

320
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:19,900
 It's here.

321
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
 Okay, I'll go after it.

322
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,226
 This is Naoko.

323
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,251
 I found it.

324
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,124
 Okay.

325
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:31,900
 Kei, please prepare the starlight scope.

326
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
 Okay.

327
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,900
 It was worth it.

328
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,807
 Hello.

329
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:40,706
 I'm sorry.

330
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:42,731
 It's sold out today.

331
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:44,641
 Let's go.

332
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
 Ryo, it's a mini-pato.

333
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
 What?

334
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
 That's for Kobachi and Naoko.

335
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
 Okay.

336
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,242
 It's a mini-pato for formation.

337
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
 It's gone.

338
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,865
 It's okay.

339
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,873
 I can see it with the moonlight.

340
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,576
 Oh, what's that ?

341
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,947
 That's it.

342
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:13,697
 This is my strategy.

343
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,766
 I'm working hard.

344
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,321
 I can't see the moon.

345
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:19,900
 I just see the smoke.

346
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
 But I can't see the road.

347
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
 It's gone.

348
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
 Damn it.

349
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
 I can't see anything.

350
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
 It's gone.

351
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,900
 I thought I was going to die.

352
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
 Damn it.

353
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:48,858
 Kikyu seems to be heading this way.

354
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:51,959
 I can't see it at all.

355
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:54,668
 It's okay even in the dark.

356
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:55,926
 That telescope.

357
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,168
 It should be perfect

358
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:58,642
 until a few kilometers away.

359
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:03,039
 Oh, Kei.

360
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:04,407
 This lens.

361
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:05,900
 What's wrong?

362
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,730
 This is a black paint.

363
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:11,900
 Who did this?

364
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,544
 If you say so.

365
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:22,392
 I don't want to be caught so easily.

366
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:23,306
 I'm sorry, Ryo.

367
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:25,798
 You helped me until the last minute.

368
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:28,762
 I can pay you back in a little while.

369
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:31,606
 Where is the other person?

370
00:18:32,082 --> 00:18:35,254
 Hey, it's a convenience store ramen.

371
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,279
 I'd like to ask for your number.

372
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:39,245
 This voice.

373
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,941
 After all, Ryo-chan.

374
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
 Today is the last day.

375
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
 Good night.

376
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,710
 That's right, Reiko.

377
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:50,210
 Why did you give me this phone number?

378
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:51,900
 There is no doubt.

379
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
 Because the suspicious Kikyu

380
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,038
 always appears when Ryo-chan is not around.

381
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
 If this is the case.

382
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:02,696
 I was caught by that woman.

383
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:07,186
 You're a good man.

384
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,903
 I think it's better to open it soon.

385
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:13,500
 Even though I'm in a good mood.

386
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:14,936
 It's okay.

387
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,875
 I have to clean up this stock soon.

388
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,731
 Let's make a lot of money at the end.

389
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:21,900
 If it goes well.

390
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,613
 You can also be popular at the store.

391
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:27,826
 How can I be so popular?

392
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:29,851
 Use the fireworks competition.

393
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:32,277
 Fireworks competition?

394
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,750
 But Ryo-san, can you rest on that day?

395
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,148
 It's unfortunate to have relatives.

396
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:41,061
 If you make excuses, you can rest.

397
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:43,853
 I have a lot of relatives who are older than me.

398
00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:51,083
 Chief, actually...

399
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:51,900
 I know.

400
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,643
 I know.

401
00:19:53,674 --> 00:19:55,900
 It's about the holiday.

402
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
 I'm listening to the report.

403
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
 You seem to be looking for the suspicious Kikyu

404
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
 until the last day.

405
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,690
 You seem to be looking for the suspicious Kikyu.

406
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,900
 I'm impressed with you.

407
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
 Tomorrow's fireworks competition is a special holiday.

408
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
 Please continue to investigate.

409
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,450
 Yes.

410
00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:14,512
 What?

411
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:16,473
 You don't seem to be very happy.

412
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:18,498
 It's nothing.

413
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:20,523
 It's nothing.

414
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:22,548
 It's nothing.

415
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:24,573
 It's nothing.

416
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:33,875
 I was looking forward to the fireworks competition.

417
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,619
 The wild guy's enthusiasm.

418
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:37,900
 Hey,

419
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
 isn't it strange?

420
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,157
 Those two have been there for a while.

421
00:20:46,556 --> 00:20:50,985
 Don't you move while standing still at the window?

422
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:56,645
 I'm not going to let Reiko get in the way of my business.

423
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:58,299
 Ryo-san,

424
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,277
 it's finally time to decorate the finale.

425
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:01,900
 Yes.

426
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,369
 The last Kikyu Ramen at the convenience store.

427
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,869
 I'll make it more exciting like fireworks.

428
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
 Thank you for waiting.

429
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
 The Kikyu Ramen has arrived at the convenience store

430
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,900
 that is familiar to everyone.

431
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
 The beer that you drink while looking at the fireworks

432
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
 is the best in Japan.

433
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,900
 What is the best?

434
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
 The first-class seat at the fireworks exhibition.

435
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
 Everyone in the high-rise apartment.

436
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
 Beer, snacks, shaved ice.

437
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,900
 The convenience store that has everything

438
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,900
 is going to sell you happiness.

439
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,900
 Yes, everyone,

440
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,900
 together.

441
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
 Let's go.

442
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
 Hey, give me beer.

443
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
 Give me shaved ice.

444
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
 Yes, I'm coming.

445
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,900
 I knew it.

446
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,900
 I got beaten up.

447
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,900
 Ryo-san,

448
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
 if you keep this up, you're going to break everything.

449
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,456
 This is a great joke.

450
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:05,426
 Hey.

451
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
 What is it? What's wrong?

452
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,900
 The burner is not in a good condition.

453
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
 It's old.

454
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,900
 I can't stop.

455
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,965
 Hey, what is the Kikyu?

456
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,044
 I have an illusion.

457
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,159
 This is no doubt.

458
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:34,464
 I was good at it,

459
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:35,900
 wasn't I?

460
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
 Idiot!

461
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,900
 I'm going to the fireworks exhibition.

462
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
 What?

463
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,900
 What!

464
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,794
 He seems to be involved in the shock wave and doing a dutch roll.

465
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:52,900
 He's a crazy guy.

466
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
 Ryo-chan!

467
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
 Is it over?

468
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,900
 No, there should be a 15th ball left at the end.

469
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
 15th ball?

470
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,900
 It's 300 meters straight, so if he gets involved...

471
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
 If he gets involved?

472
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
 It's the end of the system!

473
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,900
 It's a miserable end for an idiot.

474
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
 What?

475
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,900
 Hey, money is falling from the fireworks!

476
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,900
 It's a great service!

477
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,900
 Ryo-san, the money...

478
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,900
 It can't be helped.

479
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,900
 I was able to see the fireworks of the 15th ball up close.

480
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,900
 I'll give it to everyone as a gift.
