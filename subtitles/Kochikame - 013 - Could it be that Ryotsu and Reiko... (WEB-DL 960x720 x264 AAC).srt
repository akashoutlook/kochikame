1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 It can't be! Ryotsu and Reiko!

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 So this is the latest model?

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Yes.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 It's lighter and more compact than steel.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 How do you use it?

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Can I borrow your hand?

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Sure.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 If you touch the inside of the handle like this...

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 ...it locks automatically.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Really?

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 You can unlock the key with this electronic lock key.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 That was quick!

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Now we don't need to arrest the culprit.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Finally, the guys from the exchange school are here.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Today was a tough day.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 You look sleepy, Ryo-chan.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I'm not sleepy at all.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I went to the beach five days ago...

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 ...and drank and sang every night.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 After that, I played Tetsumon for 70 hours.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Then I went straight to bed.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I haven't slept for 120 hours.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 That's a lot.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I'll sleep for 100 hours if I go home today.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I'm tired.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 You have to change your lifestyle.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I can't afford it.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 What's that?

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Is it this?

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 It's a new model.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 It locks in 0.2 seconds.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 That's interesting.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Just touching it is enough?

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 That's convenient.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I'll unlock it with this key.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 That's cool.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 That's interesting.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 That was quick.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 You looked so sleepy just now.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 You don't have eyes for fun.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Let's go home.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I want more.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 If you're tired, you should go home and sleep.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Like a child.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 What did you say?

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I'll break your bones.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I'll arrest you!

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 What?

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 The key!

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I ate it!

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Hey!

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Damn it!

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 It ran away!

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 What are you going to do?

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I don't know!

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Do something, Nakagawa!

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 It wasn't me.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Terai borrowed it from the head office.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 I'll ask him.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 There should be a spare key.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Yes, that's right.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 That dog ran away because you yelled.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 You should have caught it.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 You're the cause of the key.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Really?

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 It's hard.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 The person in charge went on a vacation.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 What?

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 When will you come back?

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 It seems to be tomorrow.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Are you going to stay with Reiko for 48 hours?

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 That's my line.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Wait.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Is it Saturday today?

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 That's right.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 It's not a joke!

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 It's the day of peace!

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I don't have time to do this.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I have to do something.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 It's the latest style.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I don't get hurt.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 I had a bad feeling when I was playing with my hands.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 I'm sorry, but I have something to do.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 I'll go home first.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 What?

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Wait!

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Ryo-chan will work with me.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 What?

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Wait a minute.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I haven't slept for 120 hours.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Are you going to let me work for 8 hours?

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 It can't be helped.

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Today is a day off.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Why do you work?

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 It's okay.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 You can do whatever you want.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Of course.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 I'm going to sleep.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 That's great.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 It doesn't take a second.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 You can sleep anywhere.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 It's the same as animals.

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 This is the Kamewari Park.

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 I'm here.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Reiko, the head office is calling.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Me?

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Ouch!

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 My eyes are cold.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Come here.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Hey!

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 I'm back.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Yes.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 I'm going to the office.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Right now?

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Yes.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 I understand.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 My head is burning!

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Hey!

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Come here!

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 What are you doing?

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I'm going to the office.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 No!

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I don't want to!

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I'm not going!

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 What are you doing?

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Hey, you!

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I'm in a hurry.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Hey!

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 I'm going.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Wait!

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Hey!

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Reiko!

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Why do I have to run?

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 It can't be helped.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 It's forbidden to ride with two people.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 I'm going to fly.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Do your best.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Stop it!

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 That's enough.

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 What?

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 What?

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 That's a new record.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Do your best.

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 It'll be embarrassing if you get caught.

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 They are a bold couple.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 They are beautiful.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Stop it.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 What?

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 This way.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 I want to pee.

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 You can't go there with me.

157
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 I'm not going.

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 What are you going to do?

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I'm going to get caught.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I'm in trouble.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I know.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 What if I do it in the back garden?

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Do you want me to stand in the back of the office?

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I can't stand it.

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 I can't stand it anymore.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Hurry up.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I don't want to.

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Why do I have to do this?

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Reiko!

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 What are you doing there?

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I'm going to take a bath.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 You don't look like Reiko.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Let's play volleyball together.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 No.

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 It's too early.

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I told you it's too early.

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 They treated me like a pervert.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 That's enough.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Excuse me.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Thank you for your hard work.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Ryo-chan.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 You're done with your work.

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Let's go home.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Well...

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 What?

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Toilet?

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 If I go in with you,

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 you'll become a real pervert.

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Go outside like me.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I'll close my eyes.

191
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 You can't do that.

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Then wait until we get home.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Be patient.

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 There's only one way.

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 How?

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Like this.

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Like this.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 I don't want to live like this anymore.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Even I'm treated like a pervert.

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I'm tired.

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 My left hand hurts.

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I'm tired, too.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 I've been running around

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 without enough sleep.

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I'm sweating.

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Let's take a bath.

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 A bath?

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 No, it's okay.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I won't look at you.

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 What's with your eyes?

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Do I look like a pervert?

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Ryo-chan.

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 But just in case.

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Damn it.

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I made you faint again.

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Don't hit me on the way to the toilet.

217
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 You're getting more and more resistant.

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 You're getting faster.

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 You look like a cockroach.

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Do you want to take a bath?

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Let me in, too.

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Wait.

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I'll be right out.

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 No, right now.

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Don't be naked in a place like this.

226
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 If you want to go in, go ahead.

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Don't be ridiculous.

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Damn it.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 But how did you change your clothes

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 with your hands tied up?

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Huh?

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 It's a little hot.

233
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 I feel refreshed.

234
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 I don't feel refreshed at all.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I'm going to take a bath in my clothes.

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I told you to go in.

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Who is it now?

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Ms. Akimoto.

239
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 She's the manager's aunt.

240
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 She's famous for her talk.

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I don't know what rumors will spread

242
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 if I find her in a place like this.

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 You don't have to tell me anything.

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I'm not going.

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Ms. Akimoto.

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Ms. Akimoto.

247
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Ms. Akimoto.

248
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Yes.

249
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Thank you for waiting.

250
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Did you take a bath?

251
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Your luggage is here.

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Thank you.

253
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Oh, right.

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Do you know the girl in room 8?

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I don't really like rumors.

256
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Well, that girl takes a different man

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 into her room every day.

258
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 I don't want to see her crying.

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 I don't want to see her crying.

260
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Is that so?

261
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Compared to that, you are rare now.

262
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Weird men don't flutter.

263
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 This is tough.

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 The next day

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Let's go to bed.

266
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Let's get changed.

267
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Huh?

268
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 You fell asleep without doing anything.

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 You'll catch a cold if you sleep in a place like this.

270
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 It's not that hard.

271
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 You've been awake for 135 hours.

272
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Yes.

273
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 It's me, Pappa.

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 It's me, Pum Pum Maru.

275
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 What's wrong, Pappa?

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 What's wrong, Pappa?

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 I'm on my way.

278
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 To Tokyo?

279
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 What's going on?

280
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 What?

281
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 I didn't hear you.

282
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 That's strange.

283
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Anyway,

284
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 tomorrow at 1 o'clock,

285
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 I'm going to see Tengamaru Shoji.

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 I'm going to see Tengamaru Shoji.

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Even if you say that suddenly,

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I'm not going to get married yet.

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Do you have someone you like?

290
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 It's not like that.

291
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I didn't do it.

292
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Reiko, what was that man's voice?

293
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 No, Pappa.

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 It's the sound of the TV.

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Ryo-chan.

296
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 It's the TV.

297
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Stop it, Reiko.

298
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Stop it.

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 It's Reiko now.

300
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 It's the TV.

301
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Okay.

302
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 See you tomorrow.

303
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Good night.

304
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I'm in trouble.

305
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 If I take Ryo-chan away like this,

306
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 it'll be a big trouble.

307
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Pappa might be shocked and fall asleep.

308
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 I think it's about time,

309
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 but I'm sorry.

310
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 No,

311
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 I don't mind being a little late.

312
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 If it's for Reiko, I'll wait for hours.

313
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Right, Pappa?

314
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 That's right.

315
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Excuse me.

316
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Is it Reiko?

317
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Hello.

318
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Sorry to keep you waiting.

319
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I'm sorry.

320
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I got caught up in traffic.

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I'll leave it here for a moment.

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 It's cute, isn't it?

323
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 You like it, don't you?

324
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 You're always with me wherever I go.

325
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Ryo-chan has been sleeping since yesterday.

326
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 If you keep sleeping like this,

327
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 everything will be over.

328
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Reiko-san, you're so cute.

329
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I like that.

330
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Thank you.

331
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 As you know,

332
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I'm Tengamaru Daisuke.

333
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I'm Tengamaru Shoji's uncle.

334
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 I'm glad to be able to get close to

335
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Reiko-san.

336
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Nice to meet you.

337
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 What's your hobby?

338
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I spend money.

339
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 It's hard to spend money

340
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 because I have too much money.

341
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 That's another good hobby.

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 What's your hobby, Reiko-san?

343
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 It's just my imagination.

344
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Ouch.

345
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Poor thing.

346
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Did you get up?

347
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I said I wanted to see you.

348
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 I said I wanted to see you.

349
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Is that so?

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Excuse me.

351
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 That's why.

352
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 So that's why I'm wearing

353
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 a raccoon doll like this.

354
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Ryo-chan, please.

355
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Please don't find out

356
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 until the meeting is over.

357
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Do you like

358
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 a guy who does stupid things?

359
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 No.

360
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 It's an important

361
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 transaction between my partner and my father.

362
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 If it goes well, I'll buy you

363
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 a radio-controlled helicopter that Ryo-chan wanted.

364
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 What? Radio-controlled?

365
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Okay, I got it.

366
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Leave it to me.

367
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 The lady seems to be

368
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 calculating everything.

369
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Even though it's on the radio,

370
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 it's hard to stay still.

371
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 It looks delicious.

372
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 There's sake, too.

373
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 By the way, I haven't eaten anything since last night.

374
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Okay,

375
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 watch it.

376
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Anyway,

377
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 my father-in-law is

378
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Himiko's mother's sister.

379
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Ryo-chan.

380
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 That's enough.

381
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Reiko-san.

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Yes.

383
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 If you were to get married,

384
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 would you go to Asia or

385
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Dengen?

386
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I'd go anywhere.

387
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Really? I'd go anywhere

388
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 except Shita-machi.

389
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 What?

390
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 I can't stand it.

391
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Shita-machi is old

392
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 and has a bad pattern.

393
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 I don't like it.

394
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 I don't like Shita-machi.

395
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I hate it

396
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 because it's a fake.

397
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 What do you think?

398
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 It's delicious.

399
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Water!

400
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Water!

401
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Give me water!

402
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Captain!

403
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Captain!

404
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I'm sorry.

405
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 I'm sorry.

406
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 How is it?

407
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Would you like to talk?

408
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 That's good.

409
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Young people are young people.

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Right, Tenkamaru-san?

411
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 That's right.

412
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Reiko-san.

413
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Yes.

414
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 We're finally alone.

415
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Reiko-san.

416
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Ever since I first saw you...

417
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Um...

418
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Reiko-san.

419
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 We're doing a Dragon King show over there!

420
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 What?

421
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Dragon King?

422
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 I think Tanuki was running.

423
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Dragon Kick!

424
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Dragon Kick!

425
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Dragon Kick!

426
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Dragon Kick!

427
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 It's good to do this once in a while.

428
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Yes.

429
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 It was a good chance.

430
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Good job, Dragon King.

431
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Dragon King!

432
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Dragon King!

433
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 What's wrong?

434
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Nothing.

435
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 It's strange.

436
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Calm down.

437
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Dragon Kick!

438
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 The moon!

439
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 This is Tanuki from Kachikachi!

440
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Reiko-chan, run!

441
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Help me!

442
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 It's really shallow.

443
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 But it's good.

444
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Half of my face is fine.

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Damn.

446
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 But I'm in trouble.

447
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Reiko-san!

448
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 What should we do?

449
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 We'll be found!

450
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 What should we do?

451
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Reiko-san! Reiko-san!

452
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Why are you so slow?

453
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 What?

454
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 It's your turn.

455
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Hurry up.

456
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 What?

457
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Hurry up.

458
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 You're a good Devil General.

459
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 But who is this girl?

460
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Dragon King.

461
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I'm a huge fan.

462
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 It's a big Devil Devil.

463
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 It's a big Devil Devil.

464
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Take this!

465
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Take this!

466
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 You're a big Devil Devil.

467
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 You're a big Devil Devil.

468
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 You're a big Devil Devil.

469
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Reiko, you do it too.

470
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 What?

471
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 He's serious.

472
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 If he wants to do it, let's do it.

473
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Yeah.

474
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 It can't be helped.

475
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Take this.

476
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Good. Everyone, follow them.

477
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Go, Sora!

478
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Reiko-san!

479
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Where did he go?

480
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Reiko-san, you're so wonderful.

481
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Reiko-san!

482
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Reiko-san!

483
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 What are you doing?

484
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Reiko-san!

485
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Reiko-san!

486
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 What?

487
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 I don't think it's appropriate

488
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 for Tenkamaru to do that.

489
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Reiko-san!

490
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 The rest was a mess.

491
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 But I'm relieved

492
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 that I finally got a job.

493
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I'm so glad

494
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 that I got a job like this.

495
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Maybe you're still lucky.

496
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 The person in charge

497
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 is going out for a month from today.

498
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 A month?

499
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 That's great.

500
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 By the way, where's Reiko-san's match?

501
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Of course, she rejected it from the other side.

502
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 This?

503
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Yes, the one we promised.

504
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 I did it!

505
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 So, did the match go well?

506
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 No.

507
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 She doesn't want to get married.

508
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 She rejected it

509
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 because of her father,

510
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 but she was wondering

511
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 how to reject it.

512
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 That's what I thought.

513
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 This is useful.

514
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Ryotsu!

515
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Good morning!

516
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 You're playing with

517
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 something like that again?

518
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 No, I'm always

519
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 busy with work.

520
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 This is not a toy.

521
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 It's the latest model.

522
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Isn't it great?

523
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 I see.

524
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Take it off.

525
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 This key...

526
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Take it off.

527
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 What's wrong?

528
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 You can't take it off for a month?

529
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 You bastard!

530
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 What are you going to do?

531
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I'm going to die if I play with you for a month!

532
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Forget it!

533
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 He's really stubborn.

534
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 This is Kameyari Park.

535
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 I'm busy right now.

536
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 What?

537
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 There's an elephant in the shopping street?

538
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 I can't touch it because it's dangerous.

539
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Wait a minute!

540
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Why do I have to go?

541
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Next time,

542
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 let's play with an elephant!

543
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Hey, you!

544
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 What's wrong?

545
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 It's dangerous!

546
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Come on!

547
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Hey, you!

548
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Come on!

549
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Hey, you!

550
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Let's go!

551
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Let's play!

552
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Hey, you!

553
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Come on!

554
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Hey, you!

555
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Come on!

556
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,720
 Sayonara sa Oh Yeah

557
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,880
 Suki na you ni ikite mi yo
