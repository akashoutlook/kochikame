00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 The Rookie Cop Who Came from the Sky

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 What a nice weather!

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Something good is going to happen on a day like this...

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 It's too quiet.

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 It's too quiet.

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 That means...

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Ryouku is late again!

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Huh?

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Ryou... Ryouku is working!

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 He came two hours before the time to go to work.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 He's been like that all the time.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I thought he'd take a shower even if it rained.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 We were just talking.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I'm very moved right now.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I've been working at the police station for 30 years.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I've never been this happy!

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Chief.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 You're so moved.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Ryouku finally woke up from work.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 He's been working so hard.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Yes! I did it!

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Good job, Ryotsu!

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I thought you'd do it someday.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 By the way, what documents did you write?

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 What?

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I don't like it.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Did you forget, chief?

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Didn't I tell you yesterday?

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I told you to submit the finished paper.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 The finished paper?

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I wrote everything.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Your hands are frozen.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Idiot!

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Who are you?

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Chief, are you okay?

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I'm sorry, but I need medicine.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Okay.

38
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:17,000
 Did you drink too much, chief?

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 You are old enough.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 You need to take care of yourself.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,617
 What did you say?

42
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:25,000
 It's all your fault!

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Calm down, chief.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 If you get too angry, your blood vessels will break.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I have no choice but to give up because I have such a bad subordinate.

46
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:40,000
 I remembered it as a subordinate.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Is Nakagawa-kun still here?

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Mr. Nakagawa?

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 He's a newcomer who's going to be in this police station from today.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 What kind of guy is he?

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Oh, he's pretty handsome.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 He grew up in New York until he was 16 years old.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 He's the same age as Reiko-san.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Yes.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 His car has a permanent license.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 He also has a boat and a plane license.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 He's also good at sports and can speak Japanese.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,004
 He's so good at shooting that he can blow a needle's head off a kilometer away.

59
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:14,757
 Who is Mr. Nakagawa?

60
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,000
 He's the son of Nakagawa-zaibatsu.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Nakagawa-zaibatsu?

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,865
 Is he the Nakagawa-zaibatsu that can be found anywhere in the world?

63
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,717
 That's right.

64
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:26,000
 What is that Nakagawa-zaibatsu?

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Is it a piece of wood?

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 It's not a piece of wood. It's a piece of wood.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 It's a piece of consul.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,175
 Is it a piece of konnyaku?

69
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,138
 No, it's not.

70
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,000
 Reiko-kun, don't talk like that.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Don't talk.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 You're going to hurt your stomach like me.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Yes.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 You're not going to get a hard job as a police officer.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 You're going to have to go to kindergarten and study hard.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Ryo-tsu!

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 You're going to have to teach Nakagawa-zaibatsu not to do that.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 What?

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Okay, now.

80
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,054
 Let's go.

81
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,536
 How is it? Isn't it amazing?

82
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:19,936
 It's the American helicopter Black Hawk combat rescue type.

83
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,175
 I'm tired of it.

84
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,000
 Is that what you were doing yesterday?

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Well, yes.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 The chief will definitely be tired of it.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 That's strange.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 What is the prop?

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 What's with that locker?

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 That's right. I remember now.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 When did you get that?

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Huh? You didn't know?

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 It's completely deformed.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Good, good.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Here we go.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,975
 Good, good boy.

97
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,670
 Besides, how did you get this?

98
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:16,000
 You could have used this passion for work.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I'm always using it.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Sorry, sorry.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Ryo-chan!

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Ryo-san?

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 What's going on?

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Are you okay, Ryo-san?

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I thought I was going to die.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 By the way, where's the helicopter?

107
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:45,689
 Helicopter?

108
00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:47,000
 It flew out.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,507
 It's worth 300,000 yen!

110
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:53,132
 If it's gone, I'll have to pay for it.

111
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:54,929
 I'm not joking.

112
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:57,203
 Ryo-chan is the one who's to blame.

113
00:06:57,228 --> 00:06:59,000
 Darn it. Where did it go?

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Huh?

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Oh, it's an excellent helicopter.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 It came out of nowhere.

117
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:14,000
 Damn it! How dare you break my helicopter!

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 What's going on?

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 I-I think the helicopter is coming this way.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 W-What?

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 What's that?

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I don't know. Who is it?

123
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:42,606
 It's a blast.

124
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:47,445
 Oh, no, no.

125
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:52,295
 Hooray!

126
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:05,209
 It's too late, everyone.

127
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,521
 From today, I will be working at the launch site.

128
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:09,265
 I'm Keiichi Nakagawa.

129
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:11,279
 Nice to meet you.

130
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:12,197
 You bastard!

131
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:14,539
 How dare you destroy my helicopter!

132
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:15,008
 Huh?

133
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:15,937
 Oh?

134
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,868
 It's a Walther MPL submachine gun.

135
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:20,375
 Do you know?

136
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,047
 I'm so happy.

137
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:24,115
 By the way, this is the gun.

138
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,920
 Oh!

139
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:27,881
 It's the same as Dirty Harry.

140
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:30,545
 That movie was great, wasn't it?

141
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:32,680
 Oh, if you don't mind,

142
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:34,712
 I'd like to give you an apology for destroying the helicopter.

143
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:35,737
 Really?

144
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:36,845
 I'm sorry about that.

145
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,870
 No.

146
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:40,082
 I have a lot more at home.

147
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:42,107
 Would you like to come and see it next time?

148
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:43,132
 I'll go.

149
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,954
 Idiot!

150
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:49,569
 What are you thinking about?

151
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:51,655
 Revenge! Revenge!

152
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,889
 So this is no good either?

153
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:56,304
 Of course.

154
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:58,633
 Terai.

155
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:00,006
 Collect them.

156
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:00,677
 Yes, sir.

157
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,031
 My stomach is killing me again.

158
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,757
 I'm going to the doctor Reiko.

159
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:10,632
 I'll leave the rest to you.

160
00:09:11,787 --> 00:09:14,585
 You're a pretty attractive guy.

161
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,820
 I'm Ryotsu.

162
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:16,492
 Nice to meet you.

163
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:17,517
 Oh.

164
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,523
 You're the super famous Ryotsu?

165
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:22,890
 I am.

166
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:25,320
 I'm Ryotsu.

167
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,512
 Nice to meet you, too.

168
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:27,705
 You two are the bad guys.

169
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,616
 You two seem to be happy.

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Is that helicopter for the next time?

171
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,258
 You're rich for the konnyaku shop.

172
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,000
 Konnyaku shop?

173
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,000
 By the way, why did you become a police officer?

174
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:47,609
 Well,

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 I've lived in New York for a long time.

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I've always wanted to be a police officer who would risk his life for the citizens.

177
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:04,443
 And you're wearing a shabby uniform.

178
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:05,468
 What?

179
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,000
 That's right.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I think it's more problematic than a gun.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Is that so?

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,461
 The uniform of the police in Japan is not good.

183
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:16,000
 So I made an order in Armani.

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 It was about 1 million yen.

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 1 million yen?

186
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:26,975
 I don't think I can afford such a expensive uniform.

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I don't know how you feel about spending 300,000 yen on a radio.

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,257
 I'll deal it with you.

189
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,000
 Yes, yes.

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 By the way,

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,391
 I haven't been going to the police recently, but I've been trying to forgive you for that kind of uniform.

192
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:44,000
 Well, I was told it was no good, but I changed my clothes on the helicopter.

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 I'll do that.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 The chief should be in pain, too.

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I'll go to the patrol.

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Ryo-chan, tell Mr. Nakagawa.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 See you later.

198
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,658
 So what should I do?

199
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:03,000
 Terai, tell him what to do.

200
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:05,000
 You're the one who teaches him.

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 I'll go to the patrol, too.

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Hey.

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Damn it.

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Well, I...

205
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Stand in front of station and show people the way.

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Yes, sir.

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Are you Mr. Omawari?

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Yes, I am.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Oh, good.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 I'd like to ask you the way.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Yes, please.

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Senpai, please wake up.

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 What is it?

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,569
 I was sleeping well.

215
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:50,811
 I was asked the way, but I don't know anything about this area.

216
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,000
 What?

217
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 What?

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,670
 Show me the map and let me look for it.

219
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:59,000
 That's the old man who came back to Japan for the first time in 50 years.

220
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 He says he doesn't know where this is.

221
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Well, it can't be helped.

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,800
 So, where do you want to go?

223
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:09,175
 A restaurant.

224
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,000
 What kind of restaurant?

225
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I forgot the name of the restaurant, but I have a clue.

226
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,000
 What?

227
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:19,000
 It's a restaurant like this.

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Oh, that's a bad picture.

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Did you draw it?

230
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,655
 When I was a student, it was more than 50 years ago.

231
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,000
 What? 50 years ago?

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 So, what's the address of the restaurant?

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 That's the downtown of Tokyo.

234
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 That's all?

235
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Yes.

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 No, no.

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 The downtown is big.

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,162
 I don't understand.

239
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:44,752
 Give up.

240
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:46,000
 That's no good.

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Because it's my first job.

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Do whatever you want.

243
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:55,537
 If you let me look for it, I would like to thank you.

244
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:56,488
 What?

245
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:58,000
 Why don't you say that first?

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 I'll ask you about the details in the back.

247
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Hey, Nakagawa.

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,384
 Order coffee and cake for breakfast.

249
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:05,523
 What?

250
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:07,431
 Just go.

251
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:09,000
 Yes.

252
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I see.

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 When I was a high school student, I went to that restaurant several times.

254
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:17,339
 High school?

255
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,000
 Yes.

256
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 It's Tokyo Art University now.

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 I was always busy because I had a day off.

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 What?

259
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 That means it's near the art college.

260
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Yes.

261
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I walked for about 15 minutes.

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 The art college is on the upper floor.

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 If you don't mind, you can have this.

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Sorry.

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Let's look for it near the art college.

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Can you find it in about two hours?

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,421
 If it's on the upper floor, it'll take 20 to 30 minutes by car.

268
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:58,000
 Actually, I have to go back to Paris by the 1 o'clock flight to Narita.

269
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 If it's on the upper floor, it'll take about an hour in Tokyo.

270
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Nakagawa

271
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Get a taxi.

272
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 I'll call you right away.

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 It's me.

274
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,651
 Bring the car to the police station right away.

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Well...

276
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 How about my cake?

277
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Thank you very much.

278
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Here it is.

279
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Ferrari F40.

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Here you are.

281
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 But this is for two people.

282
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 I've remodeled it into a new one, so it's okay.

283
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Please get in.

284
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Reiko, I'm back at a good place.

285
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Ryo-chan.

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 I need help.

287
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I need a taxi.

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 What?

289
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 See you later.

290
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,489
 I think I saw him somewhere.

291
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:01,399
 Damn it.

292
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:03,485
 I don't have time for this.

293
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,000
 Hey, Nakagawa.

294
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Turn around.

295
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Senpai, it's impossible.

296
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Is it the exit of the one-way street?

297
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Idiot!

298
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Don't you want to make a good old man's wish come true?

299
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Well...

300
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Go back.

301
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Then there's no problem.

302
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:18,025
 No way.

303
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,062
 I understand.

304
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,087
 Senpai, let's go back.

305
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 What's going on?

306
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Idiot!

307
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I don't know.

308
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Ryotsu Kankichi.

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 He's back at it again.

310
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 It's nice to ride such a lovely car.

311
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 It's not the time to be impressed.

312
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 I'll arrest you this time.

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Turn left.

314
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Stop.

315
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Senpai, what should we do?

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 When you're busy...

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Come on!

318
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I'll show you the power of Ferrari.

319
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Yes, sir.

320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 It's too fast.

321
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 It's Ryotsu Kankichi again.

322
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 If there's a problem, I'll fix it.

323
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
 Turn right.

324
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,625
 Yes, sir.

325
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:32,000
 Turn left.

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Yes, sir.

327
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 But road  is so busy.

328
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 I can see it well.

329
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 I've been playing around here since I was a kid.

330
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 It's like a garden.

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 It's impossible to go any further.

332
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Idiot!

333
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 It's your first job.

334
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Policemen always finish their tasks.

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Senpai.

336
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 I made a mistake.

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 All right.

338
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 It's getting darker.

339
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Don't worry.

340
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I can get through.

341
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I've been here before.

342
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 It's not a bicycle.

343
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 All right.

344
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 As expected of Senpai.

345
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 What is this place?

346
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Can you stop for a moment?

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 It's nostalgic.

348
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I've lived in Paris for decades.

349
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 I often remember Japan.

350
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 It was when I was a student at a beautiful art school.

351
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I was surrounded by good friends.

352
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I was painting all day long.

353
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Ueno is a forest of art.

354
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 I went to the art museum every day.

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I had a good time with my friends.

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 At that time, I fell in love with the girl at the cafeteria that my friend took me to.

357
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 It was my first love.

358
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 That's the cafeteria in that painting.

359
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 When was that?

360
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I think it was close to graduation.

361
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 It was when I caught a cold and went to bed.

362
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 She came to the dormitory.

363
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 She took care of me.

364
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 When I got better, I tried to thank her.

365
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 At that time, I was poor and had no money to give her a present.

366
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 So I drew her portrait with all my heart.

367
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And I gave her that picture.

368
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 The happy face of that girl at that time is still burning in my eyes.

369
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 So what is that girl?

370
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I went to study in Paris at the same time as graduation.

371
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 I didn't say I liked her.

372
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It's a long time ago.

373
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 It's not the time to be upset.

374
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 There's only an hour left.

375
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Let's find the cafeteria.

376
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 How is it, old man?

377
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Do you remember the scenery around here?

378
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 This area has changed a lot since 50 years ago.

379
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 An hour left?

380
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It's impossible.

381
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I decided to bring back my memories to Paris as a memory.

382
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 There are still 10 minutes left.

383
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I won't give up.

384
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I won't give up.

385
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I can't find one or two of them.

386
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I'm going to be a police officer.

387
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Damn it!

388
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 I've been thinking about you for 50 years.

389
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I wanted to see you for the first time.

390
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 It's okay.

391
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 This is also fate.

392
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 That tree...

393
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 I found it!

394
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I found it!

395
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Look at this place.

396
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 It's the same as before.

397
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 It hasn't changed at all.

398
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Let's go see the first love.

399
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Wait a minute.

400
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 What's wrong, old man?

401
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 She's married and has a family.

402
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 I don't want to ask her all of a sudden.

403
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 What are you talking about?

404
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Let's go inside.

405
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 But...

406
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 If you don't open it, I'll open it.

407
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Come on.

408
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Open it.

409
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Hurry up and open it.

410
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Ms. Isumi.

411
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Mr. Taki.

412
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 It's Mr. Taki, right?

413
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Yes.

414
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 It's been a long time.

415
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 No, it's true.

416
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 That painting is still in the store.

417
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 You've been taking good care of it.

418
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 This painting is my treasure.

419
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Thank you, Ms. Isumi.

420
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Senpai, look at that happy face.

421
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 We police officers work hard for the people's smiles.

422
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Police officers have a great job.

423
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 By the way, how much will you give me?

424
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Senpai.

425
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 No, thanks to you, I made a good memory.

426
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Please accept this as a thank you.

427
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Thank you.

428
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Then I'll take care of it.

429
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Goodbye.

430
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,515
 Let's go home.

431
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Are you going again?

432
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 There's nothing to be happy about.

433
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I got such a bad painting.

434
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Hey, idiot.

435
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 I'll give you this painting.

436
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Is it okay?

437
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 It's okay.

438
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Go.

439
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Taki, Jotaro.

440
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Did the Ferrari just break down?

441
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 No, it didn't.

442
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 We still have a lot of cars.

443
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Do you have that much money?

444
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,826
 Well, it's about 400 million yen.

445
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,843
 400 million yen?

446
00:23:14,883 --> 00:23:17,000
 Nakagawa, let's get along.

447
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Ryo-chan.

448
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 There was an old man in the Ferrari, right?

449
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Yes, that old man.

450
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 No way.

451
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 He was a famous painter all over the world.

452
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 It's that old man, right?

453
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Is he such a famous painter?

454
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 One painting costs at least 100 million yen.

455
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 100 million yen?

456
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 I won.

457
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 You're good.

458
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I'll give you a lot of money.

459
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 My 100 million yen.
