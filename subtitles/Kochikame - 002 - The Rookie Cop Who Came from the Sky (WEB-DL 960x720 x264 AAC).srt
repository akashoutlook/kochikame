1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Poop-poop-poop-poop-poop-poop-poop.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 The South Wind blows.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 The South Wind blows.

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,900
 Eggplant salad!

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Poop-poop-poop-poop-poop-poop.

8
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,000
 Poop-poop-poop-poop!

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 One more?

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 A new soldier from the sky!

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 What a nice weather!

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Something good is going to happen on a day like this...

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 It's too quiet.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 It's too quiet.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 That means...

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Ryouku is late again!

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Huh?

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Ryou... Ryouku is working!

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 He came two hours before the time to go to work.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 He's been like that all the time.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I thought he'd take a shower even if it rained.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 We were just talking.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I'm very moved right now.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I've been working at the police station for 30 years.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I've never been this happy!

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Ryouku.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 You're so moved.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Ryouku finally woke up from work.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 He's been working so hard.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Yes! I did it!

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Good job, Ryouku!

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I thought you'd do it someday.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 By the way, what documents did you write?

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 What?

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I don't like it.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Did you forget, chief?

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Didn't I tell you yesterday?

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I told you to submit the finished paper.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 The finished paper?

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I wrote everything.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 My hands are frozen.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Idiot!

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Who are you?

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Chief, are you okay?

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I'm sorry, but I need medicine.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Okay.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Did you drink too much, chief?

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I'm old enough.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 I need to take care of myself.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 What did you say?

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 It's all your fault!

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Calm down, chief.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 If you get too angry, your blood vessels will break.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I have no choice but to give up because I have such a bad subordinate.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I remembered it as a subordinate.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Is Nakagawa-kun still here?

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Mr. Nakagawa?

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 He's a newcomer who's going to be in this police station from today.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 What kind of guy is he?

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Oh, he's pretty handsome.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 He grew up in New York until he was 16 years old.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 He's the same age as Reiko-san.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Yes.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 His car has a permanent license.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 He also has a boat and a plane license.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 He's also good at sports and can speak Japanese.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 He's so good at shooting that he can blow a needle's head off a kilometer away.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Who is Mr. Nakagawa?

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 He's the son of Nakagawa-zaibatsu.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Nakagawa-zaibatsu?

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Is he the Nakagawa-zaibatsu that can be found anywhere in the world?

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 That's right.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 What is that Nakagawa-zaibatsu?

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Is it a piece of wood?

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 It's not a piece of wood. It's a piece of wood.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 It's a piece of consul.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Is it a piece of konnyaku?

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 No, it's not.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Reiko-kun, don't talk like that.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Don't talk.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 You're going to hurt your stomach like me.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Yes.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 You're not going to get a hard job as a police officer.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 You're going to have to go to kindergarten and study hard.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Ryo-tsu!

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 You're going to have to teach Nakagawa-zaibatsu not to do that.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 What?

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Okay, now.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Let's go.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 How is it? Isn't it amazing?

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 It's the American helicopter Black Hawk combat rescue type.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 I'm tired of it.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Is that what you were doing yesterday?

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Well, yes.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 The chief will definitely be tired of it.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 That's strange.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 What is the prop?

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 What's with that locker?

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 That's right. I remember now.

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 When did you get that?

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Huh? You didn't know?

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 It's completely deformed.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Good, good.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Here we go.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Good, good boy.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Besides, how did you get this?

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 You could have used this passion for work.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I'm always using it.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Sorry, sorry.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Ryo-chan!

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Ryo-san?

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 What's going on?

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Are you okay, Ryo-san?

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I thought I was going to die.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 By the way, where's the helicopter?

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Helicopter?

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 It flew out.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 It's worth 300,000 yen!

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 If it's gone, I'll have to pay for it.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I'm not joking.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Ryo-chan is the one who's to blame.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Darn it. Where did it go?

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Huh?

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Oh, it's an excellent helicopter.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 It came out of nowhere.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Damn it! How dare you use my helicopter!

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 What's going on?

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 I-I think the helicopter is coming this way.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 W-What?

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 What's that?

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I don't know. Who is it?

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 It's a blast.

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Oh, no, no.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Hooray!

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 It's too late, everyone.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 From today, I will be working at the launch site.

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 I'm Keiichi Nakagawa.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Nice to meet you.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 You bastard!

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 How dare you destroy my helicopter!

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Huh?

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Oh?

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 It's a Walther MPL submachine gun.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Do you know?

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I'm so happy.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 By the way, this is the gun.

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Oh!

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 It's the same as Dirty Harry.

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 That movie was great, wasn't it?

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Oh, if you don't mind,

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I'd like to give you an apology for destroying the helicopter.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Really?

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 I'm sorry about that.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 No.

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I have a lot more at home.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Would you like to come and see it next time?

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 I'll go.

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Idiot!

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 What are you thinking about?

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Revenge! Revenge!

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 So this is no good either?

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Of course.

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Terai.

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Collect them.

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Yes, sir.

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 My stomach is killing me again.

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I'm going to the doctor.

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Reiko.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 I'll leave the rest to you.

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 You're a pretty attractive guy.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 I'm Ryotsu.

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Nice to meet you.

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Oh.

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 You're the super famous Ryotsu?

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I am.

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I'm Ryotsu.

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Nice to meet you, too.

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 You two are the bad guys.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 You two seem to be happy.

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Is that helicopter for the next time?

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 You're rich for the konnyaku shop.

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Konnyaku shop?

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 By the way, why did you become a police officer?

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Well,

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 I've lived in New York for a long time.

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I've always wanted to be a police officer who would risk his life for the citizens.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 And you're wearing a shabby uniform.

189
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 What?

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 That's right.

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I think it's more problematic than a gun.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Is that so?

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 The uniform of the police in Japan is not good.

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 So I made an order in Armani.

195
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 It was about 1 million yen.

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 1 million yen?

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 I don't think I can afford such a cheap uniform.

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I don't know how you feel about spending 300,000 yen on a radio.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I'll do it with you.

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Yes, yes.

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 By the way,

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 I haven't been going to the police recently, but I've been trying to forgive you for that kind of uniform.

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Well, I was told it was no good, but I changed my clothes on the helicopter.

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 I'll do that.

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 The chief should be in pain, too.

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I'll go to the patrol.

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Ryo-chan, tell Mr. Nakagawa.

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 See you later.

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 So what should I do?

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I'll tell you.

211
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 You're the one who teaches me.

212
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 I'll go to the patrol, too.

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Hey.

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Damn it.

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Well, I...

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Stand in front of me and show me the way.

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Yes, sir.

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Are you Mr. Omawari?

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Yes, I am.

220
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Oh, good.

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 I'd like to ask you the way.

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Yes, please.

223
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Senpai, please wake up.

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 What is it?

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I was sleeping well.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I was asked the way, but I don't know anything about this area.

227
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 What?

228
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 What?

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Show me the map and let me look for it.

230
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 That's the old man who came back to Japan for the first time in 50 years.

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 He says he doesn't know where this is.

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Well, it can't be helped.

233
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 So, where do you want to go?

234
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 A restaurant.

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 What kind of restaurant?

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I forgot the name of the restaurant, but I have a clue.

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 What?

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 It's a restaurant like this.

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Oh, that's a bad picture.

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Did you draw it?

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 When I was a student, it was more than 50 years ago.

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 What? 50 years ago?

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 So, what's the address of the restaurant?

244
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 That's the downtown of Tokyo.

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 That's all?

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Yes.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 No, no.

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 The downtown is big.

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 I don't understand.

250
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Give up.

251
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 That's no good.

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Because it's my first job.

253
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Do whatever you want.

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 If you let me look for it, I would like to thank you.

255
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 What?

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Why don't you say that first?

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 I'll ask you about the details in the back.

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Hey, Nakagawa.

259
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Order coffee and cake for breakfast.

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 What?

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Just go.

262
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Yes.

263
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I see.

264
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 When I was a high school student, I went to that restaurant several times.

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 High school?

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Yes.

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 It's Tokyo Art University now.

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 I was always busy because I had a day off.

269
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 What?

270
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 That means it's near the art college.

271
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Yes.

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I walked for about 15 minutes.

273
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 The art college is on the upper floor.

274
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 If you don't mind, I'll have this.

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Sorry.

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Let's look for it near the art college.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Can you find it in about two hours?

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 If it's on the upper floor, it'll take 20 to 30 minutes by car.

279
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Actually, I have to go back to Paris by the 1 o'clock flight to Narita.

280
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 If it's on the upper floor, it'll take about an hour in Tokyo.

281
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 What?

282
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Get a taxi.

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 I'll call you right away.

284
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 It's me.

285
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Bring the car to the airport right away.

286
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Well...

287
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 How about my car?

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Thank you very much.

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Here it is.

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Ferrari F40.

291
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Here you are.

292
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 But this is for two people.

293
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 I've remodeled it into a new one, so it's okay.

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Please get in.

295
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Reiko, I'm back at a good place.

296
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Ryo-chan.

297
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 I need help.

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I need a taxi.

299
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 What?

300
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 See you later.

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 I think I saw him somewhere.

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 I'm back at the airport.

303
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Damn it.

304
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 I don't have time for this.

305
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Hey, Nakagawa.

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Turn around.

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Senpai, it's impossible.

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Is it the exit of the one-way street?

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Idiot!

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Don't you want to make a good old man's wish come true?

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Well...

312
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Go back.

313
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Then there's no problem.

314
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 No way.

315
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I understand.

316
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Senpai, let's go back.

317
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 What's going on?

318
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Idiot!

319
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I don't know.

320
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Ryoji Kankichi.

321
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 He's back at it again.

322
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 It's nice to ride such a lovely car.

323
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 It's not the time to be impressed.

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 I'll arrest you this time.

325
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Turn left.

326
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Stop.

327
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Senpai, what should we do?

328
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 When you're busy...

329
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Come on!

330
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I'll show you the power of Ferrari.

331
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Yes, sir.

332
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 It's too fast.

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 It's Ryoji Kankichi again.

334
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 If there's a problem, I'll fix it.

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Turn right.

336
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Yes, sir.

337
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Turn left.

338
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Yes, sir.

339
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 But Ryoji is so busy.

340
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 I can see it well.

341
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 I've been playing around here since I was a kid.

342
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 It's like a garden.

343
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 It's impossible to go any further.

344
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Idiot!

345
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 It's your first job.

346
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Policemen always finish their tasks.

347
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Senpai.

348
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 I made a mistake.

349
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 All right.

350
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 It's getting darker.

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Don't worry.

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I can get through.

353
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I've been here before.

354
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 It's not a bicycle.

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 All right.

356
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 As expected of Senpai.

357
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 What is this place?

358
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Can you stop for a moment?

359
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 It's nostalgic.

360
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I've lived in Paris for decades.

361
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 I often remember Japan.

362
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 It was when I was a student at a beautiful art school.

363
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I was surrounded by good friends.

364
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I was painting all day long.

365
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Ueno is a forest of art.

366
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 I went to the art museum every day.

367
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I had a good time with my friends.

368
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 At that time, I fell in love with the girl at the cafeteria that my friend took me to.

369
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 It was my first love.

370
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 That's the cafeteria in that painting.

371
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 When was that?

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I think it was close to graduation.

373
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 It was when I caught a cold and went to bed.

374
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 She came to the dormitory.

375
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 She took care of me.

376
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 When I got better, I tried to thank her.

377
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 At that time, I was poor and had no money to give her a present.

378
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 So I drew her portrait with all my heart.

379
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And I gave her that picture.

380
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 The happy face of that girl at that time is still burning in my eyes.

381
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 So what is that girl?

382
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I went to study in Paris at the same time as graduation.

383
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 I didn't say I liked her.

384
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It's a long time ago.

385
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 It's not the time to be upset.

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 There's only an hour left.

387
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Let's find the cafeteria.

388
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 How is it, old man?

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Do you remember the scenery around here?

390
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 This area has changed a lot since 50 years ago.

391
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 An hour left?

392
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It's impossible.

393
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I decided to bring back my memories to Paris as a memory.

394
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 There are still 10 minutes left.

395
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I won't give up.

396
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I won't give up.

397
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I can't find one or two of them.

398
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I'm going to be a police officer.

399
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Damn it!

400
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 I've been thinking about you for 50 years.

401
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I wanted to see you for the first time.

402
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 It's okay.

403
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 This is also fate.

404
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 That tree...

405
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 I found it!

406
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I found it!

407
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Look at this place.

408
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 It's the same as before.

409
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 It hasn't changed at all.

410
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Let's go see the first love.

411
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Wait a minute.

412
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 What's wrong, old man?

413
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 He's married and has a family.

414
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 I don't want to ask him all of a sudden.

415
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 What are you talking about?

416
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Let's go inside.

417
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 But...

418
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 If you don't open it, I'll open it.

419
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Come on.

420
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Open it.

421
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Hurry up and open it.

422
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Ms. Isumi.

423
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Mr. Taki.

424
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 It's Mr. Taki, right?

425
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Yes.

426
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 It's been a long time.

427
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 No, it's true.

428
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 That painting is still in the store.

429
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 You've been taking good care of it.

430
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 This painting is my treasure.

431
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Thank you, Ms. Isumi.

432
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Senpai, look at that happy face.

433
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 We police officers work hard for the people's smiles.

434
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Police officers have a great job.

435
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 By the way, how much will you give me?

436
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Senpai.

437
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 No, thanks to you, I made a good memory.

438
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Please accept this as a thank you.

439
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Thank you.

440
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Then I'll take care of it.

441
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Goodbye.

442
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Let's go home.

443
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Are you going again?

444
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 There's nothing to be happy about.

445
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I got such a bad painting.

446
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Hey, idiot.

447
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 I'll do this painting.

448
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Is it okay?

449
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 It's okay.

450
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Go.

451
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Taki, Jotaro.

452
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Did the Ferrari just break down?

453
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 No, it didn't.

454
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 We still have a lot of cars.

455
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Do you have that much money?

456
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Well, it's about 400 million yen.

457
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 400 million yen?

458
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Nakagawa, let's get along.

459
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Ryo-chan.

460
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 There was an old man in the Ferrari, right?

461
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Yes, that old man.

462
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 No way.

463
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 He was a famous painter all over the world.

464
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 It's that old man, right?

465
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Is he such a famous painter?

466
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 One painting costs at least 100 million yen.

467
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 100 million yen?

468
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 I won.

469
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 You're good.

470
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I'll give you a lot of money.

471
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 My 100 million yen.

472
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

473
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 I've come up with an amazing idea.

474
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I'm going to sell ramen on a balloon.

475
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 I mean, a convenience store.

476
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 What do you think?

477
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 No one can come up with such a great idea.

478
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 I'm a genius.

479
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Next time, on Sky Jumping Store.

480
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 I'm looking forward to it.

481
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Hey, smile at me

482
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 You're not bad

483
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Hey, smile at me

484
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 You're doing great

485
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Smile at me all the time

486
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 A serious woman is not beautiful

487
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 You should smile right away

488
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 If you're not a child
