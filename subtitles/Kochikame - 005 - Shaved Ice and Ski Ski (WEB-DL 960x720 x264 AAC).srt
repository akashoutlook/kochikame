1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,360
 Shaved Ice and Ski Ski!

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,400
 I can't do this in the morning.

3
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,640
 Kaki-gori, give me some strawberries.

4
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
 Sure.

5
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
 Huh? When did you start doing this?

6
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,960
 I've been doing it since this year.

7
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,560
 It's easier to do it in the morning, and it's easier to do it in the evening.

8
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,760
 That's true.

9
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,400
 Yeah, I thought I am going to throw that away.

10
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,520
 Throw it away? What a waste.

11
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,160
 You can still use this kaki-gori.

12
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,280
 Well, it's the flow of the times.

13
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,080
 Here you go.

14
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,520
 If you don't want it, I'll take it.

15
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,040
 Yeah, sure.

16
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,240
 Grandma!

17
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,040
 Huh?

18
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,240
 Give me some strawberries.

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,520
 I'll have some lemons.

20
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,640
 Sure.

21
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,320
 You guys, if you don't study and wait for the money, I'll get mad at you.

22
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,760
 Ryo-san, is it okay for you to be selling oil in a place like this?

23
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,640
 I'm not selling oil. I'm eating ice.

24
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,040
 I don't want to talk like a boss to a kid like this anymore.

25
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,040
 I ate it.

26
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:02,850
 If you eat something cold, you'll get a stomachache and go to sleep.

27
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,800
 You won't even know if you get a stomachache and puke.

28
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:08,465
 Then I'll take it.

29
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,530
 Sure.

30
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:18,245
 Hey, you, working-class workers.

31
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,205
 Ryo-chan, what's that?

32
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,664
 It's an ice-picking machine. I got it from a candy shop.

33
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,123
 An ice-picking machine?

34
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:28,070
 You can get anything you want, senpai.

35
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,520
 What are you going to do with that?

36
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,720
 Huh?

37
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,040
 I'm going to make shaved ice.

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,200
 Winter is the season of the year. Summer is the season of the year.

39
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,920
 I can't do anything with this.

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
 Senpai, if it's an ice-picking machine...

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,320
 Ryo-chan bought it at the supermarket last week.

42
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,440
 There's a pen-kichi-kun like this one, right?

43
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,040
 Hey!

44
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,120
 You can't be like that toy!

45
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,720
 In this day and age, shaved ice has to be real.

46
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,680
 Is there a real shaved ice?

47
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,720
 Sometimes it changes depending on the place.

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,305
 I showed you this shaved ice machine last week.

49
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
 I'm going to make it right away.

50
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,600
 But Ryo-chan, if it's real, you won't use the ice in the refrigerator, right?

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
 Huh?

52
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,200
 If it's real, you'll have to use the ice in Mont Blanc or the ice in the South Pole.

53
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
 The ice in the South Pole...

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,320
 There's a branch of the Nakagawa Continent in Greenland.

55
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,320
 The ice in the North Pole should be fine, but...

56
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,200
 That's it!

57
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,920
 Huh?

58
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,400
 Gourmet shaved ice is more in the North Pole than the South Pole.

59
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,440
 I will buy that ice.

60
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
 Give it to me right away.

61
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,520
 Okay, but...

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,120
 Listen, right away.

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,440
 I hate waiting.

64
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,560
 I understand.

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
 Then I'll take a break and come back.

66
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:54,157
 I'm going to throw up right away.

67
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
 What?

68
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
 It's so noisy that I can't sleep.

69
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:10,807
 Senior, the shaved ice has arrived at the North Pole.

70
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:11,728
 Huh?

71
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:13,824
 Hurry up! The shaved ice is here!

72
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:14,729
 Huh?

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
 It's here!

74
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,560
 Where's the shaved ice?

75
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
 Hurry up!

76
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,440
 Huh?

77
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
 There's only one shaved ice!

78
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,640
 I did it!

79
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
 All of these are mine!

80
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,231
 Here, take it for the ice.

81
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,440
 This way!

82
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
 A little bit more!

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
 There's no space!

84
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,828
 I'm going to throw up right away.

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
 It's so hot!

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,320
 It's the worst when the cooler breaks at a time like this.

87
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
 I feel like I'm going to get wet even with the snow.

88
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
 I know.

89
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,280
 Huh?

90
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
 What's that?

91
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:21,620
 It's the mountain!

92
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:34,521
 The lights are different after all.

93
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,780
 Ryo-chan, can you give me some too?

94
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:38,436
 No.

95
00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:39,584
 Why not?

96
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:41,120
 Just a little bit.

97
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
 Shaving ice is a very important thing.

98
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
 You can't just get it for free.

99
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:49,960
 No matter what you say, I've already paid 10,000 yen in Nakagawa.

100
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
 The ice is all mine.

101
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,150
 The ice in the refrigerator suits you, Tenkichi-kun.

102
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
 What a terrible sound.

103
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:08,960
 Compared to that, it's a wonderful sound.

104
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
 It's like the sound of a bug.

105
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,960
 This is Japan's traditional shaved ice.

106
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:16,800
 I'll put some syrup on it.

107
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,034
 It's done!

108
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
 The ice is as delicate and beautiful as the snow.

109
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 I'll have a bite first.

110
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
 It's good!

111
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
 The real one is different after all.

112
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
 And it's also pleasant.

113
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,032
 The smell of water and the smell of the refrigerator is mixed together.

114
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,057
 It's really pleasant.

115
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
 Mmm...

116
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,253
 Mmm...

117
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:45,382
 This is so good.

118
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,343
 It's full of the romance of Taiko.

119
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:51,761
 It has to come from the beautiful ice.

120
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:54,786
 It's the best shaved ice in the world.

121
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:58,640
 No, actually, this should be called shaved ice.

122
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,640
 The ice I shaved in the refrigerator is no longer shaved ice.

123
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,480
 You ate the best shaved ice I made yesterday.

124
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:12,480
 That's right.

125
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,480
 I'll make it with milk this time.

126
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,197
 Huh?

127
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,685
 Hey, what?!

128
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:21,099
 Don't steal it!

129
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:22,724
 I'll arrest you!

130
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:24,748
 Just a little bit is fine.

131
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:27,773
 Thanks to this shaved ice, the heat is getting through.

132
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
 Look, the car is moving.

133
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,795
 Hurry up and get to work.

134
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,842
 Oh, Keiichi.

135
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,030
 Mmm...

136
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,740
 It's beautiful.

137
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,230
 It's really delicious!

138
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:51,763
 It's just like a gourmet shaved ice!

139
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:57,396
 Oh, I want you guys to eat it too.

140
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:02,099
 I'm really satisfied with shaved ice like that.

141
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,279
 It's really refreshing.

142
00:09:03,304 --> 00:09:05,826
 The brilliance of this elegant ice and the softness of the milk.

143
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:15,458
 The sound of the ice popping is the elegance of Venus's whisper, which woke up from a sleep of millions of years.

144
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:19,740
 Fantastic!

145
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,767
 This is the color of the rose and the color of shaved ice!

146
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:25,256
 I'm going to eat it all!

147
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:32,334
 The inside of my mouth is cold and numb.

148
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:36,334
 I'm going to eat it all! But when it comes to the 70th cup, it's a little...

149
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,107
 Aren't you tired of it? It's about time.

150
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:38,381
 What?

151
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
 That's not true!

152
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,219
 Is this the ice?

153
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:46,908
 It's cold.

154
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,197
 It's dangerous, so move away from here.

155
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:53,222
 It feels good.

156
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,493
 Damn it!

157
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:00,975
 Eat this! It's my shaved ice!

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,813
 Don't make it your own!

159
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:05,000
 I paid for it and bought it.

160
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,408
 It's my meal for a week!

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 It's delicious!

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,570
 It tastes like strawberry and has milk topping.

163
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,523
 I ate it all and my head is numb.

164
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:32,438
 Are you okay, Senpai?

165
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:33,887
 Don't push yourself too hard.

166
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,552
 I gave it to a neighbor.

167
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:37,574
 What is this?

168
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:40,599
 If you think this is just water, you can drink as much as you want!

169
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:44,378
 It's water for two-thirds of the human body.

170
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:48,168
 There are still so many people left.

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 All right, it's a special service for you guys.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,559
 I'll give you this full-fledged meal shaved ice.

173
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:56,504
 I've already eaten it, so it's okay.

174
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:58,223
 That's right. I don't need it.

175
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:00,000
 Ryo-chan, take responsibility.

176
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:02,815
 All right, I'll eat it all.

177
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,267
 I'll eat it all.

178
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,534
 What are you going to do?

179
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,956
 It's decided.

180
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,472
 I'm going to eat it.

181
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:21,816
 I only have strawberry flavor and milk flavor, so I'm going to eat it.

182
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:26,105
 I'm going to put cola on this side and change it with ketchup sauce.

183
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,655
 I'm going to put eggs and natto on this side.

184
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
 I'm going to eat it with vitamin drinks.

185
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,016
 Doesn't it look delicious?

186
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:35,157
 Are you really going to eat it?

187
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:36,455
 Of course.

188
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,680
 It's getting cold.

189
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
 I'll drink tea and warm up.

190
00:11:59,914 --> 00:12:01,914
 All right, it's warm.

191
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:13,086
 I can't eat any more.

192
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:14,875
 What are you going to do with the rest?

193
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,529
 I'm going to make rice balls and eat them later.

194
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,074
 What is this?

195
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:23,739
 Ryotsu, is it your doing again?

196
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:25,122
 What is it?

197
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:26,680
 I didn't do anything.

198
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:27,717
 Come on.

199
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:31,863
 My ears are stretching.

200
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:34,182
 What is this?

201
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:36,910
 That phone is useless.

202
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,899
 This is a stage device I prepared for the chief.

203
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,772
 For me?

204
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,038
 That's right.

205
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:52,349
 I'm going to have Ryuhyo Nagaretabi, the chief's specialty, sing in karaoke in this ice mountain bag.

206
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:53,663
 Don't fool me.

207
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:58,778
 This is the ice from the North Pole that was imported directly from Greenland.

208
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:01,574
 Ryo-chan bought it for 10,000 yen from Kei-chan.

209
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,739
 Ryotsu.

210
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,411
 How about a cup of tea, chief?

211
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:07,786
 I don't need it.

212
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:10,712
 Put an end to this ice.

213
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:13,336
 Listen to me.

214
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,719
 Even if you say that,

215
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:16,969
 Shut up.

216
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:20,158
 If this ice doesn't disappear until tomorrow,

217
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,844
 You will be sent to the North Pole.

218
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,813
 North Pole?

219
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,766
 Is there such a place?

220
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,204
 I'll make it especially for you.

221
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:30,360
 Do you understand, Ryotsu?

222
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,330
 There is still a lot of ice.

223
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:51,187
 There is no way I can eat all of this today.

224
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:52,640
 This is it.

225
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,304
 The ice mountain that Ryo-san bought.

226
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:58,032
 This is the ice mountain of the North Pole.

227
00:13:58,057 --> 00:13:59,374
 If you stand out this much,

228
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,764
 it will be a rumor.

229
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:04,257
 What are you going to do?

230
00:14:04,282 --> 00:14:07,774
 I thought I'd shave all of this and eat it.

231
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,360
 If you make this much ice into shaved ice,

232
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
 you can ski.

233
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,360
 That's it.

234
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,109
 That's it.

235
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:21,539
 I like this hot summer, I am going to do ski.

236
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:24,008
 I'm going to take this.

237
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,772
 Rental skiing and rental snowboarding.

238
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:32,797
 I don't mind if I think about it.

239
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
 I can make money and clean up the ice.

240
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
 It's exactly the same.

241
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
 Okay, let's get started.

242
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:49,305
 Okay, let's get started.

243
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,360
 What is this?

244
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
 Even if this hand is mine...

245
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,951
 Senpai, what are you going to start again?

246
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,487
 I'm sure it's about money.

247
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:17,358
 Ryo-chan's power is all about money.

248
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,650
 Thank you for your hard work.

249
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:38,306
 Good morning, Ryo-san.

250
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:39,242
 Please carry the rest.

251
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
 Next is the seat.

252
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
 Okay.

253
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
 It's a woman's morning meal.

254
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,360
 Now the road is clear.

255
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,771
 Kankichi, what are you doing with the ice?

256
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
 I did a lot.

257
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,673
 Ryo-san, I brought ski and snowboarding.

258
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:19,181
 Please put it there.

259
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:20,360
 Okay.

260
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
 Okay, now I'm ready.

261
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
 I did pretty well.

262
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,878
 Welcome, welcome.

263
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:36,360
 Ryo-tsu Snowland.

264
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
 I'm back.

265
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,360
 What is Ryo-tsu Snowland?

266
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
 Welcome, welcome.

267
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,651
 It's snowing in the middle of summer.

268
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:48,368
 It's a small town like a desert.

269
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,335
 In the middle of summer, you can enjoy skiing, snowboarding,

270
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,130
 and even bobsleigh.

271
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:57,326
 That's it.

272
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,373
 Let's go in.

273
00:16:58,398 --> 00:17:00,249
 Yeah, that sounds fun.

274
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:01,843
 Me too.

275
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:08,265
 The traffic jam has been resolved, but there's still a lot to do.

276
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
 Yes, yes.

277
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,761
 This is the snowboard.

278
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:15,082
 You can't bring it in.

279
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:17,082
 Yes, the company is 10% off.

280
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:19,539
 You can't bring it in.

281
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:20,360
 How about that snowboard?

282
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
 Yes, yes.

283
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
 Welcome, welcome.

284
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,360
 Welcome, welcome.

285
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:28,683
 Thank you.

286
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,335
 I think this will be a few million yen.

287
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,088
 That's right.

288
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:34,627
 Snowboard

289
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
 Come on, come on.

290
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,360
 When you're hungry,

291
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
 it's snowland specialty, kourizushi.

292
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
 It's a fish that makes your parents cry.

293
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,474
 It's a favorite egg for children.

294
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:48,360
 If you don't eat this,

295
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,360
 you won't get anything.

296
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,885
 Then grab one.

297
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,971
 I want an egg.

298
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:55,315
 Okay, one egg.

299
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:00,436
 Wait.

300
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:03,536
 The rice is frozen.

301
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:05,601
 That's right, It's frozen.

302
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,960
 It's cold, so it lasts a long time.

303
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:09,030
 How do you eat it?

304
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:12,360
 You eat it with jam.

305
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
 It's refreshing.

306
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
 Let's eat it with jam.

307
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
 If you don't like raw food,

308
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,360
 how about ice curry?

309
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,816
 Welcome.

310
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:26,360
 Even curry is ice?

311
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,577
 I want that.

312
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:28,655
 Curry.

313
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,030
 I can still eat it.

314
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:42,335
 If you hit it,

315
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,255
 you'll get a car and an egg.

316
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,360
 If you throw it,

317
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,108
 you'll be happy.

318
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:49,765
 Uncle, give it to me.

319
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,000
 Me too.

320
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,289
 Don't push it.

321
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:54,314
 The egg is 200 yen here.

322
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
 Me too.

323
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
 I can't do this anymore.

324
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
 I can't do this anymore.

325
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:06,962
 What?

326
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:08,331
 Wait, What?

327
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
 Ryo-tsu?

328
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,825
 He made a snow land in the park.

329
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,091
 He rents skis and snowboards

330
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,389
 and earns money.

331
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:21,234
 What a guy.

332
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,796
 If you make so much money,

333
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:27,938
 do you want to buy another mountain?

334
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
 Ryo-tsu.

335
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,360
 What is it, chief?

336
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,954
 You make this in the park

337
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,532
 and earn money?

338
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:42,360
 No way.

339
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
 I don't just make ice.

340
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
 I want to make a place

341
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
 for the local residents.

342
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
 I want the people of Kameyari

343
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,381
 to be happy.

344
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:54,360
 What is this?

345
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,360
 What is it?

346
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,360
 Ryo-tsu!

347
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,311
 I know you have money behind your back.

348
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,770
 Give it back to everyone!

349
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,719
 No way!

350
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,360
 Wait!

351
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
 Time out!

352
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 Wait!

353
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,360
 It went well.

354
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
 What?

355
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
 Ryo-tsu!

356
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
 I got it.

357
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,658
 I have an egg.

358
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
 Wasabi!

359
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:40,360
 Wait!

360
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:45,726
 Wait!

361
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
 What?

362
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
 Damn it!

363
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,357
 No way!

364
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
 It's an earthquake!

365
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:07,165
 Wait!

366
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
 Ouch!

367
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
 Watch out!

368
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:23,266
 Damn it!

369
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,577
 It's mine!

370
00:21:25,602 --> 00:21:27,263
 I won't give it to anyone!

371
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
 Come on!

372
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,529
 Get ready, Ryo-tsu!

373
00:21:38,554 --> 00:21:39,515
 What?

374
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,023
 I won't do that!

375
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:42,617
 You're naive!

376
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,300
 It's collapsing!

377
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
 It's so heavy!

378
00:22:23,094 --> 00:22:24,615
 What is that?

379
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:31,249
 Where did everyone go?

380
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:33,920
 It's time to retreat.

381
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:40,047
 Ryo-tsu!

382
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:44,360
 It's strange.

383
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
 No one is here.

384
00:22:49,216 --> 00:22:50,360
 Chief!

385
00:22:58,116 --> 00:23:00,116
 Help me!

386
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
 Help me!

387
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:22,914
 I protected you.

388
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,789
 Give this money back to everyone.

389
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:28,360
 No!

390
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
 It's mine!

391
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
 It's mine!

392
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,360
 Good for you.

393
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
 You used up all the ice.

394
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,360
 I'm a stingy man.

395
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
 I use up all my money.

396
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,814
 I wonder if my instinct makes me do that.

397
00:23:51,258 --> 00:23:53,258
 Shut up!

398
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,360
 I'm done for!

399
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
 If I make Reiko angry,

400
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
 I'll be in big trouble!

401
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
 I'll throw away the high-speed cars!

402
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
 I'll run the high-speed roads backwards!

403
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
 Then I won't have a wife!

404
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
 Next time, on Reiko,

405
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
 I'll chase after her with anger!

406
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
 Let's do this!
