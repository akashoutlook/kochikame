1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,380
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,360
 Shaved Ice and Ski Ski!

5
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,400
 I can't do this in the morning.

6
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,640
 Kaki-gori, give me some strawberries.

7
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
 Sure.

8
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
 Huh? When did you start doing this?

9
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,960
 I've been doing it since this year.

10
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,560
 It's easier to do it in the morning, and it's easier to do it in the evening.

11
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,760
 That's true.

12
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,400
 Yeah, I thought you were going to throw that away.

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,520
 Throw it away? What a waste.

14
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,160
 You can still use this kaki-gori.

15
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,280
 Well, it's the flow of the times.

16
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,080
 Here you go.

17
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,520
 If you don't want it, I'll take it.

18
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,040
 Yeah, sure.

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,240
 Grandma!

20
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,040
 Huh?

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,240
 Give me some strawberries.

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,520
 I'll have some melons.

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,640
 Sure.

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,320
 You guys, if you don't study and wait for the money, I'll get mad at you.

25
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,760
 Ryo-san, is it okay for you to be selling oil in a place like this?

26
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,640
 I'm not selling oil. I'm eating ice.

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,040
 I don't want to talk like a boss to a kid like this anymore.

28
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,040
 I ate it.

29
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,160
 If you eat something cold, you'll get a stomachache and go to sleep.

30
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,800
 You won't even know if you get a stomachache and puke.

31
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,920
 Then I'll take it.

32
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,960
 Sure.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,600
 Hey, you, working-class workers.

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
 Ryo-chan, what's that?

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,040
 It's an ice-picking machine. I got it from a candy shop.

36
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,640
 An ice-picking machine?

37
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,680
 You can get anything you want, senpai.

38
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,720
 I see.

39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,520
 What are you going to do with that?

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,720
 Huh?

41
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,040
 I'm going to make shaved ice.

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,200
 Winter is the season of the year. Summer is the season of the year.

43
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,920
 I can't do anything with this.

44
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
 Senpai, if it's an ice-picking machine...

45
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,320
 Ryo-chan bought it at the supermarket last week.

46
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,440
 There's a pen-kichi-kun like this one, right?

47
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,040
 Hey!

48
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,120
 You can't be like that toy!

49
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,720
 In this day and age, shaved ice has to be real.

50
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,680
 Is there a real shaved ice?

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,720
 Sometimes it changes depending on the place.

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,640
 I showed you this shaved ice machine last week.

53
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
 I'm going to make it right away.

54
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,600
 But Ryo-chan, if it's real, you won't use the ice in the refrigerator, right?

55
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
 Huh?

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,200
 If it's real, you'll have to use the ice in Mont Blanc or the ice in the South Pole.

57
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
 The ice in the South Pole...

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,320
 There's a branch of the Nakagawa Continent in Greenland.

59
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,320
 The ice in the North Pole should be fine, but...

60
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,200
 That's it!

61
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,920
 Huh?

62
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,400
 Gourmet shaved ice is more in the North Pole than the South Pole.

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,440
 I bought that ice.

64
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
 Give it to me right away.

65
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,520
 Okay, but...

66
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,120
 Listen, right away.

67
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,440
 I hate waiting.

68
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,560
 I understand.

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
 Then I'll take a break and come back.

70
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,000
 I'm going to throw up right away.

71
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
 What?

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
 It's so noisy that I can't sleep.

73
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,400
 Senior, the shaved ice has arrived at the North Pole.

74
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,200
 Huh?

75
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,600
 Hurry up! The shaved ice is here!

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,480
 Huh?

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
 It's here!

78
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,560
 Where's the shaved ice?

79
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
 Hurry up!

80
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
 I'm going to throw up right away.

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
 I'm going to throw up right away.

82
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,440
 Huh?

83
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
 There's only one shaved ice!

84
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,640
 I did it!

85
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
 All of these are mine!

86
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
 Here, take the ice.

87
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,440
 This way!

88
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
 A little bit more!

89
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
 There's no space!

90
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
 I'm going to throw up right away.

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
 I'm going to throw up right away.

92
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
 I'm going to throw up right away.

93
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
 I'm going to throw up right away.

94
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
 It's so hot!

95
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,320
 It's the worst when the cooler breaks at a time like this.

96
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
 I feel like I'm going to get wet even with the snow.

97
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
 I know.

98
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,280
 Huh?

99
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
 What's that?

100
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
 It's so hot!

101
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
 It's so hot!

102
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
 It's the mountain!

103
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
 It's the mountain!

104
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
 It's the mountain!

105
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
 The lights are different after all.

106
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
 Ryo-chan, can you give me some too?

107
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
 No.

108
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
 Why not?

109
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
 Just a little bit.

110
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
 Shaving ice is a very important thing.

111
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
 You can't just do it for free.

112
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,960
 No matter what you say, I've already paid 10,000 yen in Nakagawa.

113
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
 The ice is all mine.

114
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,960
 The ice in the refrigerator suits you, Tenkichi-kun.

115
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
 What a terrible sound.

116
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,960
 Compared to that, it's a wonderful sound.

117
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
 It's like the sound of a bug.

118
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,960
 This is Japan's traditional shaved ice.

119
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
 I'll put some syrup on it.

120
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
 It's done!

121
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
 The ice is as delicate and beautiful as the snow.

122
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 I'll have a bite first.

123
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
 It's good!

124
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
 The real one is different after all.

125
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
 And it's also pleasant.

126
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,800
 The smell of water and the smell of the refrigerator is mixed together.

127
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
 It's really pleasant.

128
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
 Mmm...

129
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
 Mmm...

130
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
 This is so good.

131
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
 It's full of the romance of Taiko.

132
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,640
 It has to come from the beautiful ice.

133
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,640
 It's the best shaved ice in the world.

134
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,640
 No, actually, this should be called shaved ice.

135
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,640
 The ice I shaved in the refrigerator is no longer shaved ice.

136
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,480
 You ate the best shaved ice I made yesterday.

137
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
 That's right.

138
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,480
 I'll make it with milk this time.

139
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
 Huh?

140
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
 Eat this!

141
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
 Don't steal it!

142
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
 I'll arrest you!

143
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
 Just a little bit is fine.

144
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,480
 Thanks to this shaved ice, the heat is getting through.

145
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
 Look, the car is moving.

146
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
 Hurry up and get to work.

147
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,480
 Oh, Keiichi.

148
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
 Mmm...

149
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
 It's beautiful.

150
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
 It's delicious!

151
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
 It's really delicious!

152
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,480
 It's just like a gourmet shaved ice!

153
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
 Oh, I want you guys to eat it too.

154
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,480
 I'm really satisfied with shaved ice like that.

155
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
 It's really refreshing.

156
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,480
 The brilliance of this elegant ice and the softness of the milk.

157
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,320
 The sound of the ice popping is the elegance of Venus's whisper,

158
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,320
 which woke up from a sleep of millions of years.

159
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
 Fantastic!

160
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
 This is the color of the rose and the color of shaved ice!

161
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
 I'm going to eat it all!

162
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,320
 The inside of my mouth is cold and numb.

163
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
 I'm going to eat it all!

164
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,160
 But when it comes to the 70th cup, it's a little...

165
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
 Aren't you tired of it? It's about time.

166
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
 What?

167
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
 That's not true!

168
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
 Is this the ice?

169
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
 It's cold.

170
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
 Eat this!

171
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
 It's dangerous, so move away from here.

172
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
 It feels good.

173
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
 Damn it!

174
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
 Eat this! It's my shaved ice!

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Don't make it on your own!

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I paid for it and bought it.

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 It's my meal for a week!

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 It's delicious!

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 It tastes like strawberry and has milk topping.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 I ate it all and my head is numb.

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Are you okay, Senpai?

182
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Don't push yourself too hard.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I gave it to a neighbor.

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 What is this?

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 If you think this is just water, you can drink as much as you want!

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 It's water for two-thirds of the human body.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 There are still so many people left.

188
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 All right, it's a special service for you guys.

189
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I'll give you this full-fledged meal shaved ice.

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 I've already eaten it, so it's okay.

191
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 That's right. I don't need it.

192
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Ryo-chan, take responsibility.

193
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
 All right, I'll eat it all.

194
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
 I'll eat it all.

195
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
 What are you going to do?

196
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
 It's decided.

197
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
 I'm going to eat it.

198
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
 I only have strawberry flavor and milk flavor, so I'm going to eat it.

199
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,840
 I'm going to put cola on this side and change it with ketchup sauce.

200
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
 I'm going to put eggs and natto on this side.

201
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
 I'm going to eat it with vitamin drinks.

202
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,680
 Doesn't it look delicious?

203
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
 Are you really going to eat it?

204
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
 Of course.

205
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,680
 It's getting cold.

206
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
 I'll drink tea and warm up.

207
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,680
 All right, it's warm.

208
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,680
 I can't eat anymore.

209
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,680
 I can't eat any more.

210
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,680
 What are you going to do with the rest?

211
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,680
 I'm going to make rice balls and eat them later.

212
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,680
 What is this?

213
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
 Ryotsu, is it your doing again?

214
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
 What is it?

215
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,680
 I didn't do anything.

216
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
 Come on.

217
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
 My ears are stretching.

218
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
 What is this?

219
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
 That phone is useless.

220
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
 This is a stage device I prepared for the chief.

221
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
 For me?

222
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
 That's right.

223
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
 I'm going to have Ryuhyo Nagaretabi, the chief's specialty, sing in karaoke in this ice mountain bag.

224
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
 Don't fool me.

225
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
 This is the ice from the North Pole that was imported directly from Greenland.

226
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
 Ryo-chan bought it for 10,000 yen from Kei-chan.

227
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,360
 Ryotsu.

228
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
 How about a cup of tea, chief?

229
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
 I don't need it.

230
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
 Put an end to this ice.

231
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
 Listen to me.

232
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
 Even if you say that,

233
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
 Shut up.

234
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
 If this ice doesn't disappear until tomorrow,

235
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
 you will be sent to the North Pole.

236
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
 You will be sent to the North Pole.

237
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
 North Pole?

238
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,360
 Is there such a place?

239
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
 I'll make it especially for you.

240
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 Do you understand, Ryotsu?

241
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
 There is still a lot of ice.

242
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
 There is no way I can eat all of this today.

243
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
 This is it.

244
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
 The ice mountain that Ryo-san bought.

245
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
 This is the ice mountain of the North Pole.

246
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
 If you stand out this much,

247
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
 it will be a rumor.

248
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
 What are you going to do?

249
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
 I thought I'd buy all of this and eat it.

250
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
 I thought I'd buy all of this and eat it.

251
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,360
 If you make this much ice into shaved ice,

252
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
 you can ski.

253
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
 That's it.

254
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
 That's it.

255
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
 I like this hot summer.

256
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
 I like this hot summer.

257
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
 I'm going to take this.

258
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
 Rental skiing and rental snowboarding.

259
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
 I don't mind if I think about it.

260
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
 I can make money and clean up the ice.

261
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
 It's exactly the same.

262
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
 Okay, let's get started.

263
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
 Okay, let's get started.

264
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
 Okay, let's get started.

265
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,360
 What is this?

266
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
 Even if this hand is mine...

267
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
 Senpai, what are you going to start again?

268
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
 I'm sure it's about money.

269
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
 I'm sure it's about money.

270
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
 Ryo-chan's power is all about money.

271
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
 Thank you for your hard work.

272
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
 Please carry the rest.

273
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,360
 Good morning, Ryo-san.

274
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
 Next is the seat.

275
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
 Okay.

276
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
 It's a woman's morning meal.

277
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,360
 Now the road is clear.

278
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
 Kankichi, what are you doing with the ice?

279
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
 I did a lot.

280
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
 Ryo-san, I brought ski and snowboarding.

281
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
 Ryo-san, I brought ski and snowboarding.

282
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
 Ryo-san, I brought ski and snowboarding.

283
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,360
 Please put it there.

284
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
 Okay.

285
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
 Okay, now I'm ready.

286
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
 I did pretty well.

287
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
 Welcome, welcome.

288
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
 Ryo-tsu Snowland.

289
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
 I'm back.

290
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,360
 What is Ryo-tsu Snowland?

291
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
 Welcome, welcome.

292
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
 It's snowing in the middle of summer.

293
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
 It's a small town like a desert.

294
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
 It's a small town like a desert.

295
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
 In the middle of summer,

296
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
 you can enjoy skiing, snowboarding,

297
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
 and even bobsleigh.

298
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
 That's it.

299
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
 Let's go in.

300
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
 Yeah, that sounds fun.

301
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
 Me too.

302
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
 The traffic jam has been resolved,

303
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,360
 but there's still a lot to do.

304
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,360
 There's still a lot to do.

305
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
 Yes, yes.

306
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
 This is the snowboard.

307
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
 You can't bring it in.

308
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
 Yes, the company is 10% off.

309
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
 You can't bring it in.

310
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,360
 How about that snowboard?

311
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
 Yes, yes.

312
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
 Welcome, welcome.

313
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,360
 Welcome, welcome.

314
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,360
 Thank you.

315
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,360
 I think this will cost a few million yen.

316
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
 I think this will cost a few million yen.

317
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,360
 That's right.

318
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
 Snowboard

319
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
 Come on, come on.

320
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,360
 When you're hungry,

321
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
 it's snowland specialty, kourizushi.

322
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
 It's a fish that makes your parents cry.

323
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
 It's a favorite egg for children.

324
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,360
 If you don't eat this,

325
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,360
 you won't get anything.

326
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,360
 Then grab one.

327
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
 I want an egg.

328
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
 Okay, one egg.

329
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
 Wait.

330
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
 The rice is frozen.

331
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
 It's frozen.

332
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
 That's right.

333
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
 It's cold, so it lasts a long time.

334
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
 How do you eat it?

335
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
 You eat it with jam.

336
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
 It's refreshing.

337
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
 Let's eat it with jam.

338
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
 If you don't like raw food,

339
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,360
 how about ice curry?

340
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,360
 Welcome.

341
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,360
 Even curry is ice?

342
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
 I want that.

343
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
 Curry.

344
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,360
 I can still eat it.

345
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,360
 I'll give you the egg you dropped.

346
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
 If you hit it,

347
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
 you'll get a car and an egg.

348
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
 If you throw it,

349
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
 you'll be happy.

350
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
 Uncle, give it to me.

351
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,360
 Me too.

352
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,360
 Don't push it.

353
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,360
 The egg is 200 yen here.

354
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
 Me too.

355
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
 I can't do this anymore.

356
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
 I can't do this anymore.

357
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
 What?

358
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
 Ryo-tsu?

359
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
 He made a snow land

360
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
 in the park.

361
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,360
 He rents skis and snowboards

362
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
 and earns money.

363
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
 What a guy.

364
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
 If you make so much money,

365
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
 do you want to buy another mountain?

366
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
 Ryo-tsu.

367
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,360
 What is it, chief?

368
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
 You make this in the park

369
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
 and earn money?

370
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
 No way.

371
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
 I don't just make ice.

372
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
 I want to make a place

373
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
 for the local residents.

374
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
 I want the people of Kameyari

375
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
 to be happy.

376
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
 What is this?

377
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,360
 What is it?

378
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
 Ryo-tsu!

379
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
 I know you have money

380
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
 behind your back.

381
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
 Give it back to everyone!

382
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
 No way!

383
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
 Wait!

384
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
 Time out!

385
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 Wait!

386
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,360
 It went well.

387
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
 What?

388
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
 Ryo-tsu!

389
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
 I got it.

390
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
 I have an egg.

391
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
 Wasabi!

392
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,360
 Wait!

393
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
 Wait!

394
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
 What?

395
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
 Damn it!

396
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,360
 No way!

397
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
 It's an earthquake!

398
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
 Wait!

399
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
 Ouch!

400
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
 Watch out!

401
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
 Damn it!

402
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,360
 It's mine!

403
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
 I won't give it to anyone!

404
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
 Come on!

405
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
 Get ready, Ryo-tsu!

406
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
 What?

407
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
 I won't do that!

408
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
 You're naive!

409
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,360
 Ryo-tsu!

410
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,360
 It's collapsing!

411
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
 It's so heavy!

412
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
 What is that?

413
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,360
 Where did everyone go?

414
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
 It's time to retreat.

415
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
 Ryo-tsu!

416
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,360
 It's strange.

417
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
 No one is here.

418
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
 Chief!

419
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
 Help me!

420
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
 Help me!

421
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
 I protected you.

422
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
 Give this money back to everyone.

423
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
 No!

424
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
 It's mine!

425
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
 It's mine!

426
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
 Good for you.

427
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
 You used up all the ice.

428
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,360
 I'm a stingy man.

429
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
 I use up all my money.

430
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
 I wonder if my instinct makes me do that.

431
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
 Shut up!

432
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,360
 I'm done for!

433
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
 If I make Reiko angry,

434
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
 I'll be in big trouble!

435
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
 I'll throw away the high-speed cars!

436
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
 I'll run the high-speed roads backwards!

437
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
 Then I won't have a wife!

438
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
 Next time, on Reiko,

439
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
 I'll chase after her with anger!

440
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
 Let's do this!

441
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
 To be continued...
