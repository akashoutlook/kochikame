00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,600
I guess it was a headliner.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,820
Ah, here comes the summer again this year,

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,720
Im turning around, turning around, turning around, turning around, turning around, turning around, turning around,

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,480
Ah, here comes the summer again this year,

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,000
Im turning around, turning around, turning around, turning around, turning around, turning,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,640
Here it's the big wave coming,

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,240
I'm pulling away, causing a ruckus!

Great work, everyone.

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,400
Oh, I'll leave it here.

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,920
Takatan Osmo

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,080
Takatan Osmo

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,600
There! Go Takanoyama!

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,900
There! Go!

34
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,760
Yes! Yes!

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,900
Yes! Yes!

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,660
Takanoyama!

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,520
Yes! Yes!

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,240
Yes! Yes!

39
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,940
Takanoyama...

40
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,440
I was the strongest.

41
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,340
I'll never complain about Takanoyama.

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,400
I don't want to miss the best of Takanoyama.

43
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,280
I don't think I can understand the real fun of Osmo if I watch it on TV.

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,500
So you're the real Takanoyama.

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,440
Hey! If you're the real Takanoyama, you'll see him walking in a yukata sometimes.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,340
Then I'll watch it too!

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,000
But why don't you watch it?

48
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,860
It's not so easy to get the ticket for Osmo.

49
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,720
Oh, really? I didn't know that.

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,680
You can't get a ticket unless you're a top member of the National Assembly.

51
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,360
If you watch the Osmo in front of the National Assembly,

52
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,960
it's my life.

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:49,720
What a dream.

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,920
It's a dream of my life.

55
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,800
I think I'm going to the shopping street.

56
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,900
Hey, where are you going?

57
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,900
I'm going to patrol.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,160
It's unusual for Ryo to leave soup.

59
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,140
It's unusual for him to leave soup.

60
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,100
Come on, come on.

61
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,980
The Kamiari shopping street clothing sale.

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,060
It's a big summer sale.

63
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,980
The main item is a ticket to OZMO.

64
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,460
It's a full seat of the town.

65
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,860
It hasn't come out yet.

66
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,780
It hasn't come out yet.

67
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,940
The ticket to the ticket.

68
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,680
It's pretty low.

69
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,800
This is bad.

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,340
Ryo is trying to do clothing sale.

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,040
Oh.

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,180
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

73
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

74
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,120
It's too much.

75
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:45,960
What's the matter with Ryo?

76
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,520
You don't know?

77
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,500
He's a very lucky person.

78
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,500
He went around Hokkaido the other day.

79
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,440
Last year was a four-day trip to Guam.

80
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,680
And he's got a good computer.

81
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,720
What are you doing?

82
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
I'm not going to clean up the mess.

83
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,520
Come on.

84
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,000
All right.

85
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,700
Here we go.

86
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,700
We don't have time for that.

87
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,860
It's a good thing this is a government name.

88
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,500
I knew you'd shout it out for a long time.

89
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,320
I feel like you're having a hard time.

90
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,100
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

91
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,920
The Bao got a kill.

92
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,480
Yeah.

93
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,760
He got into trouble again.

94
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,240
Great.

95
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,440
Cho.

96
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,720
It is a good friend.

97
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,140
It's a good friend.

98
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,340
I wonder if I can say that.

99
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,420
Oops, I dropped the ticket.

100
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,680
What? What's wrong with that?

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,320
I have a wide face.

102
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,080
Ryo, you're amazing.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,340
Not really.

104
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:09,700
Not really.

105
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,880
That's...

106
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,340
Well, how's that?

107
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,960
Does anyone want to buy this ticket?

108
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,260
Sumo is Japan's national sport.

109
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,280
Cherry blossoms, mountain, and Fuji.

110
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,420
You can't say you're Japanese without seeing sumo.

111
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,100
Hey, mister!

112
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,620
Don't you forget the heart of Japan soon?

113
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,240
But this is a ticket to Masseki and Senshuraku.

114
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,080
Salaryman,

115
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,820
you can't buy this ticket with such a low salary.

116
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,020
No one's here?

117
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,760
Oh, I guess not.

118
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,660
Never mind.

119
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,460
Let's go inside.

120
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,980
Let's go see it together.

121
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,180
Yes.

122
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,560
There's only one left.

123
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,580
Oh, right.

124
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,660
I forgot the important person.

125
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,120
No.

126
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,320
I have to invite the owner of the ramen shop.

127
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,420
You're overdoing it.

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,560
You're right.

129
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,140
You're right.

130
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,100
It's just a bit weird.

131
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,740
I'm kidding.

132
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,480
I'm kidding.

133
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,580
Why don't you invite the manager who's taking care of you every day?

134
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,720
Manager.

135
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,220
You're going, too, aren't you?

136
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,980
Well, well, well.

137
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,560
If you want me to invite you, I'd love to.

138
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,620
That's right, manager.

139
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,520
I remember you had a high-class brandy.

140
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,180
The one you were proud of for being given a promotion.

141
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,100
No, that's...

142
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,500
The brandy you drink at Masseki is delicious.

143
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,300
It's a bit weird, but it's delicious.

144
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,460
You can bring it to me.

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,860
If you bring it to me.

146
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,760
All right.

147
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,580
This is decided.

148
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,260
Now, let's get to work.

149
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,800
The admission fee has become very high.

150
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,240
I can't help it at this time.

151
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,040
I'm a little excited.

152
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,900
That's a great hand.

153
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,980
It's true.

154
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,520
And the National Assembly is quite big.

155
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,400
Well, it's the National Assembly of Japan.

156
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,640
What?

157
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,480
Excuse me.

158
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,780
Oh, sorry.

159
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,480
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,880
Oh, you're a beautiful woman.

161
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,880
This is no problem.

162
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,600
No problem.

163
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,200
Oh, thank you.

164
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,480
Bye.

165
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,580
Foreigners.

166
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:31,780
You've been to Osumo, too.

167
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,000
The Osumo that I met recently was very popular.

168
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,480
Osumo is popular overseas.

169
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,080
I can't believe I can see it in Masseki with a grand atmosphere.

170
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,560
Who's the one who gave me the ticket for this place?

171
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,100
Just a few days ago, someone asked you to get a ticket to Masseki.

172
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,560
I'm sorry.

173
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,280
I heard So сы

174
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,640
thought you were just an ordinary person.

175
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,000
Huh?

176
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,760
What?

177
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,780
So what?

178
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,860
If you're not satisfied with the tickets, you can go home.

179
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,540
No, no.

180
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,380
It doesn't matter if you're not satisfied with the tickets.

181
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,840
It doesn't matter if you're not satisfied with the tickets.

182
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,680
I really appreciate you.

183
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,960
Then let's go.

184
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,220
Everyone has tickets, right?

185
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,460
Yes.

186
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,320
All right.

187
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,620
Don't be late for me.

188
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,040
My ticket is...

189
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,220
Hey, wait!

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,120
Idiot!

191
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,680
The wind of Ryogoku is also very strong.

192
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,220
So three of us can see it slowly.

193
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,460
Forget about that guy.

194
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,140
Let's go.

195
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,160
Huh?

196
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,920
Yes.

197
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

198
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,640
Wait, that...

199
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,320
What?

200
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,400
I was saved by the flow of the Sumida River.

201
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,140
Did you jump into the Sumida River?

202
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,060
Of course.

203
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,680
It's easy to lose your tickets.

204
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,880
I can't believe it.

205
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,300
It's coming.

206
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,960
It's coming.

207
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,340
It's coming.

208
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,040
It's coming.

209
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,240
Oh, hey, hey.

210
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,780
Oh, hey, hey.

211
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,900
Oh, I love the raw food, I love the raw food.

212
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,400
Here you go.

213
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,420
It's pretty small.

214
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,440
Well, it's close to the roadside, so it's fine, fine.

215
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,260
Oh, what's that?

216
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,580
It's snacks and alcohol.

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,040
Oh, you're thoughtful.

218
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,740
You're a real master.

219
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,020
You can get souvenirs when you go home.

220
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,220
There's a plan for the chief.

221
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,140
This will be a solid meeting.

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,540
I'm not here to do a meeting.

223
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,520
I'm here for the Sumo match.

224
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, that's a pretty good pair of glasses.

225
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,600
It's a must-have for the match.

226
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,820
Hey, chief, you're smart.

227
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,880
Show me, show me, show me.

228
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,420
Wait, wait, I'll go first.

229
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,260
Who are you doing such a good job for?

230
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,720
Oh, that again?

231
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,080
All right, all right, I'll show you.

232
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,440
Thank you, thank you.

233
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,280
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

234
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,580
I knew you didn't eat anything good.

235
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,240
Oh, it's that blonde cutie from earlier.

236
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,220
If you don't want to watch Sumo, give it back.

237
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,040
It's fine, it's not a Helmon.

238
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,660
That's not the problem.

239
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,300
Well, well, let's toast, for now.

240
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,440
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

241
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,140
Cheers.

242
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,180
Don't you forget something?

243
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,360
What?

244
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,600
Something?

245
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,040
Thank you to Mr. Ryotsu.

246
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, what?

247
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,600
I don't think that's the right way to say it.

248
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,780
Oh, come on.

249
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,300
Oh, really?

250
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Oh, wait, wait.

251
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,580
You know, he's in a bad mood.

252
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,860
I'll go home first, so I'll give you a souvenir.

253
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,420
Oh, all right.

254
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,500
I'll say it, I'll say it.

255
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,920
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Ryotsu.

256
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,600
Cheers.

257
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,680
From now on, Ishikata, Yokosuka, Takanoyama, and Hyōi.

258
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:19,840
I'll be your friends.

259
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,480
Oh, look, look.

260
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,080
Takanoyama, Takanoyama.

261
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,100
I can see the strength of your body when I see it live.

262
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
I'm looking forward to the best of Musumi.

263
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,260
That's right.

264
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,760
What kind of great technique will the Yokozuna of Zen-shou show us?

265
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,840
I'm looking forward to it.

266
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,680
I see, so this is the Makunochi bento.

267
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,820
Why don't you calm down a little and watch Sumo?

268
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,500
I'm out of lunch.

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,380
Hmm.

270
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:46,440
Hmm.

271
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,000
Can I eat sushi for Reiko?

272
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,960
I-I don't mind.

273
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,740
Sorry.

274
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,340
Senpai, you're eating silently.

275
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,860
It's okay, it's okay.

276
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
It's better to give food quietly.

277
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,380
East sea of Mayu.

278
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,040
Sea of Mayu.

279
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,160
Hmm, the sea of Mayu has two digits, so it's very energetic.

280
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,240
It's energetic.

281
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,180
It's different from TV, so I can feel the energy.

282
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,900
Hey, I got it, I got it.

283
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,280
Yes, there, there.

284
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,140
Pull, pull, more, more.

285
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,600
Hey, if you're sick, you know.

286
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,500
What?

287
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,080
Shut up.

288
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,420
You can eat this grilled chicken for you.

289
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,880
I got it.

290
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,060
Hey, don't call me by that name.

291
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,820
Oh, no.

292
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,480
It's over.

293
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,100
The sea of Mayu.

294
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,880
It's amazing.

295
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,220
It's amazing.

296
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,420
It's amazing.

297
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,700
It's amazing.

298
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,660
I've never seen it before.

299
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,060
Idiot.

300
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,420
I didn't see the game.

301
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,560
Well, if you eat silently, you'll get angry.

302
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,880
I'm not angry at all.

303
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,800
I'm not angry at all.

304
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,860
You're so detailed about the question.

305
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,880
What?

306
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,940
I'm done.

307
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,720
I'm going to the bathroom.

308
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,200
What the hell is he doing?

309
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,400
I'm just making a fuss about it.

310
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,660
It's not true.

311
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,120
Don't worry.

312
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,620
I saw the scene.

313
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,460
It's good.

314
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,400
Good.

315
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,540
Then I'll take it all.

316
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,100
You're all right, aren't you?

317
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,500
It's mundoDoe.

318
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,500
It's also no big deal.

319
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,520
Hey, Isshou.

320
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,620
Your sister is there.

321
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
And you're here.

322
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,020
Are you all right?

323
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,380
I forgot.

324
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,680
I'm sorry.

325
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,140
Actually, that day was when you said, "I'm going to the bathroom."

326
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,720
Well, to be honest, it's about time.

327
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,380
I'll see you around.

328
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,980
I've just been exhausted from the games and the g-

329
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,000
Wha-?

330
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,280
Look who's here.

331
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,520
Oh, sorry! You alright?

332
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,540
Uh...

333
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,320
There's been more mountains of mud lately, so be careful.

334
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,540
Okay.

335
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,460
Oh, I'm so sorry!

336
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,480
Are you hurt?

337
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,240
I-I'm fine! It's nothing!

338
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,240
Really?

339
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,560
I'm really sorry.

340
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:42,360
This is a bit strange, but I'm pretty sure I can go past this door right here.

341
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,580
I thought I'd come.

342
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,340
I'm in trouble.

343
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,000
I can only see the same thing from any entrance.

344
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,380
Did something happen?

345
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,640
No, I don't know where I am.

346
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:01,940
Chief!

347
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,040
Huh?

348
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,840
This way!

349
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, Ryotsu!

350
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,560
I was just taken away.

351
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,140
I see.

352
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,580
There's a lot of damage to the ship today, so be careful.

353
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,340
Thanks for your hard work.

354
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,620
I almost got lost.

355
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,520
Let's go back.

356
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,000
Hey, Ryotsu.

357
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,480
I'm just in front of the store.

358
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,020
Let's buy some souvenirs.

359
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,680
Hurry up.

360
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,880
It's the last fight of the day.

361
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,100
Hmm, what should I buy?

362
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,320
Hmm, it's a simple one.

363
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,760
As expected, Takanoyama's is big.

364
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,740
Hmm, this is not bad.

365
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,900
If it's young goods, it'll sell well to women in the book.

366
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,060
Hmm, this is a good one.

367
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,120
I'll buy one as a souvenir.

368
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,500
Oh, sorry, but how much is this?

369
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,300
Huh?

370
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,140
What's wrong, Chief?

371
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,980
Is something wrong?

372
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,180
Did you buy something?

373
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,620
I don't have a wallet.

374
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,340
That's strange.

375
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,120
I'm not sure...

376
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,380
I don't like this.

377
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,060
You left this at home.

378
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,520
What a fool I am.

379
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,880
I bought the ticket and took a train...

380
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,140
Oh, come on.

381
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,980
I'll lend you one.

382
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,220
But you can't have the purpose...

383
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:26,780
Huh?

384
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,060
What is it?

385
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,800
This is not my wallet!

386
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,340
Oh, that's mine!

387
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,840
Isn't it my wallet?

388
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,100
Huh?

389
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,140
Wait!

390
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,720
Eh? A woman's wallet?

391
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,500
It's Suri! Suri, somebody come here!

392
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,840
N-n-n-nonsense! No! No!

393
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,080
Where's Suri?

394
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,180
-It's this guy! -This guy is Suri!

395
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,440
-I told you it's not him! -Come here!

396
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,500
Ah! Chief, let's run!

397
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,840
Stop!

398
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,460
You two, stop!

399
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,600
Stop!

400
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,700
B-but why do I have to run too?

401
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
Ryozu, what's going on?

402
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,600
What's going on?

403
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,360
I don't even know myself!

404
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,140
I see! It's that time!

405
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,220
That woman! She's blaming Suri for everything!

406
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,740
Dammit!

407
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,120
Where could she be? She should be around here!

408
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,460
Ryozu, explain yourself! Ryozu, stop!

409
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,700
No! If we keep this up, we'll both be caught!

410
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,520
Chief, for the sake of justice,

411
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,100
can you be a little more polite?

412
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,280
I-I-I-I'll take your leave!

413
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,820
W-what?

414
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,020
Shit! It's that time!

415
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,220
Where? Where is it?

416
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,620
Excuse me!

417
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,380
Oh?

418
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,200
Wait!

419
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,920
What the hell is the two of them doing?

420
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,500
Don't tell me they're lost?

421
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,080
I'm afraid they might be lost.

422
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,200
Maybe I should go get them.

423
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,980
All right. I'll be back soon.

424
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,080
Thanks. I'll be back. I'll be back soon.

425
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,700
Anyway, we can eat lunch now.

426
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,560
That's right.

427
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,540
Hey!

428
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,060
Ryo!

429
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,360
Senpai, what are you doing?

430
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,360
Get out of the way!

431
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,360
Oh no!

432
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,860
Excuse me!

433
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,740
Let's go!

434
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,680
Yes!

435
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,000
This is Three.

436
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,060
No! Not like that!

437
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,780
But we're friends, right?

438
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,120
That's why I...

439
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,980
I don't know what you're talking about!

440
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,160
Where is it?

441
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,480
Where is that blonde?

442
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,640
I sacrificed my head.

443
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,080
I'll catch you no matter where you are!

444
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,720
Ouch!

445
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,180
Oh!

446
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,140
Saori, are you okay?

447
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,320
Yes.

448
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,540
It's Three!

449
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,880
That's Three!

450
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,420
Oh my God!

451
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,660
We're being arrested!

452
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,200
We're being arrested!

453
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,140
Wait!

454
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,320
Senpai!

455
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,960
Help! Help!

456
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,480
Wait!

457
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,780
Ryo! Ryo! What are you doing?

458
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,780
I got you, Three!

459
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,460
No!

460
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,180
I'm not letting you get away!

461
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,700
Oh no!

462
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,340
You bastard!

463
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,220
Just get it off me!

464
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,520
Get your dirty hands off me!

465
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,320
Shut up!

466
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,600
You switched your hands!

467
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,200
You're being arrested by Three!

468
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,000
Make this clear!

469
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,980
What did you say!

470
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,320
Even though he's three,

471
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,840
you should let go of that girl right now!

472
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,980
Yeah, but hey!

473
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,720
Let go!

474
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,300
Three is this blonde woman!

475
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,140
It can't be her bad nature.

476
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,620
She seems like a bad person.

477
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,600
Stop judging her by her face!

478
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,340
That guy is not Three.

479
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,140
He's trying to save me!

480
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,700
What are you doing?

481
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,420
The girl is the culprit!

482
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,300
Oh, yes, yes!

483
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,680
But...

484
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,960
What? Where's the evidence?

485
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,440
Damn it!

486
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,700
Wait a minute.

487
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,020
What are you doing?

488
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,360
See, that's my way of talking.

489
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,860
Ryo-ryo-tsu!

490
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,940
You've abandoned me.

491
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,620
Well, well, well.

492
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,720
For the sake of the culprit's dignity,

493
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,180
I can't help but make a little sacrifice.

494
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,700
And if I run that much,

495
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,140
I'll be able to get rid of the lack of exercise.

496
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,600
No way...

497
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,320
What's this?

498
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
You put so much of it in my jacket.

499
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,400
You have a cute face.

500
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,920
That's my wallet.

501
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,400
You're being careless.

502
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,460
You're not in the right place.

503
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,940
Even if I were to tell you...

504
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,620
I'm always the one who's always bothering you.

505
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,700
Is that the attitude you have, Chief?

506
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,340
Well, I'm sure I'm the one who's always bothering you.

507
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,200
But at least,

508
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,280
I'm not the one who's always bothering you.

509
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,600
I'm not the one who's always bothering you.

510
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,020
I'm the one who's always bothering you.

511
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,220
What did you say?

512
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,960
Ouch!

513
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,160
The gate's closing!

514
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,180
Chief, hurry up!

515
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,360
The first link is still remaining.

516
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,140
It's the final match between the two of them.

517
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,940
It's bad.

518
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,400
At least, we need to see that.

519
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,120
Ryo-tsu!

520
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,260
We'll talk about it later.

521
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,440
Hurry up!

522
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,820
Let's go!

523
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,660
It's the first game of the day.

524
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,920
I'll see it no matter what it takes.

525
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,560
You totally forgot what you came to see with my ticket.

526
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,940
We got it! We got it!

527
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,300
No, we managed to get through it somehow.

528
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,920
If this match gets seen,

529
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,460
it's worth coming to the National Stadium.

530
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,080
Go, go!

531
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,100
It's there! It's there!

532
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,180
Where is it?

533
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,420
What?

534
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,140
I can't see anything.

535
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,960
Senpai.

536
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,720
Here.

537
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,780
I can't see.

538
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,840
Let go of me.

539
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,600
The best of the best.

540
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,860
What's wrong?

541
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,660
It's over.

542
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,040
It was a fight that I will never see again.

543
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,280
What a waste.

544
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,180
The final decision is to beat and beat and beat Takanoyama.

545
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,120
Takanoyama wins.

546
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,060
What a waste.

547
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,960
What do you have against me?

548
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,440
You're just a kid, but you're always saying small things.

549
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:09,920
What?

550
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,060
What did you say?

551
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,160
You're a girl.

552
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,860
Damn you.

553
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,800
What did you say?

554
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,500
You're a bastard.

555
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,500
I'll beat you.

556
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,020
You're too much.

557
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,460
Don't you have any manners?

558
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,040
You're so noisy.

559
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,480
I'm sure she would have had no manners.

560
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,700
What?

561
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,920
What's this?

562
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,200
What's this?

563
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,260
I'm so embarrassed.

564
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,080
What do you mean?

565
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,460
There's no concept there.

566
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,240
What do you want to do?

567
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,840
I have to wait.

568
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,340
I almost fell.

569
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,080
But I'm here.

570
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,280
I am going.

571
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,500
Now.

572
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:48,660
It's going to be my turn.

573
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:48,780
I am going.

574
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,920
Ah, now.

575
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,540
I want it now.

576
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,740
Raaaaaah!

577
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,520
Red, stop! Blue, advance!

578
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,700
Let's cross the road of disaster!

579
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,900
What? That's common sense?

580
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,360
Are you guys keeping that common sense?

581
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,280
Alright! I'll guide the traffic safety!

582
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,540
Next time, "Dashin Bosou Daibakusou"!

583
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,220
Thanks for watching!
