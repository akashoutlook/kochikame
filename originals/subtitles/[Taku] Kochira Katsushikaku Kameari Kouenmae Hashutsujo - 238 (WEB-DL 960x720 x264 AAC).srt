1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,220
"Soccer Club N drifting loves Jura-San"

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,300
"When you watch TV, please make your room bright, and look away from him."

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,720
"Come to my place if you don't have money!"

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,620
"I'm not with you, but I'm worried."

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:35,980
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:42,520
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,180
Come to me, the one without a job

8
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,580
I'm not here, but don't worry

9
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,620
Look, the fire is burning

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,020
The red cloud

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,500
The red cloud

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,700
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

13
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,520
I know, I know, I know

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,260
If you understand, come to me quietly

15
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:26,880
Follow me!

16
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,160
Shackle Panic

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,500
We move our lungs up and down to breathe.

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,160
However,

19
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,380
When this diaphragm starts to contract on a flat surface,

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,860
The rhythm of breathing is disturbed,

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,980
The vocal cords in the throat are open,

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,080
The air is suddenly exhaled,

23
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,380
Inhale with recoil,

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,600
This is Shackle Panic

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,360
What are you saying?

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,300
I don't know

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,160
Damn it!

28
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,680
Let's rewrite it again!

29
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,460
Yes!

30
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,180
Stop breathing and drink water.

31
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,060
If you drink water, you will stop shackling, Ryo-chan.

32
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,100
If you drink water, how many times do you drink?

33
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,120
How many times do you drink in the morning?

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,020
Is that so?

35
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,840
I'm sure someone is talking about Ryo-san's rumors.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,340
That's a snort.

37
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,320
Eh?

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,680
Ah, I see.

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,960
What do you mean, "Shackle"?

40
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,460
Shiyu-kun,

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,480
If you move it to the temple, the shackles will stop.

42
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,460
Eh?

43
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,400
It's not a snore, so the shackles won't stop, Ryo-san.

44
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,580
If you stay quiet, you'll stop before you know it.

45
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,000
Quiet?

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,240
Then write this report instead of me.

47
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,020
Eh? What kind of logic is that?

48
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,480
I'll take a break until the shackles stop.

49
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,040
Write it yourself, Ryo-chan.

50
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,600
Anyway, I can't work until the shackles stop.

51
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,020
I'm going to take a break.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,980
Oh, my.

53
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,300
Great! I asked you.

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,220
I understand. I'll write it.

55
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm just thinking about skipping work.

56
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,880
I did it.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,080
Here comes another one of us.

58
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,320
You little.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,020
That's all for the news this afternoon.

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,120
Damn it.

61
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,980
I can't understand why the screen changed when I saw the shackles.

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,020
I see.

63
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,520
I don't need a remote control.

64
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,960
Even so, I hope it stops.

65
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,760
I can't believe it.

66
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,880
What?

67
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,240
What is it, Reiko?

68
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,180
Are the shackles stopped?

69
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:49,980
What?

70
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,080
Oh, I see.

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,240
Oh, no.

72
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,360
Sorry about that.

73
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,440
It's me, Ryo.

74
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,200
What? The old man?

75
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,880
How was it? Did the shakuri stop?

76
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,940
Good morning!

77
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,960
Did the shakuri stop, Senpai?

78
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,700
Don't say that, Nakagawa!

79
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,820
I was surprised, too.

80
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,080
Ryo, you shouldn't be skipping work to excuse the shakuri.

81
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,840
Don't make fun of the shakuri.

82
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,600
They say that if the shakuri lasts long, it's dangerous to live.

83
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,140
It's possible.

84
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,100
That's too much.

85
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,520
That's right, Senpai.

86
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,020
I've heard this when I was a kid.

87
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,920
If the shakuri doesn't stop, it'll die.

88
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,360
That's a lie.

89
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,000
When the shakuri starts to appear, it takes three hours.

90
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,760
It's more like a physical burn than you think.

91
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,840
It's also like a breath.

92
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,460
That's a pain.

93
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,180
It's okay, Ryo.

94
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,740
What else can you do to stop the shakuri?

95
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,520
I know how to stop the breath and drink water.

96
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,120
And how to scare people.

97
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,980
I think there's something else, too.

98
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,420
You should ask the wisdom bag at a time like this.

99
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,260
I'll go call the third-floor old lady.

100
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,100
It's okay now that I'm here.

101
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,280
What are you going to do?

102
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,180
Water!

103
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,680
Yes!

104
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,060
Here you go.

105
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,060
Okay.

106
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,400
What are you doing?

107
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,040
A chopsticks.

108
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,880
Yes.

109
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,360
Here you go.

110
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,140
Water!

111
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,700
Stop it!

112
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,880
Go!

113
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,780
What are you doing?

114
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,060
Open your mouth.

115
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,040
Yes.

116
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,180
Take this.

117
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,400
Drink from the mouth of the chopsticks.

118
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,980
Stop it.

119
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,920
Yes.

120
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,740
It's delicious.

121
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,360
How was it?

122
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,160
How was it, Ryo-chan?

123
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,300
That's good.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,500
Ryo-san, that's great.

125
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,060
That's wonderful.

126
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,540
Yes.

127
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,040
This is the best for Shakkuri.

128
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,740
See you, Ryo.

129
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,340
Good, good, good.

130
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,280
Thank you, Grandma.

131
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,660
You're welcome, Osamatsu-sama.

132
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,200
Well, I'll be going now.

133
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,180
Yeah.

134
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,120
Ryo, you did well.

135
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,320
Yeah.

136
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,580
Hey, Ryo!

137
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,720
That's ridiculous.

138
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,620
All of my grandchildren stopped at this way.

139
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,760
No, no, no, no.

140
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,420
That's not fair.

141
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,640
Huh!

142
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,260
Mr. Tamai.

143
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,780
Who are you?

144
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,140
Mr. Tamai, who is visiting Hattori-san's house.

145
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,640
Those two are not close.

146
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,000
What are you doing here?

147
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,380
I'm here to stop Shakkuri.

148
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,060
I asked you to do this.

149
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,160
You don't even listen to what I say at home.

150
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,000
You're always like this.

151
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,360
You're always like this.

152
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,600
You're always like this.

153
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,100
You're always like this.

154
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,280
You're always like this.

155
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,620
Don't fight.

156
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,660
You two, go home!

157
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,920
Um,

158
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,600
We'll be going now.

159
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,020
How do you stop Tamai-san's Shakkuri?

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,480
Lower your head a little more.

161
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,180
Ouch!

162
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,740
Are you okay, Ryo-san?

163
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,500
I did it on purpose!

164
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,140
It's against the law!

165
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,960
Please calm down.

166
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,200
What do you mean, it's against the law?

167
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,120
Don't say that!

168
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,460
Ryo-chan,

169
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,420
I think your Shakkuri stopped.

170
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:34,780
Huh?

171
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,020
Speaking of which,

172
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,320
this time,

173
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,420
I really...

174
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,200
Ah!

175
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
That was close!

176
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,400
It didn't stop!

177
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,400
Damn it!

178
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,720
It's no use after all!

179
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,360
Huh?

180
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,200
Huh?

181
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
If you're a Shakkuri,

182
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,320
you have to look up and drink water at once.

183
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,900
Who are you?

184
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,080
That's it!

185
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,460
Hey!

186
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,600
Raise your chin!

187
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,480
There's a rugby match

188
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:00,940
on the ground nearby.

189
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,000
Really?

190
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,900
But rugby is played by the big guys, right?

191
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,640
Yes.

192
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,280
There are other people on the ground.

193
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,460
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

194
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:09,780
See?

195
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,280
It's true.

196
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,700
I drank all of it!

197
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,400
Oh, yeah!

198
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,560
Ah!

199
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,360
I can't drink water!

200
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,540
I'm a surprised person!

201
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,000
Rugby has nothing to do with it!

202
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,600
Senior,

203
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,220
I think your Shakkuri stopped.

204
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,380
Did it stop?

205
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,020
Did it stop?

206
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,840
Yeah!

207
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:29,720
Yeah!

208
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,040
If only your Shakkuri stopped,

209
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,560
I would be grateful.

210
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:33,900
Yeah!

211
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,420
Oh, no!

212
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,700
I'm sorry!

213
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,540
Huh?

214
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,000
Ryo,

215
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,100
you should try this!

216
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:41,860
Huh?

217
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,820
I can't drink even a drop of water!

218
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,100
Not water!

219
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,500
I remembered

220
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,420
when in my wife's countryside,

221
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,980
I had to drink

222
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,580
to make Shakkuri stop!

223
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,740
A pot of persimmon?

224
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,520
Try it with Damemoto!

225
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,480
Huh?

226
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,140
What is Damemoto?

227
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,220
Anyway,

228
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,340
Just drink it, thinking it was a trick.

229
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,260
I can't help it. It's just a little.

230
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,860
It's bad.

231
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,840
How is it?

232
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,520
It's good.

233
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,400
Is it bad?

234
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,940
Why can't I stop my shakuri?

235
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,160
I guess you can't be bad at shakuri.

236
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,880
My children stopped it.

237
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,720
Ryo, are you there?

238
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,740
You can't stop your shakuri?

239
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,640
Shakuri is tofu after shakuri.

240
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,700
This is the best shakuri.

241
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,540
Sit down.

242
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,900
Do you know how to make tofu?

243
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,960
Tofu?

244
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,860
How to make tofu?

245
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,820
You have to answer or not to make tofu.

246
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
Tofu is also a soy.

247
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,940
What are you doing?

248
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,080
Stopped.

249
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,140
Stopped?

250
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,100
Really?

251
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Stopped?

252
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,700
I just answered soy.

253
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,880
Amazing.

254
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,440
It's brilliant.

255
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,360
I don't know why.

256
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,460
There is a store. I'm going home.

257
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,560
Thank you.

258
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,380
It's nothing.

259
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,940
But Ryo was there.

260
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,160
Ryo?

261
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,060
I can't believe it.

262
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,320
I never stopped doing shakuri before.

263
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,560
I didn't see you fighting on this totally.

264
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,620
Do you know how to stop your shakuri, either?

265
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,940
Of course.

266
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,120
Ryo?

267
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,720
Shakuri is also good with eggplants.

268
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,120
Eggplants?

269
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,260
Eggplant?

270
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,320
Yes, you just think of an eggplant in your head.

271
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,220
Just think of it?

272
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,180
It's even more creative.

273
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,780
It's an eggplant, Ryo-chan.

274
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,660
There are many things with eggplants.

275
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,220
Grilled eggplants, mapo eggplants...

276
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,460
You can imagine a normal eggplant, right?

277
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,260
Yes, it's in your head.

278
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,060
You can imagine it, but my shakuri won't stop.

279
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,600
Ryo-san, concentrate on your feelings and think of an eggplant.

280
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,640
Eggplant...

281
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,400
Eggplant, eggplant, eggplant...

282
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,220
I don't know.

283
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,280
When I think about it again, I can't think of anything else but eggplants.

284
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:51,000
When I think of eggplants, I think of peppers, tomatoes, onions, and lotus roots.

285
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,480
Eggplant...

286
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,140
Ryo-san, calm down.

287
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,880
Look, it's a blue and purple eggplant.

288
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,280
I'll go buy some eggplants.

289
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,840
It's faster to draw than to draw.

290
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,160
Eggplant...

291
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,080
I think this is an eggplant, Ryo-chan.

292
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,880
It's a plum eggplant.

293
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,000
A normal eggplant looks like this.

294
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,360
Like this.

295
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
Eggplant looks like this.

296
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,600
No, it's not.

297
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,320
Like this.

298
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,620
Eggplant looks like this.

299
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,960
What's wrong with eggplants?

300
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,180
Eggplant, eggplant, eggplant, eggplant...

301
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,780
Ryo-chan, you remembered the eggplants.

302
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,620
That's good, Ryo-san.

303
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,840
Thank you, everyone.

304
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,140
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

305
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,340
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

306
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,260
What?

307
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,060
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

308
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,720
That's right.

309
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,760
Good job.

310
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:18,180
I've heard the saying, "If you don't stop twitching as a child, you die."

311
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,080
Twitching?

312
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,140
I'm going to die!

313
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,580
Kankichi!

314
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,340
Huh?

315
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,640
Kankichi, you stole the money from the shop, didn't you?

316
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,040
M-Mama!

317
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,460
I said you stole my money!

318
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,300
What's wrong with you?

319
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,000
What's wrong with you?

320
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,260
I'm a police officer now!

321
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,420
I've stolen a few drinks,

322
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,560
but I don't want to get in trouble with the police.

323
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:42,660
I don't want to get into trouble with the police.

324
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,520
You stole the drinks?

325
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,940
I thought you stole the drinks.

326
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,240
Was that your doing?

327
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,320
Well, that's...

328
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,560
What are you doing here?

329
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,600
What are you doing here?

330
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,380
Look, mom.

331
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,480
This is a workplace.

332
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,520
I want to be called a sex slave.

333
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,620
It's amazing.

334
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,640
Did you always get scolded like that when you were a child?

335
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm in trouble.

336
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,300
I'm embarrassed.

337
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,480
Thank you very much, mom.

338
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,680
I can't stand it.

339
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
I'm in trouble for doing something like that.

340
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,060
What?

341
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,020
I was told to come to Reiko to stop your mischief.

342
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,820
What do you mean, Reiko?

343
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,820
When I traveled to Mongolia a long time ago,

344
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,500
I remembered that my mother was asking me if I was a thief to stop the mischief of children.

345
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,360
What kind of parent are you?

346
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,180
You're saying that?

347
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,120
I'm a mother of two children.

348
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,600
What?

349
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,280
I was a little mischievous, but I thought that I would be released from the mischief.

350
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:50,980
That's amazing.

351
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,540
It's the Mongolian way of stopping the mischief.

352
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,640
You're such a noisy child.

353
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,380
I'm sorry, everyone.

354
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,000
Then I'll go home.

355
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,460
I'll send you to your house.

356
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,400
Oh, that's fine.

357
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,900
Kankichi, don't bother everyone with mischief.

358
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:09,860
I know.

359
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,420
I'm fine now.

360
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:11,500
I don't have to do anything.

361
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,760
That's right, you are.

362
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,900
What's wrong with you?

363
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,680
My mischief is getting faster than before.

364
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,600
Push hard, Kankichi!

365
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,840
Your mischief is not as tough as it seems.

366
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,980
Why don't you try a little more overseas?

367
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,740
I've heard a lot about Reiko's Mongolian side.

368
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,180
I've been listening to it a lot.

369
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,120
But where should I look for it?

370
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,060
I have an idea!

371
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,100
Alright! Please get off here.

372
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,160
Where is it?

373
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,280
It's a Japanese school run by Nakagawa Group, Senpai.

374
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,140
Japanese? School?

375
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,740
I asked students from all over the country to help me.

376
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,600
It's global, Ryo-san.

377
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,440
Hello.

378
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,360
He's a student from Vietnam.

379
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,880
My mother asks a lot of questions at home.

380
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,540
The kids will stop.

381
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,100
Let's give it a try. Please.

382
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,480
I'm Kankichi's mother.

383
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,660
It's all in Japanese.

384
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,120
What kind of questions do you ask?

385
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,080
Anything is fine.

386
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,320
Anything is OK.

387
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,640
Please ask a lot of questions.

388
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,460
You're weak. What's your favorite food?

389
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,480
My favorite food?

390
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,540
It's not my first date.

391
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,780
I don't know what to ask.

392
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm a father, but I don't know my son's favorite food.

393
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,160
It's yakiniku.

394
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,940
What's your favorite animal?

395
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,000
Animal?

396
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,960
You're so stupid.

397
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,760
You have to answer seriously, Kankichi.

398
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,520
I like and hate animals.

399
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,080
There are many kinds of animals.

400
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,220
What?

401
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
I've thought about it.

402
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,120
What's your favorite animal?

403
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,060
Dog.

404
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,840
More questions.

405
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,400
What's your favorite type?

406
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,400
Type?

407
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,580
What?

408
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,880
It's your type.

409
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,000
My type?

410
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,440
I'm beautiful.

411
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,580
I'm good-looking.

412
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,680
I'm good at cooking.

413
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,300
And...

414
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,020
I mean, I'm still a child.

415
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,080
You eat meat like a child.

416
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,120
No, I don't like meat.

417
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,760
And you are a child.

418
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,140
You eat meat like a child.

419
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,460
You eat meat in front of your mom.

420
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:38,940
You eat meat and go crazy.

421
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,120
A child is good-looking.

422
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
And a child is good-looking.

423
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,100
The last question, please.

424
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,400
Do you hear it?

425
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,720
Who says something bad?

426
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,260
A child is a good-looking.

427
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,260
She has a sudden appearance.

428
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,600
I do not want to hear about it.

429
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,020
I'm going to the gym.

430
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,260
Did you stay?

431
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,440
I'm not a baby.

432
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,560
What's next?

433
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm going to the Mexican red thing.

434
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,740
I'm going to the baby shack.

435
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,660
I'm not a baby.

436
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,780
I'm going to the lab.

437
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,300
I'm going to the lab.

438
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,980
He's going to the lab.

439
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,580
There's a lab.

440
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,260
But it won't stop.

441
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,580
In America,

442
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,720
when you're shivering,

443
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,780
you breathe in your hair.

444
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,700
I know this.

445
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,860
You can't do that.

446
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,940
In France,

447
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,700
you breathe in your hair.

448
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,860
I got it.

449
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,040
I'm going to the US.

450
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,460
What about Italy?

451
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,720
I'm going to the hair shop.

452
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,440
I'm going to the hair shop.

453
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,640
You can't do that.

454
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,020
I'm going to the hair shop.

455
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,500
I'm going to the hair shop.

456
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,880
Where are you going?

457
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,280
I don't care.

458
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,180
to you

459
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:32,300
I'm going to the hair shop.

460
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,300
I'm going to the hair shop.

461
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,460
to you

462
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,600
I don't care.

463
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,700
I don't care.

464
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,120
everything I do

465
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,140
I don't care.

466
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,120
It's me again.

467
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,220
Miss Litz.

468
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,600
You're trying to win the war,

469
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,760
You're trying to win the war,

470
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,700
Stop it, Maria!

471
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,020
We can't do anything, can we, Ryotsu?

472
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,980
Just give me a little bit of your feelings.

473
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,560
You stink of water, don't you? Say anything you want, senpai.

474
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,180
I've done my best. Now, I just need to rest here.

475
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,140
Don't die, Ryousama!

476
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,140
If you die, Maria, you can't live!

477
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,340
I don't want to either!

478
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,620
I won't let you die! I won't let you die!

479
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,060
I won't let you die!

480
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,360
Just be patient for a little bit.

481
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,560
Ryousama, do your best!

482
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,740
Don't lose to Shackley!

483
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,300
That's not what I'm talking about! That's not what I'm talking about!

484
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,500
Shackley, you bastard! DTG!

485
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,940
This kind of technique isn't in judo!

486
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,360
Ryousama!

487
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,660
Senpai!

488
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,500
How is it? Has Shackley stopped?

489
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,620
Eh... Eh... Eh... Eh... Eh... Eh... Eh...

490
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,540
Oh no!

491
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,540
Ryousama!

492
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,620
Next up is engineering attack!

493
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,820
Let's go, Ryousuna!

494
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
I'll defeat Shackley for sure!

495
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,800
I don't care. Just let me sleep in peace.

496
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,820
Fly away. Fly away. Shackley, take me!

497
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,480
Eh...

498
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,120
Uwa... Help!

499
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,600
Hey!

500
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,180
*Slow motion*

501
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,200
*Slow motion*

502
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,740
*Slow motion*

503
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,020
*Slow motion*

504
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,500
*Slow motion*

505
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:30,880
*Slow motion*

506
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,380
*Slow motion*

507
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,420
*Slow motion*

508
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,720
*Slow motion*

509
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,180
*Slow motion*

510
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,640
*Slow motion*

511
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,020
*Slow motion*

512
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,660
*Slow motion*

513
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:46,600
*Slow motion*

514
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,720
*Slow motion*

515
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,140
*Slow motion*

516
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,500
*Slow motion*

517
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,400
*Slow motion*

518
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,940
*Slow motion*

519
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,280
*Slow motion*

520
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,120
*Slow motion*

521
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,060
*Slow motion*

522
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,920
*Slow motion*

523
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,160
*Slow motion*

524
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,400
Man, My bike is...

525
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,980
Chiruencia. You did it wrong.

526
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,040
I thought you were going to die

527
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,340
How do you expect me to come to this neighborhood

528
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,900
and go back to the past?

529
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,360
What?

530
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,220
All right, I'll somehow get to Ryo.

531
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,260
Wait, that reminds me...

532
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,960
Yay! The shakuri stopped at last!

533
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,080
Ryotsu! It's all right now!

534
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,640
Bulba!

535
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,360
I'll get rid of that shakuri from my body!

536
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,120
Ryo! I'll stop the shakuri for sure!

537
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,800
No, you don't have to stop it!

538
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,360
It's already stopped!

539
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,700
Ryo!

540
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,760
Ryo!

541
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,300
Ryotsu! Don't lose to the shakuri!

542
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,180
That's why I don't need the shakuri anymore!

543
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,220
Damn it! It's a trap!

544
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,900
Oh, it ran away! Follow me, Sakonji!

545
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,040
No, I don't...

546
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,380
Damn it! Why do I have to face this when the shakuri stopped?

547
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,660
It's a trap!

548
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,100
It's a trap!

549
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,580
It's a trap!

550
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,560
It's a trap!

551
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,300
It's a trap!

552
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,620
It's a trap!

553
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:15,940
I lost!

554
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,200
Are you all right?

555
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,020
Not yet!

556
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,400
Ryo!

557
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,480
What is this?

558
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,260
I'll get rid of them all!

559
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,780
Kankichi!

560
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,940
The shakuri's sister, Sato Mitsugaki,

561
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,800
