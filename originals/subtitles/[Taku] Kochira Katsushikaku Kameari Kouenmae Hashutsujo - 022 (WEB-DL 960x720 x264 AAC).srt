Nakagawa, you go in front!

31
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,820
Yes!

32
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,460
Where is it? Where is it?

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,180
Where is the gun?

34
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,660
It's mine!

35
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,660
It's the underwear robot!

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,860
It's mine!

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,460
It's mine!

38
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,080
It's mine!

39
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,220
It's mine!

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,440
It hurts!

41
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,280
It hurts!

42
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
I'm the police!

43
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,020
Hey!

44
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,120
Hey!

45
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,760
It's me!

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,340
I'm Ryo-tsu Kankichi, the first officer of the police!

47
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,740
Oh, it's true!

48
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,920
It's Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

49
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,840
It's me, but it's Ryo-tsu!

50
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,880
If it's Ryo-tsu Kankichi, then it's not a big deal if it's the underwear robot!

51
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,500
Ryo-tsu!

52
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,840
We're going to arrest you!

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,000
The current suspect of the underwear robot!

54
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,020
Don't mess with me!

55
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,420
I'm not an underwear robot!

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,360
Then what are you holding in your hands?

57
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,600
Huh?

58
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,600
That's the proof you can't move!

59
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,320
Huh?

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,920
N-No!

61
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,480
I just grabbed it when it fell!

62
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,920
I heard a scream, so I got in here!

63
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,800
Do you think that kind of excuse will work?

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,580
It's true!

65
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,580
There's another one here!

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:05,940
That's not true!

67
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,020
Ah!

68
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,660
Phew...

69
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,640
Mr. Nakagawa!

70
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,900
Really?

71
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,360
It's a misunderstanding.

72
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,180
We heard a scream, so we got in here.

73
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,640
It's useless.

74
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,080
I said it.

75
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:18,880
What?

76
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,580
Is that so?

77
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,540
No!

78
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,800
We were confused.

79
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,100
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,140
Come to think of it, we were doing a special training for the Chikan troupe.

81
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,560
We were screaming "Chikan!"

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,800
Hey, you!

83
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,020
You're saying the same thing, but you don't believe me at all!

84
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,680
Don't you doubt Nakagawa's words?

85
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,260
Oh, that's natural, right?

86
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,260
Of course.

87
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,120
You guys, what kind of basis do you have to judge people?

88
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,660
Of course, it's their face!

89
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,380
In general, it's the face of a man with thick and painful eyebrows.

90
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,200
I can't trust a man like him.

91
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,060
You're right about that.

92
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,560
Besides, he was short.

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,600
Nonchalantly sluggish.

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And with a short body.

95
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,280
How long can you hang on to it?

96
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,640
And his hair stinks under his feet.

97
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,760
Listen to my words!

98
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,920
Please, please.

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,860
Don't!

100
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,280
You're getting into my way!

101
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,060
Stop it!

102
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,620
Don't!

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,800
Stop it!

104
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,280
You idiot!

105
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,740
Stop it!

106
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,340
Ryo...

107
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,720
No, I misunderstood!

108
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,380
Mr. Nakagawa.

109
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,900
Didn't you try to steal the underwear?

110
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,620
No!

111
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,360
Yes, I did!

112
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,120
I'm not!

113
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,200
I'm an imposter!

114
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,060
That was a disaster, Ryotsu.

115
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,400
But you're not doing the right thing.

116
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,420
You should be grateful for that.

117
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,040
Grateful? I'm not joking.

118
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,860
Women these days think men are nothing.

119
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,220
I don't understand what you're saying.

120
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,500
I understand women these days.

121
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,340
And...

122
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,960
You're so mean!

123
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:00,780
Right?

124
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,160
And you look so pitiful.

125
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,340
You should date me.

126
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,260
No way!

127
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,040
You're so rich!

128
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,880
Hey, man!

129
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,940
What are you looking at?

130
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,900
Nothing.

131
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,420
Shut up.

132
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,000
You're such a pain.

133
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm sorry.

134
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,780
I'm an alien.

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,320
I've decided!

136
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,520
What are you doing, Senpai?

137
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,980
I'm a man.

138
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,820
I can't date a woman.

139
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,220
I can't date a woman within two meters of me.

140
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,100
No way.

141
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,660
Then you can't get a job.

142
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,240
Yeah.

143
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,860
Excuse me.

144
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,100
Which way is the station?

145
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,860
No way!

146
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,280
Don't come in from that line.

147
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:48,960
What?

148
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,900
You're a security guard, aren't you?

149
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,620
Oh, the station.

150
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,040
The station is...

151
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,160
The first corner is on the left.

152
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,620
This...

153
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,660
This...

154
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,600
You idiot!

155
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,640
No matter what anyone says, I won't date a woman.

156
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,820
I'm sorry.

157
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,500
I can arrest Ryo-tsu in a little while.

158
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,420
Ryo-tsu?

159
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,660
Prepare for an emergency.

160
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,760
Ryo-tsu is the best.

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,500
Ryo-tsu is good at roam me.

162
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,440
Ryo-tsu is good at roam me.

163
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,680
Ready?

164
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,260
Ready?

165
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,480
Can you feel anything?

166
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,700
Wait a minute!

167
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,360
What are you doing?

168
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,700
Get out of my way!

169
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,900
Senpai, I must go right now.

170
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,340
Please take it.

171
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,600
Okay.

172
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,600
Oh, please.

173
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,320
Look, that's the one!

174
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,540
Oh, that's the one from the magazine!

175
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,000
I applied with a light heart, but I didn't know I'd really get it.

176
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,620
But Ryo's garden is easy to use, so it's good.

177
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,540
Right.

178
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,500
Look at Ryo's bed.

179
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,640
It's so nice!

180
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,360
Well, the materials have been imported, so this is the video of the log house being assembled.

181
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,300
Well, please do your best to assemble it.

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,940
What!? We're going to assemble it?

183
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,940
What should we do? We can't assemble this.

184
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,060
Doesn't anyone know who's good at this?

185
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,980
There it is!

186
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,220
But...

187
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,820
They won't do it for us.

188
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,500
Right! There's a good way!

189
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,760
Wait, wait!

190
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,800
Let's gather everyone tomorrow.

191
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,760
Hey, hey! This is bad, Ryo-san!

192
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,960
Look at the survey article for the book club this month.

193
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah, I know that!

194
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,240
Man, every month they do a boring project.

195
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,100
That's clearly a Seco-Hara!

196
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,520
They're making fun of men!

197
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,480
What? What?

198
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,840
You're the number one who hates Ryo-tsu again?

199
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,280
Then we've finally achieved V7.

200
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,920
What's wrong?

201
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,520
This is...

202
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,080
This is...

203
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,720
The number one who hates me who asked the survey...

204
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,620
It doesn't have my name on it!

205
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,380
What!?

206
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,020
But the number one who's good at exchanging...

207
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,740
This is...

208
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,800
The number one who's good at exchanging, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,740
The number one who wants to be my lover, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

210
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,560
The number one who wants to marry, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

211
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,980
He always keeps the top in the middle and gets third place.

212
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,020
Isn't this a misprint?

213
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,000
That's not true.

214
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,600
If it's a misprint or a misprint, then it's just a misprint.

215
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,160
That means...

216
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,900
You!

217
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,220
You've done a cowardly impression again!

218
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,080
Why would I do such a thing?

219
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,700
Chief, I don't think you would do something like that on purpose.

220
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,700
Hmm?

221
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,820
That's true.

222
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,160
But to suddenly be number one from the top...

223
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,460
That's weird.

224
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,500
It's not weird!

225
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,200
The women of today have finally realized the true manliness of men.

226
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,580
They're more likely to choose the truth over the good of the story.

227
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,400
They're more likely to choose the truth over the bad of the story.

228
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,120
They're more likely to choose the truth over the good of the story.

229
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,380
Heh heh.

230
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,680
Ryo-tsu senpai.

231
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,920
The number one for exchanging...

232
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,480
Congratulations!

233
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,740
Congratulations for the first place.

234
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,580
Congratulations.

235
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,280
Congratulations.

236
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,780
Ah.

237
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,360
We've been deceiving Ryo-tsu-san all this time.

238
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,060
That's right.

239
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,200
We've finally realized the charm of Ryo-tsu-senpai.

240
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,960
I'm... I'm popular.

241
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,500
I can't believe it.

242
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,220
You're too much.

243
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,680
You're not going to go against the woman, are you?

244
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,460
Huh?

245
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,720
You're not going to go against the woman, are you?

246
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,320
What a useless guy.

247
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,540
Hn...

248
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,700
Don't cross that line!

249
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,040
What?

250
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,820
I've decided not to go against women.

251
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,780
Don't say such things.

252
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,440
Shut up!

253
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,220
Get out of here!

254
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,820
Ugh...

255
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,440
Senpai!

256
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,680
You!

257
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,240
Go away!

258
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,920
What's with that attitude?!

259
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,040
Well, well.

260
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,580
calm down.

261
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,300
First step completed.

262
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,420
I'll see if that idiot gets his food.

263
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:04,660
I'll see if that idiot gets his food.

264
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,320
There's no way it's not coming.

265
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,480
How do you like it?

266
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,640
Yeah, it's pretty good.

267
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,520
Here it comes.

268
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,400
Hello, this is Rai Rai-ken.

269
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,560
I wonder who's playing with that.

270
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,020
Shhh!

271
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,480
This is Rai Rai-ken. I brought you some ramen.

272
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,000
Here you go.

273
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,300
I knew it. Ryo-tsu's charm is his manliness.

274
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,400
Yeah.

275
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,620
He's not like the guys in the store.

276
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,320
His eyebrows are so sharp.

277
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
Seriously, a good man is more important than looks.

278
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,740
But it's sad that we can't accept his passion.

279
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,000
Thank you.

280
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,680
We're always against men we like.

281
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,640
That's his personality.

282
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,060
Hey, Ryo-sama!

283
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,800
But he's not that popular.

284
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,820
He's always against men he likes.

285
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,500
Well, women are complicated.

286
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,100
Hey, you two.

287
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,160
Oh, Ryo-tsu-senpai.

288
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,920
Senpai, you didn't accept our bouquet earlier.

289
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,240
It's not mine.

290
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm sorry, Naoko.

291
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,680
Well, I'm so sorry.

292
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,060
Oh, it's a cup of coffee.

293
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,440
Good, because we're in the cold.

294
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,220
Here, have a sip.

295
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,000
What?

296
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,920
You bought it yourself?

297
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,880
Naoko.

298
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,260
Here you go.

299
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,560
Thanks.

300
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,400
Thank you.

301
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:50,760
It's good!

302
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,060
Here, drink it.

303
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,340
What?

304
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,320
Don't hold back. Drink it.

305
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,140
But, but...

306
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm happy, Ryotsu-senpai!

307
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,340
I'm happy, Ryotsu-senpai!

308
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:27,840
Huh? Why am I in this situation?

309
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,920
You put up with it, Naoko!

310
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,140
You put up with it, Naoko!

311
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,020
I won't waste your precious sacrifice!

312
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,900
I won't waste your precious sacrifice!

313
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,640
I'll finish you off!

314
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:51,820
I'll finish you off!

315
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,460
Hey, Mr. Ryotsu!

316
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,480
Good evening, are you free?

317
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,320
Good evening, are you free?

318
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,580
How is it?

319
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,100
Do you want to go out for a drink?

320
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
I thought it was someone else, but it's you, Honda-kun.

321
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,140
You look fine.

322
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,040
What are you wearing?

323
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,340
I have an appointment tonight.

324
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,640
I'm sorry, but I don't have time to be with you.

325
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:20,540
I'm sorry, but I don't have time to be with you.

326
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,420
Appointment?

327
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,880
Ryo-san, you'll be invited to the female dormitory tonight.

328
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,460
Ryo-san, you'll be invited to the female dormitory tonight.

329
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:27,940
The female dormitory?

330
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,300
You're jealous, aren't you?

331
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,500
I can't take you there.

332
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:32,860
I can't take you there.

333
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,240
Anyway, I'm the first one to be invited.

334
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,640
Anyway, I'm the first one to be invited.

335
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,220
Well, women these days

336
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,800
know what it's like to be a man.

337
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,760
know what it's like to be a man.

338
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,360
It's different from what they usually say.

339
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,740
It's different from what they usually say.

340
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,800
Ladies and gentlemen!

341
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,760
Good evening!

342
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,800
Good evening!

343
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:58,940
Lady!

344
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,860
Ladies and gentlemen!

345
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,140
Hey, Shibana!

346
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,840
Hey, Shibana!

347
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,860
Hey, Shibana!

348
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,600
Did you know?

349
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,360
It's actually a male dormitory here.

350
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,660
Only Ryo-san is special.

351
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,540
Oh, my.

352
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,900
You're so impressed.

353
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,040
You're so impressed.

354
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,120
You're so impressed.

355
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,680
You're so impressed.

356
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,140
Naoko.

357
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,220
Ryo-san.

358
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,040
The moon is so beautiful.

359
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,320
Hey, it's clear. Let's go see it.

360
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,000
Huh? It was cloudy last time.

361
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,560
Whatever. Whatever.

362
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,080
OK. Now!

363
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,160
Roger.

364
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,160
Hey!

365
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,880
This must be the legendary Pigeon Man!

366
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,180
Boo!

367
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,000
Huh? What's that?

368
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,300
What is this?

369
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,820
Oh, that. It's a log house kit.

370
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,860
We have all the logs, so we just need to put them together as it says on the map.

371
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,140
Gas and water are also one-touch.

372
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,580
If we put it in Ryo's garden, it'll be a place for everyone to live.

373
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,040
But we don't have the right log builder.

374
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,340
We can't build anything like that.

375
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,940
Is there a strong and strong man somewhere?

376
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,400
There's none.

377
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,940
All the men around here are weak.

378
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,580
It's great to see a man working with sweat on his forehead.

379
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,680
Yeah, the trend these days is a man with a smell of sweat.

380
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,680
I don't know if it's a trend or not, but you guys forget someone.

381
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,700
Oh, what?

382
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,920
A strong, strong, reliable man.

383
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:41,980
Who?

384
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,660
Is that Ryochi-senpai?

385
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,480
No, I don't want to tell Ryochi-senpai about that.

386
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,680
No, I don't want to tell Ryochi-senpai about that.

387
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,500
Why not?

388
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,680
Because Ryochi-senpai is wearing a suit like that.

389
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,120
Right?

390
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,660
This is my temporary form.

391
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,460
This is my true form.

392
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,300
Yeah!

393
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,600
Seiji!

394
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,560
And this is my army.

395
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,280
It's a disaster, but it's a force.

396
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,820
It's a disaster, but it's a force.

397
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,120
Shut up! Don't say that!

398
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,540
First, the foundation construction.

399
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:20,920
First, the foundation construction.

400
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,060
I know, you guys!

401
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,660
I know, you guys!

402
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,760
I know, you guys!

403
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,520
I know, you guys!

404
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,000
Come on!

405
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,540
Come on!

406
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:29,580
Come on!

407
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:29,720
Hey, don't be so angry!

408
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,080
Honda, what's that little thing?

409
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,900
Hmph, men are simple.

410
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:46,540
Hey, bring it on!

411
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:46,920
What?

412
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,840
Why don't you two do it too?

413
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,020
I'm sorry!

414
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,740
Everyone, it's lunchtime!

415
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,940
It's our homemade lunch!

416
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,820
It's our homemade lunch!

417
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,320
We'll make a cookie ourselves.

418
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,800
We'll make a cookie ourselves.

419
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,100
Amazing!

420
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,460
It looks delicious!

421
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,040
Terai-san and Honda-san, thank you!

422
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,900
You can do it!

423
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,880
I can count on you!

424
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,920
I can count on you!

425
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,840
That's great!

426
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,300
You're much better than you look.

427
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,320
Really?

428
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,560
Wow, Terai-san, you have a good arm.

429
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:13,880
Wow, Terai-san, you have a good arm.

430
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,900
No, you're mostly Z.

431
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,220
You guys, let's go home!

432
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,720
Let's go home!

433
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:19,820
Let's go home!

434
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,100
Oh, no!

435
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,680
Oh, no!

436
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,220
But they've come all the way here.

437
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,060
It would be better if you all cooperated.

438
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,960
I can do this alone.

439
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,760
Go home!

440
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,840
We don't have enough lunch boxes!

441
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,740
That was a little bit of a mistake.

442
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:39,800
It was a mistake.

443
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,100
I guess it's impossible to do it alone.

444
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
I can't ask them for help.

445
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,880
You're slow.

446
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,780
If you do this, you'll be praised,

447
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,640
you'll be praised, you'll be praised,

448
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,380
and you'll be put on the stage to work.

449
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:00,980
Okay?

450
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,820
Ryo, hang in there!

451
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,740
Hang in there!

452
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,000
You look great working here!

453
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,600
You look great working here!

454
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:08,860
You look great working here! You're cool!

455
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,020
Well, you're right.

456
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,240
Wow, I'm surprised!

457
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,960
You're really strong!

458
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,960
What is this? I like it!

459
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,360
You look great!

460
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,240
You look like a man!

461
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,860
You're right!

462
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
This is a one-time job.

463
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:25,920
This is a one-time job.

464
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,440
This is a one-time job.

465
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,560
Paka is easy to handle.

466
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,460
Paka is easy to handle.

467
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,140
Let's keep doing this in the back row for 24 hours.

468
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,360
Let's keep doing this in the back row for 24 hours.

469
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,380
Oh, my head!

470
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,380
Oh, my head!

471
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,100
Ryo!

472
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,480
Perfect, Ryo!

473
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,080
You're great!

474
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,640
You're amazing!

475
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,120
What is this?

476
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,840
Ryo!

477
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:57,960
Great job, Ryo!

478
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,080
What a perfect job.

479
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,120
Ryo!

480
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,460
Great true job!

481
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,080
I guess we have to shoot him.

482
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,720
Ryoichi, are you okay?

483
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,800
I'm a little tired.

484
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,560
I'll give you a massage.

485
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,480
Do your best.

486
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,500
Please make our log house soon.

487
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,040
Of course, Tomoe.

488
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,760
-Oh! -Revive!

489
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,400
-Yay! -Yay!

490
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,740
-Good luck! -Good luck!

491
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,320
To Be Continued

492
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,680
Here's your lunch.

493
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,960
See you later.

494
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,460
Are you leaving already?

495
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,700
I'm on a business trip.

496
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,280
Another convenience store lunch.

497
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,380
I used to love homemade lunches.

498
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,180
The level of lunches has dropped

499
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,760
due to the lack of perfection in the house.

500
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,780
Oh, this again.

501
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,420
I have to eat more poppy bread and butter

502
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,020
every day.

503
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,700
But I can't find it.

504
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,460
My dad is too stingy to make a living.

505
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,420
These days, no one supported me.

506
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,800
I feel like I'm forced to work,

507
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,040
being forced to do this.

508
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,540
If you keep doing this,

509
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,320
you'll beビったt.

510
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,300
I soon felt like a senior was being manipulated.

511
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,500
Nakagawa-kun, seems like you didn't want to lose the first position.

512
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,740
You know what I mean? You're envious of me, though. Do not be Dangri.

513
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
I'm so tired.

514
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,100
Senpai! Ryotsu-senpai!

515
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,020
Ryotsu-senpai!

516
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,060
Senpai!

517
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,420
He's still not here, that Ryotsu guy.

518
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,320
He's so tired.

519
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,520
It's only a little while, but he's still working hard.

520
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,020
I wonder when he'll finish it.

521
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,560
I'm tired of nagging him.

522
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,580
Oh, I'm so tired!

523
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,380
I worked so hard to get the first place in the poll.

524
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,800
Just a little more.

525
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,860
I'm sorry.

526
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,860
I wasn't mean.

527
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,220
What's wrong? Did I say something?

528
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,320
It's nothing!

529
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,500
Don't worry about it.

530
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,260
Just a little more. I'll do my best.

531
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,740
I'm glad. I didn't hear you.

532
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,760
I'm glad you're an idiot.

533
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,020
I can hear you.

534
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,000
I'll do my best.

535
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,080
Watch me.

536
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,140
That's so great!

537
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,600
It's finally done.

538
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,680
Our villa!

539
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,880
It's awesome!

540
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,800
It's so pretty!

541
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,500
The curtain windows!

542
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,560
The bath is bigger than the ridges.

543
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,980
Hey, let's stay here tonight!

544
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,240
Agreed!

545
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,660
I'll teach you how to get angry at me.

546
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:20,820
This tree smells so good.

547
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,960
It feels like I'm in a hot spring in the mountains.

548
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,580
But he's surprisingly good at making such a great log house.

549
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,760
He's really good at it.

550
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,420
Yeah, he's been working hard on it.

551
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,540
I think I should rewatch it.

552
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,980
Komachi!

553
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,160
What?

554
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,860
You're in love with Ryo Tsukankichi, aren't you?

555
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,620
No, I'm not!

556
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,580
I'm so happy!

557
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,300
No, you're not!

558
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,380
Everyone, be quiet!

559
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,000
The special seat is 5,000 yen.

560
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,600
The camera and video are 1,000 yen each.

561
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,560
Come on!

562
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,520
Let's go!

563
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,240
I'm in heaven, you stupid girls!

564
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,320
Come on!

565
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,800
Come on!

566
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,200
Did you see that?

567
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,200
This is what a real man's job is!

568
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,640
What are you doing?

569
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,680
You're a jerk!

570
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,920
Ouch!

571
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,100
My ear pads are all messed up!

572
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,180
I don't have any tires!

573
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,700
Huh?

574
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,380
I won't forgive you!

575
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,740
We're still going to get revenge!

576
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,820
I won't forgive you for bullying a weak woman!

577
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,860
You're not weak at all!

578
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,380
Wait a minute!

579
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,760
If you get hated, you'll be the number one.

New Year's Eve at the Chief's House?

582
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,460
Huh? I haven't heard of it!

583
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,620
Why didn't you call me?

584
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,280
Chief!

585
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,260
I'm going to go right now!

586
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,380
Please leave the Osechi food!

587
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,480
