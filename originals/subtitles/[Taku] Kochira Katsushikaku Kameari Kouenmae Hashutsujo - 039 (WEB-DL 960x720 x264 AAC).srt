1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
Kدي

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:18,400
On a sunny day, floating in the river

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,540
If I get a pebble, I will fly to my shoes

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:32,240
I wonder if he's going to the gym where he was saving money

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,260
He laughed at me saying that I was just a kid

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,680
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I only get a punishment

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,820
There's no change in a single grumble

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,840
The cityscape that never changes is strangely kind

9
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,400
From the waterfront of Tongari-boshi

10
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:07,080
To Kaishakuten, the sunset falls

11
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,120
Tomorrow, it's already over

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,760
Katsushika, Shibamaru

13
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,000
I've lost all my happiness

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,360
And I've realized that I'm such an idiot

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,260
Love, Ryotsu and Maria

16
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,600
Idiot!

17
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,560
Don't you have any sense of self-awareness as a person?

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm sick of lecturing you!

19
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,240
If you're sick of it, you don't have to!

20
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,560
Is that so?

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,800
Well, I guess I'll just go.

22
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,960
I'm tired of being late every time

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,260
Look at me.

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,080
I'm on a two-hour break, but I haven't been late even once.

25
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,400
It's because there's someone who makes you wake up!

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,360
I'm all by myself!

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,980
How can you be proud of that?

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,380
Then you should get married!

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,900
Get married?

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,400
That's right.

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,440
This is the only way to restore your attitude to life from the bottom of your heart.

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,580
Get married, make a child, buy a house and become a fine My Home Papa!

33
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,040
My Home Papa?

34
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,160
I'm going.

35
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,260
Then I'll go.

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,120
Huh?

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,300
What?

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,020
I have no intention of getting married!

39
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,740
It doesn't matter how you feel about it.

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,140
I'll get you married any way.

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm definitely going to get you married!

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,860
I'm getting married!

43
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,640
I won't!

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,360
Get married, get married, get married!

45
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,040
I won't! I won't! I won't!

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,960
All right, all right.

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,700
I'll get you married.

48
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,680
I won't!

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,180
I'm going to get you married!

50
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:47,800
I won't!

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,380
I was just imagining things.

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,640
Why aren't you coming out?

53
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,120
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,620
I'm done chasing you.

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,940
Can you date me for a bit?

56
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,440
Let go!

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,640
Let go!

58
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,860
What's wrong with you?

59
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,820
You're just acting like a human!

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,660
You're the best!

61
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,960
You're gone!

62
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,340
You're bad!

63
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,840
You remember that, don't you?

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,260
Don't run away!

65
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:35,980
I'll get you more!

66
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,480
Thank you very much.

67
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,460
You're the same...

68
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,440
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:49,820
Sorry to bother you.

70
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,880
No, I didn't want to bother you.

71
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,680
I just did what I had to do.

72
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,060
What's your name?

73
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm...

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,500
No, I'm Ryo-tsu Kankichi,

75
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,140
the head of the Kameari Park.

76
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,840
Mr. Ryo-tsu from Kameari Park.

77
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,000
Hello.

78
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,440
My name is Ai Asato.

79
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,240
Ai Asato?

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,460
Asato is Asano-sato.

81
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,340
Ai is Ai.

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,700
It's my first love.

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,700
Ma...

84
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,480
Bi...

85
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,320
An...

86
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,380
Please call me that.

87
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,900
Maria.

88
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,680
Yes, Mr. Ryo!

89
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,420
Maria!

90
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,980
I can't believe I got to be friends with such a beautiful woman!

91
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,040
Yippee!

92
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,820
Hooray!

93
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,320
Did you trap Ryo-chan?

94
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,180
You're so loud.

95
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,180
Even if you prepare a seat for us,

96
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,300
Ryo-chan won't come out.

97
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,580
Well, I'll have to make him my home-papa.

98
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,900
I can't stand being trapped by a boss-like trap.

99
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,420
Senpai, what are you going to do for lunch?

100
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,820
Oh, right. I'm going to make ramen from Tsurukame prefecture.

101
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,720
Excuse me.

102
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,620
Who is Mr. Ryo-chan?

103
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,740
Ryo-sama, I'm here!

104
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,180
Oh?

105
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,640
Senpai, who are you?

106
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,080
Uh, just a friend.

107
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,560
Why are you here?

108
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,380
I came to make lunch for you.

109
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,020
Wow!

110
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,040
This is amazing!

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,340
Okay, I'll enjoy it!

112
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,920
It's so good!

113
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,600
That's great!

114
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,280
Can I see Mr. Ryo again and make it for him?

115
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
I'm very happy to have such a delicious dish.

116
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,100
Yes, I want to make Mr. Ryo's lunch every day from now on.

117
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,480
Mr. Ryo, see you tomorrow.

118
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,080
Yeah!

119
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,400
Bye!

120
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,500
Good luck!

121
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,220
Now I don't have to worry about lunch.

122
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,840
Senpai!

123
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,680
Why are you so straight forward?

124
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,700
If you want to make lunch every day, you want to be by my side all the time.

125
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,180
In other words, you want to marry me!

126
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,620
Marry?

127
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,160
No way!

128
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,280
There's no doubt about it.

129
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,440
You're beautiful, polite, and you're a perfectly delicious cook.

130
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,860
You're the perfect bride!

131
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,700
Uh, my bride?

132
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Senpai, you did a good job.

133
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,400
It's a good thing you like such a nice girl.

134
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,260
Of course, it's a proposal, right?

135
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,660
Proposal?

136
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm sure it'll look good on you.

137
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,340
That's right.

138
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,160
I'm going to marry Maria.

139
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,740
Now, you're a friend of my home papa, too.

140
00:06:59,740 --> 00:06:59,900
That's right.

141
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,060
No, I haven't decided yet.

142
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,080
Huh?

143
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,700
My home papa?

144
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,360
Now that you mention it...

145
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,920
You set a trap for Ryozu.

146
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,480
Don't tell me, Maria...

147
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,440
No, I'm sure I'm talking too much.

148
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,760
They're getting involved in front of me.

149
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,920
And they come to my house.

150
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,680
And their attitude.

151
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,060
I see.

152
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,920
So that's how it is.

153
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,440
Let's be careful.

154
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,980
Well, Maria is a good girl, you know.

155
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,960
But, she's very close to her father.

156
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,620
She'd be able to marry that girl.

157
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm afraid they would force Ryo to marry her.

158
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,240
I don't know.

159
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,300
Ryo!

160
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,760
Ryo!

161
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,500
Maria!

162
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,420
Maria!

163
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,980
Master Ryo, from now on...

164
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,840
You'll be a serious My Home Papa!

165
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,180
Hey, Master!

166
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,560
Stop! Let me go!

167
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,240
Master Ryo...

168
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,760
Help me!

169
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,940
Please stop, Master!

170
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Please don't bring your face here!

171
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,880
Master Ryo... Master Ryo!

172
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,320
Huh?

173
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,640
What's wrong, Master Ryo?

174
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:27,880
Master...

175
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,860
I had a terrible dream.

176
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,340
What kind of dream?

177
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,100
I thought it was Maria, but actually, it was the chief...

178
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,440
Eh?

179
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,800
Why are you here, Maria?

180
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,640
Of course, I'm here to make breakfast for Master Ryo.

181
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,020
Huh?

182
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,120
Ah...

183
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,280
Ah...

184
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,900
Ah...

185
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,140
Master Ryo...

186
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,960
Oh, it looks delicious!

187
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,120
It's annoying...

188
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,020
No.

189
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,380
If I keep this up, I'll be dragged by Zuzuru and the other's pace...

190
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,700
You've fallen into the trap, Master Ryo!

191
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,920
I can't stand being the leader's scapegoat.

192
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
I'll make my heart a demon here...

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,480
What are you going to do?

194
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,540
Huh?

195
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,580
From this morning, I've been alone...

196
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,100
I sneaked into this man's room and cleaned and washed myself.

197
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,020
Don't you think it's disgusting?

198
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,160
Master Ryo, do you hate me?

199
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,380
Eh?

200
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,020
No, that's not it, but...

201
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,580
Then you like me, don't you?

202
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,100
Ah!

203
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm so happy!

204
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,340
Ah...

205
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,300
Ah...

206
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,620
Eh...

207
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:52,980
Eh...

208
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,100
I'm not saying that.

209
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,360
I'm not going to marry you.

210
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,820
No...

211
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,020
No...

212
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,280
This...

213
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,200
This is good.

214
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,060
Master!

215
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,420
Master, what's going on?

216
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,200
You've been playing with people's hearts like that.

217
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,540
W-What do you mean?

218
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,860
You've set up a trap in order to get me married.

219
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,040
What? You found out?

220
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,320
I was planning to get you married, but my partner refused.

221
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,440
Here, this is the girl.

222
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,100
What?

223
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,340
Then, where's Maria?

224
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,980
Damn it! I'm a big idiot!

225
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:21,520

226
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,660
I'm going to sleep.

227
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,360
I'm going to sleep.

228
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,820
I'm going to sleep.

229
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,240
I'm going to sleep.

230
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,980
I'm going to sleep.

231
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,880
I'm going to sleep.

232
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,900
I'm going to sleep.

233
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:42,940
I'm going to sleep.

234
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,280
I'm going to sleep.

235
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,120
I'm going to sleep.

236
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
I'm going to sleep.

237
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,580
I'm going to sleep.

238
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,460
I'm going to sleep.

239
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,560
I'm going to sleep.

240
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm going to sleep.

241
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,140
Mr. Ryo....

242
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,120
I'm going to sleep.

243
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,580
Mr. Ryo.....

244
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:05,900
I'm going to sleep.

245
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,900
I'm going to sleep.

246
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,780
What?

247
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,580
I'm going to sleep.

248
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,880
I'm going to sleep.

249
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,100
Sleep

250
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,400
I'm going to sleep.

251
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,100
I'm going to sleep.

252
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,720
I don't know.

253
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,380
Ryo!

254
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,540
I'm so happy!

255
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,400
I see.

256
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,160
I'll be back, Maria!

257
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,080
I'll be waiting for you!

258
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,520
Just as I thought.

259
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,900
Ryo's getting serious after the wedding.

260
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,160
I never thought I'd be the one to go to the wedding.

261
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,440
Now I can be the one to go to the wedding.

262
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,320
Are you alright?

263
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,100
Yeah.

264
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,920
This is...

265
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,240
Oh, Ryuji Asato.

266
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,860
You're a big fan, aren't you?

267
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,880
Yes.

268
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,000
Really?

269
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,580
Yeah.

270
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,820
I went to the match with him.

271
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,260
I'm so happy!

272
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,920
Ryo's been watching me all this time.

273
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,560
He must have been bound by fate.

274
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,740
What are you talking about, Maria?

275
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,200
Ryuji Asato is my father's kickboxer.

276
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,840
That's why it's me.

277
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,820
Ryuji is my ring name.

278
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,520
I've been watching you since you were little.

279
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,200
But I haven't received an answer from you.

280
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,240
I'm not happy with my life.

281
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,460
Ryuji Asato.

282
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
He won 50 matches and 50 wins in a row.

283
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,800
He's the champ of all-stars.

284
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,300
the success of his pasado career.

285
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,620
I never knew you'd be a girl.

286
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,860
Isn't that obvious?

287
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,240
You don't even think about it.

288
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,680
New female kogodas are pretty. New female kids. New players are even more fry. And beautiful.

289
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,000
Huh?

290
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,140
Why are you dressed like that?

291
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,680
I had someone I loved from the bottom of my heart.

292
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,960
He was Kikuboxing's coach, Iwao Gantetsu.

293
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,200
I loved him so much, and I finally decided to be his wife.

294
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,000
And that's how you quit kickboxing?

295
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,380
Yes.

296
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,340
I trained a lot, and I finally became who I am now.

297
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,760
But my fate was tragic.

298
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,080
My coach went abroad.

299
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,660
I went to Japan.

300
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,280
Is that coach similar to Ryo?

301
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,760
Yes, he's exactly like me.

302
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,520
He's my ideal type.

303
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,940
So that's how you fell in love with him.

304
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,440
I was just trying to make a name for a man's wedding.

305
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,920
I'm home! I'm back from Puzzle Royale!

306
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,960
Welcome home, Ryo!

307
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,540
Marion, I was so lonely without you.

308
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,760
Chuka, chuka, yuchi, yuchi.

309
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,200
I was supposed to be a smiling,

310
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,840
so tall and handsome couple.

311
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,420
You say that in person, huh?

312
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,020
So for you, as the director,

313
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,920
I hope you'll love us with his help.

314
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,940
You're so sweet!

315
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,900
But we might have to find another guy around, Reiko.

316
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,540
I'm so sorry about that.

317
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,180
It's all right.

318
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,080
So, the person who's going to be your husband is me, isn't he?

319
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,460
What're you gonna do?

320
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,840
Someone needs to tell you the truth.

321
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
I can't.

322
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,300
But if I tell you...

323
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,700
Ryotsu! Maria is actually a man!

324
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,080
What!?

325
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,800
Come on.

326
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,000
If you're lying, you should be more realistic.

327
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,380
Oh, I'm so jealous of marrying such a beautiful woman.

328
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,320
I'll show you a hot newlywed family and make you more jealous.

329
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,600
I'll make you more jealous.

330
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,500
What's going on with Otsu?

331
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,700
Well, well, well.

332
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,140
This is his own mouth.

333
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,540
Are you trying to make him speak from his own mouth?

334
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,300
Maria is a man, right?

335
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,020
I see.

336
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,720
Oh, what should I do?

337
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,560
Go away!

338
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:22,960
What?

339
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,500
The only thing left is to rebel.

340
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,060
If you let him do that, it's over.

341
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,100
I know.

342
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,160
Ryotsu, how about some tea?

343
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,760
Oh, no.

344
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,520
Oh, no, no!

345
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,780
Sorry...

346
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,800
I shouldn't have another one.

347
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,100
This is not going to work if he's taking the tea.

348
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,720
No worries.

349
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,900
I brought the side dish to remind you of the situation.

350
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,460
Well, you're lucky.

351
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,800
Well, Ryotsu...

352
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,980
Watch out, Ryotsu.

353
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,440
Goodbye, Ryotsu.

354
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,400
Bye, Ryotsu.

355
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,820
He seemed to have become another person.

356
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,280
I'm sorry.

357
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,560
I shouldn't have another one.

358
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,500
It's okay.

359
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,940
There's still some left.

360
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,520
How many did you bring?

361
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,060
To make my marriage with Maria more certain,

362
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,340
I brought the coin delivery from the agency.

363
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,920
I'm so happy!

364
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,500
Now we have to make Ryo-tsu realize this.

365
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,320
Ryo-tsu, I have something to tell you.

366
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,080
What?

367
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm going to the agency right now.

368
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,640
Come on!

369
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,440
Ryo-tsu, what is marriage?

370
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,240
Why are you suddenly so serious?

371
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,880
Until recently you said "get married right away!"

372
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,660
Now you're not confident about it anymore?

373
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,640
No, I'm not!

374
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,320
I want to say that marriage can't be decided in a moment!

375
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,400
You may not know, but marriage is the grave of life.

376
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,560
In the case of you, it's the grave,

377
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,080
but in the case of Maria and me, it's definitely heaven.

378
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,180
It will definitely be hell if you find out who Maria is!

379
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,160
Marriage is not just about the appearance of the other party.

380
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,900
It's also important to know what's inside.

381
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,340
You know Maria has a good personality, right?

382
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,540
It's not about that!

383
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,540
I mean, once before marriage,

384
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
you should go to the hot spring,

385
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,120
and go to the same bath.

386
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,120
Maria is in the same bath,

387
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,120
so we can't go together.

388
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,740
Well, that's...

389
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,580
Oh, maybe, chief!

390
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,300
Oh, you've noticed!

391
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,900
Maria and I were in the same hot spring,

392
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,600
and you said you'd come in, too?

393
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,780
Oh, I'll come in, too!

394
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,240
You're quite a bad person, too.

395
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,080
I usually have a bad feeling about it,

396
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,920
but why do I feel it only at times like this?

397
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,460
What I'm trying to say is,

398
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,640
if you go in the bath together,

399
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,820
you might discover something unexpected.

400
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,440
Something unexpected?

401
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,820
That's right!

402
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,500
Something unexpected,

403
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,740
something very unexpected,

404
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,960
something so unexpected,

405
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
something so much unexpected,

406
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,840
you might discover something unexpected!

407
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,920
Something unexpected!

408
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,500
Maria!

409
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,380
Chief!

410
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,940
They're the real villains,

411
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,520
who always get beaten up by the bad ones.

412
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,360
If you resist them badly,

413
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,220
you'll get beaten up like this guy!

414
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,920
Now, I'm going to have you two

415
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,080
catch up with me today!

416
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,620
Hey, what are you doing to my Maria?

417
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,400
Master Ryo!

418
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,700
You again, huh?

419
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,680
You're going to beat them all up, huh?

420
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:43,840
Whoa!

421
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,220
Whoa!

422
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,180
Whoa!

423
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,780
Good job!

424
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,980
He's got a lot of power!

425
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,540
He's fighting for love, isn't he?

426
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,080
He is!

427
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,880
Now! Put him in the bag!

428
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,720
Ryo!

429
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,860
I won't let you get away!

430
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,680
I won't let you get away!

431
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,960
As expected of the former champion of kickboxing!

432
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,920
I won't let you get away!

433
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:47,320
What's that?

434
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,520
What's that?

435
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,360
Asato Ryuji's special move!

436
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,520
Air Jump Knee Kick!

437
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,840
Why did Maria use that move?

438
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,280
Ryo!

439
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,700
Ryo, are you okay?

440
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,780
What's this?

441
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,200
What's this?

442
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,700
Something is moving in my head!

443
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,160
No way!

444
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,360
What's this?

445
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,220
What's this?

446
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,000
Hey, hey, hey!

447
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,000
Ryo!

448
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,920
What's this, Maria?

449
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,080
What's in that matagura?

450
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,080
I don't want to.

451
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,360
Ryo has it, too.

452
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:36,860
What?

453
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,740
What about his chest?

454
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,660
It has a pad in it.

455
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,060
Then Maria is...

456
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,140
a man!

457
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,420
A man!

458
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,660
A man!

459
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,800
A man!

460
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,320
I finally get it.

461
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,620
I wish I could've known this in a much more gentler way...

462
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,940
So that's what came out of this.

463
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,120
Ryo!

464
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,080
You came to rescue me.

465
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
I'm so happy!

466
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,060
Your love begins forever.

467
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,260
When is the wedding?

468
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,380
What about the wedding trip?

469
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:13,460
Where are you going?

470
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,380
Don't be stupid!

471
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,940
Why do I have to marry you?

472
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,280
But you signed the marriage certificate saying you wanted to marry me.

473
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,340
I thought you were a woman then.

474
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,080
I have no intention of marrying a man.

475
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,840
I didn't know you were dating the ideal man.

476
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,780
I feel sorry for you.

477
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,360
It's not fair to make a girl cry.

478
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,300
He's a man!

479
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,320
I want to cry, too.

480
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,800
But I guess this is the end of the marriage.

481
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,440
I wonder what Maria is doing.

482
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,600
Do you still have a crush on her?

483
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,200
I wish we were married.

484
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,160
Don't be stupid!

485
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,920
We broke up because of our bad taste.

486
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,840
I'm just a little stuck.

487
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,200
I hope we don't have a fight.

488
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,900
Cheers!

489
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,000
What are you doing?

490
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,960
You're not here, are you?

491
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,780
I'm giving a tour of the new police officer's office.

492
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,500
Come on, get off.

493
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,940
Come on!

494
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,980
Ryo!

495
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,080
I wanted to live at your house.

496
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,720
Maria, you have a bad habit?

497
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,480
I'm a man, you know.

498
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,500
Maria looks great.

499
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,960
These days I love to dance.

500
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,580
What?

501
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,760
What the hell are you doing with such an absurd martial arts?!

502
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,880
Next episode, Rush and Clash of the Continent!

503
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,020
Don't miss it!

504
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,160
I want to be free, even more than a bird

505
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,440
A lady's dream that changes at the speed of a full moon

506
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,720
My love, I'm sorry, I lost

507
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,280
The future of the panorama

508
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,680
The dazzling light that dives

509
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,540
You understand, don't you?

510
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,980
I'm sorry, wait for me
