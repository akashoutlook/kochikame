1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,620
"A Christmas Day"

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,680
Ryo-san, it's almost Christmas.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,340
What Christmas?

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,700
Everyone's so excited.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,960
Christmas is usually on your birthday,

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,120
not for a couple!

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,140
Ryo-san, you're always alone.

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,620
Sorry!

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,200
Damn it!

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,120
Give me a present too!

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,280
When you watch TV,

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,460
make the room bright and look away!

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,020
Come to me,

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,520
you poor thing!

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,440
I'm not here,

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,200
but I'm worried.

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,820
Look at the blue sky,

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,900
and the white clouds.

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,140
It'll be alright soon.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,940
Come to me,

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:17,380
you jobless!

22
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not here,

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,540
but I'm worried.

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,940
Look at the fire,

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,520
and the red clouds.

26
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,740
I'm not here,

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,420
but I'm worried.

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,840
Look at the fire,

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,620
You know it, right?

30
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,160
You know it, right?

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,740
If you know it,

32
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,740
then come to me,

33
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,860
and keep quiet!

34
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,400
Come to me,

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:57,880
and keep quiet!

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,880
I

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,380
and keep quiet!

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,640
We're not good at that.

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,020
You're not good though.

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,140
That's why

41
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,620
you kept quiet!

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:26,000
You were making fun of me!

43
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,100
A pig!

44
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,900
Are they making a new one?

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,680
It's suddenly quiet.

46
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,440
Let's go and see.

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,520
Okay.

48
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,940
Senpai, what's that?

49
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,180
What is this?

50
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,000
Huh? Can't you see?

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,360
It's a helicopter for one person.

52
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,280
A helicopter?

53
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,140
That's right.

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,780
It's a shoulder-type helicopter with an even more compact auto gyro.

55
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,680
It's like a motor on a bamboo stick.

56
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,980
So it's called a "Takekobuta."

57
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,380
I've heard of that somewhere.

58
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,440
Really?

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,140
Then let's make it a shoulder-type helicopter.

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,860
It's pretty easy.

61
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,420
But, are you really going to fly?

62
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,020
If I don't fly, it's just a big fan.

63
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,920
But, that's not it.

64
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,400
In this shape, it'll rotate even a human.

65
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,480
It's okay.

66
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,840
There are many gears in the shaft and body,

67
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,740
and it's synchronized with the propeller's rotation in the opposite direction.

68
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,760
No matter how many turns it makes, the front is always the same.

69
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,340
That's very creative.

70
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,780
It would be great if you could just listen to the story.

71
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,220
This is the first prototype.

72
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,720
If this works, it will be sold in large numbers.

73
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,240
Huh?

74
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,320
You're going to sell it?

75
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,720
Of course.

76
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,020
I wouldn't make something like this just for my hobby.

77
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,480
Modern business is a one-minute, one-second fight.

78
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,020
When you get caught in a traffic jam on a highway,

79
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,540
and the car doesn't move at all.

80
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,100
Even if you have a cell phone or an email,

81
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,320
you still have to meet and talk to it directly.

82
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:10,880
Right?

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,100
I don't have time.

84
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,500
Only then,

85
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,140
this shoulder-copter will be active.

86
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,020
It's a very rare project.

87
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,560
Hello, everyone.

88
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,360
Sorry to keep you waiting.

89
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,740
You see,

90
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,400
No.1 took over 1 million yen for hand-made,

91
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,320
but if you have a sponsor and mass-produce it,

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,660
you can sell it for half the price.

93
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,940
If you buy it now,

94
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,060
you can fly around the city like a red-haired sheep.

95
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,260
This looks strange.

96
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,400
transport mansion and so on.

97
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,660
If you say so, the demand may be quite wide.

98
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,440
Is that so?

99
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,800
That's right!

100
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,520
Okay, let's try it!

101
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,860
Oh!

102
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,960
It's dangerous!

103
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,260
It's impossible in the room after all!

104
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,300
Ah!

105
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,200
Okay, let's go to the park!

106
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,100
Hmm, you should do it here from the beginning.

107
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,440
Hmm, a little.

108
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,980
It looks quite heavy.

109
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,580
It's 30 kilometers, so it can't be helped because it's an engine.

110
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,660
Are you okay?

111
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,800
Please don't get lost!

112
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,580
Yeah, if anything happens, I'll contact you on my cell phone.

113
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,020
I understand.

114
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,900
Then you guys are in danger, so stay away.

115
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,320
Let the engine start!

116
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,740
Yes!

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,520
Engine start!

118
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,540
I'm going to land!

119
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,420
I'm going to land!

120
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,800
Oh, it went up!

121
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,240
It's a success, Senior!

122
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,060
See you!

123
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,640
I'll come around Tokyo with a test flight!

124
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,240
If the chief comes, I'll trick him!

125
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,060
He went.

126
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,440
It really looks like Takedonbon.

127
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,700
Ehehehe.

128
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,280
Alright, let's go, let's go!

129
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,240
That's it!

130
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,240
This is a really good view.

131
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,840
I'm a genius after all.

132
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,740
I wonder how the outside world is like.

133
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,440
Oh, I found a temple.

134
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,460
Alright, I'll make a little fun of it.

135
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,040
It looks fun. Let's ride this next time.

136
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,760
Yeah, let's do it.

137
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,120
It's expensive.

138
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,300
I'm not good at this kind of thing.

139
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,440
It's fine, dad.

140
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,560
Let's go.

141
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,400
It's fine if you close your eyes.

142
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,900
It's not like you're really flying in the sky.

143
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
The monk is just giggling.

144
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,640
Alright, let's have a full-scale walk in the air.

145
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,580
The monk is going to be surprised.

146
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,780
Here we go!

147
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:29,840
Mom!

148
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,040
It looks like something is flying in the sky.

149
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,140
It's rising rapidly!

150
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,940
It's rising rapidly!

151
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,680
It's rising rapidly!

152
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,700
It's flying at 8 o'clock!

153
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,860
It's rising rapidly!

154
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,520
It's going up!

155
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:07,820
I made it in time.

156
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,380
It's going up!

157
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,660
It's going down!

158
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,240
I need to think fast.

159
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,020
It's flying at 8 o'clock.

160
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,380
It's still going!

161
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,560
She's over there!

162
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:27,860
What's important is to find it.

163
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,080
Let's see, what's going on?

164
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,060
Let me explain the others.

165
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,600
One, two, three, go!

166
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,280
Ouch!

167
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
Gah!

168
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:48,460
Ah!

169
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,220
Oh?

170
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,960
Ah!

171
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,900
Ah!

172
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,500
Ouch!

173
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,440
Gah!

174
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,180
Oh, wow!

175
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,520
Ouch!

176
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,940
Gah!

177
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,900
Ah?

178
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,100
Huh? Huh?

179
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,520
Huh?

180
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,280
No call. No call.

181
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,300
Excuse me again!

182
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,200
Good-bye!

183
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,640
I don't know why.

184
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,360
Ah, it was terrible.

185
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,040
Oh, gas.

186
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,120
It's about time to supply fuel.

187
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,020
Oh, good.

188
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,200
Gah!

189
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,940
Ouch!

190
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,100
Oh, gas station!

191
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,660
Get me gas!

192
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,160
Why from the sky?

193
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,300
It's full of waste.

194
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,700
Yes, welcome!

195
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,060
Yes, it's OK.

196
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,160
Now, let's continue.

197
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,380
Get out of the way.

198
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,440
One, two...

199
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,160
Open the door!

200
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,580
What was that?

201
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,400
You, young sports car! Stop!

202
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:07,980
Stop!

203
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,120
Gah!

204
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,240
Huh?

205
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,900
Gah!

206
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,620
The speed limit is over 30 km/h.

207
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Hooray!

208
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,240
Huh?

209
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,580
What's wrong with you, Mr. Ryoji?

210
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,020
Let me rest!

211
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,440
Ouch!

212
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,800
Hey, you're in the middle of work!

213
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,760
It's OK. It's OK. Don't say anything harsh.

214
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Get off!

215
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,740
Gah!

216
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,280
Gah!

217
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,860
Gah!

218
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,220
Gah!

219
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,240
Gah!

220
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,200
I'm so nervous.

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,420
Gah! Gah! Gah!

222
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,160
Hey, hey!

223
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,720
Don't be so reckless!

224
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,580
I'm afraid!

225
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,560
I'm scared!

226
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,940
It's because you suddenly lifted the power valve.

227
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,900
It's because you suddenly lifted the power valve.

228
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,320
You're so mean.

229
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,860
Please let me down.

230
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,640
Don't be so reckless.

231
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,640
It's too difficult to control with one hand.

232
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,940
Gah! Gah! Gah!

233
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,760
Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah!

234
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,800
Gah! Gah! Gah!

235
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,280
Engine trouble!

236
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,580
Ouch!

237
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,840
Ouch!

238
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,660
Ouch!

239
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:14,800
Ouch!

240
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,180
Ouch!

241
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,720
Gah!

242
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,820
What's wrong?

243
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,460
What's wrong?

244
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,140
The engine is...

245
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,540
What's wrong?

246
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,820
It's dead!

247
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,200
The engine is back!

248
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,600
Get out of the way!

249
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,920
Ouch!

250
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:29,820
Ouch!

251
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,240
It's the nose, my ass!

252
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,920
Let me go!

253
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,580
I still can smell the beer.

254
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,880
You're a big b*tch!

255
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,080
Let me go!

256
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,520
Your nose's gone!

257
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,280
It's the fun part!

258
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:58,840
Kentou no Oda

259
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,480
Let's see...

260
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,180
Like this...

261
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,220
The gasoline chiller and the maintenance took longer than I thought!

262
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,940
I'll have to blame the repair shop for this one.

263
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,840
Here we have the next news!

264
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:21,240
As a special gift, the king of the Ahorstan, Chappie, who is known as the pet of the king of the Ahorstan, has gone missing.

265
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,180
Chappie is a bird with an IQ of 380, and can speak human language.

266
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,700
Even in the New Book, the name of the bird is displayed, and the king of the Ahorstan is in great shock.

267
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,320
There are rumors of a kidnapping by anti-king.

268
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:42,400
The king has said that he will give a reward of 100 million Ahorstan dollars to the person who protected Chappie.

269
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,260
This is it!

270
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,040
If you use the shoulder copter to capture this bird, you will receive a reward and become a great advertisement.

271
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,300
You will also get a sponsor!

272
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,920
Hey, Chappie!

273
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,440
Come out!

274
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,340
Where are you?

275
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,840
I'm asking you a question. Do you know this bird?

276
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,660
I don't know!

277
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,340
What bird is this?

278
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,800
Have you ever seen this bird?

279
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,540
I'm sorry, but have you ever heard of this bird?

280
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:37,240
It's a bird that can be easily found.

281
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,200
Well, we can't find it that easily.

282
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,100
Mr. Chappie, take care.

283
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,940
Thanks.

284
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,780
But it's not as convenient as a cartoon.

285
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,620
No way.

286
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,060
Wait a minute. This is the top of the chimney.

287
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,320
Teko-chan!

288
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,280
Ita! You're Chappy, aren't you?

289
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,060
I'm Sadie.

290
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,980
Eh? What?

291
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:06,040
No, no, no! I can't catch that! I can't catch it!

292
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
What the hell are you doing?

293
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,220
It's a trap!

294
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,220
It's a trap! It's a trap!

295
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,840
Teko-chan! Teko-chan!

296
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,000
Damn it. You're going to let me run away, aren't you?

297
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,520
Wait!

298
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,180
Where did that bastard run off to?

299
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,640
It's there!

300
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,540
Teko-chan!

301
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,740
Damn it.

302
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,280
This guy!

303
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,900
The world is pink.

304
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,220
What is this?

305
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,380
What is this?

306
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,240
Thief! struggles!

307
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,060
Thief! struggles!

308
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,780
Thief...

309
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,280
Thief...!

310
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,100
Wait! Wait! I'm...

311
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,460
Thief!

312
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,120
Thief...!

313
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,420
Thief...!

314
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,580
Thief...!

315
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:51,820
Thief!

316
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,240
Where is the Thief?!

317
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,660
Where are the Thief...

318
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,200
The Thief...

319
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,480
Thief...

320
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,340
Thief...!

321
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,980
Thief...!

322
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,500
Thief...!

323
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:00,520
Thief...!

324
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:00,580
Tmap!

325
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,180
T limo!

326
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,020
Ba...

327
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,740
Trap!

328
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,380
Thief...!

329
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:12,820
I'm going to that place!

330
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,160
Alright, let's go!

331
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,140
Your majesty!

332
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,240
What the hell is this?

333
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,340
Toho! Toho!

334
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,440
What are you doing?

335
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,500
Ryotsu! What are you doing in such a place?

336
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,020
No, that bird is the best and the prize is...

337
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,940
What are you talking about?

338
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,680
Come down here, you fool!

339
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,160
Chief! You fool! You fool!

340
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,020
What?

341
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,100
What are you talking about?

342
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,520
You're so mean!

343
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,340
Hey, stop it!

344
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,260
Ryotsu, you're so mean!

345
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,400
Chief, that bird is not me!

346
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,520
You're lying!

347
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,840
Birds don't talk!

348
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,920
It's true!

349
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,200
Say something!

350
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,660
Say something!

351
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,120
Say something!

352
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't be stupid!

353
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,320
You're stupid!

354
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,480
Come down here, Ryotsu!

355
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,140
Come down here, Ryotsu!

356
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,360
Come down here, Ryotsu!

357
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Come down here, Ryotsu!

358
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,860
Come down here, Ryotsu!

359
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,400
Hey, wait!

360
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,280
Ryotsu, you idiot!

361
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,820
Don't you dare to live like this!

362
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,020
It's the death sentence!

363
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,220
It's not me!

364
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,100
Damn it!

365
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,640
You said you wanted to die and you ran away!

366
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,860
I won't forgive you!

367
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:36,520
It's here.

368
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,440
And here!

369
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,340
And here!

370
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,580
What's this?

371
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
What's this?

372
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,680
A rock!

373
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,540
You're abusing the Quetta!

374
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,360
Hey, wait!

375
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,260
You touched the rock, and now you're in trouble!

376
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,560
You slapped your hand over here, back to the quetta!

377
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:00,660
It's too much!

378
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:00,780
And what do you have there?

379
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,020
A fare!

380
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,880
I'll take care of it!

381
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,640
"The quetta is here!"

382
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,040
And who were you talking to?

383
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:09,860
The quetta is here!

384
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,140
Please, I'm going to save the quetta!

385
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,700
Where did he go?

386
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,680
He shouldn't be looking for me.

387
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,440
Ryo-san! Ryo-san!

388
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,100
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

389
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,380
You're not going to tell me?

390
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,380
I'm not!

391
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,140
You're not going to tell me?

392
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,220
Shut up!

393
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,560
You're making me angry!

394
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,100
Ryo-san! I'm coming! I'm coming!

395
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,600
Damn it! Wait for me!

396
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,240
How dare you insult me!

397
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,040
This way, Ryo-san!

398
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,880
Hurry up, you idiot!

399
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,840
Shut up!

400
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,040
You're going to be killed, Ryo-san!

401
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,920
If you let me say that, the engine will start!

402
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,560
I'll catch you this time!

403
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,080
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

404
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,420
This way! This way!

405
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,100
How did you like that?

406
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,100
You can eat me or whatever you want!

407
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,340
I'll do whatever I want!

408
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,320
This is bad! This is bad!

409
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,220
What's bad?

410
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Your life is going to be in danger now, right?

411
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,840
But I won't forgive you!

412
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,460
Ryo! Ryo!

413
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,120
You're a tyrant! You're a tyrant!

414
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,720
You're a tyrant!

415
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,220
I'm not a tyrant!

416
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,920
What the hell are you talking about?

417
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,580
You're lying!

418
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,940
I'm not lying! I'm not!

419
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,980
Even if you lie to me, I won't let you get away with it!

420
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,480
I'm not lying! I'm not!

421
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,040
Damn it! Wait for me!

422
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,440
Stop!

423
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,420
I'm not going to let you get away with this!

424
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,900
You're going to get me!

425
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,100
Be quiet!

426
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,800
Oh boy!

427
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,660
I'm in trouble!

428
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,100
Ryo! You're wrong! You're wrong!

429
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,220
Huh? That's...

430
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,680
That's the A perseveranceu king!

431
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,920
Are you serious about this?

432
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,820
Ryo! Look after him, princess!

433
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,000
OK, I got it!

434
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,980
For the money to come back to me, I'll have to help you in return!

435
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,520
Will you?

436
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,880
Alright! Let's go!

437
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,000
The submarine is waiting for us at sea.

438
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,340
The plan is a success!

439
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,520
Hahaha, Ido!

440
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,680
The strange helicopter is circling around.

441
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,660
What?

442
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,020
That's Chapin!

443
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,600
Chapin, this way, this way, this way!

444
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,120
What the hell!

445
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,240
Chippy!

446
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I got it! Leave it to me!

447
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,160
Ah!

448
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,080
Take this!

449
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,280
What? What? What?

450
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,180
Ah!

451
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,440
I'll get you!

452
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,060
Get down!

453
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,380
Alright!

454
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,420
Now I can pull the machine gun!

455
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,420
You, get into the helicopter and break the king's rope!

456
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,100
What about the submarine?

457
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,380
We'll manage!

458
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,520
That's it!

459
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,660
That's it! That's it! That's it!

460
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,420
This way! This way!

461
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,360
Come on!

462
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,360
Damn it!

463
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,000
This bastard!

464
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,580
Now, Chapin!

465
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,360
Come on!

466
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,860
The helicopter!

467
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, Chapin!

468
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,640
Hey, what are you doing?

469
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,460
This way, this way!

470
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,900
G-G-Get up!

471
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,000
G-Get up!

472
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,040
Chapin!

473
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,580
Chapin!

474
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,180
Chapin!

475
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,300
Chapin!

476
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,020
Chapin!

477
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,420
Chapin!

478
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,820
Take this!

479
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,860
The ferry!

480
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,060
Can't way!

481
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,620
Take it!

482
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,980
Take it back!

483
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,820
Awesome!

484
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,740
Awesome!

485
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,540
You did it!

486
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,320
Chic!

487
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,960
You did a great job, Chapin!

488
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,520
Gyo General!

489
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,900
You're great!

490
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,320
Well, well.

491
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,400
I bet you know what to do.

492
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,480
The next morning, the next day, the next day...

493
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,320
The next day, the next day, the next day...

494
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,140
The next day, the next day, the next day...

495
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,920
The next day, the next day, the next day...

496
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,940
Mr. Ryozu, you finally found Chappy.

497
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,360
I'll give you a reward.

498
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,400
Congratulations! Congratulations!

499
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,860
Heh, heh, heh... That went well.

500
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,000
I'll take 100 million Aho Standard Law.

501
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,200
My future will be pink!

502
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,360
Alright, Mr. Ryozu.

503
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,260
100 million Aho Standard Law.

504
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,100
Nuhaha!

505
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,740
Is this 100 million Aho Standard Law?

506
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,480
Heh, heh, heh...

507
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,760
By the way, how much is 100 million Aho Standard Law in Japanese yen?

508
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,180
It's about 5,700 yen today.

509
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,240
Hmm, 50 million is not bad.

510
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,640
It's 5,780 yen.

511
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,060
Huh?

512
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,640
That's ridiculous!

513
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,120
You worked so hard!

514
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,220
Even if you say that...

515
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,240
Today is the first day...

516
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,120
The first day is about 17,301 Aho Standard Law.

517
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,920
100 million Aho Standard Law is about 5,780 yen in Japanese yen.

518
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,040
Hey, say that quickly!

519
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,020
Ahaha, Ryozu.

520
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,040
Too bad! Too bad!

521
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,340
Ahaha, hahahaha...

522
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,240
Hey, you bastard!

523
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,880
Don't laugh!

524
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,780
Ahaha, hahahaha...

525
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,560
It's funny, it's funny.

526
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,400
Hey, don't laugh!

527
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,240
I'll kill you!

528
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,100
I'll kill you, Ryozu!

529
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,500
Do it nicely!

530
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,300
You idiot, Ryozu!

531
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:33,900
I'll kill you!

532
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,060
Shut up!

533
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,320
Ryozu, don't laugh!

534
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,860
Stop it!

535
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,140
Roger that!

536
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,000
What are you doing?

537
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,140
You're not doing anything.

538
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,140
What are you all doing?

539
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,540
Save me!

540
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,180
Save me!

541
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:50,860
Save me!

542
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,220
Move over!

543
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,120
Get out!

544
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,780
No use!

545
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,400
Get out!

546
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,180
Oh oh, what are you doing?

547
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,940
Why did you scare me?

548
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,280
What happened?

549
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:02,800
It's notù

550
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,760
I arrived at the home with Chappy.

551
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,040
Iq 380 was not just a bird.

552
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,280
Indeed, I want to give someone a drink with a red nail.

553
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,100
What's wrong with Senpai?

554
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,580
I don't see you for a while.

555
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,640
News from overseas.

556
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,320
At the top of the Alaskan Mountains,

557
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,740
A snowman-like creature was found on the top of Mount McKinley.

558
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,900
This creature has a strange voice that says, "I am Ryo-tsu."

559
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,080
Ryo-chan?

560
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,580
Senpai, it was blown to Alaska by a jet plane.

561
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,080
It looks like Tanpopo's seed.

562
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,000
Perfect. Leave it alone.

563
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,680
It's better to end your life as a snowman in Alaska.

564
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,660
It's better for the world and for people.

565
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,780
I am Ryo-tsu!

566
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,720
Dax!

567
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,480
Someone, help me!

568
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,800
Someone, help me!

569
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,140
After the rain, someone called me.

570
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,660
I walked back and forth.

571
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,640
I asked my mom.

572
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,220
When an elixir was drawn,

573
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,420
I thought I had a new feeling.

574
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,540
I felt an unusual feeling at that time.

575
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,740
So I took this charge of "Agedo3"

576
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,440
And I walked only in black.

577
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,640
Everyone was a child once.

578
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,600
But everyone forgot.

579
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,180
I forget

580
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,080
The politician with a great face

581
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,600
The blue aunt in the eyes

582
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,020
Turn around and look at that corner

583
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,600
You can meet everyone

584
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,880
There is a turtle

585
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,260
There must be a turtle

586
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,760
There must be a turtle

587
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,320
Everyone come to our town

588
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,380
Thank you!

589
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,880
New invention, Jumbo Manju!

590
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,340
If you eat it, it will be as big as you think it is!

591
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,960
It feels good to look down the river!

592
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,020
Hey, how big will it get?

593
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,320
This is too big!

594
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,500
Do something, Tondemo Professor!

595
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,160
Next time, Ryo-san will get bigger!

596
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,100
Please look forward to it!

597
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,740
Well, if you look outside

598
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,260
there is a turtle

599
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,520
There must be a turtle

600
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,700
Everyone come to our town

601
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,780
Thank you!
