1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:04,880
" horseshoe"

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,240
Once you see the television,

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,680
bright the room to watch them away from you.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,720
The people without money, come to me!

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,120
I don't know either, but I feel worried

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,900
Look at the blue sky, the white clouds

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sure it'll be okay

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,800
You know it, right? You know it, you know it!

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,120
If you know it, then shut up and follow me!

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,380
The End

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,080
Thank you for watching!

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,860
Next time, I'll be back with a more interesting story.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,100
Next time, I'll be back with a more interesting story.

14
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,180
Let's go home.

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,660
Okay.

16
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,760
What do you want?

17
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,520
Well...

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,140
Kankichi said he'd use your mail.

19
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,340
No, it's not that.

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,200
Please take this.

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,440
Okay.

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,100
I have a lemon on my phone.

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,560
That's not a normal phone.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,280
You can type with the voice.

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
What do you mean?

26
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,000
You can just talk to it.

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,440
That's convenient.

28
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,480
But I can't get an answer from Lemon.

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,860
I have the same phone, but I'll try it.

30
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,460
Mail.

31
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,760
What is it?

32
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,280
Oh, you're talking.

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,100
Yes, well...

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,120
To Lemon Ghiboshi.

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,740
Okay.

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,960
What's the title?

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:24,880
Oh.

38
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,680
Test.

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,160
Here's the content.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,700
Hello, Lemon-san.

41
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,800
That's really convenient.

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,640
Send.

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,700
I sent a mail.

44
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,180
Oh.

45
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,660
Please say "mail" on your phone.

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,860
Mail.

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,060
Wow, it's all hiragana.

48
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,300
I thought it would be easy to send a mail.

49
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,540
Yeah.

50
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,680
And thank you.

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,180
I'll use it carefully.

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,980
I'll use it carefully.

53
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,560
Yeah.

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,680
Lemon's Parenting Diving Machine

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,440
Cute.

56
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,760
You've grown up so much.

57
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,680
Yeah, it's been six months.

58
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,240
You look like Matoi-chan.

59
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,400
I look like Lemon-chan.

60
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,960
We're sisters.

61
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,140
Yeah.

62
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,240
Yeah.

63
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,980
Hey, you.

64
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,920
Good Прек Acting Books.

65
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,140
Pretty good.

66
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,480
Nice to meet you.

67
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,960
Yeah.

68
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,380
I've never seen you before.

69
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,700
This is...

70
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,760
àn Vaccination D kr.

71
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,680
I don't know.

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,500
This is what I am all about.

73
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,540
Oh, it's all about you.

74
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,020
Thank you.

75
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,520
Thank you very much.

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,940
Thank you.

77
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,280
If I meet her like she does, we get to talk.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Do you want to leave?

79
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,140
Fine.

80
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,340
Hey!

81
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,120
差ね or fucking Verse 3 and all that so it's not okay stop.

82
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,340
You're letting a little boy enter your house?

83
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,120
I can't help it.

84
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,540
When I get a bit of a salary, I come to get sushi.

85
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm working at the restaurant on my own.

86
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,080
I'm sure Ryo-chan Kichi is going to do something.

87
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,480
Shut up!

88
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,600
I'm a relative of the Gibon family!

89
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,260
Don't interrupt me about your family!

90
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,100
Hmph!

91
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,660
Yeah.

92
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,920
Well, well.

93
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,440
Hey, Matoi.

94
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,880
Can you come out in the magazine?

95
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,920
What?

96
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,060
My friend is an editor at a baby magazine.

97
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,700
She's looking for cute babies.

98
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,140
It's not a big deal.

99
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,240
Really?

100
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,340
I think she'll be happy.

101
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,540
Wow!

102
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,740
Ahaha!

103
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,480
You're already in the entertainment world!

104
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,660
I'm not!

105
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,360
I'm just taking pictures of baby magazines.

106
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,380
This is a corner where you introduce babies.

107
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,260
No, I don't understand.

108
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,580
Idols are getting younger and younger.

109
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,900
Momos' little sister's little sister.

110
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,760
Well, I'm sorry for being the other little sister.

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,640
Well, I'm sorry for being the other little sister.

112
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,860
Oh, well.

113
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,240
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,900
You, too.

115
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,160
You, too.

116
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,520
Then, please.

117
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,220
Well, Mika.

118
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,980
You, too.

119
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,340
Mika.

120
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
You, too.

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,580
Mika.

122
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,440
Oh!

123
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,780
There you are!

124
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,300
You've gotten better, Lemon!

125
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,300
The baby drinks the air with you.

126
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,700
It must be hard to put it out.

127
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,520
It's hard to say.

128
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,500
Lemon didn't really make a big difference.

129
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,200
That's not true.

130
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,620
It's true.

131
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,400
Because I'm the one who held Lemon.

132
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,540
Don't be so angry, Lemon.

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,580
Lemon was a baby 3 or 4 years ago.

134
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,020
I was, too.

135
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,160
Did Kankichi have a baby?

136
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:34,980
Yes.

137
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,460
Look, it's Lemon's album.

138
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,400
Which one?

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,220
Don't look at it because it's embarrassing.

140
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,760
It's an album that's a little embarrassing.

141
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:45,940
Which one?

142
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Is this Lemon?

143
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:47,860
It's cute.

144
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,540
It was a baby who didn't cry at all.

145
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,880
It's the same as now.

146
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,360
Are you praising that?

147
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,780
This is another Lemon.

148
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,000
It's like a baby.

149
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
You're wrong about a parent and a child.

150
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,780
If it's an orange, it's a perfect parent and child.

151
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,680
It's okay.

152
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,840
Lemon will take care of the oranges.

153
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,200
I'm sorry.

154
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,240
Put a baby in a bottle.

155
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,980
It's time for the interview.

156
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,400
Yeah.

157
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,420
I'm nervous.

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,300
You're okay.

159
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,240
We're with you, so we'll do it.

160
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,640
Oh, here they come.

161
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,060
Wow! Out of the blue?

162
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,800
Hmm?

163
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,720
Hey, Ryotsu-kun!

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hey, DENKYOKU SPARK! Are you editing for a magazine?

165
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,520
No way! I just passed by.

166
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,820
Oh, so you're with Plus too.

167
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,280
Plus says he's helping out, so I'd like to say hello.

168
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,860
Seriously, what are you up to?

169
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,500
Are you friends with Lemon?

170
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,220
Ah, hello, everyone!

171
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,560
I'm DENKYOKU Plus's father, Spark.

172
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,360
What kind of person are you?

173
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,900
Let me introduce you. I'm the fake inventor of Chitomachi.

174
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,480
Hey!

175
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,860
I'm kidding. I'm the president of Super Electronics.

176
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,160
Oh, the president.

177
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,440
How many craftsmen do you have?

178
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,380
Seven, including the branch store.

179
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,440
That's a lot of money. You need to make it more reasonable.

180
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,240
My company is developing sushi robots.

181
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,800
Hey, are you selling the product?

182
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,720
I'm just giving you some examples.

183
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,000
This is a sushi robot. It has 50 wheels per minute.

184
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,220
You really need to be a good man to make sushi.

185
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,260
For people like that, we developed a humanoid robot.

186
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,140
What? I didn't know there was such a weird humanoid robot before.

187
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,260
It's not like that. It's this kind of robot.

188
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,020
Oh, you have a good face like a craftsman.

189
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,460
What's more,

190
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,120
What?

191
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,420
You can do a job for five people by yourself.

192
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,420
Five people is fine, but the appearance is too SFX-chic.

193
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:06,620
Originally, the machine was a machine, but it was too machine-like, so it was made human-like with artificial skin.

194
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,100
Don't do it! It's even more creepy.

195
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,720
What else do you have?

196
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,040
How about a knife-cutting robot?

197
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
It's a speed of one in 30 seconds.

198
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,900
So don't make it a humanoid.

199
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,140
And the sea-shaped resin machine.

200
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,440
It's a robot that can handle even the business language.

201
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,320
That's what makes it humanoid. It's creepy.

202
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,180
That's what makes it more impactful.

203
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,580
Um, I have a visitor.

204
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,200
My name is Miwa from Baby's Life.

205
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,280
I'm glad to meet you today.

206
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,680
Ah, hello, hello.

207
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,980
Nice to meet you. I'm Spark, the electric pole.

208
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,760
Hey, it has nothing to do with you.

209
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,040
No, it's just for my baby.

210
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,800
I've brought you a useful item for your baby.

211
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,820
How about it? Would you like to see it?

212
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,700
Um, I want to take a picture of Mikai.

213
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,920
Yes.

214
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,340
No, I didn't expect that.

215
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,820
A piece of garden in a bag.

216
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,440
Nice.

217
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,360
Cute.

218
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,240
Awesome.

219
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,780
Eh?

220
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,540
Ah!

221
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,820
Um, could you not get in the way?

222
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,060
I'm not going to get in the way.

223
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,580
I'm going to show you how to walk around the garden.

224
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,240
I think it's a good idea to take a picture of it.

225
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,320
In the garden?

226
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,220
It'll get dirty.

227
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,080
Don't worry.

228
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,760
I have a safety walker I developed.

229
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,860
It's a revolutionary system that doesn't get dirty even in the garden.

230
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,360
It's a doll.

231
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,660
It looks like a hamster ball.

232
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,500
Even if it's inside the house, it can't go outside on its own.

233
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,120
Even if it's in the house, it can't fall off the veranda.

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,840
It's certainly safe.

235
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,620
It's safe even if your mother calls you for a long time.

236
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,480
But how can I put such a big thing in the room?

237
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,300
That's right.

238
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,260
If it's too big to get out, you can't put it in.

239
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,780
It certainly won't fit.

240
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,120
What if it falls on the slope?

241
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,860
It's too dangerous.

242
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,640
If it's really safe, you don't use dolls.

243
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,860
Well, what's next?

244
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,980
Hey, don't cheat!

245
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,360
Apolo-kun!

246
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,280
Apolo-kun?

247
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,580
Doesn't it look like the artificial intelligence robot we made somewhere?

248
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,960
That's rude.

249
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,320
This is not a robot.

250
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,840
It's a baby suit for babies.

251
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,660
But it's still an unfinished product.

252
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,240
Unfinished?

253
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,180
There are no babies who can take tests.

254
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,520
Of course!

255
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,020
So, let's explain the functions with the improved Apolo-kun beta.

256
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,380
Why me?

257
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,020
I heard that babies these days can't do HiHi well.

258
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,220
Yes, there is a tendency like that.

259
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,540
That's right!

260
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,000
With this Apolo-kun,

261
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,740
HiHi can be easily controlled.

262
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,160
Oh!

263
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,260
It's a structure that forces the correct HiHi movement with a power motor.

264
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,300
Furthermore,

265
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,460
in this way,

266
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,300
it can guide the correct way of walking.

267
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,720
The correct way of bowing.

268
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,220
Ah!

269
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,040
The correct way of bowing.

270
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,100
Furthermore,

271
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,480
the correct way of bowing.

272
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,860
Captain, nice shot!

273
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,180
As expected, a single player is different.

274
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,040
Once again,

275
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,140
the correct way of bowing when a boss is angry.

276
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,100
Captain, thank you for the meal.

277
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,300
I'm sorry.

278
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,420
Could you give me half of the salary?

279
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,480
Salaryman!

280
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,920
I feel terrible.

281
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,260
It's not good to forcefully let him do it.

282
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,080
Hmm.

283
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,100
Apolo-kun is indecisive.

284
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,440
So, the next item is.

285
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:58,840
Oh!

286
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,700
Don't say that!

287
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,320
Did you come to the product monitor?

288
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,300
Damn,

289
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,100
thanks to Spark,

290
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,420
I've spent a lot of time.

291
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,600
I'll take Mikan for a walk today.

292
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,780
I have to go to the store to prepare, so I can't go today.

293
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,780
I'm sorry, orange.

294
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,760
Then I'll take you to the lemon.

295
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,340
Oh, lemon, are you okay?

296
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,500
Yup!

297
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,280
It's not good to be exposed to the outside, so I'll be back in 30 minutes.

298
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,400
Okay, I'll go.

299
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,120
Be careful.

300
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,400
Yup!

301
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,540
That's how Lemon becomes a little sister.

302
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,380
But I'm still worried.

303
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,260
Kankichi, follow me so I won't be found by Lemon.

304
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,300
Roger that.

305
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,980
This phone has a lost mode, so you can see where Lemon is in one shot.

306
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,580
Okay.

307
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,660
Here it comes!

308
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:23,800
Ah, Plus!

309
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,980
Um, um...

310
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,280
I'm sorry about earlier.

311
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,220
Huh?

312
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
Isn't it Plus?

313
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,340
Didn't you go home with Spark?

314
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,420
I remember it was your father and you said it was not his father.

315
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,460
You're so cute, aren't you?

316
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,580
Yeah, you're just like Lemon.

317
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,000
You can have a conversation if it's not through mail, right?

318
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,820
No, it's just...

319
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,360
Why did you say sorry earlier?

320
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,600
Oh, that was because my father made a big fuss...

321
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,420
But I don't feel bad.

322
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,020
He's a good father with good children's feelings.

323
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,320
Look, even this new Hyper Land Cell,

324
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,160
it's dangerous for children to go outside.

325
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,160
This phone too...

326
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,880
Something wrong with your phone?

327
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,320
Well...

328
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,400
I can't talk to Lemon-san well,

329
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,720
so my father...

330
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,540
Anyway, about the baby,

331
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,160
my father thought about it for my father's sake

332
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,500
and invented it for the baby.

333
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,520
What are you doing, Plus?

334
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,500
You were talking nicely,

335
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,000
but now you're quiet?

336
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:03,840
This...

337
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,620
Hyper Land Cell, activate!

338
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,220
Wait, Plus!

339
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,300
This is the power of the new Hyper Land Cell!

340
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,020
K-Kankichi!

341
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,680
Sir!

342
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,540
Huh? Senpai?

343
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,740
I got it, I'll go help him right away.

344
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,420
Ryo-chan, did you do something again?

345
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,560
Anyway, I'll go to the hospital right away,

346
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,020
so please take care of the rest.

347
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,640
I can understand how Minomushi feels.

348
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,520
Senpai!

349
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,760
Are you okay?

350
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,860
Thanks to you.

351
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,620
I was wondering what would happen.

352
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,740
I'm sorry.

353
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,840
I didn't think it was you.

354
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,360
But why was Kankichi there?

355
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,240
Huh?

356
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,820
No, it was just a coincidence, a coincidence.

357
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,360
Right, Mika...

358
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,700
Huh?

359
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,700
Huh?

360
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,000
Your face is a little red.

361
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,920
What?

362
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,940
Mikan!

363
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,880
Really?

364
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, I'm a little hot.

365
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,580
What should I do? What should I do?

366
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,740
All right.

367
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,040
Anyway, let's hurry home.

368
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,220
Lemon, follow me.

369
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,420
Okay.

370
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,460
I'll take care of the doctor.

371
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,600
Oh, Plus, I'm counting on you.

372
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,600
Plus...

373
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,820
Lemon, let's go!

374
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,580
Okay.

375
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,940
Oh, Dad?

376
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,480
Huh? Mikan-chan is sick?

377
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,840
That's bad.

378
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,980
All right.

379
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,940
There's a doctor robot that's just right for you.

380
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
His name is Akahie-kun.

381
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,460
Yeah.

382
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,860
You're a fool, Dad!

383
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,800
The thermometer!

384
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,680
Huh?

385
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,400
What's wrong?

386
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,840
Mikan has fever.

387
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,460
Where's the doctor?

388
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,200
Plus is calling him right now.

389
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,980
It's Lemon's fault.

390
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,160
Matoi told me to come home right away.

391
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,940
What should I do?

392
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,620
It's okay.

393
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,220
Everyone's with Mika.

394
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,940
You don't have to worry about anything.

395
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,500
Take care.

396
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,760
I put on some ointment.

397
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,520
Oh, what did the doctor say?

398
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,740
He said he had a cold.

399
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,080
There were a lot of people here today.

400
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
You must be tired.

401
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,800
I should give them some medicine.

402
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:57,960
Yeah.

403
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,360
You've done a good job.

404
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,280
Plus.

405
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:00,980
Um...

406
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,720
How about Lemon?

407
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,020
If it's Lemon, it's Kikyo and Mikan's business.

408
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,080
Kankichi!

409
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,000
Leave Mikan to Mom and Grandma.

410
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,800
You help out at the store.

411
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,920
Yeah, I got it.

412
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,040
Leave it to me.

413
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,340
Plus, you go home...

414
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,660
Huh?

415
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,020
What should Lemon do?

416
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,200
Put some ice in this ice pillow.

417
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,640
Can you do that?

418
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:23,900
Yeah.

419
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,860
Yeah. We're going to cool the heat of the oranges with ice.

420
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,420
That's right. Let's fold the lemon.

421
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,600
Yeah.

422
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,500
Then, Lemon. I'll leave this to you.

423
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,600
When you put the ice in, bring the ice pillow.

424
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,200
Okay.

425
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,200
Then, Naemon...

426
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,120
But...

427
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,080
Let's fold it, Naemon.

428
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,020
Huh?

429
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:06,760
That's enough.

430
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,660
Put it under the orange's head.

431
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,760
Got it.

432
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,260
It's okay.

433
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,220
I'm sleeping with the doctor's medicine.

434
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,040
Then let's go now.

435
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,400
You two are tired, aren't you?

436
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,920
Let's put in some hot cocoa.

437
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,920
Y-yes. Thank you.

438
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,780
Lemon is here a little longer.

439
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,340
It's okay.

440
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,680
Lemon...

441
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,420
Okay.

442
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,120
Don't worry about it.

443
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,880
Lemon... I...

444
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,480
I'm sorry, Plus.

445
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,020
But I want to be by your side alone.

446
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,840
Ah...

447
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,680
Then let's go.

448
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,240
I'll get you some drinks later.

449
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,780
Yes.

450
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,120
Man, it's tough every time the party's over.

451
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,240
But, I can manage drinking alone,

452
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,660
so this is a good job.

453
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,320
Bus, are you still there?

454
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,660
I can't go back like this.

455
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,900
I made Mikan branches catch a cold.

456
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,880
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry about that. I'm sorry.

457
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,300
I'm not.

458
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,720
If that's the case, I have a responsibility.

459
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,060
That's right.

460
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,140
Hey, that's not the case in this kind of situation.

461
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,900
Oh, yes.

462
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,960
Well, I'm sure you feel the responsibility.

463
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,360
That's right.

464
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,200
Alright. Let's cheer Lemon up.

465
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,320
Come on, Kakichi!

466
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,140
Idiot!

467
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,600
If you enter the room like a lump of gold,

468
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,140
your orange illness will get worse!

469
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,200
Come here!

470
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,600
Damn it!

471
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,700
You called me like a lump of gold.

472
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,700
That's what I said.

473
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,060
Hurry up and come in.

474
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,700
Plus, you'll catch a cold too.

475
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,460
Yeah.

476
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,000
What's with everyone gathered?

477
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,580
Let's leave him alone for now.

478
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,720
So that Lemon doesn't feel bad.

479
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,480
That's right.

480
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,080
That might be the best thing.

481
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,240
I'm sorry, Mikan.

482
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,920
It's because of Lemon that I've caught a cold.

483
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm sorry.

484
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,220
Mikan,

485
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,960
I'm sorry.

486
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,020
I'm not going to do anything.

487
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,960
She's always been like this...

488
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,120
Mikan...

489
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,500
Thank you, Onee-chan.

490
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,620
Mikan! How are you feeling?

491
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,100
Oh, the fever's gone down!

492
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,020
I'm glad you're well, Mikan. I'm really glad.

493
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,020
What's wrong, Nemo?

494
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,380
Mikan's crying. I'm sure she's hungry.

495
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,200
Kankichi, call Mom over.

496
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,800
Okay, I got it!

497
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,960
Hey, Milk! Milk!

498
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,740
Hey, shut up! Don't run around the house!

499
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,820
Oh, Geppert!

500
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,180
Mikan woke up and she wants some milk!

501
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,640
I know that.

502
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,140
She's just gotten a little cold.

503
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,360
Look! Everyone's breakfast is ready!

504
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,900
Oh, good job, you three.

505
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,600
What a great teamwork.

506
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,380
You're so full.

507
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,360
Nemo, you did a great job.

508
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,740
You're a great sister.

509
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,800
It's all thanks to Kankichi and Plus.

510
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,000
I can't help it.

511
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,440
What are you doing?

512
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,100
I don't know what Kankichi is doing, but don't talk so much.

513
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,540
You're so annoying!

514
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,120
I'm gonna kill you!

515
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,220
Stop it! It's the same thing every time!

516
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,600
I'm not gonna do it! I'm gonna kill you!

517
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,720
You're so rude!

518
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,500
Stop it!

519
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,280
I'm gonna kill you!

520
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,140
Stop it!

521
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,720
I'm getting a fever.

522
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,480
I might have caught a cold.

523
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,100
I'll catch a cold.

524
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,980
I'm sorry, but I have a bad feeling about this.

525
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,700
What?

526
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,120
You don't believe me?

527
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,460
You're gonna admit it yourself?

528
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,460
Damn it!

529
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,880
I'm so frustrated.

530
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,840
Mika, you're so annoying!

531
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,720
Stop it!

532
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,480
Stop it!

533
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,620
Stop it!

534
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,360
Stop it!

535
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,000
Stop it!

536
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,080
Stop it!

537
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,280
Stop it!

538
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:05,480
Stop it!

539
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,360
Stop it!

540
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,720
Why, how come?

541
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,960
Why, how come?

542
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,200
Why, how come?

543
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,820
Why?

544
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,840
Your eyebrows look like black dessae.

545
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,340
Why?

546
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,480
You can run fast in your sandals.

547
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:30,840
Why?

548
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,180
Why?

549
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,400
You're always putting your arm around him.

550
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,680
Why, why?

551
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,280
Even though it's a mess, everyone adores it

552
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,260
Why, why?

553
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,260
It doesn't matter, but

554
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,740
The title of this anime is so long

555
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,020
This is Katsushikaku, Kameyari Koenmae, first appearance

556
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,580
Why, why?

557
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,280
Why, why?

558
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,440
Why, why?

559
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,520
Everyone, together!

560
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,640
Why, why?

561
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,920
Why, why?

562
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:30,100
Listen, Honda!

563
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,000
Men always forget the two letters of ambition

564
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:33,800
But we can't forget it!

565
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,700
From today to tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow

566
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,500
We always have the ambition to become the best!

567
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,140
So Honda, let's sell curry in this fire truck together!

568
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,900
Next time, "Men have ambitions!"

569
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,620
Please watch!

570
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,260
There is a Kameyari over there

571
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,880
There must be a Kameyari

572
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,680
Everyone, come to our town

573
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,800
Thank you!

574
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,000
