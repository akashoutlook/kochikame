1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,880
Forged In

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,360
When it comes to watching TV

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,140
Try to look out of your room and try to look away

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:25,180
Searing the setting sun at a far-flungaway river

5
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,300
Nekatsu shikashiba mata

6
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,340
Shiawaseda resette

7
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,240
Nakushite

8
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,900
Kigatsuita

9
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,100
Wakana ore

10
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,120
Dakara

11
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,440
Nekatsu

12
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,380
Nekatsu

13
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,680
Anitoshite!

14
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,460
Yueino No Shinani

15
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,560
This is Yueinou's Shinani from Ryoutsu-sama.

16
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,360
Please have this finished, in What a Long History.

17
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,840
Well, you're a beautiful woman, so you don't have to be so nice.

18
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,140
You're a beautiful woman, so you don't have to be so nice.

19
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,520
And you're a waste of money for Kinjiro.

20
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,980
And you're a beautiful woman, so you don't have to be so nice.

21
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,640
Go on, you're a good man.

22
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
How did you trick him, you bastard?

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,740
Dad, you drank too much.

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,040
What? You're a bad man.

25
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,280
When you're happy, you should drink thoroughly.

26
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:16,900
When you're happy, you should drink thoroughly.

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,340
Right, Dad?

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,840
Y-Yes.

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,920
More importantly,

30
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,580
Kinjiro's brother is a police officer.

31
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,700
Kinjiro's brother is a police officer.

32
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,180
What?

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,180
Well, I don't think he's a good man.

34
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,260
Well...

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,220
Kinjiro, your brother, is a great lawyer.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,000
And I think he's a great police officer, too.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,020
Huh?

38
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,400
I think he was the chief of the Kazushika office.

39
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,140
Or vice-chief.

40
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,340
Oh...

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,820
Well...

42
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,160
You're a good man.

43
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,260
I'm sure you'll be a good police officer in the future.

44
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,040
What a wonderful brother you are.

45
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,160
Yes.

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,280
I'll be a good police officer in the future.

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,460
What?

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,280
What?

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,900
Is that what I said?

50
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,940
You don't remember?

51
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,400
You're a bad person.

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,420
I won't remember.

53
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,740
I'll get it on my head.

54
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,340
What are you going to do?

55
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,920
Kankichi will come to the wedding.

56
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,700
But he's a great brother.

57
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
You're kidding me.

58
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,360
Well,

59
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,620
I'm going to invite Kankichi to the wedding.

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,240
You!

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,880
I'll think about it.

62
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,360
But look, if he comes to the wedding, he'll be in big trouble.

63
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,920
He likes matzubi, so if he gets drunk and gets naked, it'll be bad.

64
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,500
The wedding might turn into a divorce.

65
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,200
But you can't just ignore him, right?

66
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,980
We're brothers.

67
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,040
And if you find out later, you'll get angry.

68
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,960
Shut up!

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,200
If the wedding is over, there's nothing we can do about it.

70
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,760
Then...

71
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes, the divorce is impossible.

72
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,780
We can ask for compensation and compensation.

73
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,460
Thank you very much.

74
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,300
Doctor, we have a call from your family.

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,660
Excuse me.

76
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,240
And we also have a call from the head office and the minister of civil affairs.

77
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,200
Got it.

78
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,280
Yes.

79
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,160
This is it.

80
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,740
The invitation to the wedding is here.

81
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,180
I gave it to them this morning.

82
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,200
What?

83
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,000
Did you give it to them on the day of the wedding?

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,980
Of course I did.

85
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,980
Damn, you're late.

86
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,480
Anyway, dad.

87
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,940
You said that about your brother yesterday...

88
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,480
Dad.

89
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,560
Dad!

90
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,460
Damn it.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,760
Wait.

92
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,980
I gave it to them this morning.

93
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,940
It'll arrive tomorrow.

94
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,140
I have a problem with parents.

95
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,240
They'll never get it before the wedding.

96
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,640
I won't give it to them until the wedding.

97
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,060
I wish they gave me the answer.

98
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,740
Dad!

99
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,800
Aww, you did it again!

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,480
I love you man.

101
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,400
How about you and me?

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,440
We're good friends, buddy.

103
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,500
Never mind.

104
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:17,660
I'll remember it.

105
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,960
The wedding will be perfect,

106
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,020
I haven't gone to work yet,

107
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,440
Hey, daddy!

108
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,280
You're pathetic.

109
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,280
It's not me.

110
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,020
Hey, man!

111
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,180
What are you doing here?

112
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,820
I was just guessing.

113
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,800
Wait a minute.

114
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,380
What is it?

115
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,480
Did you find out?

116
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,620
The 11th race is a battle between Kamioka and Yoshiyama.

117
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,400
Just this one point.

118
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:48,940
Thanks.

119
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,580
See you.

120
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,340
You scared me.

121
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,500
Hey!

122
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
What is it?

123
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,720
It's the 10th race.

124
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,780
You don't have to go to work.

125
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,920
Oh, I see.

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
The chief will be here soon.

127
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,140
What a guy.

128
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,220
Hey, you!

129
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,100
What are you doing?

130
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,220
No...

131
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,720
Excuse me.

132
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,660
I found it.

133
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,000
If I don't have this, Kankichi will come.

134
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,880
Don't worry.

135
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,780
I'll go to the Ferris wheel.

136
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,600
I'll go to the Ferris wheel.

137
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,200
I'll go to the Ferris wheel.

138
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,400
Are you touring?

139
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,640
Yes.

140
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,520
Honda and Otohime will go with me.

141
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,700
Sounds fun.

142
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,760
When is it?

143
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,020
Next Sunday.

144
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

145
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,900
There is a wedding on that day.

146
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,660
Don't say that.

147
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,360
Whose wedding is it?

148
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,740
It's my mother's, grandmother's, sister's, son's, wife's, sister's, sister's daughter's.

149
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,520
I don't know.

150
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,960
If you're a distant relative, you don't have to come.

151
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,940
Well, I guess I'll refuse.

152
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,240
Oh, right.

153
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,220
I found the invitation.

154
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,700
I found it.

155
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,540
The phone number is...

156
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,520
Keiko Kirigaya.

157
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,180
It's a different name.

158
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,020
What about Hanamuko?

159
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,340
Jiro Ryotsugane.

160
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,280
This one is also different.

161
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,100
It seems that she is a lawyer from Todai University.

162
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,640
She is from Todai University.

163
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,860
Her address is Taitoku.

164
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,880
Oh.

165
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,940
What's wrong?

166
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,480
My brother is also from Todai University.

167
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,160
He is a lawyer in Taitoku.

168
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,100
He is the same person as Jiro in this Ryotsugane.

169
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,100
Oh, it's a coincidence.

170
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,460
It's a strange name.

171
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,420
Ryotsugane.

172
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,400
Ryo-sama, is it possible that you read it as Ryotsukinjiro?

173
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,540
What?

174
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,040
Ryotsukinjiro.

175
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,260
Oh, I see.

176
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,900
Ryotsukinjiro.

177
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,800
You are a distant relative of my senior.

178
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,040
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,800
He is my brother.

180
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,860
What?

181
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,880
No way.

182
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,560
He is your brother, but he is not your senior.

183
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,080
You read it as Ryotsugane, right?

184
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,500
No, I'm sure it's the same address.

185
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,400
Then...

186
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,500
He is Kinjuro.

187
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,940
I didn't let you know that.

188
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,340
Damn it.

189
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,300
Ryo-sama.

190
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,740
It seems that something terrible is going to happen.

191
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,980
Nakagawa-san.

192
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,540
Nakagawa-san?

193
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,200
Senpai and I are relatives.

194
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,840
Kinjuro, you bastard!

195
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,960
Why didn't you tell me?

196
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,440
I won't forgive you!

197
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,780
You are so stubborn.

198
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,540
I just got it.

199
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,440
Make me some food.

200
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,100
Yes, yes. I'll prepare it right now.

201
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,200
Hey, have you eaten yet?

202
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,060
What's wrong with you?

203
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,480
I've been waiting for a mail from Ryo Kankichi.

204
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,200
You are...

205
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,120
Hey, Meiji.

206
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,140
Hey, Meiji!

207
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,040
Damn it.

208
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,000
Kankichi.

209
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,880
Ryo-sama's mother.

210
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,220
Maria-chan.

211
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,160
Where is Kankichi?

212
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,460
That is...

213
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,820
The

214
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,700
I thought it was this area.

215
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,420
Here I am.

216
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,540
My uncle will say hello to you.

217
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,820
Next is...

218
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,080
My middle school teacher...

219
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,860
Who is that?

220
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,780
Me.

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,500
Let me in.

222
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,080
Brother.

223
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,460
Brother...

224
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:01,960
Hello, brother.

225
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,580
Hey, Kinjiro!

226
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,420
Calm down, brother.

227
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,160
Nice to meet you, brother.

228
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,300
Brother, this is Keiko Kirigaya.

229
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,700
We're having a wedding today.

230
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,360
What do you mean you didn't invite me to your wedding?

231
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,260
Keiko's mother's younger brother's...

232
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,060
Oh, I forgot.

233
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,560
I received an invitation from a distant relative, but I didn't receive it.

234
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,360
There's no way.

235
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,280
I sent it to Niconico.

236
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,020
Don't lie!

237
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,440
I don't know how great you've become, but I'm not a bad brother who can't even invite me to my brother's wedding.

238
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,500
You misunderstood, brother.

239
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,300
Then why didn't you send me an invitation?

240
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,420
I've never had a sad day like today.

241
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,040
I thought I'd celebrate my brother's wedding no matter what.

242
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,200
What?

243
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,800
I told you, it's a misunderstanding.

244
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,980
That's right. I didn't even send an invitation.

245
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,360
You're so annoying.

246
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,840
Keiko.

247
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,960
Are you okay, Keiko?

248
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,480
I just sprained my ankle a little.

249
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,500
What are you doing?

250
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
I'm sorry for being a rough brother.

251
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,020
I'm sorry for being a rough brother.

252
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,680
If you do this, I'll break your wedding as well!

253
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,220
My brother is always like that.

254
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,920
That's right. If I try to be happy, I'm always in the way.

255
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,260
What?

256
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,800
Even when I fell in love with a girl for the first time in elementary school.

257
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,980
Kinjiro, what are you talking about?

258
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,560
Stay close to her.

259
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,680
I took a photo of her in front of the futon I had put on.

260
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,440
So my first love didn't work.

261
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,740
You're sorry for putting on a sleeping mask.

262
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,320
That's not all.

263
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
Even when I was about to pass the university exam.

264
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,560
Keiko.

266
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,900
What did I feel for the past two days before I got the acceptance letter?

267
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,400
Thanks to that, the joy would have doubled.

268
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,760
It's enough. Please leave.

269
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,620
What?

270
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,640
Kinjiro.

271
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,880
That's enough.

272
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,380
This is how you are.

273
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,120
Right?

274
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,740
I'm not your brother anymore.

275
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,860
Bye.

276
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:37,260
To be continued

277
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,140
Kinjiro, can you give it back to me?

278
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,900
Kinjiro!

279
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,060
Don't talk about that guy anymore!

280
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,100
The End

281
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,200
Kinjiro?

282
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,980
The Whitebeard Bridge...

283
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,060
I have a memory of the Whitebeard Bridge.

284
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,060
That was before I entered elementary school.

285
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,700
I was watching a paper play.

286
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,720
That day, my brother was not there,

287
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,800
and I happened to be alone.

288
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,020
Oh...

289
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,940
I followed him to the paper play.

290
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,380
When I suddenly realized,

291
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,020
I was in a completely different town.

292
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,980
I didn't know where to go back to.

293
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,740
Anyway, if I went to Kawazutai,

294
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,820
I thought I would arrive in Asakusa.

295
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,640
And I arrived at the Whitebeard Bridge,

296
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,520
Dad... Mom...

297
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,780
Let's go home!

298
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,640
Brother...

299
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,760
Kenjiro...

300
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:49,200
I...

301
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,840
I was worried about you, but now I can't watch the pro-wrestling.

302
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,280
Nii-chan!

303
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,280
I still remember Nii-san's heart beating and the warmth on his back.

304
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,840
He's a wonderful man.

305
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,720
That's why he bought a house near Shirahigibashi.

306
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,540
It was a place of great memories for me.

307
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,420
Kinjiro-san, let's go to Nii-san's wedding.

308
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,860
Keiko-san!

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,040
Nii-san!

310
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,120
Nii-san!

311
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Nii-san!

312
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,880
Nii-san!

313
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,920
Nii-san, it's my fault.

314
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,260
Please attend the wedding.

315
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,120
No, please attend.

316
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,720
What? You suddenly changed your attitude.

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,560
Nii-san is a precious brother to me.

318
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,260
Please attend the wedding.

319
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,300
Please do it for me, too.

320
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,240
Idiot!

321
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,120
I can't say "Yes, I do."

322
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,540
If you're not my brother, I'm not your brother.

323
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,660
Nii-san!

324
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,860
Nii-san!

325
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,500
Senpai!

326
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,100
Kankichi!

327
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,880
Oh, Fukuro!

328
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:32,920
This.

329
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,840
It's the invitation to my wedding.

330
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,240
My father took it out of the mail box of Ryo.

331
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,340
What?

332
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,200
I couldn't get a draft because I went to the wedding.

333
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,920
That bastard! I won't forgive you!

334
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,180
Oh!

335
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,520
Nii-san, the wedding is...

336
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,080
Of course, I'll attend it.

337
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,860
I'll make it the best wedding in Japan as my brother!

338
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:56,900
See you!

339
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,020
That's right!

340
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,660
Take care!

341
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,720
Are you the tough brother?

342
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,600
Nice to meet you today.

343
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,480
You're called the iron man.

344
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,380
Nice to meet you, too.

345
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,380
Well...

346
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,600
Uncle, the toilet is here.

347
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,120
I'll take a picture after the ceremony.

348
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,220
I'll collect them all.

349
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes.

350
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,440
Keep an eye on the money.

351
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,020
Be careful with the money.

352
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,600
Yes.

353
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,740
The amount is here.

354
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,480
The ceremony will start in 10 minutes.

355
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,880
Come on, old lady.

356
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,500
You're so smart.

357
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,260
Are you ready?

358
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,820
Yes.

359
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,900
Is everyone here?

360
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,580
Yes, perfect.

361
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,560
Your wife is beautiful.

362
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,280
She's the best.

363
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,360
She's perfect for the wedding.

364
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,840
No way!

365
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,160
I have a request for you when you're getting ready.

366
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,320
What is it?

367
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,600
What are you going to do?

368
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,680
I'll make the best wedding in Japan.

369
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,920
Leave it to me.

370
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,560
Now is the time to be the main character!

371
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,440
I think so.

372
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,360
The times are about to change.

373
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,460
As for politics...

374
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:04,940
Enough!

375
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,020
It's too long.

376
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,960
It's over.

377
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,900
Thank you.

378
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,560
The next minister is definitely Mr. Kuroyama.

379
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,480
Who is he?

380
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:15,560
I don't know.

381
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,280
He must be his secretary.

382
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,540
First he gave up on the show.

383
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,540
I was really worried about him...

384
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,660
After all, it was better not to call him.

385
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,620
So I applied.

386
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,260
Not this time!

387
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,020
The next is...

388
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,200
The oldest member.

389
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,640
Kankichi Ryōtsu.

390
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,120
It's me.

391
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,480
I want to say something.

392
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,040
You're a good man.

393
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,120
What? I told you not to call me that.

394
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,460
I don't care what happens.

395
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,700
Even if you say that, I'm worried.

396
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,560
When he was a kid, his brother Kinjiro was a useless guy who was always sleeping.

397
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,120
Big brother...

398
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,880
When he got older, he became a model that was made of serious raw materials.

399
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,120
But from his brother's point of view, he's still a foolish brother.

400
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,180
You're the most foolish.

401
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,220
Please look. This is my father.

402
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,360
He actually has a good-looking face.

403
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,260
He became a guarantor because he was so good.

404
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,060
As a result, he crushed the perspective of the store.

405
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,660
Don't say that.

406
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,160
My relatives have a good life.

407
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,900
They have a good job, a good job, a good job, a good job, a good job.

408
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,180
They have a good job, a good job, a good job, a good job.

409
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,660
They are all good-looking and poor, but...

410
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,540
They are all good-looking and poor, but...

411
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,260
They are not doing anything good.

412
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,820
In addition, my relatives have a lot of old people and old women at the top at the age of 107.

413
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,060
They don't think much and just live a long life.

414
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,120
Next, please, Professor of National University.

415
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,720
Please...

416
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,260
Relax your necktie.

417
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,640
Do you feel good?

418
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,280
It's your home anyway.

419
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,740
Everyone, relax your necktie.

420
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,720
If you eat with your neck tight, the food won't pass through your throat.

421
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,060
I'm getting closer to the tempo of my senior.

422
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,080
Applause!

423
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,080
It was a wonderful classical performance.

424
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,640
But, the unbearable amount of money is a burden to the ears of the horse.

425
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,880
Oh, Nakagawa! Come here for a moment!

426
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,180
What?

427
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,400
This young entrepreneur is my subordinate.

428
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,780
Please greet him.

429
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,640
First, adjust the time. Connect it for three minutes.

430
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,840
I see.

431
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,860
You're using the temperature of the Akou of Nakagawa's treasury?

432
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,260
Well, uh...

433
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,960
I and the senior are...

434
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,040
That's enough! We have a job!

435
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,380
Sorry to keep you waiting!

436
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,380
After the retouching, the new priest will enter!

437
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,620
New priest! New priest! New priest!

438
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,100
The priest has returned!

439
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,680
The new priest is the chief of our village, the Arakuremono family!

440
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,700
This is amazing, professor!

441
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
The television is different from the Arakuremono family!

442
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,040
Amazing!

443
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,440
Now, everyone! Let's celebrate their happiness and drink!

444
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,180
Ah, that was supposed to be a bad idea by the new priest and the chief!

445
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,000
Don't say such a hard word!

446
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,420
Now, let's drink and drink and drink all the alcohol in the hotel!

447
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,420
Yeah!

448
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,100
It's fine to ride the new priest!

449
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,380
Yeah, he's a nice old man.

450
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,360
From today, he'll really become your older brother.

451
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,460
I'm glad to hear that he's a reliable old man.

452
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,400
Is that so?

453
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,940
I'm so happy! I'll take care of all the housework!

454
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,940
That's really helpful!

455
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,080
Kirinoya, please take care of the children.

456
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,900
No, thank you.

457
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:55,980
Of course.

458
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,240
Dad, let's drink already!

459
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,540
Huh? The priest is...

460
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Ah, what a nuisance!

461
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,740
I think I drank too much today.

462
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,280
Professor, please wake up!

463
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,880
I can't drink anymore.

464
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,320
It's about time.

465
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,220
Okay, okay.

466
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,100
Now, let's go home, Dad!

467
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,140
My relatives are all dead.

468
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,620
President, are you okay?

469
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,100
Dad, I'm sorry.

470
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,620
My brother got too drunk and ended up in this situation.

471
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,780
Kinjirou...

472
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,280
Yes?

473
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:43,720
I've been to many weddings, but this is the first time I've had such a fun and warm wedding.

474
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,320
He's a good brother.

475
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,020
Kinjirou.

476
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,720
Yes?

477
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:51,820
Yes.

478
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,360
Please take care of my daughter.

479
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,400
Yes.

480
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,020
Dad...

481
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,040
Ouch...

482
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,440
I've never seen such a happy father before.

483
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,220
I have to thank you, brother.

484
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,220
Ah!

485
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,300
Where's brother?

486
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,100
Mom, where's brother?

487
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,180
He went home with dad.

488
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,740
Eh? Really?

489
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,920
Brother...

490
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,760
Dad, it was a nice wedding, wasn't it?

491
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,960
It was the best wedding.

492
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,500
I'm worried about what's going to happen later.

493
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,740
Kankichi, stay up tonight.

494
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,300
That's right.

495
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,640
There's plenty of wine.

496
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,020
And fish, too. There's a sea bream that came out of the wedding.

497
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,780
I forgot to bring it all.

498
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,980
If it's decided, go home quickly.

499
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,780
I'm cold.

500
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,440
Kinjirou, be happy.

501
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:49,460
Get up.

502
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
Kankichi!

503
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,400
What are you doing?

504
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,120
Alright, let's drink!

505
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,520
Let's drink till morning.

506
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,940
Are you sure you're old enough?

507
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,700
I'm not losing to you yet!

508
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:19,840
Argh, kind of.

509
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,340
Hey, shut the door!

510
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:22,740
Why?

511
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,340
What should I do?

512
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,540
I'm right here, I'm gonna save Ryo.

513
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,520
What are you doing?

514
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:30,620
I'm being chased.

515
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,040
Kankichi, you're balanced too.

516
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm just a little disappointed.

517
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:35,260

Can I drink too?

525

No, please stop drinking.

Hey!

537
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,340
The wedding ceremony of my younger brother Kinjiro has been successfully completed,

538
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,360
and I, too, have become a relative of Nakagawa!

539
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,020
From now on, as a relative,

540
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,560
I'll build up a Nakagawa Group,

541
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,460
and make more and more money!

542
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,980
Next time, as a relative,

543
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,280
I'll be in your care!
