1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,880
Vacation is intense!

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,800
Ryo, I know what you're saying.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,720
Come out!

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,880
It's been six months since you stopped helping.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,180
I'll have you pay today.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,440
I'll close this deal and pay you 55,000 yen.

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,280
Pay the three bills!

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,720
You think it's okay for the police to pay the debt?

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,100
Open it, Ryo Kankichi!

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,580
I have to go home before they pay today.

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,140
Hurry up and come out!

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,560
I know you're hiding, Ryo!

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,300
Come out!

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,160
30 seconds left.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,200
This way is no good.

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,520
I see.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,520
Five seconds left.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,280
Four.

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,900
Three.

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,560
Two.

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:56,840
One.

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,020
Stop!

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:00:59,760
Stop!

24
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,420
You're done, Ryo.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,580
Let's play again.

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,080
How much is the debt?

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,500
It's nothing.

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,720
It's about 180,000 yen.

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,160
It's the same as my salary.

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll pay you back!

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,280
I'm confused.

32
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,860
Hokkaido is good, isn't it?

33
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,320
The autumn leaves are already starting.

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,460
Okinawa is hard to throw away.

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,720
We can play scuba diving.

36
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,700
Hokkaido is great.

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,800
Okinawa is good.

38
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,060
Hokkaido?

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,220
Okinawa!

40
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,820
Hokkaido!

41
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,300
Hokkaido!

42
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:32,920
Hokkaido!

43
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,460
Hokkaido!

44
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:33,700
Okinawa!

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,180
Okinawa!

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,660
Okinawa!

47
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,100
Okinawa!

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,360
Okinawa!

49
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,000
Okinawa!

50
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,280
Well, well, you two...

51
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,680
What's wrong?

52
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,680
Actually, I was talking about the trip to Yan at the exhaust.

53
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,640
Where are you going?

54
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,140
That is...

55
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,340
Ryo!

56
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,120
Hokkaido is good, isn't it?

57
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,720
You can eat anything you want in the fall.

58
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,760
I knew it!

59
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,080
It's Okinawa, isn't it?

60
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,620
It's a great place to go on a trip!

61
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,300
Hokkaido and Okinawa, huh?

62
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,100
It's a great place.

63
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,500
I think it's better to go abroad.

64
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,400
You can enjoy the feeling of the South China Sea with Hawaii or the Gulf.

65
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,480
That's impossible.

66
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,760
The budget is not enough.

67
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,980
How much is it?

68
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,060
48,000 yen per person.

69
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,840
After the previous trip, I decided to go to the university.

70
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,420
I paid 2000 yen a month for two years.

71
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,060
I worked hard for two years.

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,460
By the way, Ryo,

73
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,500
you've been saving up for three months.

74
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,740
Shut up!

75
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,220
I'm happy with that.

76
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,400
Leave it to me.

77
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,760
I'll let you go on a trip abroad.

78
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,580
What?

79
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,760
I'll make good use of the travel expenses and pay off my debt.

80
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,640
I'm so smart.

81
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,000
A travel agency for the first time.

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,280
Travel agency for the first time.

83
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,200
I hate this name.

84
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,780
I think it's the place where the fake real estate is located.

85
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,280
Well, whatever.

86
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,600
I don't have a contract with him yet.

87
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,340
I'll have to do something with the debt, or I'll be in trouble.

88
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,360
I'll ask him!

89
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,120
Why are you here again?

90
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,520
Cheers!

91
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,360
Welcome!

92
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,460
A travel agency for the first time for the first time for real!

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,100
It's been a long time.

94
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,440
A travel agency for the first time for the first time for real!

95
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,540
You're a fraud!

96
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,440
You're a fraud, you know.

97
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,600
Why are you the one who's the travel agent?

98
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,920
Well, the real estate industry is in a bad shape.

99
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,860
So I've switched to the overseas travel agent.

100
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,400
It's about you anyway. You're still doing frauds.

101
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,500
N- no way.

102
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,340
I'll start a new life from now on.

103
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:41,880
I'll be honest!

104
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,700
I'll be devoted to my job!

105
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,100
You'll be honest, huh?

106
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,140
Y- yes.

107
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,540
Actually, I want to go on a trip to Iyan with my wife.

108
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,840
Y- yes, you do.

109
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,860
Which way are you going?

110
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,940
I want to go to the South Island, like Guam or Saipan, in 3 nights and 4 days.

111
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,480
Sir, you're lucky.

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,100
Just now, I got the information about the super-cheap Guam tour.

113
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,960
Oh.

114
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,160
How about this?

115
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
60,000 yen in 3 nights and 4 days.

116
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,200
The hotel is super-class, so it's super-profitable.

117
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,400
So, why are you going?

118
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,160
I'm going!

119
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,700
That's a good idea for an airplane.

120
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,320
I'm so excited.

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,640
What's written in this small font?

122
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,260
I'll ask!

123
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,040
The meeting place, Guam Airport?

124
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,940
That means the airport is different.

125
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,560
What?

126
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,160
You, where did you get your heart?

127
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,120
This is the same as the old days, isn't it?

128
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,580
Huh?

129
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm so sorry.

130
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,920
I'm so sorry.

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,540
Night-night.

132
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,200
This is a super-cheap tour.

133
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,520
It includes the flight fee, so it's 60,000 yen in 3 nights and 4 days.

134
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,640
So, what's the hotel like?

135
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,160
It's a pretty good hotel, even though it's a super-cheap hotel.

136
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,040
Super-cheap hotel, huh?

137
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,600
What's this sign?

138
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,440
It says, "Super-cheap Hotel."

139
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,100
I think I heard it wrong.

140
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,680
Can you tell me another hotel?

141
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,440
Super-cheap hotel.

142
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,000
Can you point at me?

143
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,420
Um, this one?

144
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,500
It's a kind of unnatural way of pointing at me.

145
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,720
Giku-giku.

146
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,040
What the hell is this?

147
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,680
This "super-cheap" hotel behind this fancy hotel is called Super-cheap Hotel, right?

148
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,940
Well, that's...

149
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,820
I'm sorry.

150
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,860
I can see through your way of doing things.

151
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,500
Hey, you!

152
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,180
Why are you doing such a serious tour?

153
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,840
It doesn't matter if it's a southern island.

154
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,820
I don't care where you are, but you have to make sure that you have a proper hotel and proper food.

155
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,660
And of course, you have to take the plane.

156
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,760
Is that clear?

157
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,920
Yes, I understand.

158
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,960
I'll prepare it.

159
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,740
I see.

160
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,940
That's good.

161
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,300
And about the price.

162
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,500
Since it's a 5-person group trip, we'll charge 30,000 yen per person.

163
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,280
30,000 yen?

164
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Yes, 30,000 yen.

165
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,500
You're so ridiculous.

166
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,040
It's impossible to pay 30,000 yen in the country at this time.

167
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,680
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

168
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,420
So, everyone who is passing by,

169
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,360
this is a fake business.

170
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,260
Everyone, please be careful not to get caught.

171
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,660
I got it. I got it.

172
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,120
So please stop.

173
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,400
Let's get 4 tickets.

174
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,880
Everyone who is passing by,

175
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,080
this is a fake business.

176
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,060
I got it. I got it.

177
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,460
I'll do it for 30,000 yen somehow.

178
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,380
What?

179
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,380
You should have said that from the beginning.

180
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,720
Hey, keep this trip's cost of 30,000 yen a secret from everyone.

181
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,860
Why?

182
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,040
Why?

183
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,580
I got it.

184
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,440
Y-Yes.

185
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,640
If you get caught, I'm sure you know what will happen.

186
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,740
Yes, I do.

187
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,460
If you pay 18,000 yen per person,

188
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,540
that's 90,000 yen for 5 people.

189
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,560
The cost is 180,000 yen, so it's half.

190
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,180
What?

191
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,520
Are you going on a trip without a ticket?

192
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,220
How about it?

193
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,560
But I have to go to Shirobaetai next month.

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,780
What's wrong with you?

195
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,080
You've been in hot springs for a long time.

196
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,180
Our trip is amazing.

197
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,760
It's a luxurious trip of 3 nights and 4 days to the south island.

198
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,080
Is it overseas?

199
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,100
It's amazing.

200
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,840
Yes, the south island is good.

201
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,580
If you get on a jet bike,

202
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,760
you'll be popular with a blonde lady in a bikini.

203
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,600
Oh.

204
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,240
I'm so excited!

205
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,580
You're an exciting boy!

206
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,120
I can't tell you how excited he is.

207
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,640
He's excited for his new friend.

208
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,100
Thank you, sir.

209
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,520
Excuse me.

210
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:01,600
Thank you, sir.

211
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,140
There's a man in the back.

212
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,180
It's a man!

213
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,120
What's wrong?

214
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,480
I didn't know?

215
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,120
It's a man!

216
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,700
$12,000 plus the actual cost of $30,000 plus my savings of $6,000 in three months.

217
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,320
In short, it's $126,000!

218
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,380
$126,000? That's a bit...

219
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,660
I see. It's a shame.

220
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,160
You and I are friends, so I called out to you alone.

221
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,200
No jet bikes, no gold hair!

222
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,460
I understand! I'll buy the equipment and prepare it!

223
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,740
I see! Great! I'll pay the debt with this!

224
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,500
Is he really okay?

225
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,200
He was in such a bad mood the other day.

226
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,300
That's right!

227
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,800
It's okay! It's okay!

228
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,300
Really?

229
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,200
He said he was tired of traveling with you the other day.

230
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,240
It's a shame.

231
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,980
He complained that he could travel to the southern island with that money with my help.

232
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,960
I think he should be more grateful.

233
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,920
That's right, chief.

234
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,000
That's right. I'm sorry, Ryotsu.

235
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,060
Well, I hope you understand.

236
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,100
What?

237
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,240
What are you doing here?

238
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,260
Well, let's continue our journey.

239
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,960
That's right.

240
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:12,960
Hey, manager!

241
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:13,840
I'm counting on you!

242
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,660
Yes, sir!

243
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,060
Everyone, please come this way.

244
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,860
Welcome!

245
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,400
Thank you!

246
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,980
That's it!

247
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,080
Why?

248
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,480
We will be in a separate seat from now on.

249
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,580
Separate seat?

250
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,780
Yes, sir!

251
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,800
By the way, I heard only you two were in a separate seat from now on.

252
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,360
You guys are in first class!

253
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,840
No, you are not.

254
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,780
That gentleman is...

255
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,140
Here we are again!

256
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,880
Well done, sir!

257
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,980
Hehehehe!

258
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,120
Uh, we're here to check out that plane service.

259
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,380
Oh, that flight, huh?

260
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:25,880
It's wonderful!

261
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,420
Please move completely.

262
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,240
Please be careful when you walk, okay?

263
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,120
Stop right there!

264
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,080
What's going on?

265
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,700
Since only five people were allowed to enter the inn,

266
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,340
the guests will be taken outside.

267
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,540
What? What do you mean outside?

268
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,420
You can catch them at the place you like, whether it's a beach or a beauty salon.

269
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:49,940
What?

270
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,460
Then you'll be taken outside, right?

271
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,720
We're guests, guests!

272
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,240
Even if you say that, what do you want?

273
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,680
Three!

274
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,420
You idiot!

275
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,420
Hey, Ryotsu, what are you mumbling about?

276
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,520
We're about to leave.

277
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm not mumbling!

278
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,220
If you don't hurry, you'll be late for the ride!

279
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,780
What?

280
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,200
Hey!

281
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,660
Don't fly!

282
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,480
Idiot!

283
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,920
What's that?

284
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,500
Who, you've got no później?

285
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,540
I was an old Japanese soldier that must've traveled the Zero Line.

286
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,840
Oh...

287
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,280
But I'm happy to see such a beautiful, Japanese guest,

288
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,520
so I'll have to give you a little gift.

289
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,860
Huh? A gift?

290
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,960
Don't you wonder what I look like in the old days?

291
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,900
What?

292
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,460
Hooray!

293
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,280
We're going home!

294
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,600
masukan kono

295
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,480
Damage Stuck!

296
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,260
Let's turn the card into cans!

297
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:13,880
Oh!

298
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,360
Ah! Senpai is down!

299
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,600
Oh, come on! He can hold out.

300
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,020
He'll follow you in a bit.

301
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,000
Good work. This is the destination, Otto Dokkoi Island.

302
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,980
Do you want to share the room first, or do you want to have a meal?

303
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,660
Meal! Meal!

304
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,400
The hotel is buying your job.

305
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,420
Why me again?

306
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,940
Because the staff is too much.

307
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,400
Is the hotel over there?

308
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,520
No, it's over there.

309
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,120
I don't understand.

310
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,880
It's a wonderful hotel.

311
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,940
We have arrived.

312
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,440
Hey, where are you going?

313
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,520
I'm sorry to be the last one to go to the bimboku.

314
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,820
I'll go to the restaurant first.

315
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,880
The viking is at this garden restaurant.

316
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,200
What?

317
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,860
Here it is.

318
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,500
Me, too!

319
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,280
I'm sorry, but this place is full of staff.

320
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,940
You like this place?

321
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,080
We have prepared the customers' portion over there.

322
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:40,640
What?

323
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,480
It's delicious.

324
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,780
It's wonderful.

325
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,540
The food is delicious.

326
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,540
There's nothing to say.

327
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,260
We have to thank the senior.

328
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,720
That's right.

329
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,320
By the way, where is he?

330
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,640
He is...

331
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,380
Why me again?

332
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,580
This is the place where you will stay.

333
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,920
Aren't you staying at that hotel?

334
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,340
The budget is too expensive.

335
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,520
But the inside is like a hotel, so don't worry.

336
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,360
Well, the room is divided into two.

337
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,720
The wife will stay alone and one will stay in the cottage.

338
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,040
And the other two will stay alone.

339
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,360
Wait, wait, there's one left.

340
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,980
I'm staying, too, so there are two left.

341
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,640
Wait! What are you going to do with those two?

342
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,680
They are prepared at Hanarekojima over there.

343
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,120
It's an optional Robinson Crusoe tour.

344
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,560
Oh.

345
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,540
Well, one is fine with both.

346
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,100
Why me?

347
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,800
The life in Hanarekojima is perfect for you who are separated from humans.

348
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,180
Yeah, yeah.

349
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,900
But what about the other one?

350
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,640
Hey, I'm not going yet.

351
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,300
Hey, the manager, do something.

352
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,180
Even if you tell me to do something, this is the most I can do.

353
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,140
Anyway, 30,000 yen for one person...

354
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,840
Idiot!

355
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,560
30,000 yen?

356
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,540
Ryochi, what do you mean by 30,000 yen?

357
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,520
The total amount is 48,000 yen, but...

358
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,260
You've already raised it to 30,000 yen.

359
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,480
You were going to do it, weren't you?

360
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,780
Senpai, you are so mean.

361
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,580
I can't even get 126,000 yen.

362
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,560
In total, 186,000 yen.

363
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,220
You were going to do it, weren't you?

364
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,620
Oh, that 18,000 yen is the amount of your debt.

365
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,500
6,000 yen is the amount of travel expenses for Ryo-chan.

366
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,780
Hmm...

367
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,710
Hmm...

368
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,400
Hmm...

369
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,600
Hmm...

370
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,700
Hmm...

371
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:49,880
Hmm...

372
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,940
Hmm...

373
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,200
Hmm...

374
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,100
Hmm...

375
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,860
Don't you know that I'll pay for it.

376
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,360
Why?

377
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,740
Don't you know that I'll pay for it?

378
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,840
Why do you want me to pay for it?

379
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,120
Because I have the highest cost of the expenses.

380
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,540
Because I have the highest cost of the expenses.

381
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:01,920
Don't you get it?

382
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,660
Because you lost in the 'Janken' game.

383
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,380
.

384
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,000
Will you really let me stay at this island?

385
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,400
Um...

386
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,140
Yes.

387
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,260
Use this, please.

388
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,480
What?

389
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,820
Isn't it a hammock?

390
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,640
Then I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

391
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,960
Hey, what about the rice?

392
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
Please look for it properly.

393
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:45,220
It's an island with nothing.

394
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,640
That's right.

395
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,120
Then, let's sleep comfortably.

396
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,160
That's right.

397
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,960
Then, let's sleep comfortably.

398
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,520
Senpai, please wake up.

399
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,880
Senpai, Senpai, wake up!

400
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,520
Senpai, Senpai, wake up!

401
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:30,760
Senpai, it's terrible.

402
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,020
What the hell is this?

403
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,420
Why are you in the sea?

404
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,460
I'm sure it's a man-tongue.

405
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,640
I see.

406
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,900
That's why you gave me a hammock.

407
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,860
You bastard.

408
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,480
You bastard.

409
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,600
Uh-oh.

410
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,640
I'm saved.

411
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,040
But Senpai, you can't move your body.

412
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm saved.

413
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,020
What's wrong?

414
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,200
You have a strange feeling?

415
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,200
Senpai!

416
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,620
I'm saved.

417
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,360
HONDA!

418
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:51,560
HONDA!

419
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:51,800
Do something!

420
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,080
HONDA!

421
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,620
I'm saved.

422
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,720
But what are we going to do now?

423
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,060
That's our luggage.

424
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,980
Lucky!

425
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,340
Ready...

426
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:17,700
Go!

427
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,240
HONDA, be gentler.

428
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,700
Yes.

429
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,860
No, not there.

430
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,760
Not there.

431
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,840
Not there.

432
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:25,880
Not there.

433
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,580
Cheers!

434
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,240
Cheers!

435
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,760
Cheers!

436
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:40,820
Cheers!

437
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,720
Cheers!

438
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,660
Cheers!

439
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,400
Cheers!

440
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,640
Cheers!

441
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:53,940
Thanks!

442
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,460
Cheers!

443
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,320
Cheers!

444
00:19:59,720 --> 00:19:59,900
Cheers!

445
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,140
Cheers!

446
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,260
Cheers!

447
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:02,360
Cheers!

448
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:02,760
Cheers!

449
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,060
Cheers!

450
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,180
Here we are, Phuket.

451
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,520
7 nights, 8 days.

452
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,940
Your wife must be happy about it.

453
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,540
Yes, she is.

454
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,440
It's been a fun vacation trip.

455
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,820
It's because I made Ryotsu an island.

456
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,040
But poor thing.

457
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,260
Are Ryo and his friends doing well?

458
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,620
Yes.

459
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,300
Oh?

460
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,320
That island, I'm sure, was...

461
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,560
...a bit bigger in the daytime.

462
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,500
When it's full of fish, it sinks more than half.

463
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,400
What?

464
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,020
Are the seniors all right?

465
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,880
That person is all right, I suppose.

466
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,400
I don't think they've told us anything.

467
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,360
Oh?

468
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,080
Did I forget to tell them?

469
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,760
Hmph.

470
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,680
That's a big excuse for threatening me.

471
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,940
I'll have to suffer a little.

472
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,040
That's bad.

473
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,220
What?

474
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,780
I'm sure they'll turn us upside down and do something.

475
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,500
Giggle.

476
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,740
Oh, there!

477
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,260
There!

478
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,460
It's a curse.

479
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,840
Buchi...

480
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,480
Koro.

481
00:20:59,500 --> 00:20:59,660
Ro..

482
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,420
Su.

483
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,780
hallucinating...?

484
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,000
That really is bad.

485
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,700
A-A-A-A-A-A-A...

486
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,140
.

487
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,360
.

488
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,240
.

489
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,640
.

490
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,100
Damn it!

491
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,280
Attack! I'll tear down the entire cottage!

492
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,460
Yes sir!

493
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,420
The enemy is still sleeping. Let's go.

494
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,220
Yes sir.

495
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,700
It's a banana!

496
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,560
A goat!

497
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,440
You're following me, aren't you, senior?

498
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:57,920
Yes!

499
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,100
It's corn!

500
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,720
Attack!

501
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,740
You're following me, aren't you, senior?

502
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,500
Yes!

503
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,060
It's a lobster!

504
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,740
Attack!

505
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,860
Hey, Honda, isn't that strange?

506
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,220
Look!

507
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,580
It's moving away from the cottage.

508
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,900
It's true!

509
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,720
This is a trap.

510
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,780
A trap?

511
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,200
It's a trick the chief is thinking of.

512
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,780
It won't work!

513
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,580
Let's go, Honda!

514
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,900
It's a 100-yen coin!

515
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,120
A 100-yen coin!

516
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,100
Huh?

517
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,520
There are a lot of coins here and there!

518
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,600
I'm so lucky!

519
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,320
I'm so lucky!

520
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,080
Senior, money is more like a trap!

521
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,580
I don't care about the trap!

522
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,020
It's a motorcycle handle!

523
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,580
It's a fork and a tank!

524
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,760
I'm so lucky!

525
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,740
I'm so lucky!

526
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,820
I'm so lucky!

527
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,380
I'm so lucky!

528
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,040
I'm so lucky!

529
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,280
I'm so lucky!

530
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,780
I'm so lucky!

531
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:51,840
I'm so lucky!

532
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,480
I'm so lucky!

533
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,620
I'm so lucky!

534
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,820
It's a 10,000 yen machine!

535
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,380
I'm a genius!

536
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,440
You seriously got caught, Ryosuke!

537
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,440
Chief!

538
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,180
I didn't know you'd get caught in such a simple trap.

539
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,080
Hey, why haven't you changed?

540
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,060
Get out of there!

541
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,280
Silence!

542
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,960
You're company assigned to Cojima!

543
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,760
We'll certainly catch you four!

544
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,780
I want you to remember that!

545
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,780
What a poor thing.

546
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,040
But I feel sorry for him.

547
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,760
Well, if you cool your head a little,

548
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,840
I'll call you back for dinner.

549
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,460
What are you going to do next time you make something like this?

550
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,580
If this happens, it's war.

551
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,340
I'll definitely take the cottage apart!

552
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:50,740
I'll take the cottage apart!

553
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
It's looking good.

554
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,780
Ryouchi, something to deliver.

555
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,100
Ryouchi, something to deliver.

556
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,640
What's that? It's Omu.

557
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,960
Ryouchi, something to deliver.

558
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,840
What's this?

559
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,440
Hey, can you hear me?

560
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,240
It's the chief's voice.

561
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,040
It's a wire phone.

562
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,960
I can hear you.

563
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:20,480
Please.

564
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,360
Ryouchi, did you reflect on yourself?

565
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,080
Then, I'll cook you an afternoon meal with a barbecue.

566
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,580
It's your call.

567
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,660
It's okay.

568
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,220
Stop being so obstinate.

569
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,240
If you stop here tonight,

570
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,220
we can do it all over by rock-paper-scissors.

571
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:34,860
Please.

572
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:35,860
Thank you.

573
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,740
If you stand in front of me

574
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,260
and apologize for a painful incident,

575
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,200
I can think it over, but please.

576
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,160
What did you say?

577
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,020
Stop being so obnoxious!

578
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:45,840
What are you doing?

579
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,240
He's such a child.

580
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,800
It's such a hard day's work.

581
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,620
I'll be fine as long as I enjoy myself here.

582
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,900
Forget about him!

583
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,200
Damn you! You monte of a Chief!

584
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,160
Wanna attack us?

585
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,320
No, I'll just put up a guerrilla front!

586
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,000
Let's just protect Negura for now!

587
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,040
*de jazz music*

588
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,720
There is a perfect hole for digging.

589
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,820
*footsteps*

590
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,260
Ah it's so ... cold.....

591
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,560
*footsteps*

592
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,340
What is this?

593
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,620
*footsteps*

594
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Is it some kind of military factory or something?

595
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,180
*footsteps*

596
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,580
*footsteps*

597
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,860
Oh?

598
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,920
What's that?

599
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,720
It's a gold coin!

600
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,600
Yahoo!

601
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,660
"O-Hara"

602
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,440
Mr. Ohara! Mr. Ohara!

603
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,460
Hm?

604
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,340
A fax for you has arrived at the hotel.

605
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,020
It's from the director.

606
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,640
Mr. Ohara, you are not allowed to go on holiday.

607
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,840
"Actually, I found a fake coin today..."

608
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,020
"I found a fake coin..."

609
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,340
"and I was selling it at a store in the city of Gokubo..."

610
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,640
"I managed to arrest the criminal group."

611
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,680
"In the news of the murder, the fake coin factory..."

612
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,840
"is at the little island where you are going..."

613
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,300
"and the gold coin is floating on the lake."

614
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,280
What?

615
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,980
It's the island where Ryo is staying.

616
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,680
"The special mission officer, Dolphin Deka..."

617
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,740
"is going to arrive at the same place at 3:00."

618
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,960
"So, let's meet and find the factory..."

619
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,540
"and find the fake coin of the evidence building."

620
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,240
Right.

621
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,220
"Dolphin Deka?

622
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,320
A dolphin? I have a bad feeling about this.

623
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,420
There was a time when they said it was a sea turtle.

624
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,980
Could it be a dolphin?

625
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,420
It's possible.

626
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,580
The sea here is far. Why do they come here?

627
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,640
Isn't it an airplane like us?

628
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,580
But I can't feel any sign at all.

629
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,220
Oh, what?

630
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,500
It's a submarine.

631
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,260
Could it be that it's in such a place?

632
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,040
It looks like a small ship.

633
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,960
I have a bad feeling about this.

634
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,360
Oh, my.

635
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,340
"I love the sea and protect justice. Who called it? Who called it? Poseidon."

636
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,780
"I'll put it in my tank. I'll put it in my tank."

637
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,080
"I'm the captain of the Marine Police Force, Umino Dozaemon."

638
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,200
"The big and strong cut is trademarked. Dolphin, big and strong."

639
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,880
Chief, what's that?

640
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,660
"The big and strong cut is trademarked, Dolphin, big and strong."

641
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,300
Oh, you know the big and strong cut?

642
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,960
"The land is a great big one,"

643
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,860
"The sky is a moon big one,"

644
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,620
"And the sea is this Dolphin big one."

645
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,920
"This is the best three big ones in Japan."

646
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,860
Is he really a detective?

647
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,520
"I'm sorry to hear this, but you should see this."

648
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,940
"You are a warrior."

649
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,320
I'm sorry for that.

650
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,200
"I am a lawyer."

651
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,900
It's an illusion that starts only on hot days like today when crime increases.

652
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,300
Shouldn't it be an illusion as it is?

653
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,340
Hmm...

654
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,140
What is the water police force?

655
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,520
Good question.

656
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,940
It's not just one person, but five other people.

657
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,580
What? Five people?

658
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,220
I don't want to imagine it.

659
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,740
Hmm...

660
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,260
Hmm...

661
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,260
The Dolphin Squad, start!

662
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,740
It's a dolphin!

663
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,500
This is before I woke up.

664
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,460
I was a former dolphin teacher,

665
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,580
a glass craftsman, and a manga artist, and grew up.

666
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,980
Let's go home.

667
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,740
Kwa!

668
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,720
Even a spring can be made.

669
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,200
999,900 yen.

670
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,480
100,000,000 yen.

671
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,820
1, 999,969,999,

672
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,120
1, 999,969,999,

673
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,280
1, 999,969,999,

674
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,980
100,000,000!

675
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,600
Wow! There are 100,000,000 pieces too!

676
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,240
10,000,000 yen per piece x 100,000,000,

677
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,420
1, 10,100,000,000,

678
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:00,820
1, 100,000,000,000,

679
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,760
10,100,000,000,

680
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,280
10,100,000,000,

681
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:02,380
10,000,000,000,

682
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,440
1,000,000,000 yen.

683
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,000
But, senior.

684
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,020
Senpai, what are you going to do with this gold coin?

685
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,880
Of course, I'm going to take it!

686
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,560
That's a crime, isn't it?

687
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,520
It's worse to leave it here.

688
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,460
But we're police officers.

689
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,080
I'm not going to be a cop.

690
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,600
I'm not going to quit.

691
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,600
I won't be able to ride on the white horse.

692
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,620
That's too bad.

693
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,120
With this much money,

694
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,640
you can buy a hundred motorcycles.

695
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,560
Eh?

696
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,400
I'll follow you, senpai!

697
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,580
I'll follow you, senpai!

698
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,000
I see!

699
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,620
Alright!

700
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,460
I'll buy this gold coin and make a Harlem!

701
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,880
Yes!

702
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:42,940
Eh?

703
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,060
Huh?

704
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,700
Huh?

705
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:46,920
Huh?

706
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,000
Eh?

707
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:49,980
Who is it?

708
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,020
What is it?

709
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,660
Is it a chimpanzee?

710
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,300
But it seems like it's angry.

711
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,180
It seems like it's going to leave this place as its own.

712
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,540
It seems like it's asking me to get out of here.

713
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,820
You're so cheeky, even though you're a chimpanzee!

714
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,780
This gold coin is mine!

715
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,420
I'm going to get out!

716
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,060
Ouch!

717
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,180
Ouch!

718
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,520
Ouch!

719
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:23,980
Ouch!

720
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,260
Ouch!

721
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,760
You bastard!

722
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:28,620
Ouch!

723
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,020
Ouch!

724
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:31,920
Ouch!

725
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,440
Ouch!

726
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,740
Ouch!

727
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,380
Ouch!

728
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,320
Ouch!

729
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,500
Ouch!

730
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,480
Ouch!

731
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,220
Ouch!

732
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,000
Ouch!

733
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,360
Ouch!

734
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,640
Ouch!

735
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,000
Ouch!

736
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,420
Ouch!

737
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:50,740
Ouch!

738
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,340
Ouch!

739
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,460
Ouch!

740
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,000
Ouch!

741
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,420
There's a gold and silver factory on that island, huh?

742
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,720
Yes.

743
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,380
Probably.

744
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:02,940
Good!

745
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,500
Let's claim the gold with the

746
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,340
It's a little...

747
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:06,380
Good!

748
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,140
Could you wait a little longer?

749
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,460
Why?

750
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,760
Actually, a fool who said farewell to a fight...

751
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,700
No, a subordinate of mine is hiding in that island.

752
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,500
Then leave it to me.

753
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,080
Masukaho!

754
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,680
I-I'll try to persuade him somehow, so please wait until then.

755
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,700
All right.

756
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
Please wait a little longer.

757
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:40,880
Masukaho!

758
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,760
Ryotsu!

759
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,580
What are you doing here, sir?

760
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,140
Ryotsu, I'm sorry.

761
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,860
You can give me a piece of cotton.

762
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,600
I can do anything with my bare hands, so please come home.

763
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,860
You're quite different from what you are now.

764
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,300
Maybe...

765
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,620
I've already found out about the gold.

766
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,980
You don't need to do anything else.

767
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,400
The chief's naked body is also disgusting, so it's fine.

768
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,820
Look, Ryotsu.

769
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,520
If you leave that island, I'll give you 10,000 yen.

770
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,280
How about that?

771
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,380
I don't need that kind of money.

772
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,880
It's strange that you're giving me 10,000 yen.

773
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,960
I think you've already found the gold.

774
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,500
I'm sure I have.

775
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,680
It's a big trouble.

776
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,700
Ryotsu, that gold...

777
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:31,680
Gold?

778
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,540
You knew about it, didn't you?

779
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:35,980
I don't have any gold.

780
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,240
You're not going to give me any gold!

781
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,900
You do it, too!

782
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,180
Yes, sir!

783
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,460
I won't give you any gold, or I'll become the chief!

784
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,040
Got it!

785
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,860
I'm going to prepare for their counterattack.

786
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,320
Yes, sir!

787
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,420
They're so pitiful.

788
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:56,760
No one's here.

789
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,780
Now it's my turn.

790
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,840
Hurry up!

791
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,660
We have to protect the gold!

792
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,400
I'm ready!

793
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,800
I'm the opponent this time!

794
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,080
Yeah, you're here already.

795
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,640
Huh?

796
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,540
What? There's no one here.

797
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,580
That's strange.

798
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,140
Huh?

799
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,060
Huh?

800
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,520
Whoa!

801
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,100
It's a submarine!

802
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,720
Oh.

803
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,140
It's pretty small.

804
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,020
It's a Plamo, right?

805
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,200
You're the one who called me a "lion"?

806
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,500
That's right! Who are you to call me that?

807
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,360
I love you and protect justice.

808
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,260
Who called you?

809
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:55,680
Who called you?

810
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,900
Who called you, Poseidon?

811
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,640
I'm going to put you in my tank!

812
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,160
I'm going to put you in my tank!

813
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,280
I'm the captain of the Marine Corps, Umino Dozaemon.

814
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,160
The small one is the trademark of a Dolphin!

815
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,180
The factory's too long.

816
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,060
The proud one...

817
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,060
No, no, no...

818
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,020
You have to stand...

819
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,700
You have to...

820
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,320
You have to...

821
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,280
I will protect you!

822
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,740
You won't get away with this!

823
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,040
Dolphin time!

824
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,440
What a dolphin!

825
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,240
It's no real dolphin.

826
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,300
Wow!

827
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,240
Yow-yow-yow...

828
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,720
No, that's not what I meant!

829
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:46,840
Yes sir!

830
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,800
What kind of game are you going to show us this time?

831
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,540
It's a grenade!

832
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:58,920
No!

833
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,620
It's no use running away!

834
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,140
It's no use running away!

835
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,460
It's a missile!

836
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,780
If it's a dolphin, then it's a chimpanzee!

837
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,180
It's strange.

838
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,080
Why is it exploding?

839
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,100
Pull it! Pull it more!

840
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,380
Go!

841
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,260
Run!

842
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,560
Go!

843
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,660
The enemy is also a missile!

844
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:49,920
Retreat!

845
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,580
No!

846
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,480
Ginga, you can't be hit!

847
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,420
What kind of enemy is there?

848
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,080
Ryo-chan and Mr. Honda are just two.

849
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,220
That's impossible.

850
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,220
I saw 50, no, 100 people.

851
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,400
No way.

852
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,260
It's not a coincidence.

853
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:04,920
Ryo-chan...

854
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,400
No.

855
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,740
Enough!

856
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,700
We won't leave without you!

857
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,300
Then let's ask for support.

858
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,880
Support?

859
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:12,600
!

860
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,580
!

861
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,500
!

862
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,660
6 years later

863
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,420
We're in a big trouble.

864
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,400
What's the matter?

865
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,460
Is something up here?

866
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,420
I don't know.

867
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,460
I don't know. I don't know.

868
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,600
While you are attacking, I will land and conquer the island.

869
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,380
Very well.

870
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,900
I don't know if it's a drift or a dolphin, but it's not a big deal.

871
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,880
But someone else is attacking us.

872
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,200
Don't worry. Don't worry. Leave it to me.

873
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,220
It's the American Harrier.

874
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,580
The American Harrier

875
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,540
Are you going to fight the army this time?

876
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,460
You bastard!

877
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,480
Alright! Not yet!

878
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,300
Now, Honda!

879
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,020
Not yet!

880
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
Not yet!

881
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:44,000
I won't let you get away with this!

882
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,120
If you steal this, you'll get this.

883
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,280
I've made the plumber, but how can I control it?

884
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,020
You bastard!

885
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,440
Take this!

886
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,080
I won't let you get away with this!

887
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,240
Look at my skills that I've trained at the game center yesterday!

888
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,880
Tenshi!

889
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,440
This is bad.

890
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,820
Captain!

891
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,140
What's going on?

892
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,140
I've figured out a lot of tricks.

893
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,620
I've found the enemy aircraft carrier!

894
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,540
It's not easy to splash two planes in a blink of an eye.

895
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,820
Captain! The Harrier that was taken by the enemy is coming!

896
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,720
Ready for Arafx and C Sparrow!

897
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,560
Fire!

898
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,800
Come on! The round's about to hit the coast!

899
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:26,280
Did you see that?

900
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,460
Don't get close!

901
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,300
communion!

902
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,300
It's too..

903
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,940
What is it?

904
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,120
Berserker!

905
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,460
The mission went to failure.

906
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,640
Where is the escape device?

907
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,840
Where is it?

908
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,960
It's here.

909
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,060
What?!

910
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,060
I'm coming.

911
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,560
Alright, I'm landing.

912
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,500
You're stuck in a swamp, you idiot!

913
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,200
That's right, you're an idiot!

914
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,300
You're going to get a free bucket!

915
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,880
You're going to get my bucket!

916
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,180
I'm going to get your bucket!

917
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,260
Ouch!

918
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,700
Damn you!

919
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,500
Oh!

920
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,660
A small object is approaching in the abyss.

921
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,500
Achoo!

922
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,040
What is it, a roundabout!!

923
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,720
I'll attack immediately, but first you should pass through here, give me a hand!

924
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,760
If you're going to resist that much, then...

925
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,780
Just give it up!

926
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,940
This gap!

927
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,760
Look, it's more of a fire than that.

928
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,240
What?

929
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,760
Press the ignition button.

930
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,740
This?

931
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,680
Yes.

932
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,340
What did you press?

933
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,880
As you said, the ignition.

934
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,380
It's the fishing button.

935
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,460
You've never even hit me, have you?

936
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,680
Sorry, sorry.

937
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,420
It's flooded.

938
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:49,540
It's too much.

939
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,220
Ugen, speed up.

940
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,260
It's the fishing rod.

941
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,320
What?

942
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,480
This is...

943
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,160
Splendid.

944
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,980
It's a great shot.

945
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,000
We're in danger!

946
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,300
We've sunk the aircraft carrier.

947
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,900
This is terrible.

948
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,340
The US Navy won't keep quiet about this.

949
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,500
Exit 182

950
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,060
We're a big way on the front of the ship!

951
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,340
What are your thoughts?

952
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:43,760
It's all right.

953
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,400
Let's hear from him.

954
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,500
I'm stuck again!

955
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,080
Senpai!

956
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,160
That's a good book! Give it to me!

957
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,880
That's not all! Look at that!

958
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:57,940
Huh?

959
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,280
What's with that big gun?

960
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:29,700
The Island

961
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,460
The origin of the island is gone.

962
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,640
Ryo-chan must have fallen on the southern island.

963
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,840
Ryo-chan...

964
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,420
Oh, look at that!

965
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,660
Oh! Mr. Honda and Dolphin Deka!

966
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,960
Amazing! They're alive!

967
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,460
Where's Ryo-chan?

968
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,740
Ryo-chan? Ryo-chan is alive too!

969
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:46,520
What?

970
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,200
If you disappear, you'll be a burden to the world.

971
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,040
I'm sorry.

972
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,100
Ryo-chan,

973
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,420
they're asking you to pay for the fighter that was blown up by the sinking aircraft carrier.

974
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,160
What did you say?

975
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,900
You'll have to pay for the hotel's cost.

976
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:09,920
I don't know.

977
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,660
You're also responsible for asking the Navy for support.

978
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,740
No way.

979
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,380
I know.

980
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,680
You just have to pay.

981
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,320
Pay?

982
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,700
You're going to pay?

983
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,300
Where did you get that money?

984
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,180
There's a gold coin worth 1 billion yen here.

985
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,160
I'll pay you with this.

986
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,480
This coin is fake.

987
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,400
You're making fun of me again.

988
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,880
I'm not lying. This is real.

989
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,460
If you compare it, you'll see.

990
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,420
Oh! The Queen Elizabeth is red-faced!

991
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,300
I can't help it.

992
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,760
I'll take care of it myself.

993
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,300
Yeah.

994
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:50,920
I haven't gotten tired.

995
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,280
I couldn't sleep well.

996
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,840
I became a flying giant.

997
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,740
Ryo-chan and Honda-san,

998
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,320
I wonder when they'll be able to come home.

999
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:00,760
Stop it.

1000
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,020
My head starts to hurt.

1001
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,160
Damn it.

1002
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,340
Why do I have to do this when I'm abroad?

1003
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,080
Mr. Ryotsu,

1004
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,260
we need to motivate him.

1005
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,420
Like that guy.

1006
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,460
Wolf,

1007
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:18,480
Luffy!

1008
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,320
Next up is a big jump!

1009
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,960
Hey, Ryotsu-san, I don't think we can pay the debt back anytime soon.

1010
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:31,800
I know!

1011
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,340
Done!

1012
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,720
What am I doing?

1013
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,040
I hate traveling abroad!
