1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,520
What to Do in a Night Chair

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,380
Take a look at the room with the TV and stand away!

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:23,780
♪ Come to me if you're not rich!

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,620
♪ I'm not too rich but I'm always worried

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:35,920
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,640
I'm sure they'll be alright

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm sure they'll be alright

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,400
Come to me if you're jobless

9
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,460
I'm not here, but don't worry

10
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,440
Look, the red moon is burning

11
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,560
The red moon is burning

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:11,620
The red moon is burning

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,980
The red moon is burning

14
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,240
I'm sure they'll be alright

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,100
I'm sure they'll be alright

16
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,540
I'm sure they'll be alright

17
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,080
Come to me if you're jobless

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,620
I'm sure they'll be alright

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm sure they'll be alright

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,880
I'm sure they'll be alright

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:42,760
I'm sure they'll be alright

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,560
I'm sure they'll be alright

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,500
I'm sure they'll be alright

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,960
I'm sure they'll be alright

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,060
Oh, it's quite a famous hotel.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,560
The octopus dishes are very delicious.

27
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,180
Yes, that's the final destination.

28
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,780
Wait a minute.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,760
Normally, Tanji decides where to go on a first-person trip.

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,500
Why do you decide without consulting me?

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,340
I don't know where to take you if you decide.

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,380
Previously, I used my travel expenses and was deceived by the tourist tour.

33
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,980
I was taken to a mountain that I didn't know why.

34
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,280
If you leave it to Ryo, it won't be a good thing.

35
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,220
Then, what should I do?

36
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,300
If you have a destination, there is nothing to do.

37
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,980
There are many things to do.

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,880
Handling of transportation, confirmation of departure, printing on the same day.

39
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,620
And the travel expenses.

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,280
That's me and the director.

41
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,400
I'll give you the money.

42
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,920
Don't use it up.

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,360
Yes, yes, I understand.

44
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,260
Then I'll go to the library.

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,900
Thank you for your hard work.

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,700
Octopus dishes, huh?

47
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,200
I'm looking forward to it.

48
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,640
I've eaten once, but the octopus dishes there are excellent.

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,120
It's just octopus.

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,340
Ryo, why don't you write something on the envelope so that you don't use it up?

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,160
Yes, yes.

52
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,180
Octopus...

53
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,540
Bobi, are you going on a trip?

54
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:29,900
Yeah.

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,620
All the staff, including Atami.

56
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,460
It's a waste to come to Japan.

57
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,020
It's just a stupid method of going to eat octopus.

58
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,240
Originally, I decided to go to Kanji, so I had no choice but to collect the expenses.

59
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,120
To be honest, how is this kind of travel?

60
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,340
Everyone...

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,300
Senpai, you drank too much~

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,300
Shut up!

63
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,420
Why did you even bother coming all the way to Atami Kunari to eat octopus?

64
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,900
That's impossible!

65
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,280
Eh? Octopus-H compassion!

66
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,860
This hurts...!

67
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,980
Ryo, you sure are rough.

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,660
Yeah. Apparently, he didn't like his woven path that he decided on by himself.

69
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,520
Ryo, let's just drink tonight!

70
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,260
We can hang out 'til morning~

71
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,520
What to do~!

72
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:17,720
I see!

73
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,580
Alright, I'll take it!

74
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,340
Yay!

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,240
I don't give a shit about octopus!

76
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,940
Ryo-san, Ryo-san!

77
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,760
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

78
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,940
Do you have money?

79
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,180
Money?

80
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,840
Let me see...

81
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,480
Let me see...

82
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,600
Uh...

83
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,260
Oh, this is a lot!

84
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,020
What? Octopus?

85
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,760
What do you mean octopus?

86
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,060
Oh, oh!

87
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,700
It's the prize money from last month's octopus-frying tournament!

88
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,980
Now, Sakonji, Barba, and I will drink it up!

89
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,980
Oh, that's fast...

90
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,600
Bring me a big bottle of sake!

91
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,060
Hey, Ryo-san...

92
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,320
I have a lot of money!

93
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,860
Thank you very much!

94
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,940
The morning sun is so bright!

95
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,320
It's a cool morning!

96
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,060
You really drank until the morning, didn't you?

97
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,220
Ryutsu, what's wrong with your emotions?

98
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,060
No, I was lucky enough to have the prize money from the octopus-frying tournament.

99
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,480
What?

100
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,300
I think you drank it on the night of the octopus-frying tournament, didn't you?

101
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,020
That's right. I drank it with Ryutsu's prize money.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,160
It's not enough, so we all took out a little.

103
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,100
Then, what about this money?

104
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,600
Ryo-chan, write something in your envelope so you don't use it up.

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,880
Hey, hey, octopus...

106
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,160
Oh, it's the cost of the accommodation trip!

107
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,740
What? Did you spend the money for the trip?

108
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,540
What are you going to do, Ryutsu?

109
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,200
Huh?

110
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,060
It's finally time, Ohara-kun.

111
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,720
It's finally time, Chacha.

112
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,380
Oh, this kind of dish comes out.

113
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,260
They say you only use freshly caught octopus.

114
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,820
I'm looking forward to it!

115
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,620
But why are they gathering on the dock?

116
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,980
Are they going by boat?

117
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,720
I don't know.

118
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,260
I can't see the boat for that matter, but...

119
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,900
It's about time to depart, isn't it?

120
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,300
This is...

121
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,580
A submarine?

122
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,480
Look at that.

123
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,980
The "Katsushikasho Goikko-sama"?

124
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,960
No way...

125
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,460
Oh, everyone!

126
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,380
Sorry to keep you waiting!

127
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,920
Ryutsu, what's going on here?

128
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,320
Are you really going to go with that?

129
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,560
Of course.

130
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,880
The main part of this trip is octopus.

131
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,140
So I've prepared a submarine to let everyone taste the feeling of octopus.

132
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,960
How about it?

133
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,700
It's a good idea, isn't it?

134
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,100
I'm sorry, Jody.

135
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,640
I'm sorry for asking you to do this.

136
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,820
Oh, no!

137
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,700
If you can travel with Bobby, I'll gladly cooperate with you!

138
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,100
I'll be glad to.

139
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,860
All right, everyone's on board!

140
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,940
Yeah.

141
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,120
Then, let's go!

142
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:53,680
Now, everyone!

143
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,300
Do it fast!

144
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,460
Even if you say so...

145
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,560
It's too quiet to go home and calm down.

146
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,780
I don't think you can see the outside.

147
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,080
Oh, that's right.

148
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,960
Click!

149
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,560
This is a video of a submarine camera.

150
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,420
It's a simple sight.

151
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,200
I'm just excited just looking at it.

152
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,000
Ryutsu, I have a simple question.

153
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,740
How much does it cost to rent a submarine like this?

154
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,780
How much does it cost to rent a submarine like this?

155
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,600
That's right!

156
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,680
I have a karaoke ready!

157
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,940
Let's have a karaoke tournament!

158
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,980
Hey, Eriho-tsu!

159
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,660
Well, let me sing first.

160
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,680
Bad guys have a big robot punch.

161
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,100
Throw it to the end of the world.

162
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,740
No, no!

163
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,860
Bad guys have a big robot punch.

164
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,260
Throw it to the end of the world.

165
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,200
All this time, it's gone.

166
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,020
What?!

167
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,080
Bang! Bang! Ba-bang!

168
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,320
Bang! Bang! Bang!

169
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:08,400
Bang! Bang! Ba-bang!

170
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,900
Bang! Bang! Ba-bang!

171
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,940
I've done it along with you.

172
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,240
This is a big robot punch.

173
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,860
5 minutes later

174
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,080
Here we are.

175
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,240
An Atami!

176
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,620
But it's far from the beach.

177
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,500
It's just a few miles away, so it can't be any closer.

178
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,180
How do we get to the hotel?

179
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,300
Don't worry.

180
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,040
This way.

181
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,500
7. Shaking aやん

182
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,220
Are we going on rubber boats?

183
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,540
Yes.

184
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,460
11. Fire

185
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,100
Now everyone.

186
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,380
Let's make a fire!

187
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,800
Turns out...

188
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,500
coming on a而已n trip and getting burned off a boat

189
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,440
is as bad as Normandy landing.

190
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,720
All of them have bad ideas!

191
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,060
12. Hotel

192
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,480
This is a wonderful hotel!

193
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,440
This is wonderful.

194
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,000
Wow, it's beautiful.

195
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:25,940
It's wonderful.

196
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,240
Ryotsu, please guide us to the room.

197
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,040
I'm tired of the boat ride just now.

198
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,760
Ryotsu.

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,800
I'm ready.

200
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,100
I see.

201
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,980
Let's go to the hotel.

202
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,460
This is the hotel.

203
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,300
This is luxurious.

204
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,460
It's wonderful.

205
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:48,680
It's wonderful.

206
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:55,920
It's a long walk.

207
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,340
Ryo, are you still here?

208
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,900
It's almost there.

209
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,560
Are we going out?

210
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,980
We're going to stay at the inn.

211
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,580
Inn.

212
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,960
Here we are.

213
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,900
It's a wonderful hotel.

214
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,080
The main building behind us.

215
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,000
It's a different building from the inn.

216
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,880
That's why I said it was a different building.

217
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,020
Hey.

218
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,760
You're telling me to stay here?

219
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,880
I also complained to the hotel, but they didn't accept me at all.

220
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,260
What do you mean, Ryo?

221
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:41,460
In fact, in recent years, there have been many cases of group guests causing trouble to other customers by making a fuss in the hotel.

222
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,600
I see.

223
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,960
To avoid such a situation,

224
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,960
From this year, all group guests will be in the hotel.

225
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,220
Then you can stay here.

226
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,420
Huh?

227
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,660
No way.

228
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,280
I can't believe you're such a liar.

229
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,040
It's quiet.

230
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,880
What's this?

231
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,340
A dirty room.

232
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,760
After coming here to eat octopus, I didn't expect to stay in an octopus room.

233
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,280
What a terrible room.

234
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,620
Ryotsu, you must be having a proper meal.

235
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,300
We're here to enjoy octopus cooking.

236
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,340
Of course. I'm cooking right now.

237
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,080
Cooking?

238
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,020
No, cooking.

239
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,900
I'm cooking right now.

240
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,920
The top chefs at the hotel.

241
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,760
You're not going to catch any?

242
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,280
I have to get enough octopus by the time of the dinner.

243
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,820
Chief, we're here in Atami, so let's go to the hot spring before the dinner.

244
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,060
That sounds good. Let's go together.

245
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,880
Ryotsu, there's a bath, right?

246
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,920
Of course.

247
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,980
The bath is here.

248
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,400
What's this?

249
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,220
The customers of the other side are going to be here.

250
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,460
As I said earlier, the group customers are causing trouble.

251
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,980
What's that?

252
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,660
It's not a joke. We're paying for the hotel.

253
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,820
Why do we have to go to such a place?

254
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,600
This is the hotel's policy.

255
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,820
I don't agree with that policy.

256
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,480
We should be serious about this.

257
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,800
Isn't that right, Chief?

258
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,700
Yes.

259
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,820
That's gross.

260
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,220
Let's go to the front.

261
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,560
That's right, that's right.

262
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,520
The bath is the only thing that can be used in the main hall.

263
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,060
I was told so.

264
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,940
Let me show you the way.

265
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,360
There are so many people here.

266
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,020
If we're fair, we can hide in the bath.

267
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,660
Now, everyone, here we are.

268
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,960
Please come in.

269
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,620
It's a public bath.

270
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,720
This is a wind dragon.

271
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,480
What?

272
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,640
Mr. Ryo, that is a woman.

273
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,280
It's not a ghost marriage.

274
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,080
From time to time, the outlet is split into men and women,

275
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,700
and the hot spring is on the inside.

276
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,720
Sir, what should we do?

277
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,620
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

278
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,260
You've seen this place the last time.

279
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,280
It's the king, so just stay calm.

280
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,080
Hey!

281
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,080
Hello, hello.

282
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm coming in, miss.

283
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,480
What?

284
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,600
You're Mr. Hondara!

285
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,300
What? It's been a long time.

286
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,560
What are you doing here?

287
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,320
I've been staying at a hondara camp for a week.

288
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,620
What? Camp?

289
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:35,820
Camp?

290
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,640
Hey, Ryotsu!

291
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,540
Can we go there, too?

292
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,520
No.

293
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,980
If they find out that we're staying here,

294
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,280
they'll find out that we're in a different camp.

295
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,280
What? You're in a different camp, too?

296
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,520
Come here!

297
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,120
Stop!

298
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,980
What is he doing?

299
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,500
Let go!

300
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,500
H-Hey!

301
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,520
What are you doing?

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,280
You're all warmed up, right?

303
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,360
Get out of the bath!

304
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,580
What do you mean, "Get out"?

305
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,240
I'm just worried about you moving around.

306
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,840
That's no point!

307
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,920
Hondara Kenpo, Tsubanomai!

308
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,320
You're so annoying!

309
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,600
I won't forgive you!

310
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,720
Hondara Kenpo, Umihippai!

311
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,940
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

312
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,680
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

313
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,320
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

314
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,240
You bastard!

315
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,960
Umihipparegaishiii!

316
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,300
Hey, Ryotsu!

317
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,180
What's up, Chief?

318
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,400
See what you're doing?

319
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,240
Hey, golly!

320
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,040
Huh?

321
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,520
Hondara Kenpo.

322
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,660
Shut up!

323
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,660
Stop! Let me go!

324
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,660
What?

325
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,140
Who is that?

326
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,340
You're embarrassing me.

327
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,300
No!

328
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,400
Akichi, you're here.

329
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,960
You came to see the bath, as promised.

330
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,680
No! It's an accident!

331
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,440
No! No! No!

332
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,640
You're here to see the president?

333
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,700
No, that's a misunderstanding.

334
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,520
Everyone!

335
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,540
What's all this fuss about?

336
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,000
No, that's...

337
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,780
Where are the guests?

338
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,260
Excuse me, we're staying at a different hotel.

339
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,720
Different hotel?

340
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,580
There's no such thing at our hotel.

341
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,540
What?

342
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,600
Ohara-kun...

343
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,660
You're a good guy.

344
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,940
Idiot!

345
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,660
I can't believe you used all your travel expenses on a bar.

346
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,040
Fortunately, the hotel is empty.

347
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,060
We're staying there.

348
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,460
We're going to have special octopus dishes prepared.

349
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,880
But we'll deduct your next salary.

350
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,840
What?

351
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,140
No way!

352
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,480
It's self-interest.

353
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,360
You can reflect on it.

354
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,180
Darn it!

355
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,660
Phew...

356
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,440
I'm sorry, everyone.

357
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,360
You don't have to worry about Jody-san.

358
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,660
They're the only bad guys.

359
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,120
Jody-san.

360
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,140
He brought us all the way here.

361
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,300
Why don't you all go to the hotel and have lunch?

362
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,220
Oh, wonderful!

363
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,380
Here you are, sir.

364
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,100
Oh, sorry.

365
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,540
Now, let's enjoy our hotel's special octopus dishes.

366
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,580
I've been waiting for this moment.

367
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,540
I've been waiting for this moment.

368
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,140
I've been waiting for this moment.

369
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,400
Finally, we can have our special octopus dishes!

370
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
I guess everyone is eating delicious octopus dishes.

371
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,460
Octopus?

372
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,040
I can eat it in Tokyo.

373
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,380
But it's the best octopus dish.

374
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,820
I just wanted to try it since it's so small.

375
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,620
Anyway, the octopus...

376
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,180
I'm hungry.

377
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,100
Yeah, me too.

378
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm hungry.

379
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,480
All of this is because of the octopus.

380
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,100
You idiot octopus!

381
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,240
Kanjiki-chan!

382
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,960
Senpai!

383
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,560
You don't have to kick me so hard.

384
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,160
Don't be silly.

385
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,240
I didn't kick you so hard.

386
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,200
What's going on?

387
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,780
It seems to sink.

388
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,380
An accident?

389
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,540
I don't know.

390
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,820
The monitor is not working properly.

391
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,900
This is it!

392
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,000
First, we will make fresh octopus!

393
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,760
It's so grotesque!

394
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,760
This is an octopus!

395
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:07,880
What?

396
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,160
A huge octopus is attached to this ship!

397
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,820
It's a gap!

398
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,840
It's because you say octopus's bad words!

399
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,700
Octopus can't understand words!

400
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,300
It's delicious!

401
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,140
This is more than I expected, Ohara!

402
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,420
Next, we will make octopus marinade!

403
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,880
It looks so delicious!

404
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,020
Let's eat!

405
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,600
It's delicious!

406
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,380
It's so healthy!

407
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,680
It's so delicious!

408
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,500
It's so delicious!

409
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,360
We can eat octopus!

410
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,400
We ate octopus!

411
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,120
Shut up! Don't cry!

412
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,440
Now we have to move the ship!

413
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,980
Can you do it?

414
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,880
I will control it!

415
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,160
Then who will do it?

416
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:10,780
You!

417
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:11,980
Come here!

418
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,300
No, no, no!

419
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,360
It's impossible!

420
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,900
I've never moved a submarine!

421
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,640
What?

422
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:19,620
What?

423
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,860
It's got a handle!

424
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:21,940
It's similar!

425
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,480
It's always like that!

426
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,980
It's not easy to control a submarine!

427
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,780
I'll cut it into pieces!

428
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,660
You did it!

429
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,540
Let's go!

430
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,060
Good luck, Honda!

431
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,400
We are going to eat octopus!

432
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,840
Octopus is sooups!

433
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,180
I'll give you octopus tempura!

434
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,340
It's so crispy and delicious!

435
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,520
It's as if it has bones.

436
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,260
Whoa!

437
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,480
It's looking at water!

438
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,260
Don't eat!

439
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,760
You crazy octopus!

440
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,060
Go away!

441
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll give you octopus grilled dish!

442
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,380
It smells so good!

443
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,460
It's delicious!

444
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:13,600
I'm so happy!

445
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,980
Ah! Good taste!

446
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,660
We're almost there!

447
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,180
We got them all!

448
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,560
Let's go!

449
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,180
Let's go!

450
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,200
Lastly, let's have an octopus dessert.

451
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,180
Oh, it's rare to see a dessert.

452
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,740
Ryotsu!

453
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,280
Ah, hello everyone. I'm Enmo Takenawa.

454
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,230
What the hell is going on?

455
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,980
You!

456
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,580
You're the one who made us not eat octopus!

457
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,840
You're the one who made us not eat octopus!

458
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,440
You're the one who made us not eat octopus!

459
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,840
Hey, wait a minute!

460
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,980
Ryo?

461
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,380
I can't forgive you.

462
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,900
What's wrong with you?

463
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,060
You're so annoying.

464
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,040
There's a deep reason for this.

465
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,720
I was attacked by a giant octopus.

466
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,660
If you're lying, you should tell me a better lie.

467
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,740
You're right, Deba!

468
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,520
Ah!

469
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,240
Ah!

470
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,020
Octopus!

471
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,380
That's enough!

472
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:11,280
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Please come in!

473
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,120
Welcome! Welcome! Please come in!

474
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,660
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

475
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,840
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

476
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,500
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

477
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,180
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

478
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,620
What's that?

479
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,820
My recommendation is...

480
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,680
Be careful of the fried chicken!

481
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,640
Huh? Is that a gag?

482
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,140
Yes, I'm sorry.

483
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,640
I don't understand.

484
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,420
I can't understand.

485
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,080
Are you serious?

486
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,020
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

487
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,900
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

488
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,080
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

489
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,880
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

490
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,320
Masai!

491
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,040
What the hell?

492
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,620
I just kicked him a little.

493
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,620
He ran away!

494
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,040
The exit is closed!

495
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,660
Do I have to prepare the temporary exit until I rebuild it?

496
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,300
It's not easy to find such a convenient place.

497
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,700
Next time, "Meso! Here is the temporary exit!"

498
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,740
Thank you for watching!
