1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:04,760
Light of

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,320
TV,

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,060
make

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,520
room

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,520
brighter

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,060
and

7
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,520
look

8
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,080
away.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,680
I

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,660
look at

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:21,720
the

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:21,840
river

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,040
of

14
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,060
and

15
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,000
look

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,040
the

17
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,960
sunset

18
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,200
that

19
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,280
at

20
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,000
the

21
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,820
moon

22
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,880
that

23
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,820
floats

24
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,860
on

25
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,020
river

26
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,480
and

27
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:38,500
look

28
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,000
at

29
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,100
the

30
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,120
moon

31
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,380
that

32
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,260
floats

33
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,860
on

34
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,160
the

35
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,520
I

36
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,840
also

37
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,160
look

38
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,220
at

39
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,320
moon

40
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,500
look

41
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,260
at

42
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,300
the

43
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,440
I

44
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,240
look

45
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,560
at

46
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,520
the

47
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,380
sunset

48
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,820
that

49
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,360
And it all ends with a kiss

50
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,820
I'm happy again

51
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,460
I'm in a daze

52
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,320
And I realize

53
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,400
I'm stupid

54
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,860
Counterattack!

55
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,800
T Accused!

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,500
Tenbatsu Techimen Tenbatsu Techimen Tenbatsu Techimen!

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,300
Tenbatsu Techimen Tenbatsu Techimen Tenbatsu Techimen!

58
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,020
Tenbatsu Techimen Tenbatsu Techimen Tenbatsu Techimen!

59
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:39,240
Monopolis Chief!

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,860
How's the underworld?

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
Yeah, it's still the same.

62
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,140
I see.

63
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,680
I was the one who was self-respecting the officers.

64
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,480
It seems I've completely disappointed my subordinates.

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
Huh?

66
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,900
I'm not going to patrol around in the middle of the day.

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,300
Good night.

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,140
Damn it! It's all his fault!

69
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,340
My honor was trampled on by this man!

70
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,800
Damn it!

71
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,480
Tenpaku!

72
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,820
Ouch!

73
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,280
You're in my way.

74
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,000
Hey, Hanayama!

75
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,900
It's you again. I know you.

76
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,620
You're always giving me the wrong punishment.

77
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,460
Why don't you do something bigger, you idiot?

78
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,180
What?

79
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,580
Hanayama!

80
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,100
S- sir!

81
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,760
If you don't behave, I'll have to show you something.

82
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,280
Hey, you idiot!

84
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,360
I'll slap you in the ass!

85
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,100
It's all because of that man.

86
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:18,980
I'll have to kill that Ryotsu and get back the trust and respect of the police officers!

87
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,100
Is there a Ryotsu officer?

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,060
Ryotsu is patrolling right now.

89
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,620
Patrolling?

90
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:31,840
Is there no Ryotsu?

91
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,260
Is he a friend of yours?

92
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,120
Well, not really.

93
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,680
Even if you say he's patrolling, he's talking about you.

94
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,840
If you don't mind, please wait in the back room.

95
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,000
Thank you.

96
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,600
What's wrong, sir?

97
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,020
You've been kind to me for a long time.

98
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,120
It's delicious tea.

99
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,680
Oh, it's a cheap tea of 100g and 200 yen.

100
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,060
Your kindness is making me feel the fragrance of tea.

101
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,560
Well, good job.

102
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,040
I wish I could have a view like you.

103
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,540
View?

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
You're really...

105
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,460
You're so annoying.

106
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,600
Are you patrolling again, Ryo?

107
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,060
Sir, lend me the lunch. I'll double it.

108
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,760
I don't want to, Ryo.

109
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,820
I've never said that and given it back, have I?

110
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,360
Oh, by the way, it's a guest.

111
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,480
Guest?

112
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,620
Ha ha ha ha ha.

113
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,620
That's right.

114
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,500
I've been patrolling the outside world for a long time.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,500
Then, last time, it was a man of Hanayama who said that

116
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
"Ryo-chan has become so small".

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,920
Yes.

118
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,140
I intended to punish him with a heavy punishment at that time,

119
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,640
but it seems that that man still lacks it.

120
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,620
Ryo-chan, you can change any painful coincidence into a positive one.

121
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,420
Hmm.

122
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,000
As expected of that man, I'm also a little bit anxious.

123
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,660
This time, I stood in the middle of patrolling

124
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,340
to add even more pressure.

125
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,800
He he he.

126
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,420
If you don't have this cane, you can't get your hands and feet out.

127
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,420
Huh?

128
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,240
He he he.

129
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,960
Let's try it with a hand.

130
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,080
Ten-batsu!

131
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,680
Ten-batsu!

132
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,020
Huh?

133
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,680
Ryoh-san, you need something?

134
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,200
Ah, no, it's nothing.

135
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,000
Hmm, as expected, I can't use this cane unless I'm an old man from Hanayama.

136
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,660
Huh?

137
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,840
Hey, mister!

138
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,220
It's a nice day for driving beauty.

139
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,220
Let's buy the one-way road!

140
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,120
Ten-batsu!

141
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,800
Ten-batsu!

142
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,060
Huh?

143
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,140
Ah, a new muffler!

144
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Look, Mr. Honda.

145
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,460
I got a hit because I tried to skip it.

146
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,960
That's why I got hit by a bat.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,640
I see.

148
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,200
So the whole village is a temple,

149
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,640
and there's no punishment for it.

150
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,720
Did you say something?

151
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,100
It's just a small thing. Don't worry about it.

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But if you just hit people,

153
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,420
it's not productive.

154
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,660
For example, if you do this,

155
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,300
you'll get paid.

156
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,000
One million yen!

157
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,760
Here you go!

158
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,100
Wow!

159
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,940
This is the Kozuchi we got from the house!

160
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,960
What a shame, Terai!

161
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,360
If you hadn't been so stingy and lent me money,

162
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,360
I would have paid you ten times or a hundred times more!

163
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,960
No, Ryo-san.

164
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,900
That's not fair.

165
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,180
It's got a little bit of money, too.

166
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,400
It's a real 10,000 yen note.

167
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,160
How long are you going to pay me back my cane?

168
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,980
Who would pay me back something so useful?

169
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,100
I got this cane.

170
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,180
No, Ryo-chan.

171
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,200
Give it back to the old man.

172
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,480
Here's the cane.

173
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,420
It's mine now.

174
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,540
I can't do anything with it.

175
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,320
It's just a piece of junk.

176
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
No, Ryo-san!

177
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,100
What are you doing?

178
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,160
Thank you!

179
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,560
I'm sure you'll go to heaven!

180
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,420
Here, I'll give you a ten-thousand yen note!

181
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,100
What the hell?

182
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,200
Are you okay?

183
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,340
Oh, where's Ryo-chan?

184
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Over there!

185
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,800
You're a big man,

186
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,360
but you're not good at anything.

187
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,880
This is just a simple task that anyone can do.

188
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:26,840
Huh?

189
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,860
What's going to happen if we return it?

190
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,060
Oh, that's it!

191
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,560
The Ten-Bastard is back!

192
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,320
The Ten-Bastard has just beenらい~

193
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,460
I'm sorry!

194
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,160
Senpai!

195
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,860
Ryozu!

196
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,300
Chief, you've been a real pain in the neck when you were little.

197
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,940
What are you doing, Ryozu?!

198
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,480
Please stop!

199
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,680
It's okay. I won't crush you.

200
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,800
It's a bell!

201
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,020
Take it!

202
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,460
Damn it!

203
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,920
I got it!

204
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,560
Huh? The string...

205
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,340
It's easy to catch Ryo-chan.

206
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,980
Who do you think you are?!

207
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,140
You're a crazy man!

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,200
I'll punish you with my sword!

209
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,340
What's this? It's a panda!

210
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,560
You should be ashamed of your own ugliness!

211
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,500
I'll leave to patrol from now on.

212
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,440
Hey, Hanayama, get back to your place!

213
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,320
Ryo-chan, you're so cute!

214
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,220
Chief!

215
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,860
Don't get on my nerves!

216
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,420
How am I supposed to live in this outfit?

217
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,580
How am I supposed to live in this school?

218
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,320
Mama, Kanda-san is here!

219
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,320
Oh, really?

220
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,660
Hey, each of you gets 100 yen for your sword!

221
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,860
I'm scared, Mama!

222
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,440
Hey, pay up!

223
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,660
Ryozu!

224
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:26,960
Ouch!

225
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,860
The Ueno people have the right to pay for swords, Chief!

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,920
This is terrible!

227
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,620
What's the matter, sir?

228
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,880
Grandpa!

229
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,720
Grandpa, you'd better get me back to my place!

230
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,760
Well...

231
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,720
Huh?

232
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,260
You lost the magic wand?

233
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,000
Y-Yes, I did.

234
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,720
I was busy with my studies.

235
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,260
Huh?

236
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,000
That's...

237
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,120
What?

238
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,140
Then what's going to happen to me?

239
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,780
If you don't have the wand, you can't go back to your original form...

240
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,940
Don't talk nonsense!

241
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,360
You want me to spend the rest of my life as a panda?

242
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,960
I can't stand to see if I can go buy a magic wand in this form!

243
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:23,960
Senior!

244
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,260
Hanayama-san didn't lose it on purpose, either.

245
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,700
Oh, of course!

246
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,240
I'm in trouble, too.

247
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,700
If I don't have that wand...

248
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,520
Where did you lose it?

249
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,820
At the end of the third signal...

250
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,540
Kyaryuu!

251
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:39,980
Ryo-san!

252
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,360
Senior!

253
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,180
Don't worry, Nakagawa Terai!

254
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,440
Call the insurance office!

255
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,760
A violent norapanda is wandering around the city.

256
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,220
But...

257
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,460
That's just not going to make you around!

258
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,760
Yes, sir.

259
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
What should I do?

260
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,820
If I lose the magic wand of the police,

261
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,840
I won't be able to go back to heaven on my first-day job.

262
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,960
Ryo-chan, when it comes to you,

263
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,360
If you do, you'll be dead.

264
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,280
So I'm sure you'll find him.

265
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,580
It's okay.

266
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,820
No!

267
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,680
If I give him the staff,

268
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,020
he won't know what to do next!

269
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,980
Even if I die,

270
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,260
I must get the staff back before that man!

271
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,820
Uncle!

272
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,780
Oh, damn.

273
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,080
Who took it?

274
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,820
What's that?

275
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,900
What's this?

276
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,300
It looks like a snack.

277
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,620
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,000
It's a snack house!

279
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:00,960
Bandera, stop!

280
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,040
It's a snack house!

281
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,540
It's a snack house!

282
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,380
It's a snack house!

283
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,940
It's really a cookie.

284
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,040
It's definitely the work of the man who took the staff.

285
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,820
But who did this?

286
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,240
What's that?

287
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,240
It's like he turned the toy box over.

288
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,780
Okay, I got it.

289
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,800
The staff took it.

290
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,300
It's a kindergarten kid's book.

291
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,900
They can't tell the difference between manga and reality.

292
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,940
Hurry up and take it!

293
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,060
Hurry up and take it!

294
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,180
It's getting smaller.

295
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,120
Now it's easier to use.

296
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,680
Lend it to me.

297
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,920
I'm going to get Mika's doll.

298
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,680
Next time, I'll...

299
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,900
Oh, it's a panda!

300
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,980
I knew it.

301
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,100
Hey, let's go fishing before we play.

302
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,780
Where's the fishing rod?

303
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,280
We're going too.

304
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,560
What should we do?

305
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,700
Oh, right!

306
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,460
Let's put it in here.

307
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,600
Let's use it later.

308
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm not here to play!

309
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,520
Let go of me!

310
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,100
It's a nice weather for golfing, isn't it?

311
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,440
It's a nice weather for golfing, isn't it?

312
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,480
It's a nice weather for golfing, isn't it?

313
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,100
It's a close course, so I'll be back in the evening.

314
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,460
Oh, you asked for a panda doll.

315
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,320
I didn't ask for it.

316
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:24,740
I didn't ask for it.

317
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,420
I'll play with it later.

318
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,340
Wait a minute!

319
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,100
Where's the fishing rod?

320
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,040
Where's the fishing rod?

321
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,760
Fishing rod?

322
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,680
I put it in the golf bag of the principal.

323
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,920
Oh, principal!

324
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,080
What?

325
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,800
Wait for that car!

326
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,140
The panda is waving at us.

327
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,060
He's a passionate part-time student.

328
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,200
I'm telling you to wait!

329
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,220
Damn it!

330
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,680
My body is too heavy to run.

331
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,020
I'll get a taxi.

332
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,200
Hey, taxi!

333
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,220
Hey, taxi!

334
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,820
Crap, don't discriminate animals!

335
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,600
Crap, don't discriminate animals!

336
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,080
Good timing!

337
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,300
That's Ming's sedan.

338
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,400
I'll get it with you.

339
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,820
I'll get it back by myself!

340
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,440
Ming, please, get it back.

341
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,360
You old-timer!

342
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,800
Did you remember it?

343
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,360
Just follow Ming's taxi.

344
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,520
Yes.

345
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,100
Yeah!

346
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,900
We have a good view of the course.

347
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:34,840
Shall we aim for the rear?

348
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,840
You are not allowed to enter except by the user!

349
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,080
I came here to collect the staff, so let go.

350
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,080
I finally made it.

351
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,200
Okay.

352
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,580
The bear has appeared!

353
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,160
RUYA isn't gonna be happy about it...

354
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,820
Oh, now!

355
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,480
I'll do the rest of his hell!

356
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,920
You're...

357
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,120
going to die!

358
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,260
That's...

359
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:20,520
not gonna do!

360
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,380
I'll finish you off!

361
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,420
I won't let you finish me off!

362
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,520
Kangaroo can swim!

363
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,360
Don't mess with me...

364
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,280
There he is!

365
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,780
It's Panda the Tsunodori!

366
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,460
Let him sleep in the water!

367
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,900
But Kangaroo has jump power!

368
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,980
Panda has become a kangaroo!

369
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:01,620
I'll punish you with my power!

370
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,780
Come on, Kasumi!

371
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:18,300
Come on, Kasumi!

372
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,400
Wait!

373
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,160
I'll go first.

374
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,840
Damn it!

375
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,260
I failed.

376
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,660
I should have bought that old man a slimy turtle.

377
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,420
Wait for me!

378
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,900
Damn it!

379
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,280
I'll lose sight of the crow and the old man.

380
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,120
I have to catch them and go to the zoo.

381
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,540
I have to do something.

382
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,700
Come on, let's go to the zoo today!

383
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,180
That's it.

384
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,840
I'll go first.

385
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,540
What's the matter, Mr. Tsunodori?

386
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,800
Excuse me, but I'm late for the opening.

387
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,940
It's a little bit...

388
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,620
I didn't know that you were a Tsunodori.

389
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,960
Well, I'm a Tsunodori.

390
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,900
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

391
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,940
I can't believe it.

392
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,880
You're a Tsunodori, aren't you?

393
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,380
Yeah.

394
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,420
I'm a Tsunodori.

395
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,800
Yeah, I am.

396
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:18,740
I'm a Tsunodori, aren't I?

397
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:18,880
Hey, I'm a Tsunodori, aren't I?

398
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,340
Hey, where's the XL size dress?

399
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,660
Welcome.

400
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,580
Naoko is here.

401
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,180
I feel like I'm getting too much attention.

402
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,400
I can't stand the legs of a panda.

403
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,560
Oh, no!

404
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,580
Oh, no!

405
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,080
Oh, no!

406
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,920
Oh, no!

407
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,060
Oh, no!

408
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,060
Oh, no!

409
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,320
Oh, no!

410
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,660
Oh, no!

411
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,560
Oh, no!

412
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,720
Oh, no!

413
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,200
I'm tired of being a kangaroo.

414
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
It seems to be over there.

415
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,920
If I can find the screw, it's mine.

416
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,880
Wait, excuse me.

417
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,000
Go to the roof!

418
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,300
It's a weight over!

419
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,700
Shut up!

420
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,820
Go straight to the roof!

421
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
Young man, use the stairs.

422
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,920
Yes, sir.

423
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,340
Where's the crow?

424
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,920
Where's the crow?

425
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,920
There it is!

426
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,780
It's the crow's nest!

427
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,020
I did it!

428
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,680
You bastard!

429
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,580
It's so noisy!

430
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,840
Shut up!

431
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,560
Stop!

432
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,680
If you go back to your original position, it's mine.

433
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,460
I won't let you do that.

434
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,340
You're so persistent!

435
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,480
That's your fault!

436
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,560
Let me go, old man!

437
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,280
Oh my!

438
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,580
And here I am.

439
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,300
Why?

440
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,360
I'd be disappointed if you left behind me.

441
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,920
Don't talk nonsense!

442
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,240
You deserve the credit of my years of hard work.

443
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:41,700
Don't interfere!

444
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,040
You bastard!

445
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,600
W-what is that?

446
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,800
I-I don't know.

447
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,100
It's a panda and a kangaroo.

448
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,940
I know that!

449
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,180
That's why I told you to give me two billion yen!

450
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,840
Listen, I'll pay for the next time.

451
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,220
Two billion yen!

452
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:11,420
I'll pay for the next time.

453
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,700
Hey, Retsu!

454
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,420
Can you move a little?

455
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,040
My turn!

456
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,460
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move!

457
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,380
What?

458
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,020
Want to play?

459
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,880
You'll get kicked out if you keep going like this!

460
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,500
Alright!

461
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,960
One more...

462
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,860
One more breath...

463
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,860
One more breath...

464
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,300
One more breath...

465
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm going to drown.

466
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,780
I can't swim with a kangaroo.

467
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,460
What?

468
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,340
Don't bother!

469
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,420
Give me the rod!

470
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,220
I don't want to run!

471
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,240
Stop!

472
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm going to drown!

473
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,760
So...

474
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,500
I'll pay for the next time!

475
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:37,220
I'm saved.

476
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,200
Hey, old man!

477
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:39,900
I'm still an animal!

478
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,680
If you're an animal, don't you dare turn me into a floating fish!

479
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,620
He's gone, Senpai.

480
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,220
It seems Chief Ohara was called by the chief in this matter.

481
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,120
Was the old man of Hanayama alright?

482
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,720
Shut up!

483
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,940
Don't talk about him!

484
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,440
I guess the panda was better than the floating fish.

485
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,780
The floating fish only come out in summer.

486
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,760
But it seems that we can make a thousand people with it without being suspicious.

487
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,920
A floating fish?

488
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,700
That's great!

489
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,300
Ryo, if you do that...

490
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,460
You're talking nonsense!

491
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,520
Sorry!

492
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,920
Everyone is here.

493
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,860
Old man of Hanayama...

494
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,420
What's up with your outfit?

495
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,820
Actually, the TV program "Tengoku Keisatsu 24" was broadcasted.

496
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,300
It was very popular.

497
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,440
I was scouted by the talent agency of Tengoku.

498
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,400
Reiko, I brought the lyrics of the famous song of Tengoku.

499
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,080
Can you bring me some tea?

500
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,520
Yes.

501
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,400
I see. That's good.

502
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,080
From now on, let's do it with talent and the second-class of the troupe.

503
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,440
No! Before that, bring me back to my home!

504
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,480
Hey, Tenbatsuji!

505
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,760
Bring me back!

506
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,240
Please!

507
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,340
Bring me back!

508
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,240
It was the video from the second-class TV Tengoku Keisatsu 24.

509
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,740
I was surprised to see what kind of machine it could be.

510
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:18,980
Shut up!

511
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,860
Well, why don't you cut this video and get rid of me?

512
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,180
This one is...

513
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,220
I'd like to take a break.

514
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,360
I'd like to take a break.

515
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,940
I'd like to take a break.

516
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,400
I'd like to take a break.

517
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,000
I'd like to take a break.

518
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,960
I'd like to take a break.

519
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,560
I'd like to take a break.

520
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:35,940
I'd like to take a break.

521
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,340
I'd like to take a break.

522
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,800
I'd like to take a break.

523
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,520
I'd like to take a break.

524
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,440
I'd like to take a break.

525
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:51,420
I'd like to take a break.

526
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,160
I'd like to take a break.

527
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:06,800
I'd like to take a break.

528
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,140
I'd like to take a break.

529
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,480
I'd like to take a break.

530
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,060
I'd like to take a break.

531
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,500
I'd like to take a break.

532
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,520
Where are we going?

533
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,040
Ryo-chan and Ran!

534
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,580
My skirt is short, so shut up!

535
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,200
Ryo-chan, why don't you dress up properly?

536
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,580
And when she said that, she found a thief!

537
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,040
Kiiin!

538
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,920
This won't make me run!

539
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,480
Next time, "Run! Reiko's Great Trace"!

540
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,200
Look forward to it!
