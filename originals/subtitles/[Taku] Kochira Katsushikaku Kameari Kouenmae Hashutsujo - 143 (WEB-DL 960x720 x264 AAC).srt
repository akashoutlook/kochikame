Younger boys are getting cheeky!

00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,420
But the number of policemen has definitely reduced to deal with them!

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,560
But the number of policemen has definitely decreased to deal with them!

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,360
We predicted the situation of today and prepared a countermeasure.

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,760
Mr. Ohara.

34
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,800
Yes.

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,440
This is the ultimate police officer created through the 30 years of destruction and 500 million of money.

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,420
Go!

37
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
Robot officer!

38
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,060
What? The robot officer is coming?

39
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,460
Yes. The chief and Mr. Terai are heading here together.

40
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,120
It's not a place where a police officer called Mr. Robot would be.

41
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,680
No. It really is a robot.

42
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,680
It was created through the 30 years of destruction and 500 million of money.

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,720
I'm looking forward to what kind of robot will come.

44
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,120
That's right.

45
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,740
I have a bad feeling.

46
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,340
It costs 500 million.

47
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,420
There's no way such a strange robot would come.

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,860
Yes. Ryo-chan is thinking too much.

49
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,560
Shut up!

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,360
It's a robot designed by us, the chief.

51
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,720
Do you think we're expecting something like that?

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,760
It might be a robot that was put on a drum in the drum kit considering our age.

53
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,360
But it might be a giant robot.

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,980
Could it be that the vehicle has transformed?

55
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,560
It would be fun if it was such a robot police officer.

56
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,340
Why are you imagining all that trouble?

57
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,300
It's not strange to have a robot like that.

58
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,420
It's something we came up with.

59
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,800
Here it is.

60
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,680
Hello, everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting.

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,860
This is the 30 years of destruction and 500 million of money that the police officer 001 spent.

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,820
I knew it.

63
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:40,860
I see.

64
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,720
Then let me transform it right away.

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,340
What do you mean?

66
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,520
This vehicle will transform into a robot police officer, right?

67
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,280
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,560
I'm not talking nonsense.

69
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,640
Hey, Tera, give it to me.

70
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,480
Yes, sir.

71
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,340
How was it? Were you surprised?

72
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,860
It's just a human being.

73
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,200
What is this human being?

74
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,800
It's made by anyone, no matter how they look at it.

75
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,220
Don't be rude.

76
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,940
The 001 was made by 30 years of destruction and 500 million of money.

77
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,620
Oh, you guys.

78
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,040
You can say that because you haven't seen the 001 move.

79
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
All right. Let's move it.

80
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,320
Tera, please move it.

81
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,360
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

82
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,900
What kind of switch is this?

83
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,660
If you kick the hip, it will stop functioning.

84
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,520
It's the same as us.

85
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,080
It's a robot made by 30 years of destruction and 500 million of money.

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,220
It's better to have a human part like that.

87
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,380
It's just like that.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,100
That's what it is.

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,660
Chief.

90
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,620
Let's put it in for the time being.

91
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,860
Yes, sir.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,400
Let's start again.

93
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,180
Yes, sir.

94
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,000
Hello, everyone.

95
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,140
He spoke.

96
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,100
I'm the 001 of the Robot Police Force.

97
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,980
You guys heard me, right? I spoke Japanese properly.

98
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,020
How was it? You were surprised, weren't you?

99
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,720
It's not surprising.

100
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,640
I can talk on my computer now.

101
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,960
That's more fluent.

102
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,840
Don't put the computer with the robot made by the destruction of the 30 years and 500 million of money together.

103
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,460
Don't worry about what he says.

104
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,560
I welcome you.

105
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,240
Chief, if you want to shake hands, you should say you want to.

106
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,320
I see.

107
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,800
You're a bad guy.

108
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,640
Shut up. Robots are like that.

109
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,360
Let's shake hands, 001.

110
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,440
Yes, sir.

111
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,720
This is what happened, so I'll take a break for a while.

112
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,880
In the meantime, please take care of 001.

113
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,180
Yes, sir.

114
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,240
Especially Ryotsu.

115
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,220
If 001 is broken, I'll ask you to compensate.

116
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,240
Why me?

117
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,540
If you break it, you're the only one left.

118
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,040
001 is the 30th year of the original government.

119
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,160
You developed it with one million and five billion.

120
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,900
That's right.

121
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,020
I'll handle it carefully.

122
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,300
I understand.

123
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,440
Please.

124
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,180
What are you going to do, senior?

125
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,040
If you touch it poorly and something happens, the director will tell you to be quiet.

126
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,540
Let it go.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,380
001 is in the middle of the room, isn't it?

128
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,340
Yes, it is.

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,140
001, go to the corner of the room.

130
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,900
Roger that.

131
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,020
All right, you guys stand there for a while, please.

132
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,700
Roger that.

133
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,140
You can concentrate on it slowly and smoothly.

134
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,320
And everyone...

135
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,460
Everyone of you.

136
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:55,640
Everyone of you.

137
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,800
Everyone of you.

138
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,880
I'm your karşı!

139
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,700
I'm your karşı- consigo!

140
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,220
I'm your karşı-yase!

141
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,360
I'm...

142
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm...

143
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm...

144
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:10,920
I'm...

145
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,540
I'm...

146
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,300
I'm...

147
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,740
Really...

148
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,560
Really...

149
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,020
Pretty...

150
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
What's wrong, Ryo-san?

151
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,980
Why are you staring at me?

152
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,900
I didn't do anything like that.

153
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,380
I just feel like that, Senpai.

154
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,760
I can't move at all.

155
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,500
I see.

156
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,860
Speaking of which, the police doll I saw on the road was also creepy.

157
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you feel the same way about this?

158
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,600
Alright, 0015, look over there.

159
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,360
Which is over there?

160
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,180
Turn right and look at the window.

161
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,760
Turn right and look at the window.

162
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,440
Roger that.

163
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,500
Alright, I'll calm down and get back to work.

164
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,980
I told you not to look!

165
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,820
I'm not looking.

166
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,940
Well, go patrol somewhere else!

167
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,020
What do you mean, somewhere else?

168
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,300
Think it over!

169
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,680
Don't do that, Ryo-chan.

170
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,780
It won't work unless you give a specific order.

171
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,400
You're so troublesome.

172
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,640
Then let's take a ride around old Mitokai-dou from Kan-nana.

173
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,880
Roger that.

174
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,080
What was that?

175
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,140
Where on earth is Kan-nana?

176
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,500
What?

177
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,840
Say you don't know!

178
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,780
If you don't know, tell me!

179
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,420
At least remember the map software!

180
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,980
Senior, there's a CD-ROM on the desk.

181
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,300
Let's install it.

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,880
Sure thing!

183
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,120
The Z-Unit should be on the back...

184
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,880
Found it!

185
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,900
It's 5 inches!

186
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
What is this?

187
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,040
It's a floppy disk.

188
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,580
What? Isn't a floppy disk smaller?

189
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,960
15 years ago, a floppy disk was like that.

190
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,920
It was the most advanced technology at the time, but now...

191
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,000
What about the CD-ROM drive?

192
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,040
It's not installed.

193
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,600
Then how do you remember maps?

194
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,100
Don't worry. I can remember everything I see.

195
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,160
That requires advanced technology, doesn't it?

196
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,340
I don't know if it's low-tech or high-tech.

197
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,340
It said the memory has passed.

198
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,160
It's amazing!

199
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,620
In 3 minutes and 10 notes!

200
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,560
It's finished up to 500 pages!

201
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,200
If you spend 5 billion, that's an obvious result!

202
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,760
All right, stand guard over there.

203
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,620
Roger that.

204
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,300
Finally I get to pay than.

205
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,260
I wonder if you can handle it alone.

206
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,960
Don't talk to me about it if you have to do it alone.

207
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,420
That guy's using 5 billion money!

208
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,000
But I'm still worried.

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,640
It seems to be okay.

210
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,100
Watch out!

211
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,880
The object is approaching. Calculate the damage caused by the collision.

212
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,060
We did it!

213
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,800
Are you okay?

214
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,560
The upper body is fine.

215
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,560
The rear is fine.

216
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,060
The left is fine.

217
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,420
The right is fine.

218
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,780
The entire circuit is fine.

219
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,220
It's so sturdy.

220
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,500
That's what makes it a tower.

221
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,200
Wait.

222
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,160
I think I can make a fortune.

223
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,000
Mr. Ryozuno!

224
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,100
Hey, Honda. What's up?

225
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,260
I came to see the robot officer.

226
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,820
He's not here. Is he patrolling?

227
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,320
That's because Ryo-chan...

228
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,240
Thank you for waiting.

229
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,500
Oh, he's here.

230
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,840
Curry rice.

231
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,500
What is this?

232
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:04,760
What's this?

233
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,600
What does this employee do?

234
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,980
This is 001.

235
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,480
What?

236
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,300
This isn't a police robot?

237
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,200
No.

238
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,040
This is too old to be a police officer.

239
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,900
It can't do complicated work.

240
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,480
I'm trying to make it work.

241
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,800
Until this morning, I worked at the subway construction site.

242
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,680
After that, I delivered tissues in front of the station.

243
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,200
Yesterday, I made a waitress do the job at the family restaurant.

244
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,160
But the customer was angry and ran away.

245
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,600
What?

246
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
I am very nice.

247
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,380
I just want to help the society.

248
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,200
I am a person who makes my own decisions.

249
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,720
But I'm sure your part-time job is all for Ryo-chan.

250
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,280
What?

251
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,580
I can't help it.

252
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,000
I have saved money for him to make his pay.

253
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,640
I didn't know that the robot has a pay.

254
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,180
Thank you very much.

255
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,040
It will be 650 yen.

256
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,780
Thank you for the meal.

257
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,160
Please take it from your part-time job.

258
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:58,920
Yes.

259
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,100
I've already finished eating this plate.

260
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,920
Please take it home.

261
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Yes.

262
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,500
He's using a robot worth 5 billion yen for his own use.

263
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,580
Yes, I have it every time.

264
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,640
Hey, wait!

265
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,500
I'm sorry, but can you give me a massage?

266
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:13,820
Yes.

267
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,780
Can you give me a massage?

268
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,220
When I made you work at the sauna three days ago, you were pretty good.

269
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,800
What? That's not true.

270
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,560
0015, give me a little more strength.

271
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,220
Yes, I understand.

272
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,040
Oh, that's good.

273
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,580
More.

274
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,020
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

275
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,620
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

276
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,060
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch! Stop it!

277
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,980
I won't forgive you!

278
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,480
Ouch!

279
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,320
R-Ryo!

280
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,200
It seems the opponent forgot about the metal.

281
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,000
It's a matter of time.

282
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,380
Okay, I'm done with the shoulders.

283
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,120
I'll ask for the legs next time.

284
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,060
Isn't it moving a little strange?

285
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,340
Yes.

286
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,460
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

287
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:00,760
Ryo!

288
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:00,880
Ryo-san!

289
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,900
Mr. Ryo!

290
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,140
Idiot! Idiot!

291
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,740
Checking the same mistakes is not panicking at all.

292
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,340
Huff. Huff.

293
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,140
What?

294
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,360
customs.

295
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,860
Customs, your pay must be paid properly.

296
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,200
If you can't pay, You may be fired.

297
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,820
By the way, the other day, I was part-time at the debt collection.

298
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,260
Really? That's not a big deal.

299
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,760
You're so kind.

300
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,860
The customer will pay for it.

301
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,620
Oh, that's great!

302
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,500
If you can't pay, here.

303
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,300
What are you doing?

304
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,240
Ouch.

305
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,740
Customer.

306
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,760
It stopped.

307
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,220
I see. There was a switch over there.

308
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,120
It was almost done!

309
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,380
Senpai...

310
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:05,820
The End

311
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,600
This is completely overheating!

312
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,980
Ryo-chan will use the steamer.

313
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,320
I just let it work for four days without rest.

314
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,000
According to this manual,

315
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,780
"You must stop intense movement within an hour."

316
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,880
What?

317
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,740
I thought it was just a hard work.

318
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,440
It's different from the shockingly strong one and the continuous operation.

319
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,640
What are you going to do, Ryo-chan?

320
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,500
If the manager finds out, it'll be a disaster.

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,480
Okay.

322
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,240
This robot was designed 30 years ago.

323
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,380
I'll repair it and show you.

324
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,660
It's a vacuum.

325
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,760
And there's so much.

326
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,260
It's true that it was like this 30 years ago.

327
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,520
It'll be a disaster to get the parts before the repair.

328
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,600
It can't be helped.

329
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,920
0015 will be pulled onto the truck to save the child

330
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,800
and will be disqualified.

331
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,140
But even if we bump into the truck,

332
00:14:59,260 --> 00:14:59,500
it's still safe.

333
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,120
Then, it's like being crushed by a monster to protect the peace of the Earth.

334
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,620
Who would believe such a story?

335
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,920
I don't know.

336
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,240
There are still a lot of unknown creatures in the world.

337
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,060
Senpai, let's think of another way.

338
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,540
Is that so?

339
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,720
Ryo-san, this is bad!

340
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,560
What's wrong?

341
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,600
I just got a call.

342
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,860
The leaders are heading this way to inspect 0015 with the chief.

343
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:24,780
What?

344
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,360
You're injured, but it's bad, isn't it, Ohara-kun?

345
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,960
After all, you're a ninja today.

346
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,520
It's no big deal.

347
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,820
For the chief and the chief officer.

348
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,500
Here, chief officer.

349
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,700
Thank you, Ohara-kun.

350
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,780
It's no big deal.

351
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,720
We've been waiting, chief officer.

352
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,660
Thank you.

353
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,540
What about Ryo-san?

354
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,580
Senpai is on patrol.

355
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,500
Oh, I see.

356
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,480
That's more convenient.

357
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,240
And 0015?

358
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,720
Yes, I'm writing a report inside.

359
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,520
Okay, call him.

360
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,240
Yes.

361
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,780
0015, the chief officer is calling you.

362
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,540
How's 0015 doing?

363
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,200
Well, it's...

364
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,560
It's doing a great job.

365
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,120
I see.

366
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,480
It's been 30 years since it started.

367
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,840
It's been rejected by 5 billion people.

368
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,140
Sorry to keep you waiting.

369
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,020
I'm 0015.

370
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,080
Chief officer, this is 0015.

371
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,400
It's the first time I've seen it move.

372
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,100
What? It seems to have shrunk a little.

373
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,560
It's moving and it's stopped.

374
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,800
It's a different impression.

375
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,200
And it's been on a lot of work lately.

376
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,160
Maybe the electricity is out of power.

377
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,300
What?

378
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,140
That's no good.

379
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,800
0015 is 30 years old.

380
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,820
It's worth 5 billion.

381
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,180
Hey, Terai-kun.

382
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,780
Get ready to charge.

383
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,160
What?

384
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,820
Charge?

385
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,500
But that's...

386
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,560
What are you talking about?

387
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,600
Get ready to charge.

388
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,420
Yes, sir.

389
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,440
I'm ready.

390
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,200
Hey, you still have enough energy.

391
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,600
So you don't have to charge it yet.

392
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,800
It's a robot, but it's a very reluctant one.

393
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,580
Terai-kun, charge it a lot.

394
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,320
What are you doing?

395
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,920
Hurry up and do it.

396
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,340
Yes, sir.

397
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,440
Mr. Ryo, forgive me.

398
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,000
It seems to be charged and rampaging.

399
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,940
No, I'm sure he's happy.

400
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,060
That's right.

401
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,880
Terai-kun, then please increase the power and make him happy.

402
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,040
Yes, sir.

403
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,100
Yes, sir.

404
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,540
As expected, with just a 30-year-old boy and 5 billion of range.

405
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,360
There is nothing more dynamic than joy in charging.

406
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,500
I see, I see, I see.

407
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,640
Terai-kun, that's enough.

408
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,420
Are you okay, 0015?

409
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,040
You bastard!

410
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,100
I'm not okay.

411
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,540
I just had to go to the electric display in a little while.

412
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,920
Let's solve this problem.

413
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,240
What is this?

414
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,880
You can solve it in 10 seconds.

415
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,940
What is that?

416
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,160
It's a question for the Nobel Prize in Physics.

417
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,460
This is...

418
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,660
Can we solve this?

419
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,380
Of course.

420
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,860
We can't understand it.

421
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,660
But it takes too much time.

422
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,300
That's right.

423
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,800
It doesn't need to be charged.

424
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,140
I see.

425
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,480
Alright, Terai.

426
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,020
Charge it immediately.

427
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,080
Yes, sir.

428
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,620
No, no, no.

429
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,400
More strongly.

430
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,320
R-0015, are you alright?

431
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,240
R-0015?

432
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,320
I-I-I'm alright.

433
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,700
What is this?

434
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,940
What's going on?

435
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,120
Well, this is the first time

436
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,800
I've used an electric vehicle motor in the past.

437
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,500
The same program that I used for the first time.

438
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,820
R-0015 is the only belki.

439
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,280
R-0015 is also monochrome.

440
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,380
But what does it mean?

441
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,260
If it is monochrome,

442
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,820
R-0015 is monochrome,

443
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,120
which means it works in any Hugh 외.

444
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,420
R-0015 is primary energy.

445
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,260
R-0016 is primary energy.

446
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,080
R-007 is primary energy,

447
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,080
which is only used for power storage.

448
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:24,740
And R-0018 is primary energy.

449
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,060
Damn, this is going to burn.

450
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,540
Oh, as expected!

451
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,580
That's because the 30-year-renewal cost 5 billion.

452
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,260
It seems that the pace is getting slower.

453
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,220
Ohara-kun, what's wrong?

454
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,040
I think the electricity is running out again.

455
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,820
Oh, I see.

456
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:54,820
Ah!

457
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,320
It's over.

458
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,220
I see, it's juice.

459
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,720
Oh, thank you.

460
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,920
But it's a robot, but it's going to go on.

461
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,460
That's how successfully it's made to be close to humans.

462
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,060
What kind of test are you going to do next?

463
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,000
Next, we're going to do a test in the water, so I'm going to go to a river nearby.

464
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,640
Oh, I see. I'm looking forward to that.

465
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,100
Then it's not a joke.

466
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,720
If you do anything more than this, I'll kill you.

467
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,180
Even so, my throat is dry.

468
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,500
All right.

469
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,020
Ah! There's a UFO outside the window!

470
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,680
What?

471
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,320
Where?

472
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,000
Where? Where?

473
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,260
0015, where is the UFO?

474
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,920
Ohara-kun, I think I saw something I shouldn't have seen.

475
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,440
Yes, me too.

476
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,940
I can't see anything.

477
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,620
Oh, right. This time, to the right.

478
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,520
Where is it?

479
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,600
Good job. You did a great job.

480
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,580
What are you talking about? I'm 0015.

481
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,200
Your face is the opposite.

482
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,740
What about 0015?

483
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,260
I'm 0015.

484
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,220
You're saying it's not both.

485
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,300
That's right.

486
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes.

487
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,360
What? Is the nearby temple a fire?

488
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,800
Are the firefighters still there?

489
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,220
It seems to be caught in a traffic jam on the way.

490
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,440
Please do something.

491
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,660
There is an important statue that has been passed down for more than 300 years.

492
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,100
It weighs 200 kilograms...

493
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,500
It's all right.

494
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,620
Please rest assured.

495
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,400
We have an amazing robot police for such a time.

496
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,440
Right, Chief?

497
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,500
Yes, yes, Ohara-kun.

498
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,180
Yes.

499
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,380
It's 0015's turn.

500
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,180
I was overworked today and my body is...

501
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,460
What? Oh, is that so?

502
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,260
Chief, 0015 is in the fire by himself.

503
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,020
He's going to jump into the fire.

504
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,060
Oh, is that so?

505
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,200
Let's go.

506
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,960
Is there something you don't like about him?

507
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,500
No, he's shy because of his shy personality.

508
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,540
I see.

509
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,560
Ryo, give up.

510
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,260
If you can save this Japanese-class statue, you may be able to see 0015 more.

511
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,980
A little more?

512
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,740
Yes, you may be able to save your life.

513
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,040
No way.

514
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,300
Ryo-chan.

515
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,260
It seems that 0015 has been found out.

516
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,260
Yes, but it's about my senior, so I think it will be somehow.

517
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,160
Ohara-kun, is 0015 all right?

518
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,400
It's all right.

519
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,680
That man is immortal.

520
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,720
It's been 30 years and it costs 5 billion yen.

521
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,780
Oh, I see.

522
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,280
This time, I'm also going to lose.

523
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,160
0015, I found you!

524
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,100
There are pluses, but you got minuses too.

525
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,380
And you're going to lose too.

526
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,100
0015.

527
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,460
I want torang my career.

528
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:00,780
0015.

529
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,740
Look, but 0015 is...

530
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,980
I want to use 0015 to return our country!

531
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,720
0015!

532
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:07,760
0015!

533
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
It's an alien station that uses artificial satellites.

534
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,380
You'll be allowed to stay there on 001.

535
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,620
Alien station?

536
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,600
Now, we're going out.

537
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,640
W-Wait a minute! I'm actually a human!

538
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,580
Hey!

539
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,960
Damn! I can't take this off!

540
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,720
He suddenly became hot...

541
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,040
He went into the water and cooled himself, so he can't take it off.

542
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,440
Hahaha!

543
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,620
As expected of a 30-year-old boy who has spent 500 million yen on a child's play,

544
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,280
his father is also a human.

545
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,040
Come on, 0015, hurry up!

546
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,640
This isn't a joke, really!

547
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,420
Come on, 0015, let's go!

548
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,340
Wait a minute! I'm a human!

549
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,140
B-B-Boo-chan!

550
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,000
T-this can't be...

551
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,480
This can't be!

552
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,480
Come on, 0015!

553
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,820
0015, you have to stay with me!

554
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,220
0015, I'm not your father!

555
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,420
0015, don't go!

556
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,960
0015, I'll take care of you.

557
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,780
0015, don't go!

558
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:28,800
0015, come here!

559
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,240
0015!

560
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,600
0015!

561
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,720
0015!

562
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,800
I love you with tears that kiss me

563
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,080
How much can people get

564
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:46,620
With such irreplaceable things in their lives?

565
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,720
You are me, I am you

566
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,080
I was filled with just that

567
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,160
Just laughing at you

568
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,200
I felt that I was healed from all the pain

569
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,320
Are you that great a violinist, Strahd Batlius?

570
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,640
Is the violin that amazing?

571
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,400
Next time, Stradivarius

572
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,780
See you!
