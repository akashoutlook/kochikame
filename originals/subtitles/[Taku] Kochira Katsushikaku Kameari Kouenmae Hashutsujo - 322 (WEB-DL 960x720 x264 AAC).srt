19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,180
He's so cute.

20
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,200
I'm so excited to recognize him.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,540
Na-Nana-chan.

22
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,680
I don't understand how you feel about me.

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,240
What hard work I put into you.

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,460
I hate you, Honda-san!

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,340
Nana-chan.

00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,240
The customer's phone is not picking up.

Hana-chan...

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,300
An old pond.

30
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,080
The sound of water jumping into the river.

31
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,700
What are you saying?

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,280
You're an adult, but you don't know the Matsuo Basho?

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,240
Matsuo Basho?

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,660
A great haiku artist from the Edo period.

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,440
Over there.

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,920
This is the Basho.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,140
The Basho!

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,160
He set off on his journey from Kokofukagawa to Okuno Hosomichi.

39
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,280
Okuno Hosomichi?

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,100
Yes.

41
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,660
You'll know what life is like if you travel Okuno Hosomichi.

42
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,440
What life is like...

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,920
That's a difficult question.

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,000
Actually, my grandpa told me this.

45
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,460
He loves the Basho.

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,560
That's why you got influenced.

47
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,160
I'm Matsuoku Ichi.

48
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,360
I'm Honda Hayato.

49
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Um, why were you crying earlier?

50
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,440
Uh, I was embarrassed.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,480
Did you have a fight with your friend?

52
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,340
No.

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,460
My bad.

54
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,120
Is this really the name of the climax?

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,460
Maybe we should change it.

56
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,720
She was worried about her job, so I thought I'd cheer her up.

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,420
Um...

58
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,520
What?

59
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,340
I read the manuscript of that manga, and it was really interesting.

60
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,480
I don't know if anyone who's been a fan of the manga for a long time will be surprised.

61
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,840
Mr. Honda.

62
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,280
I know that you worked hard to write the manga, and I want you to have confidence.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,440
Mr. Honda, shut up.

64
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,940
N-Nana?

65
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,680
You don't know how I feel about you.

66
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,540
You don't know how hard it was for me.

67
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,340
I don't know how hard it was for you.

68
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,320
Nana.

69
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,940
I wanted to be a little bit of your strength.

70
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,780
But when I think about it, my advice is a hassle.

71
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,480
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,920
It's not that bad.

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,440
What?

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,540
I think so, but somehow...

75
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,420
Thank you.

76
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,480
The voice of cicadas that are quiet and stick to the rocks.

77
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,860
Is that a place?

78
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,680
Yes.

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,480
The sound of cicadas and cicadas is interesting.

80
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,420
It's a place that was said to be a place of the ears, and there were a lot of sounds.

81
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,900
Oh, the silence and the voice of cicadas that are sticking to the rocks.

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,260
The sound of cicadas is amazing, isn't it?

83
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a momentary flight to another world.

84
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,620
The sound of cicadas.

85
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,880
You don't have to be so nervous. You should get along with your friends.

86
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,920
I have to go.

87
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,880
See you.

88
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,960
Thank you.

89
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,800
See you.

90
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,660
See you.

91
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,320
The statue is moving!

92
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,180
It moves at 5 p.m.

93
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,380
Why does the statue move?

94
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,740
I want to show you the various directions of the Sumida River that traveled on the narrow road in the back.

95
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,660
It's amazing to be treated like that even after you die.

96
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,920
It's amazing.

97
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,460
Sorry, Nana.

98
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,100
Sarah, I am so sorry but how about your work?

99
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,680
"The moon, the day the stars, and its doğal bodies-

100
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,760

101
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,940
The moon, the day the stars, and its doğal bodies-

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,560
"We found the right way to write the name of the moon in the back of the Matsuoba oyun.

103
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,040
"The moon, the day the stars, and its doğal bodies-

104
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,600
and its doğal bodies-

"And the years as it starts to snow.

106
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,920
"And the years as it starts to snow.

107
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,860
That's right.

108
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,540
What does it mean?

109
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,100
The moon is a forever traveler and the snow is a traveler again.

110
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,260
That's what it means.

111
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,260
Why is the moon a traveler?

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,200
Even if I ask why...

113
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,700
Nakagawa can't explain it well.

114
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,720
Honda doesn't really know.

115
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,320
Because the sun is still low.

116
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,920
Mr. Honda, why are you suddenly interested in the place?

117
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,940
I met a junior high school student who was familiar with the place.

118
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,560
He's a pretty good junior high school student.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,300
My uncle is a fan of the place.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,560
I see.

121
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,320
When I met him at the grave in Sumida River, I was pretty depressed.

122
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,980
He was dumped by Nana Otohime.

123
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,900
No, I just got the wrong idea.

124
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,280
But you can't contact Otohime from then on, right?

125
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,900
That's what the public says.

126
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,900
Originally, the sales were high.

127
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,420
But you're a little cartoonist.

128
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,240
You give up on the moon and the moon.

129
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,060
I give up on a love that can't be fulfilled.

130
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,440
I don't want to!

131
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,280
Did that elementary school student comfort Mr. Honda who was depressed?

132
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,120
The poem of the place he read stuck in my heart.

133
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,460
Somehow I was really healed.

134
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,840
That's why I bought this book.

135
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,540
That's right.

136
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,680
That's a good story.

137
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,060
I know the place.

138
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,060
The frog jumped into the pond and fainted.

139
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,300
Oh, Ryo-chan.

140
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,760
It's completely different.

141
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,980
You sound like that to your seniors.

142
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,720
I can do more interesting things.

143
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
Like a pond.

144
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,540
I can predict the frog that comes out of Ryo's pond.

145
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,720
I don't feel like listening.

146
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,420
I don't want to listen.

147
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,740
You guys are making fun of me like that.

148
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,120
I have the talent of a writer.

149
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,260
I'm clear from the fact that I made a hit in a manga.

150
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,560
Frog is a little thing.

151
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,960
If you say so.

152
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,320
Then why don't you apply for this?

153
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,060
Director!

154
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,280
Good morning.

155
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Good morning.

156
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,700
What is it?

157
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,920
The

158
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,400
Ryo-san.

159
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,380
Done!

160
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,980
The

161
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,280
Ryo-san,

162
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,800
the

163
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,460
The

164
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:08,600
The

165
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:08,680
The

166
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,740
I'll change into a horse and come back.

167
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,000
You have a lot of words to say.

168
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,440
A horse?

169
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,540
I can't believe it's a miracle horse!

170
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,280
Stop it, idiot!

171
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,860
Listen, in haiku, you put a symbol that represents the season.

172
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,300
If it's spring, you put a symbol that represents the summer.

173
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,680
You don't know that, so what are you aiming for?

174
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
You're a laughing stock.

175
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,180
I know, Kigo-Grai.

176
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,620
I should put it in, right?

177
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,340
Speaking of spring...

178
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:41,840
I see.

179
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,800
How about Okashou and Tennoushou?

180
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,560
Recently, I have a stomachache and it hurts again.

181
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,440
That's not good.

182
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,580
Hey, you don't have any ignorance, do you, chief?

183
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,100
Idiot!

184
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,940
Okashou and Tennoushou?

185
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,360
You should apply to the central competition!

186
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,460
I apply to the central competition every week.

187
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,040
I'm not good at it.

188
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,460
Matsuo!

189
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,160
What?

190
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,220
I met you in Sumidagawa.

191
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,080
I'm a junior.

192
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,940
Matsuo Kuiichi, a junior, won last time.

193
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,600
He is the first member of the horse research team to be the chairman of this competition.

194
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,840
He is the grandson of the horse repairman Matsuo.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,660
He is a great candidate for the haiku world.

196
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,340
He won the competition, not the entrance competition.

197
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,760
I've seen this old man on TV.

198
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,680
Life is a journey.

199
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,920
You have to travel the narrow way of life.

200
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,940
You can see what life is like.

201
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,540
I want to tell you young people.

202
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,400
You are not playing games at home.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,780
You should travel the narrow way of life.

204
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,480
Have you seen that program?

205
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,800
Actually, I just read the narrow way of life.

206
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,840
Matsuo was the grandson of a famous person.

207
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,140
The winner last time, the grandson of the chairman?

208
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,440
The son-in-law of the haiku world, a friend of Honda.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,320
3,000,000 yen.

210
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,760
I can do it.

211
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,600
Here it is, sir.

212
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,000
If you climb the stairs in this gate, you will find the statue of the Buddha.

213
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,920
The shrine nearby is the new one.

214
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,640
You're getting better at it.

215
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,380
When you climb that staircase, you will find the Sumida River.

216
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,260
Yes.

217
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,380
Sumida River

218
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:30,420
Sumida River

219
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:39,520
The Sumida River

220
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,800
Yes.

221
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,040
Let's go at full speed.

222
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,420
The

223
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,880
I can't even without you.

224
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,520
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,600
No, it's OK.

226
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,360
*Cough*

227
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,360
I was aware of the place.

228
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,220
Uguisuga, hohohokekyo, hohoke...

229
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,320
No way! You should give up on winning.

230
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,160
I knew it.

231
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,680
No way! I'm wearing my uniform!

232
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,680
Amagaeru! Gero Gero Ge Gero! Gero Gero!

233
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,900
A little bit of a bug.

234
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,740
Well, I'm free to apply.

235
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,040
You're such a little brat.

236
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,580
But you're not in a good mood here.

237
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,680
The water bubble is a big investment.

238
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,340
I'll endure it for three million yen.

239
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,260
Then, why don't you introduce me to your grandpa?

240
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,780
I'll do anything, so please do me a favor.

241
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,420
Just like this, just like this.

242
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,040
You're unreasonable, senpai.

243
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,520
I have a place I want to go.

244
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,900
If you take me, I'll introduce you to your grandpa.

245
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,980
All right, let's go!

246
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,220
Where is it?

247
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,580
Odaiba? Roppongi? Shiodome?

248
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,640
Or is it a amusement park in Chiba?

249
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,680
Matsuo, where do you want to go?

250
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,220
Okuno Hosomichi.

251
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,760
It's 2,400 kilometers from here.

252
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
2,400 kilometers?

253
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,320
What a person!

254
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,240
Oh, no, a child of your own taste...

255
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,900
No, no, a child, what is it?

256
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,780
It's cheap. It's a Honda.

257
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,660
Take me there.

258
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,460
Me?

259
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,320
But will the people at home forgive me?

260
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,380
You don't have to worry about that.

261
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
I don't care if this old man here

262
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,980
is advertising Okuno Hosomichi.

263
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,960
Are you taking me?

264
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,040
Are you not?

265
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,580
But 2,400 kilometers is a big trip, senpai.

266
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,800
He's a child.

267
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,720
He won't find out if you drive on the road.

268
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,000
You can just go around Kanto Kinko on a bike.

269
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,520
Use this place a little.

270
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,460
Matsuo needs this trip now.

271
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,300
I got it!

272
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,040
Let's travel Okuno Hosomichi together, Matsuo!

273
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,880
Yay!

274
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,800
Matsuo, I'm glad you got your father and mother's permission.

275
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,920
I'm glad, I'm glad.

276
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,980
Now you can introduce me to my grandfather.

277
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,260
Yeah, I'll introduce you to him when we get back.

278
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,720
Well, I'll come pick you up early tomorrow morning.

279
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,560
Okay!

280
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Mr. Ryusenshi.

281
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,460
Miko!

282
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,600
I got a letter, so I came to deliver it.

283
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,000
If you'd just give me your phone number, I'd be able to pick it up.

284
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,420
I have to apologize to Mr. Ryusenshi.

285
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Okay, he sent it.

286
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,220
Miko, do you want to go as it is?

287
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,120
Yes. I'm sorry for being too selfish.

288
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,600
Why are you apologizing? I'm so happy, Miko.

289
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,320
Eh?

290
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,800
This is an adventure for Miko Ai, in a way.

291
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,880
It might be possible that people will leave me and go further.

292
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,120
It was really fun.

293
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,320
It was really interesting.

294
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,780
If you've been a fan for a long time, you might be a little surprised.

295
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,220
If you're ready, I'll be happy to fight with you.

296
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,780
Mr. Ryusenshi.

297
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,520
Let's go this time.

298
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,160
Thank you very much.

299
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,800
Thank you.

300
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,760
Mr. Honda.

301
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,820
How are you feeling?

302
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,560
Matsumoto Shonen.

303
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,760
Yeah, it's great.

304
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,040
It's different from the usual Honda.

305
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Mr. Honda and Matsuo.

306
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,180
How are you feeling now?

307
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,240
Maybe I'm a little better than before.

308
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,280
Okay, I'm done.

309
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,620
When I get back, I'll pay you 3 million yen.

310
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,260
It's a good result.

311
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,660
Is there a detective named Honda?

312
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,180
Oh, it's a teacher who is a teacher of haiku.

313
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,620
What?

314
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,100
Then it's Mr. Matsuokuchi's grandfather.

315
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,700
Mr. Matsuo.

316
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,380
Actually, I've been studying haiku for many years.

317
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,100
I'm in the haiku competition of the "Mai-cho" newspaper.

318
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,680
I'm studying haiku to apply for the "Mai-cho" newspaper.

319
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,440
I heard that your grandson Kuichi went with a detective named Honda.

320
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,740
They went on a trip to the "Oku no Hosomichi" early this morning.

321
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,120
What?

322
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,660
To the "Oku no Hosomichi"?

323
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,400
Mr. Kuichi's parents should know.

324
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,420
I haven't heard anything.

325
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,500
Call them back right now.

326
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,640
Call them back?

327
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,760
Your granddaughter was looking forward to this trip.

328
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,560
First of all, that's just a child.

329
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,680
What if she gets hurt?

330
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,860
Call them back quickly.

331
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,500
Yes, I will call them back right away.

332
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,100
Who are you?

333
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,820
I'm a man who lives in haiku.

334
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,380
I'll call you right away.

335
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,700
If I can't get the grandfather's attention, I don't have any money.

336
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,620
Is the customer's phone in a place where the radio does not reach?

337
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,580
At least keep it loose.

338
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,120
What's wrong? Can't you contact me?

339
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,560
I'm home.

340
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,660
I'll put in some tea.

341
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,020
I'll buy some tea and sweets.

342
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,960
I'll go to the patrol.

343
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,060
I'll go to the patrol.

344
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,240
You guys!

345
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,000
If anything happens to your granddaughter, I'll call you back.

346
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,120
I understand.

347
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,200
I'll find her right away.

348
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm sorry.

349
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
I have to catch Honda soon.

350
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,920
I'll lose 300 million yen.

351
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,940
"Ara and the sound"

352
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,860
"Ao and Wakaba's sunlight"

353
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,720
Honda, that's Nikko.

354
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,320
It's a great view.

355
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,420
"Aro and Wakaba"

356
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,180
Then, let's take a rest here.

357
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,900
Yes.

358
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,100
"Aro and Wakaba's sunlight"

359
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,380
Hi, I ate kelp rice ball.

360
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,900
You have a different personality from when you rode a motorbike.

361
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,880
People often say that.

362
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,820
Matso's is Umeboshi.

363
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,480
Matso, do you hate Umeboshi?

364
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,000
Shall I exchange it for you?

365
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,200
You're welcome.

366
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,420
"Aro and Wakaba's sunlight"

367
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm glad you came, Matsuo.

368
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,060
Yeah, my grandpa always said on TV,

369
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,140
"You'll know what life is like when you travel on the narrow path."

370
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,740
You're young, but you're really amazing.

371
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,100
I'm not amazing.

372
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,220
You have a lot of respect for your grandpa. You like him, don't you?

373
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,860
I don't like grandpa.

374
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,660
What?

375
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,080
Your grandpa says on TV, "Go on the narrow path."

376
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,740
Yeah.

377
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,980
Then you've been there, haven't you?

378
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,300
Well, I haven't been there, but...

379
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,060
What? Your grandpa is a liar!

380
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,060
Liar!

381
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,280
He's not a liar.

382
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,760
On the narrow path? You're still too young!

383
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,320
But everyone at school...

384
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,960
Instead, think about the haiku you're going to do in the competition.

385
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
Grandpa...

386
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,820
Grandpa only thinks about haiku, and he doesn't think about my feelings.

387
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,480
Tell everyone to go on the narrow path.

388
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,780
Why can't I?

389
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,700
Matsuo, do you really hate haiku?

390
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,000
No.

391
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,900
I like haiku because it's fun.

392
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,940
I see. It's hard.

393
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,300
I don't like Umeboshi, but my grandpa says it's good for your health.

394
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,940
You don't have to force yourself. Eat this.

395
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,820
Yeah, thanks. But I'll eat it after I eat Umeboshi.

396
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,700
I see. All right, I'll give you a lot. Eat a lot.

397
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,540
Yeah. It's sold on the side-car and I'm hungry, so I think I can eat it.

398
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,020
All right, let's eat.

399
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,820
Here you go.

400
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,500
Thank you.

401
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,600
Thank you.

402
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,160
Senpai, I haven't contacted Mr. Honda yet.

403
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,020
Does Grandpa want to wait all the time?

404
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:23,960
Uh?

405
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,420
Nana!

406
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,100
Mr. Honda is here.

407
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,680
Well...

408
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,500
Welcome, Reiko.

409
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,500
Actually...

410
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,380
The narrow path in the back?

411
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,100
Yes. A policeman who said "Honda" brought out a baby who was old enough to be lost.

412
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,420
"Honda" is...

413
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,580
A tabula kasu...

414
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,520
Mr. Honda knows how people feel.

415
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,340
He's a kind person.

416
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,080
Yeah.

417
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,580
I believe in Mr. Honda.

418
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,720
I heard that Mr. Honda was dumped after fighting with her.

419
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,780
Yeah.

420
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,120
It seems that Mr. Honda was a chicken-back slave.

421
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,400
Get on the phone, Mr. Honda!

422
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,940
Hello, senpai!

423
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,020
Mr. Honda, you idiot!

424
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
Where are you?

425
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,180
We're in Nikko right now.

426
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,160
It's a nice day and I'm feeling good.

427
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,020
Nikko, you idiot!

428
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,260
Are you all right, Honda?

429
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,640
What?

430
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,160
I can't hear you, senpai.

431
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:18,840
Are you all right?

432
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,320
I'm angry, so hurry up!

433
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,180
Shut up!

434
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,100
Go on!

435
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,020
Alright, I got it!

436
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,320
I'm on my way.

437
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,800
What?

438
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,300
I'm in trouble!

439
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,300
Mr. Honda, I didn't go to you!

440
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,060
Your phone is somewhere where the radio doesn't reach.

441
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,660
Oh, crap!

442
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:38,960
Oh, crap!

443
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,560
Kasane is the name of the "Nanarubeshi" of the Yaenadeshiko.

444
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,100
Sora!

445
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,020
Mr. Honda!

446
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,260
Hey, what's up, you crazy boy?

447
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,360
N-Nothing, I just called you.

448
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,740
Ha, just called you.

449
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,680
We're friends, right?

450
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,480
What did you say?

451
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,240
N-Nothing.

452
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,740
It's a phone.

453
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,580
I'll stop it for a moment.

454
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,240
Alright.

455
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,580
Here it comes.

456
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,020
The voice calling Mr. Honda.

457
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,740
Mr. Honda?

458
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:17,880
Who is it?

459
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,500
I can't! It's already here!

460
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
Hello, Mr. Honda.

461
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,180
Where are you?

462
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:24,840
Hello.

463
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,960
Mr. Honda?

464
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,400
Hello, the phone has changed because Mr. Honda is crying.

465
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,800
It's factory review.

466
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,320
Please let Mr. Honda know that something he wants to see.

467
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,100
Something he wants to see?

468
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,420
Who do you think you're talking to?

469
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,380
Give me a break!

470
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,760
Kuu-chan, are you Kuuichi?

471
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,900
Huh?

472
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,960
Hello, Nana?

473
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,680
Kuuichi? Who are you?

474
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,260
Are you Mr. Honda?

475
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,240
Well...

476
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,220
If you're Mr. Honda, please take my place.

477
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,020
Bring your grandchild back here.

478
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,340
He'll be back soon.

479
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,780
Matsuo is worried about something.

480
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,420
Please listen to him.

481
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,640
Kuuichi, leave me alone!

482
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,300
Matsuo, the old man wants you to take his place.

483
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,320
Give it back to me.

484
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,680
Hello?

485
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,840
Mr. Honda?

486
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,560
Mr. Honda?

487
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,700
What's wrong?

488
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,040
He's gone.

489
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:13,820
What?

490
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,460
He's gone.

491
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,040
I was really worried about him.

492
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,140
Nana, I want you to see something.

493
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,360
See something?

494
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,640
That's what I said.

495
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,120
I said, "Go back."

496
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,360
You want to go back, don't you?

497
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,020
Not really.

498
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,240
It's fine if you go back.

499
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,460
Let's continue this journey together someday.

500
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,080
Okay.

501
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,660
Bye.

502
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,080
Bye.

503
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,510
Amazing.

504
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,680
I'll never get it right again.

505
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,980
Bye.

506
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,680
I'll never run away.

507
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,260
Hey, big brother.

508
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,940
Looks like he's Create a New Alpha.

509
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,220
Stop, Big Brother.

510
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:00,520
And you'll never be able to break away from this.

511
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,260
And you'll never be able to come to the opposite side of the room.

512
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,300
Bye.

513
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:02,960
Bye.

514
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,280
I'm just kidding.

515
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,300
Yes.

516
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:06,480
Grandpa!

517
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,620
Rui!

518
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:08,780
Grandpa!

519
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,640
Are you all right? Are you hungry?

520
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,300
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

521
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,380
It's okay. Let's go home.

522
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,400
Nono-chan!

523
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm gonna cry.

524
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,600
What's wrong, Reiko-san?

525
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,320
This is Nada-chan's comic.

526
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,060
It's always so moving.

527
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,660
There's something in my heart.

528
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,080
Oh! Let me read it next time.

529
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,240
Me too! Me too!

530
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,440
If you don't mind, here you go.

531
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,320
Honda-kun!

532
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:34,920
Thank you.

533
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,520
Thank you.

534
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,180
These are all the same magazine!

535
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,800
I bought them all the time when I saw them.

536
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,840
Honda-kun, you're able to get back together with her, aren't you?

537
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,420
Yeah.

538
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,640
Thanks to you,

539
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,800
I have the confidence to work hard as the shrine maiden of love.

540
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,500
You'll always watch over me, won't you?

541
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,860
I always watch over you.

542
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,160
I'll always watch over you.

543
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,460
Thank you.

544
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,860
Nana-chan!

545
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,580
You're more loving than ever.

546
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,900
You're more like manga than ever.

547
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,240
You're more like manga than ever.

548
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,700
Honda-san!

549
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Matsuo-kun!

550
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,700
You talked to your grandpa, didn't you?

551
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,240
Yeah.

552
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,680
And we decided to play soccer as well!

553
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,020
We're playing next week!

554
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,360
Really?

555
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,200
I'm going to cheer you on!

556
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,860
You made up with him, didn't you?

557
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,540
Yeah.

558
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,260
Well, see you later!

559
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:22,780
Yeah.

560
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,300
You did well, Matsuo-kun.

561
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,900
By the way, where's your senior?

562
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,100
He didn't come.

563
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,240
He didn't come back to Ryo's place, either.

564
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,580
Where could he have gone?

565
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,160
Well, he had gone home.

566
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,080
Only one thing.

567
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,620
I thought you'd told me.

568
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,660
You were all so happy, Ryo!

569
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:43,720
I'm so happy!

570
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,260
I'd be so happy too, but this is too much for me!

571
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,520
Hey, I'm getting jealous!

572
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:45,700
Not swipe it!

573
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,240
It's too much for me.

574
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:56,460
Kouya-kun!

575
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,700
Should I remain quiet for three minutes?

576
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,340
Hey!

577
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,240
I have a question for you!

578
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,620
So?

579
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,720
I was drawn to the world

580
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,840
I felt it at that time

581
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,720
A strange feeling

582
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:19,700
So I tried to walk on the black side of the arcade

583
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:26,260
The dial of the arcade

584
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,620
Everyone was a child once

585
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,920
Everyone forgets

586
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,280
A politician with a great face

587
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,020
A blue lady with blue eyes

588
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,960
Turn around and see

589
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,340
That corner

590
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,240
You can meet everyone

591
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,260
There is a camera

592
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,600
There must be a camera

593
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,280
Everyone come on

594
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,900
Let's go

595
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,780
To our town

596
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,420
There is a camera

597
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,780
There must be a camera

598
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,500
Everyone come on

599
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,020
Let's go to our town

600
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,020
Thank you!

601
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,020
The one who will re-examine the exit is coming?

602
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,840
It's a story that the chief will be burned

603
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,320
Hey, chief!

604
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,100
Chief!

605
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,580
Isn't it a great fever?

606
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,220
Are you okay?

607
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,420
Are you okay with such a flurry

608
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,680
What happens to the exit when the chief does that?

609
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,720
Next time

610
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,920
Chief please sleep

611
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,780
Yoshikura

612
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,260
There is a camera

613
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,900
There must be a camera

614
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,220
Everyone come on

615
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,760
To our town

616
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,860
Thank you!
