1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,420
Tea possibilities

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,340
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,140
Look at each other in the room, then try to stay away

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,820
The day of inner peace floats like a twilight

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,980
Look at the radiating sun

6
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,700
How kind of you

7
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:09,000
From the tapestry of a plump hat

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,300
To the taishakuten

9
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,480
The sun is setting

10
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,760
Tomorrow is over already

11
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,380
Why is it over?

12
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,020
If I win, I'll lose happiness again

13
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,720
I noticed, I'm such an idiot

14
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,820
48 hours, a world tour

15
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,160
Are you reading a foreign magazine again?

16
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,960
What kind of magazine is that?

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,240
It's a magazine for young women in France

18
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,000
It's for various reasons

19
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,700
I'm just a random person

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,060
I'm fine with being dizzy

21
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,000
What do you think, Nakagawa?

22
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,800
Did you say something, senpai?

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,960
This is a foreign newspaper

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,020
You guys don't seem like you're from the city

25
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,080
Is that so?

26
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,980
Isn't this a great professor?

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,500
It's really Professor Ezaki

28
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,680
What's wrong with Professor Ezaki?

29
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,960
He's going to announce something at the university in New York

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,740
He's going to announce something at the university in New York

31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,860
He's going to announce something at the university in New York

32
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:23,980
It's his research

33
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,060
It's not good

34
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,040
It's not good

35
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,700
What?

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,340
It's a train

37
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,280
Really?

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,280
I have a bad feeling about this

39
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,700
Everyone fell asleep for a while

40
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,640
See?

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,000
Professor Ezaki

42
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,500
How disgusting

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:46,780
I feel bad

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,840
I feel bad

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,040
I feel bad

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,860
I've lived in all the countries in the world

47
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,100
I came to the conclusion that Japan is the most wonderful country in the world

48
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,880
It's true that it's Japanese

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,200
You're clearly mistaken

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,060
You're clearly mistaken

51
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,820
You're clearly mistaken

52
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,400
You're clearly mistaken

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,720
What are you doing?

54
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,940
Don't look at me with that dirty face!

55
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,480
Ouch! What are you doing?

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,500
I'm going to sell a train for 100 million yen

57
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,780
1 million yen?

58
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,880
1 million yen?

59
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,060
That means

60
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:52,040
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

61
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:59,940
. Thank you for always caring and thanking you.

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,100
Let's introduce myself.

63
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,440
Please, everyone, thank you.

64
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,280
I'm looking forward to working with you.

65
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,320
Please come this way.

66
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,080
I am the origin of Japanese Wabi-sabi.

67
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,940
The heart of tea is the mother's heart.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,060
If you drink it, you will be alive.

69
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,900
Please enjoy your meal.

70
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,020
Ryuuho!

71
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,580
Please.

72
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,580
Then, I'll enjoy my meal.

73
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,640
Please enjoy your meal.

74
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,400
I need to use the bathroom.

75
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,480
20 million yen!

76
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,780
Please wait!

77
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,020
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,920
What's in that plastic bag?

79
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,880
I'll check it.

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,540
Well, this is...

81
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,660
What's wrong, Ryuuho?

82
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,000
You did something again, didn't you?

83
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,440
I didn't do anything...

84
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,540
Stop cutting my hair!

85
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,080
This is...

86
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,680
...the best salt!

87
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,040
Oh, senpai!

88
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,300
The treasure of the pond!

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,120
What?

90
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,880
Don't be so careless.

91
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,520
You're not going to be able to taste it.

92
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,240
What are you talking about?

93
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,140
Look at that!

94
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,520
That's an ordinary voice, not an inborn voice.

95
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,560
What?

96
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,840
Come to think of it...

97
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,140
It's all black.

98
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,600
That's right.

99
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm in trouble.

100
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
You're going to be suspicious.

101
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,540
Don't lie!

102
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,840
Even if I lie, I won't let you fool me.

103
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,840
That's right!

104
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,460
I won't let you fool me!

105
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,560
What?

106
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,060
*Gasp*

107
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,020
Look at this!

108
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,540
*Groan*

109
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,240
Oh! The color's changed!

110
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,520
The pattern's changed from the bottom!

111
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,680
It's exactly as it is. I painted it black and faked it.

112
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,100
Ryo-chan!

113
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,280
*Groan*

114
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,940
As expected of your husband.

115
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,580
I'm so happy that you saw through this trick in one look.

116
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,420
*Groan*

117
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,200
*Groan*

118
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,820
*Groan*

119
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,780
*Groan*

120
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,160
You're being so arrogant. You really didn't know anything.

121
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,220
What are you talking about?

122
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,740
Your husband saw through everything that happened.

123
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,060
*Groan*

124
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,720
*Groan*

125
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,080
Oh! It's black again!

126
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,920
What?

127
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,240
The real thing is...

128
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,760
*Groan*

129
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,120
Here!

130
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,400
*Groan*

131
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,220
Your husband did a great job.

132
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,020
He hid the real thing in advance and painted it in the normal color,

133
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,840
and then let it go into the pond.

134
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,340
*Groan*

135
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,380
*Groan*

136
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,800
That's exactly right, Ojaru!

137
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,880
You knew everything, Ojaru!

138
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,260
Wow! Kiyo did everything.

139
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,780
You're really good at this, Professor.

140
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,840
*Groan*

141
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,740
This old lady is really something.

142
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,260
*Groan*

143
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,500
By the way, everyone, I have something else I'd like to show you.

144
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,180
*Groan*

145
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,660
This is the videotape I'll use when I announce this at the next conference.

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,180
If this is announced,

147
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,340
the whole world will pay attention to my theory of learning, Ojaru!

148
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,640
Show this tape to everyone in the audience.

149
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,060
*Groan*

150
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,520
Ezaki Korosuke, stop!

151
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,640
*Groan*

152
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,020
One point!

153
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,640
You're breathing is so scary.

154
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,680
Damn you, you old man.

155
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,720
Watch this.

156
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,440
*Groan*

157
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,560
*Groan*

158
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,060
*Groan*

159
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,100
*Groan*

160
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,000
*Groan*

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,160
*Groan*

162
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,620
*Groan*

163
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,420
KINPU HUNTER~ The thoughtless Massacre

164
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,960
Fufu...

165
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,020
Wh-what?

166
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,020
Hey, we wouldn't let anyone announce something like this at the conference, right?

167
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,320
No, no, that's not it!

168
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,200
That's not it either!

169
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,620
That is the wrong tape.

170
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,820
Where did the wrong tape go?!

171
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,400
Master!

172
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,000
Did I misprint the videotapes sent by the young ladies last week?

173
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,740
Oh no!

174
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,300
I sent them myself, open-minded.

175
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,580
*Groan*

176
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,940
At this rate,

177
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,200
Is this a worldwide announcement?

178
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,600
It seems like a very important tape.

179
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,800
You've forgotten to take a look at it.

180
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,100
If I contact you right away,

181
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,140
will you send it to me or will you go get it?

182
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,640
I don't know who sent it.

183
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,000
Is it Haruko, Natsuko, Akiko,

184
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,340
or Fuyuko?

185
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,420
No!

186
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,120
The conference is tomorrow.

187
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,880
There are only 48 hours!

188
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,280
Only 48 hours?

189
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,540
Where do your daughters live?

190
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,100
Haruko is a smuggler in the jungle in Africa.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,740
Natsuko is investigating the location of the submarine at the Bamiuda Sea.

192
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,240
Akiko is currently on a dog-hunting tour of the North Pole.

193
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,920
Fuyuko is... Where is she?

194
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,260
They're all in a terrible place.

195
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,140
What's going on?

196
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,760
If I don't get that tape, I'm done!

197
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,180
What?

198
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,320
Let's go on our own!

199
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,760
Huh?

200
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,900
Please be careful.

201
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,760
For your husband, even if it's in the fire or water...

202
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,420
Professor, I'll take care of the plane.

203
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,800
No!

204
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,400
Thank you!

205
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,480
A world tour?

206
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,080
Sounds fun.

207
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,800
Okay! I'm going too!

208
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,420
You two be careful.

209
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,800
Hey, hey!

210
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,420
It's Keiichi!

211
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,760
Hey, did you hear that?

212
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,980
Is it really that great of a tape?

213
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,660
It's the person who said it, so there's no mistake.

214
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,940
If he takes that tape, he'll make a lot of money on it.

215
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,400
Then we're winners, right, kei?

216
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,440
Let's go.

217
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,980
Wh- what the check!?

218
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,960
Hang in there!

219
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,280
This is the fastest!

220
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,580
It's still too early!

221
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,520
So you're already in Africa?

222
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,560
Africa is wonderful!

223
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,780
Look at these animals!

224
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,560
This is the kingdom of nature!

225
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,440
You guys don't have to fight like that.

226
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,320
Why don't you act like me, and act naturally?

227
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,540
Then you can talk to the lions!

228
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,500
You're lying!

229
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,320
I'm not lying! Look!

230
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,360
That's a cat!

231
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,640
Look! The words are working!

232
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,240
Yes, yes!

233
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,860
You can do this, too!

234
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,520
How's that?

235
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,080
It's a touching moment for both of us!

236
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,420
Thanks to you, Grandma!

237
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,300
I can do this, too!

238
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,380
They're here.

239
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,560
We finally made it.

240
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,480
Here we go!

241
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,060
The owner of the house is having coffee.

242
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,960
This is Africa.

243
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,540
The Kiriman is really good.

244
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,640
It's not the time to drink coffee.

245
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,760
We have to do something!

246
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,880
We have to talk to the lions!

247
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,460
Don't panic.

248
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,880
Be quiet!

249
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,800
It's tea time!

250
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,120
What?

251
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,440
Amazing.

252
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,200
The lion is staring at us.

253
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,740
The owner is really good!

254
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,160
That's why I told you.

255
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,680
Don't panic.

256
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,700
You were just drinking coffee.

257
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,460
What?

258
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,960
It's a car!

259
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,180
You guys!

260
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,760
Catch the last one!

261
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,740
It's me!

262
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,780
It's me!

263
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:43,880
It's me!

264
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,780
It's me!

265
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,340
It's a surprise to me.

266
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,840
It's too scary.

267
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,240
It's not a secret!

268
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,440
It's época!

269
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,580
Everyone, follow me!

270
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,540
What!

271
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:13,900
Dah!

272
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,760
Don't!

273
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,140
Oh no!

274
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,900
It's bad! Run!

275
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,600
I won't let you!

276
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,760
I'll kill you!

277
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,300
The prisoners!

278
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,480
Please be careful!

279
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,440
We're arresting them all!

280
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,260
Oh, Mr. Harukojo!

281
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,940
What? That's...

282
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,760
Light coffee is American.

283
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,800
Cute coffee is African.

284
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,900
Dad's video letter?

285
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,420
If that's the case, it was just a picture of Dad.

286
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,000
So it wasn't you...

287
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,580
Then...

288
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,080
What the hell is this place?

289
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,500
Ah! Dad!

290
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,400
So the video letter didn't have anything different on it?

291
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,900
No, it wasn't.

292
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:31,720
It's a signal!

293
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,700
The sea is the source of all life.

294
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,680
This fantastic ocean...

295
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,940
I want to show it to you and everyone else.

296
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,900
If you're as good as your husband,

297
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,220
you can do anything!

298
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,560
Ho ho ho ho ho ho!

299
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,600
You're just dead!

300
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,960
Ha ha ha ha!

301
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,320
Uwaaah!

302
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,040
Help me!

303
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,140
This is the place!

304
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,040
There's only 12 hours left!

305
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,240
Ha ha ha ha!

306
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,040
I wonder what it is...

307
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,140
Hm?

308
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,020
What is it?

309
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,260
Stop!

310
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,320
Ha ha ha!

311
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,880
Ha ha ha ha!

312
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,700
What?

313
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,920
...

314
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,780
A video letter?

315
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,720
I sent it by mistake.

316
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,280
It's an important tape used at the meeting.

317
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,340
I don't have time to read the letters I got, so I brought them all.

318
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,460
That's it!

319
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,220
Damn it!

320
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,440
No!

321
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,260
-Hakuna- -Hakuna-

322
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,480
-Shut up! -Shut up!

323
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,880
Why me?

324
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:20,680
-Shut up! -Shut up!

325
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,820
This guy...

326
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,640
Shut up.

327
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,320
What do you want, big brother?

328
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,020
Help!

329
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:43,920
Help!

330
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,440
How is it, master?

331
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,220
This is also different.

332
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,940
It's Fuyuko's place, but where is she now?

333
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,780
Oh, dad. If it's Fuyuko...

334
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,180
Is she really going to space?

335
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:13,100
Here. This is it, dad.

336
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,560
I thought it was weird.

337
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,340
This is it. There's no doubt.

338
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,120
Congratulations on the completion of the meeting, master.

339
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,820
But we have to hurry.

340
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,960
We only have three hours until the announcement.

341
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,820
The car is coming.

342
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,840
Keiichi-mon, here you are.

343
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,500
Thank you for your hard work.

344
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,200
From here, we should be able to go to the venue in 30 minutes.

345
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,960
40 minutes left until the announcement.

346
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,420
We're barely in time.

347
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,380
Hey, you have the tape, right?

348
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,140
If you say you lost it after coming this far, it won't be fun.

349
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,300
Don't worry.

350
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,100
I'll put it here.

351
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,380
What was that?

352
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,080
What was that?

353
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
I took the tape!

354
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,700
What did you say?

355
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,100
I'll take this tape!

356
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,000
My world's biggest announcement is...

357
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,320
I'm going to chase that crazy guy!

358
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:24,800
All right!

359
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,520
Get ready!

360
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,120
Yeah.

361
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,260
I give it a shot!

362
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,100
All right.

363
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,200
Go, go, go!

364
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,200
If you run into a man, he'll cut you!

365
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
You'll have to do it yourself!

366
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,600
What you're saying is right.

367
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,460
I'm afraid this won't be a good thing.

368
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,720
Really?

369
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,580
I'm sorry, Master.

370
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:00,840
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,260
I'm just...

372
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,560
I'm sorry.

373
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,880
I'm sorry, Master.

374
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,040
I'm sorry.

375
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,760
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,120
Drink it up, will ya?

377
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,020
Oh no, it's a traffic jam.

378
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,340
Damn it!

379
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,040
We're going to use that thing!

380
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,360
Huh?

381
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,620
It's the Kiba Police's horse, isn't it?

382
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,060
Alright, Nakagawa!

383
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,480
You're going to have to get the titan to the venue somehow!

384
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,320
Huh?

385
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,340
Ah, Senpai!

386
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,680
Damn it!

387
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,560
Hurry up!

388
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,280
Hey, you thief!

389
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,780
Wait!

390
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,700
Give me the tape!

391
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,160
Bro, they're chasing us with their horses!

392
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,500
Damn it, they're so quiet!

393
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,120
Bro, it's a traffic jam!

394
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,600
Damn it!

395
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,720
We're going to break through!

396
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,380
Stop!

397
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,960
Stop!

398
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,540
Stop!

399
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,140
Stop!

400
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,540
Ah, Grandma!

401
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,300
We're alive!

402
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,800
It's time for us to stop!

403
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,000
W-What's this?

404
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,460
This isn't a circus!

405
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,400
Ah, you guys!

406
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,100
Run!

407
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,480
Hey! Give it back!

408
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,400
Wait!

409
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,660
What's going on?

410
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,840
What are you doing?

411
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,020
Shut up and put the blanks back!

412
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,880
I wonder if they'll come after me.

413
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,200
I'm going to go, big brother!

414
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,840
Oh no!

415
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:55,900
Oh no!

416
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,060
It's heavy!

417
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,280
I'll never let go!

418
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,620
Big brother!

419
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,780
I can't take this anymore!

420
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,140
Hey! What are you sleeping on?

421
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,640
What is this?

422
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,720
It's a bath!

423
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,520
What are you doing?

424
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,220
I'm going to get the tape back!

425
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,360
Why me?

426
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,440
I did it!

427
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,220
My husband!

428
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,840
I got the tape back safely!

429
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,260
What an old lady!

430
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,460
To horrible!

431
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,080
So, now it's the professor Esaki's present.

432
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,420
First, please take a look at the videotape.

433
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,740
Yeah, it's tape we had a lot of trouble with.

434
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,160
Show me what you've got.

435
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,080
I want you to know something.

436
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,560
Who's coming this time?

437
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,720
Right!

438
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,420
G

439
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,800
W-What is this stupid anime?

440
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,480
It has nothing to do with the main subject!

441
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,220
Imperator!

442
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,200
It's an interesting joke!

443
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,020
Bravo!

444
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,720
It's so interesting!

445
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,160
Splendid, sir!

446
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,940
The humor that makes the whole world laugh!

447
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,860
What exactly was our trouble?

448
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,140
What exactly was our trouble?

449
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,200
Ezaki Korosuke, Japan's best!

450
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,800
Thank you!

451
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,760
Thank you!

452
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,260
Thank you!

453
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:57,900
Yeah!

The final energy

459
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,780
Looking at tomorrow, believing in yesterday

460
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,500
Drawing the universe, standing on the ground

461
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,780
The planet with a turtle is spinning

462
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,820
I wrote a poem

463
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,240
This is good, right?

464
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,560
There's no excuse, right?

465
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,740
Maria

466
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,300
This is Maria.

467
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,560
I've been with Ryo-sama for over a year, but I haven't made any progress at all.

468
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:33,560
So, when I consulted with Komachi-san, he said that there was no choice but to make a "magnificent reality".

469
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,740
Next time, "Maria's Love Tekken".

470
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
Thank you for watching!
