"Camping"

36
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,980
There are so many bicycles!

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,980
Are you going to take all of them, Kanchi?

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,720
Hey, if we leave them, they'll get in the way of the passage.

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,020
Leave them in the bicycle storage for a while.

40
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,220
If no one comes to pick them up, they'll be disposed of.

41
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,800
Are there people who don't come to pick them up?

42
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,340
Every year, about 2 million bicycles are disposed of.

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,000
But half of the people who come to pick them up are disposed of.

44
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,940
Really?

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,600
What a waste of money.

46
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,760
Hey, wait!

47
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,180
What?

48
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,720
You want a bicycle, don't you?

49
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,920
You said you wanted to see the bicycle disposal work today.

50
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,560
I'll go with you.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:37,140
Now that you mention it, I've been interested in bicycles lately.

52
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,820
No doubt about it.

53
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,800
Lemon, do you want a bicycle?

54
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,060
What are you talking about? Bicycles are expensive.

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,300
Hey, what do you mean you want one?

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,060
You really want one, don't you?

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,440
I'll make it for you.

58
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,620
Really, Kankichi?

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,820
Yeah, leave it to me.

60
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,660
Hey, are you sure you're going to pay cheaply?

61
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,760
Don't worry.

62
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,960
There are 1 million bicycles disposed of every year.

63
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,640
If you take the parts from the bicycle that's out of warranty, you can make any kind of bicycle.

64
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,880
It's done, Lemon.

65
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,900
Wow!

66
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,740
Oh, this is a new one.

67
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,900
It has your name on it.

68
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,920
It stops right away.

69
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,340
I'm going to change the gear.

70
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm going to change the gear.

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,260
The gear process is also changed automatically.

72
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,940
When you speed up, the weight moves to change the gear.

73
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,860
The frame is made of carbon and aluminum.

74
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,760
It's light, so it doesn't rust.

75
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,940
The wheel is made of 14-inch magnesium.

76
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,320
The rear wheel is a 2.5-inch German Netszler.

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,080
Wow.

78
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,840
It looks so cool.

79
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,920
This one is really great.

80
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,520
What a surprise.

81
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,320
There's even a wallet behind the saddle.

82
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,460
There are always 30,000 yen in my bicycle.

83
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,520
Why?

84
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,280
You know, sometimes you need money while you're out.

85
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,780
Like buying a horse.

86
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,580
You're the only one.

87
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,460
Huh? Try it.

88
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,100
Y-Yeah!

89
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,120
Huh?

90
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,440
Alright! Good!

91
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,060
Huh?

92
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,580
It's comfortable!

93
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,900
Thanks, Kankichi!

94
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,140
No problem.

95
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:26,880
Huh?

96
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,980
Lemon, you're going to kindergarten on that bike?

97
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,840
I used to go from Ochanomizu to Surugadai to play.

98
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,300
But I thought I'd leave home soon.

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
You were going to kindergarten in Ichibancho?

100
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,760
You're good at climbing the Kudanzaka.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,680
When the market goes up, the gear fee changes.

102
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,420
Kanda has many slopes.

103
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,400
And she can climb up with the strength of a lemon.

104
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,060
It's high-tech for a kid.

105
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,440
Thanks to that, my favorite lemon in the house became out-door.

106
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,180
I'll come to this station by bicycle.

107
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,780
No way, Ryo-chan.

108
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,160
It takes hours to climb the Kameari from Kanda.

109
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,100
That's true.

110
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,140
We're here to play, Kankichi!

111
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,760
Huh?

112
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:21,960
Huh?

113
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,880
You came here by bicycle from Kanda?

114
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,280
Of course not!

115
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,680
Huh?

116
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,540
Geppardo!

117
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,860
From there.

118
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,060
Huh?

119
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,960
You came here by bicycle?

120
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,320
I'm going to run around here!

121
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,340
Don't go far away!

122
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,700
Then I'll go with you.

123
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,400
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

124
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,340
You have something to do.

125
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,460
What is it?

126
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,800
I wanted you to make a bicycle.

127
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
A bicycle?

128
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,540
You're not going to ride it?

129
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,560
I'm a high school girl.

130
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,280
I used to run along the Sumida River a lot.

131
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,720
It's gone!

132
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,000
I can't imagine it!

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,640
Anyway,

134
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,020
The bicycle is for the shop.

135
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,980
Super Kanda sushi?

136
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,080
The young man stole it when he went to the shop.

137
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,980
I want a replacement.

138
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,900
Make it right away.

139
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,020
Why do I have to make it?

140
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,380
I just have to buy it.

141
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,940
I don't want to waste money.

142
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,440
I refuse. I'm busy.

143
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,420
You refuse?

144
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,220
How many days until the next payday?

145
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,860
How many days until the next payday?

146
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,060
What?

147
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,620
Recently, you have been coming to eat at home when you run out of money before your payday.

148
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,260
If I say a word, I can ban you from going out.

149
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,100
You come to a painful place.

150
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,560
You will make it, right?

151
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,220
I got it. I can make it.

152
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,160
I will definitely steal it.

153
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm asking you not to steal it.

154
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,780
I made it.

155
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,980
Which one?

156
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,920
Ta-da.

157
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,240
A bicycle that will never be stolen.

158
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,740
It's an ordinary bicycle.

159
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,080
However, this saddle is a kind of landing.

160
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,480
If you carry a saddle, you can't get away.

161
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,940
Furthermore, the handle, the pedals, and the tires.

162
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,780
If you walk all the way here, you will not be able to step on the gate.

163
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,280
It's broken.

164
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,360
It's broken.

165
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,520
There are more.

166
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,820
There are two bicycles that will never be stolen.

167
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,620
You can also put a battery on the bicycle.

168
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,520
If you want to take it, it will be electrocuted.

169
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,800
It's extreme.

170
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,300
The disadvantage is that the rain can be used.

171
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,100
It's going to be electrocuted.

172
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,100
It's dangerous.

173
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,900
There are more.

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,900
Number 3

175
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,260
5.

176
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,180
The simple and easy way to protect yourself is this.

177
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,300
Hold the black paint in the saddle like this.

178
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,120
It's a cheap and simple guerrilla-like method.

179
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,120
It's really simple, though.

180
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,260
Listen, don't forget that you were wearing it when you were out.

181
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,580
You're late, Lemon.

182
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
What? You still haven't gone back?

183
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,260
You're a little worried, aren't you?

184
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,820
Okay, I'll go look for you.

185
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,620
Then I'll...

186
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,340
What an idiot.

187
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,300
Oh, Lemon.

188
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,160
I'm glad you're okay.

189
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,980
The bicycle...

190
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,680
I see. You got stolen while you were in the bathroom.

191
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,220
Damn it. I should have taken precautions against Lemon's bicycle.

192
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm sorry, Kanki-chan.

193
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,780
Lemon doesn't forgive anyone.

194
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,800
His bad 1 is that he stole it.

195
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,660
That's right, I'll definitely get it back.

196
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,580
Kanki-chan, be good.

197
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,840
It's a noticeable bicycle.

198
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,100
Someone might have seen it.

199
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,320
Let's ask around.

200
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,020
OMG!

201
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,760
That's terrible!

202
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,040
I should be quick!

203
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,460
I should go check that bicycle.

204
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,980
Hmm, there's no clue here either.

205
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,260
What should we do, Kankichi?

206
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,180
Huh?

207
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,700
Ah! My bike is gone!

208
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,040
I hid 30,000 yen in that bike!

209
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,920
Damn it!

210
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
It's either Lemon's bike or my bike was stolen!

211
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,500
Huh?

212
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,340
Huh?

213
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,660
It seems like there are no other bikes.

214
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:58,980
Huh?

215
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,020
Come to think of it...

216
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,100
Oh, Kankichi! There!

217
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,660
Huh?

218
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,800
Ah!

219
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,160
It was a fake bicycle and it was removed!

220
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,620
Wait! My bike!

221
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,400
Damn it!

222
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,920
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

223
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,700
Huh?

224
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,320
What is it, Genshin?

225
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,440
Don't play dumb!

226
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,440
Hey, Kankichi!

227
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,820
I was using it for work!

228
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,800
I hid 30,000 yen right after I returned it!

229
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,340
W-Wait, what are you talking about?

230
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,840
My bike was removed with another fake bicycle!

231
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,040
Huh?

232
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,400
That's...

233
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:33,820
When?

234
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,820
Just now! At the shopping street!

235
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,880
Oh! That's strange!

236
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,840
What's so strange?

237
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,560
I saw it with my own eyes, the bike was removed and was taken away.

238
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,000
But I don't plan to remove the bike today.

239
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,000
What!

240
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,820
What?

241
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,480
Sen...Senpai...

242
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,020
Ah! Honda!

243
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,360
Not a man...

244
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,380
Not a man!

245
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,520
Oh!

246
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,620
Hey, Honda! What happened?

247
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,640
The...the fake bicycle...

248
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,840
The fake bicycle?

249
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,420
Ex...Except...

250
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:17,300
I had a short break in Kanamachi and the fake bicycle was removed, so I walked home.

251
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,260
What!?

252
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,520
The fake bicycle was removed?

253
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,120
You can't be serious!

254
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,020
This is an accident!

255
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,860
Ryo!

256
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,580
Someone tried to take the bike, and stole it.

257
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,140
There must be someone who is stealing bikes and bicycles!

258
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,260
What?

259
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,260
Both my bike, Honda's bike, and Lemon's bike were stolen by them!

260
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,020
I can't forgive you!

261
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,740
I will definitely catch you!

262
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,400
I will definitely catch you!

263
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,060
The places where there are a lot of bicycle-worn places are usually painted red.

264
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:09,220
I contacted my friends while patrolling and gathered information, but the place where a lot of bicycles have been lost today is here.

265
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,440
Here.

266
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,360
Here.

267
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,980
I was hit here.

268
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,420
I was here.

269
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,920
Well, then, the next target is...

270
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,900
It's here, right?

271
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,360
That's right, Lemon.

272
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,640
Are you going to wait and catch the culprit?

273
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,540
No, they're the ones who do such a big thing.

274
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,260
There must be a hideout somewhere. We will find it.

275
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:35,940
Huh?

276
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,720
Oh?

277
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,120
Oh?

278
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,820
The primitive man is saying something reasonable.

279
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,960
It's like a police officer.

280
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,100
Hankichi is a top-notch police officer.

281
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:46,800
Huh?

282
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,460
Oh, that's right.

283
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,840
Is there a good way?

284
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,180
Hey, leave it to me!

285
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Senpai, can you hear me?

286
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,820
Yeah, I can hear you.

287
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,280
You're monitoring this place, aren't you?

288
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,900
Yeah, I can see it.

289
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,440
Don't lose sight of it.

290
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,560
Yes, sir.

291
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,200
Here it comes.

292
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,300
Oh, no!

293
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,680
Hey, hurry up!

294
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,240
All right.

295
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,800
Ouch!

296
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,120
Ugh, ahh, it hurts.

297
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,040
Crap, you should've handled it more carefully.

298
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,280
Tch.

299
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,720
Hey.

300
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,880
It's the police. Let's go.

301
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,080
Ahh! W-what's wrong?!

302
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,720
Ahh! The truck's going away!

303
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,880
What?!

304
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,480
Ah!

305
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Crap.

306
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,780
Naoko! Are you okay?!

307
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,680
I'm okay. But I can't continue. I'll leave the rest to you.

308
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,960
I got it. Leave it to me.

309
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,040
The culprit is over there.

310
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,280
It seems they're heading to the highway.

311
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,060
It seems like it's working.

312
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,120
Alright, I'm going to catch up with the high speed entrance!

313
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,100
There it is!

314
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,980
Ababa, here it comes again!

315
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,200
How many times do I have to do the same thing?!

316
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,300
Oh no!

317
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,440
Damn it!

318
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,820
I'm going to have to go a long way from here.

319
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,740
I guess I'm going to have to go a long way from here.

320
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,120
Damn it! I fell down!

321
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,140
Hey, wait! I'm falling!

322
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,320
Damn it, did you not notice?

323
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,600
I'm going to lose sight of you!

324
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,140
I'm going to lose sight of you!

325
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,380
D-damn it! I ran out of gas!

326
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,140
Hello!

327
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,280
Huh?

328
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,480
It's a regular man-tod!

329
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,300
Oh, I-I spoke!

330
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,220
Hurry up!

331
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,320
Okay!

332
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,640
Send me the waiver to the Katsushika Office!

333
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,700
Send me the waiver to the Katsushika Office!

334
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,200
Huh?

335
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,340
If we don't catch up ASAP...

336
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,860
There he is!

337
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,660
What's wrong, old man?

338
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,860
I'm asking, what's wrong? Hurry up!

339
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,940
I crumpled my legs.

340
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,780
It can't be helped. Where's my house?

341
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,440
It's right there.

342
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,040
Right there?

343
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,020
I got it. Take me there. I'll send you there.

344
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,340
I got you!

345
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,980
Old man!

346
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,980
Old man, what was that?

347
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,120
You sent me there. Thank you, thank you.

348
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,600
Get out of the way!

349
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,260
Get out of the way!

350
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,040
I'll show you the way!

351
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,820
Get out of the way!

352
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,520
Get out of the way!

353
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,180
I'm the number one of this pass!

354
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,060
No, I'm number one!

355
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,080
What?

356
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,000
The monkey pulled me.

357
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,180
It's a nightmare.

358
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,820
That monkey even

359
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,280
I've finally caught up with it.

360
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,260
Looks like this is the hideout.

361
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,920
Honda, can you hear me?

362
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,620
Damn it! Honda! Honda!

363
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,460
What's going on?

364
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,240
Senior! Please respond to me, senior!

365
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,520
Senpai!

366
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,380
Did something happen to Kankitsu?

367
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,020
It's okay. I'm sure the transmitter broke down.

368
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,640
That's fine, but...

369
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,140
He's not that easy to get into.

370
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,360
Yes.

371
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,500
I know where he is. I'll see him soon.

372
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,220
What is this?

373
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,760
They stole so much.

374
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,080
What did they steal?

375
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,320
They stole the bicycle of the chief inspector.

376
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,400
I thought they had a big bike.

377
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,160
What? They already dropped it?

378
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,580
Lemon's bicycle...

379
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,140
There it is.

380
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,980
My bicycle is...

381
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:15,960
Boss!

382
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,880
So he's the boss.

383
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,720
Hmm. That's a lot of people.

384
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,660
Japanese are weird.

385
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,860
When a bicycle is removed, they think they're bad and don't even pay for it.

386
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,960
I'll sell it to the best of my ability.

387
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,780
Damn, what a guy.

388
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,060
I'll melt the oil in the back of the tank.

389
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,720
Don't leave any chocolate.

390
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,360
Yes!

391
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,580
Boss, this won't be sold, right?

392
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,420
Ah, my bicycle!

393
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,620
Oh, a police bicycle.

394
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,080
This is unusual.

395
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,960
It won't be sold, but I'll put it in my collection with the white motorcycle.

396
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,240
Don't be kidding. My 30,000 yen is in it.

397
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,840
Boss, how about this?

398
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,140
Idiot!

399
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,520
That's not going to be sold.

400
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,280
But it looks pretty expensive.

401
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,540
That's an order-made.

402
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,620
I only have one, so I'll be in trouble soon.

403
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,860
I see.

404
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,700
Melt it later.

405
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,660
First, the rice.

406
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:22,700
That's a good one!

407
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,460
Hey!

408
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,920
I'll play with Leman's bicycle at night.

409
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,200
Honda! Honda!

410
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,800
It's not good as I thought.

411
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,560
I have to call for backup.

412
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,860
Hey, didn't you hear anything from the warehouse?

413
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,520
It's the sky eaves. I'm tired.

414
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,240
I guess so. It's the sky eaves.

415
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,580
Haa.

416
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,500
But I'll look at it just in case.

417
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:51,760
Let's take a look.

418
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,480
Who's there?

419
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,620
It's Toa Mas!

420
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,220
Toa Mas is here!

421
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,080
This is bad!

422
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,760
Where's my bicycle?

423
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,240
What?

424
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,960
What? There's a face on the bike!

425
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,700
I'll arrest you!

426
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,060
The bike spoke!

427
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,540
Let's get out of here!

428
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,620
My bicycle!

429
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,120
Get out of here!

430
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,440
Damn it! My 30,000 yen!

431
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:51,580
What?

432
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,900
That's Lemon's bicycle!

433
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,740
We'll be in trouble if we don't do something.

434
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,360
Get out of here!

435
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,420
Damn it!

436
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,080
I put a cover on it to protect me from the crime.

437
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,660
My bicycle!

438
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:16,860
My bicycle!

439
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
Where are you going?

440
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,820
If I keep going, both of them will be killed!

441
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,420
Damn it!

442
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,600
Wait for me!

443
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,220
I'll get you.

444
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,620
Let's go!

445
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,800
My bicycle!

446
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,340
Where are you going?

447
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,680
No!

448
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,840
Well, you forced me here!

449
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,080
Are you all right?

450
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,620
I'm okay.

451
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,660
Here you go.

452
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,980
Thank you, Kankichi. I won't lose you again.

453
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,320
Huh? I think I forgot something important.

454
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,960
Kankichi? Is that yours?

455
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,100
My bicycle! 30,000 yen!

456
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,600
30,000 yen!

457
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,300
Don't stop me!

458
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,520
Give it back to me!

459
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,260
30,000 yen!

460
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,760
35,000 yen!

461
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,400
If you keep going like this I'll be on your side.

462
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,860
I love you so much!

463
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:20,920
I love you too, Kankichi!

464
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,640
5, 4, 1!

465
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,000
Do you like the signs?

466
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,260
Is rising the sun too much too heavy?

467
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,980
Ready to go!

468
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,180
I'm going to see you all.

469
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:43,140
Turn around and look at that corner.

470
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,720
I'll see you all.

471
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,740
There's a turtle there.

472
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,020
There's definitely a turtle there.

473
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,700
Come on, everyone. Let's go to our town.

474
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,640
Let's go!

475
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,940
There's a turtle there.

476
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,180
There's definitely a turtle there.

477
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,820
Come on, everyone. Let's go to our town.

478
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,940
Thank you!

479
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,320
I did it! There's no noisy leader today.

480
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,940
That means I'll be the most important person in the headquarters.

481
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,020
Okay, I'll do whatever I want.

482
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,700
Why are Matoi, Komachi, and Naoko here?

483
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,620
Why are Matoi, Komachi, and Naoko here?

484
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,040
Next time, we'll go to a women's sewage station.

485
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,920
See you there!

486
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,680
There's a turtle there.

487
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,960
There's definitely a turtle there.

488
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,640
Come on, everyone. Let's go to our town.

489
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,740
Thank you!
