1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
bazuko

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,220
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,880
light up your room and make sure you don't get so far

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:25,220
it's as if someone is calling

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,200
after the rain

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,400
After the rain, I walked while looking back

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,940
I was drawn to the gacha

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,520
At that time, I felt a strange feeling

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:53,360
So I walked only in the black part of the Akedo Gai Tile

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,820
Everyone was a child once, but everyone forgot

11
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,800
A politician with a big face and a blue aunt above their eyes

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,100
Turn around and see that corner

13
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,480
Everyone can meet everyone

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,340
Ah, there it is

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,040
There is a wall

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,420
Ah, there is a wall

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,520
Everyone come to our town

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,700
Thank you!

19
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,280
Circus Symphony

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,120
It's a nice day, senior

21
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,100
Autumn with high sky and good night

22
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,360
That's right

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,340
Tomorrow's race will be 2-3

24
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,980
But it was 6-7 just now

25
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,000
My wild instincts were fluttering

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,280
6-7 is not a good horse

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,320
Hmm, you're pretty good, senior

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,080
Oh?

29
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,780
What is it?

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,620
It's a circus

31
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,600
Circus?

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,880
Yup, I used to come here often when I was young

33
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,980
It looks interesting, let's go

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:51,260
There's another Higashiyama

35
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,340
Hey, hold on

36
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,540
I'm so dizzy just thinking about it.

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,560
Who's there? What are you doing?

38
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,340
Come here.

39
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,340
Senpai, wait!

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,880
Ouch!

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,200
Be careful, Honda.

42
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,300
Sorry.

43
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,840
Ahaan.

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440
Why are you making such a weird noise?

45
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,320
You're so rude.

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,320
Because Senpai...

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,500
Ahaan.

48
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,600
What did I do?

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,500
Look closely.

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,040
What? Senpai, what happened?

51
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,100
That means...

52
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,820
It's a snake!

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,480
It's just a snake.

54
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,580
This is a snake-shaped ball.

55
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,140
This is no time to joke.

56
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,580
I'm going to eat you!

57
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,880
No!

58
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,520
Ouch!

59
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:53,920
Ouch!

60
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,320
Ouch!

61
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:55,860
Ouch!

62
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,600
Come on, now.

63
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm saved.

64
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,900
I'm short of life.

65
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,080
Huh?

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,220
Could it be...

67
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,900
Honda-kun?

68
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,660
Huh?

69
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,420
Well, yeah, but...

70
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,600
You know Honda?

71
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,140
It's me.

72
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,680
I was with him in junior high school.

73
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,400
Ryuhei Iwabuchi.

74
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,220
What?

75
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,660
Now that you mention it...

76
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,800
You remembered me.

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,520
Long time no see.

78
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,380
Boss!

79
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,200
A weird guy was wandering around in the tent.

80
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,880
Well, don't worry about it.

81
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,180
He's my friend.

82
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,080
Oh, really?

83
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,840
I thought he was a member of the Haraguro Company.

84
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,160
Excuse me.

85
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,080
Huh?

86
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
I'm sure your father was the leader.

87
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,080
My father died last year.

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,180
So I'm the one who took over this circus.

89
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,300
Oh, and Tachibana-shi didn't come to my room.

90
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,480
Since I was in elementary school, I've been doing well in gymnastics.

91
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,480
People in the girls' community all say "Kya! Kya!"

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,320
But I'm always jealous of them.

93
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,160
I've been on stage since I was five.

94
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,600
But I always went on trips when there was a school business.

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,660
I didn't go to school that much, so I didn't have many friends.

96
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,600
Hmm...

97
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,960
By the way, I was just wondering...

98
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,300
How's the Haraguro Company?

99
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,900
Huh?

100
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,160
Uh...

101
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,360
Haraguro Company?

102
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,360
It's a non-popular back-end financial company.

103
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,500
As expected of a policeman.

104
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,520
I'll apologize for lying to you, but...

105
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,860
The business is very tough here.

106
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,220
There's a debt from the Haraguro Company.

107
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
A debt?

108
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,380
Hmm...

109
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,900
Unlike when we were kids,

110
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,940
I don't think kids these days can even think of circuses.

111
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,380
It depends on whether the company will do well next time.

112
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,020
Huh?

113
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,340
If we fail,

114
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,380
this circus will be gone.

115
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,440
No way!

116
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,260
This circus will be my third one.

117
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,580
There are people who have been working since I was an old man.

118
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,780
I want to do something for them.

119
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,700
But I can't get more customers.

120
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,800
But...

121
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,000
But?

122
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,460
No, it's nothing.

123
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,280
Mr. Ryuhei?

124
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,540
Oh, sorry.

125
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,700
Customer?

126
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,500
It's okay, Sae-chan.

127
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,360
This is my classmate from junior high school.

128
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,180
Mr. Honda and his senior, Mr. Ryotsu.

129
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,640
Oh, hello.

130
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,040
Nice to meet you.

131
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,380
I'm Sae Shirayuri,

132
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,760
Oh, nice to meet you.

133
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,400
Would you like to see some practice?

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,360
I'll show you a new technique that I'll show you at the next workshop.

135
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,280
Oh, I really want to see it.

136
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,640
Right, senior?

137
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,220
Yeah.

138
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,080
Is it really okay to start from such a high place?

139
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,080
Shut up and watch it.

140
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,460
Oh, I'll show you.

141
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,100
Let's do it, Sae-chan.

142
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,680
Okay.

143
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,020
It's over!

144
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,220
Oh, my God.

145
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,860
It's over!

146
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,600
It's over!

147
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,420
It's over!

148
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,240
It's over!

149
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,060
It's over!

150
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,440
It's over!

151
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,340
Amazing!

152
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,400
You're good.

153
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,820
You can't do it if your two people don't do it perfectly.

154
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,520
That's right.

155
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,320
It's amazing.

156
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,700
Why can't you get any customers even though it's so amazing?

157
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,040
There's not enough publicity.

158
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,900
I know that, but the cost is quite...

159
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,640
Don't worry.

160
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,400
Leave it to me.

161
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,700
Okay, Honda.

162
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
All the Kameari members are gathering.

163
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,200
I'll save this circus.

164
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,180
Yes.

165
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,720
Thank you very much.

166
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,160
Iwabuchi Circus is starting to operate.

167
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,840
We're waiting for you.

168
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,480
Wait!

169
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,800
If you don't come, you won't be able to get in.

170
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,100
From 2 p.m. today, at the special venue of Minamisenju Kasenjiki,

171
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,640
there will be an exciting opening.

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,340
Please come and see.

173
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,540
Okay.

174
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,100
The customers are gathering.

175
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,740
It's very effective.

176
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,540
They are coming.

177
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:05,720
They are coming.

178
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,760
It's been a long time since I've been in such a big place.

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,360
Brother, it's more successful than I thought.

180
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,780
If you keep this up, the president will make fun of you.

181
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,940
I'll disturb you because I don't care.

182
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,380
Ladies and gentlemen ramen.

183
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,260
Please enjoy the circus!

184
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,400
Welcome to Iwabuchi Big Circus.

185
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,560
It's showtime!

186
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,500
Please enjoy the circus.

187
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,080
It's gone.

188
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,240
Huh?

189
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:58,640
Yes.

190
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,520
Iwabuchi Big Circus

191
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,560
"Ryo's

192
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,540
""

193
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:16,980
""

194
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,180
"It's a success, Ryo-chan."

195
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,880
"I can't believe you're letting me do the advertising."

196
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,800
"I hope things go well in the town of Senju."

197
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,100
"I'm glad to hear that."

198
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,500
"It's okay if you can take this."

199
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,000
"What?"

200
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,640
"What?"

201
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,140
"What?"

202
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:42,500
"What?"

203
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,220
"What?"

204
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,180
"What?"

205
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:47,740
"What?"

206
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,100
"What?"

207
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,080
"What?"

208
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,680
"What? What?"

209
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,680
"What?"

210
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,660
"I don't have to worry about it. Nothing's wrong."

211
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,960
"Thank God."

212
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,420
"I just worried."

213
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,780
"I know."

214
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,400
"No matter how good this ad is, the main character's kids will never have customers!"

215
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,980
"Ryo-chan, leave the rest to Mr. Sae."

216
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,500
"Yeah, I will."

217
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,140
"Take your time to rest."

218
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:30,900
"Okay."

219
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,400
"See you!"

220
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,080
Are you okay, Ryuhei?

221
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,300
Thank you, Sae-chan.

222
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,220
You're welcome.

223
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,380
Thank you for waiting.

224
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,680
Thank you.

225
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,300
Those two seem to love each other.

226
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,100
If they don't, they won't be able to act so lively.

227
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,520
I'm jealous.

228
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,340
You're a great actor.

229
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,260
You don't need to worry about this.

230
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,980
Thank you, Senpai.

231
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,460
Ryo-chan does good things sometimes.

232
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,060
Everyone, thank you for today.

233
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,900
Hello.

234
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,180
Thank you for your hard work.

235
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
I'll leave it to you, Ryo-san.

236
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,340
Leave it to me.

237
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,400
I hope we can pay back the debt for those people.

238
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,520
If that old man says that the circus will be gone,

239
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,420
I'll be shocked.

240
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:27,620
I'll be shocked.

241
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,040
Ryo-chan, you're talking too much.

242
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,320
You're so noisy.

243
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,620
Okay, next.

244
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,760
Next.

245
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,200
Ryo-chan!

246
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,360
Yes.

247
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,820
I'm at the arena.

248
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,280
Okay.

249
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,140
What?

250
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,320
Senpai, something bad has happened.

251
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,040
The two snake-like snakes of the circus

252
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,560
are entangled in Shibamata's Tora-san Castle.

253
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,280
What?

254
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,020
Ryo-chan, the circus bears are running around Nikkou Kaido.

255
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,320
What's wrong?

256
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
The circus's master, the circus monkeys, has attacked the Kanabashi Line!

257
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,780
What's going on here?

258
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,760
Who did this?

259
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,100
What are we going to do?

260
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,180
Even if we have a customer, this is...

261
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,040
We can't open the circus at this rate.

262
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,980
What should we do, Mr. Ryuhei?

263
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,040
Mr. Ryuhei!

264
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,340
I've been talking about it...

265
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,680
Are you going to say you refuse?

266
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,020
Yes, I'm sorry.

267
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,840
The world's best Boroshoi circus is trying to scout you in a desperate situation.

268
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,320
Think again.

269
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,080
If you join Boroshoi Circus, you can compete with the famous people from all over the world.

270
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,440
It's a chance to become the world's best Ryuhei.

271
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,580
I beg your pardon.

272
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,960
I don't think so.

273
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,040
The Iwabuchi Circus that my father left for me is more important than the Boroshoi Circus in the world.

274
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,200
Please understand.

275
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,220
Yes.

276
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,700
Mr. Shibuchinski says this.

277
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,360
"I'm in Japan by the end of this week, so if you change your mind, come visit me anytime."

278
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,040
He says he has the appropriate contract money.

279
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,940
Thank you very much.

280
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,440
If I have that contract money...

281
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,540
I won't be able to participate in this circus.

282
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,160
Mr. Shibuchinski should be in Japan tonight.

283
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,520
Mr. Ryuhei!

284
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,300
Boss!

285
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,720
Anyway, we have to split up the animals that escaped and catch them.

286
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,820
That's the only way.

287
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,820
Ryuhei is right.

288
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,920
We don't have time to waste.

289
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,540
Mr. Ryotsu!

290
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,340
Let's go, everyone!

291
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,600
Yes!

292
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay, let's go!

293
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,700
Yes!

294
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,620
Yes!

295
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:13,960
Yes!

296
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,560
Yes!

297
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:19,820
Ryuhei!

298
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,400
Mr. Ryuhei!

299
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,000
Mr. Ryuhei!

300
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,100
Ryuhei!

301
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,200
Mr. Ryuhei!

302
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,520
Mr. Ryuhei!

303
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:24,800
Mr. Ryuhei!

304
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,620
Mr. Ryuhei!

305
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,740
You want some?

306
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,540
"I don't know what you're talking about. Your priorities are only human."

307
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,420
"You think you're so great, aren't you? You're an ordinary person!"

308
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,120
I can't let Lucas go on like this.

309
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,720
Senpai!

310
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,560
Be careful!

311
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,480
Leave it to me!

312
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,320
I'll catch the monkey from here!

313
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,060
Fish on!

314
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,780
It's fun!

315
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,160
I'm so excited!

316
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,060
It's a waste if they turn into bears!

317
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,820
I'm not saying anything stupid!

318
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,120
I'm going to do it!

319
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,720
Come down here, Pochi!

320
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,000
Help!

321
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,120
Stop!

322
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,020
Stop!

323
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,820
If you don't listen to me, I'll make you a thief!

324
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,000
Last night, a monster escaped from the Iwaguchi Circus,

325
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,320
which was on the way to Minami-senju.

326
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,260
The footage you are seeing is a terrible story.

327
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,580
The animal escaped from the Iwaguchi Circus,

328
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,280
and it became a mess.

329
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,440
Perhaps the customers are not going to come back anymore.

330
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,000
It went well, Aniki.

331
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,220
The president will praise me.

332
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,280
Damn it! Who the hell did this?

333
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,440
This is the badge of Haraguro Industry.

334
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,220
Haraguro Industry?

335
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,480
He got away, Aniki!

336
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,260
We have to run!

337
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,780
Ryo, over there!

338
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,220
Don't let him get away!

339
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,820
He's gonna get away!

340
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,900
Damn it!

341
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,940
There!

342
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,780
Ready...

343
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,080
Set...

344
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,980
Let's go, Ryo!

345
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,020
Fire!

346
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,340
I'm counting on you, Ryo!

347
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,180
Ryo, hang in there!

348
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,960
They got rid of them easily.

349
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,500
I heard they were hired by Haraguro Industries.

350
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,060
But even if we catch the culprit,

351
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,440
if we cause such a scene,

352
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,220
we can't get anything back.

353
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,300
That's too bad.

354
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,740
Look, Senpai!

355
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,580
Here! Here!

356
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,500
This is the circus where the animals escaped!

357
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,300
I've never seen such a ghastly circus.

358
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
Senpai!

359
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,120
It's a great show!

360
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,180
The animals' performance was a great advertisement!

361
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,240
You did it, Saori!

362
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,620
I don't care.

363
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,180
No, I mean...

364
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,400
Now, we're gonna be busy!

365
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,100
Oh, no!

366
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,860
Ryuhei-san's not here!

367
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:19,860
What?

368
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,020
I'm so jealous!

369
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,320
We've got so many guests,

370
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,160
but we can't show them

371
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,060
the main stage of Ryuhei and Sae!

372
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,820
What should we do, Senpai?

373
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,720
Sae-chan, don't you know

374
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,300
where Ryuhei-san went?

375
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,380
I don't know.

376
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,140
I'm not ready to go there.

377
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,900
You'd better stop thinking about the guests.

378
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,400
There are so many guests

379
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,940
coming to see our circus.

380
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,800
We need to finish this.

381
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,440
Huh?

382
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,620
But...

383
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,080
But...?

384
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,840
Oh, that's nothing.

385
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,200
That's right!

386
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Ryuhei will be here!

387
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,620
Until then, we'll connect the site with him!

388
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,720
Yes! Yes!

389
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,040
"Aizawa Land"

390
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,840
Thanks, new captain.

391
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,660
No one can win the circus.

392
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,240
That's right, Ryuuhei.

393
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,000
Way to go!

394
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,580
You're being too mean, Ryuuhei.

395
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:40,840
Sorry.

396
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,100
She's not here yet.

397
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,400
Are you sure you're okay, Senpai?

398
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,380
Shut up and wait, Ryuhei will be here.

399
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,080
Oh no! Kei from Ippon Zuna...

400
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,420
What happened?

401
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,880
What's wrong?

402
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,220
Sorry, I can't stand up.

403
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,240
I'm in such a bad situation.

404
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,900
What should we do?

405
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,000
There's no other team for Ippon Zuna.

406
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,960
Okay, I'll do it.

407
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,000
What?

408
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,440
Dotsan!

409
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,340
Are you okay, Ryo?

410
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,240
Don't worry.

411
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,700
I learned this when I was a kid.

412
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,020
That's good.

413
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,640
Now you're the best Ryuhei in the world.

414
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,120
This is harder than I thought.

415
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,860
Are you okay, Ryo?

416
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,380
It's a real fight, isn't it?

417
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,000
Ryo!

418
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,100
What are you doing, Ryuhei?

419
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,200
I'll do it with my Ryo.

420
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,060
Ryo!

421
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,940
Ryo...

422
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,420
Ryuhei!

423
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,060
Everyone, thank you for waiting.

424
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,180
The Circus Flower-shaped Air Blanket Show is finally starting!

425
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,700
Mr. Ryuhei!

426
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,500
Mr. Ryuhei!

427
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,380
I'm sorry. I thought you'd come.

428
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,180
Sorry for being late.

429
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,840
I'm sorry for being late.

430
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,200
I'm sorry.

431
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,760
Please make sure this story never happened.

432
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,140
I'm sorry.

433
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,360
Mr. Iwabuchi!

434
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,700
As I thought,

435
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,040
Ms. Sae is the best partner for the Circus Flower-shaped Air Blanket Show!

436
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
It's beautiful and elegant.

437
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,520
It's like two people playing classical music together.

438
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,020
Circuses are like a great symphony where each person's power is played together.

439
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,680
Circus symphony?

440
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,120
That's exactly right.

441
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,300
Yes!

442
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,080
No matter how hard it is, we can't help but hesitate.

443
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,780
Sae is here, everyone is here,

444
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,020
the guests are here,

445
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,160
and we're here.

446
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,400
This is my happiness.

447
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,160
Dad, please watch this.

448
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,260
I will make this circus the best circus in the world with everyone.

449
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,040
Sae says,

450
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:02,660
"As I thought"

451
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,220
These kids sure are really cute.

452
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,460
This is my Christmas gift.

453
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,760
This is my gift?

454
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,360
This is it.

455
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,240
This is it.

456
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,680
I love you all.

457
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,820
I love you all.

458
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,180

I see. This way, it doesn't take much time and you get a lot of work.

Why are you disturbing us?

475
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,880
