Yes.

29
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,560
I'm going to try to live as a civilian as possible.

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,700
Why did you suddenly think that?

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,020
Actually, I attended a company meeting the other day.

32
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,620
Our Nakagawa Group is moving forward with other companies,

33
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,260

Thank you, Takumi.

58
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,360
He changed his special drink into a cheap egg and did his duty.

59
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,880
That's crazy.

60
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,880
I'd like to drink with you, but I have to go to the next destination for the 21st century project meeting.

61
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,460
That's all.

62
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,360
Cheers to President Ryuichiro Nakagawa!

63
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,380
Cheers!

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,180
I learned what it's like to stand on top of my father's flexible posture.

65
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,520
I learned what it's like to stand on top of my father's flexible posture.

66
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,120
I thought about what I could do, and I thought about how I could be a model for other employees.

67
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,480
I thought about how I could be a model for other employees.

68
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,720
You're great, Kei.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,460
No, I'm still working on it.

70
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,620
You're a great manager.

71
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,700
Senpai!

72
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,220
What's wrong?

73
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,000
What's that?

74
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,420
I don't know.

75
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,140
Senpai, what are you doing in the kitchen?

76
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,200
I don't know.

77
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,060
Ryo, you're the worst!

78
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,900
You shouldn't wash your body with water.

79
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,440
Ryo, you should get dressed quickly.

80
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,640
If the manager comes, it will be a big problem.

81
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,660
I understand. I understand. I'll be right out.

82
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,220
So, you're living a commoner's life?

83
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
What are your thoughts?

84
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,640
I bought my favorite Ferrari from Porsche.

85
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,560
I bought gasoline from High Oak Standard.

86
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,740
It's not funny at all.

87
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,880
It's not a joke!

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,760
I'm seriously aiming for a commoner's life.

89
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,500
Are you kidding me?

90
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,760
Porsche is not a commoner's life.

91
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,920
Stop driving and get on the train.

92
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,560
The train?

93
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,720
When I was a kid, I was a teacher and a home teacher.

94
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,900
I was a teacher and a home teacher.

95
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,520
A teacher?

96
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,360
Then, maybe most of the stations in Tokyo are automatic trains.

97
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,820
Really?

98
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,040
Even Tokyo, which was said to be impossible?

99
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,040
There's a limit to being a teacher.

100
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,680
I don't know.

101
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,680
I don't know.

102
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,420
Oh, right.

103
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,120
I'm riding on Porsche, so I'm on your side.

104
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,480
You're two people on the train.

105
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,040
It's funny in Harunosoko.

106
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,180
No, I've never been on the train.

107
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,460
Kei-chan says someone who knows how others feel is a kind person.

108
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,820
I know.

109
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,980
It's more humble and appearance than Ryo-san.

110
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:27,840
What?

111
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,280
What did you say?

112
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,060
Don't fight over me, you three.

113
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,220
Well, I'll tell you this.

114
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,980
What will happen if a guy like you becomes president?

115
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,340
A few days will pass, and the whole group will be in trouble.

116
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,160
Ryo, you're being mean.

117
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
I'm giving you a warning for Nakagawa.

118
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,580
You're threatening your junior, but you're enjoying it.

119
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,700
You have to cheer him up.

120
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,560
Cheer?

121
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,640
The support of the Nakagawa Group.

122
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,620
The smell of money floating in the air.

123
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,580
Don't worry, Nakagawa.

124
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,400
I said something harsh, because I'm going to teach you the basics of a commoner's life.

125
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:09,980
You?

126
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,580
The authority of the Shisso prefecture, the commoner's life advisor, Ryo Tsukankichi.

127
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,620
I'm on your side, so don't worry.

128
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,740
Don't ride it.

129
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,460
What?

130
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:23,780
Stop it.

131
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,380
Let's start with this dirty look.

132
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,160
What are you doing?

133
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,120
Listen to me.

134
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,120
See?

135
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,360
Senpai, this bamboo is too short.

136
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,700
A character like you who left his home can balance out just fine.

137
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,700
No way.

138
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,000
By the way, Nakagawa, you paid for all the meals, right?

139
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,340
Yes.

140
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,520
Basically, I paid with 100% card.

141
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,280
By the way, do you know how much the dinner I ate yesterday was?

142
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,900
It was 40,000 yen, no, 50,000 yen last night.

143
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,940
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,880
I haven't checked the price in detail.

145
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,980
That's what I call being divided between the commoner and the commoner!

146
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,840
Nakagawa, give me all the cards you have.

147
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,500
All of them?

148
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,960
Yes, all of them.

149
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,820
I got it.

150
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,120
You have a lot.

151
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,380
All of them are gold and platinum cards.

152
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,900
As of today, cut the cards and the circles.

153
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,280
What are you doing?

154
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,420
Pay with cash every time.

155
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,980
That's the first step to a private life with a bond.

156
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,760
I got it.

157
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,120
If you have a deposit of 1 yen like me,

158
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,460
you can concentrate your whole nervous system on the same menu, such as ramen and dumplings.

159
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,060
I see.

160
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,040
Especially, when I can take dumplings and ramen together,

161
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,200
I feel like I've taken over the world.

162
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,800
Is that so?

163
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,560
When I have no money but I'm very hungry, I eat fried rice.

164
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,220
Fried rice?

165
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,320
Then, I mix a large amount of rice with fried rice and eat it in double.

166
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,160
But you don't have to mix it.

167
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,860
Why don't you take two fried rice?

168
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,220
Are you Marie Antoinette?

169
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,300
You have a different price.

170
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,020
Take two fried rice for 1,000 yen.

171
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,760
One fried rice and a large amount of rice will be 350 yen.

172
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
I see.

173
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,640
I didn't have to calculate the amount of money in the card payment.

174
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,120
I just...

175
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,140
You may not have enough money to take a business of hundreds of millions of yen every day,

176
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,540
but it's a smart private life that doesn't need to calculate 10 or 20 yen.

177
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,360
Yes, I got it.

178
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,100
What?

179
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,820
Money?

180
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:45,440
I haven't paid it yet.

181
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,280
Yes, I've been paying it all in cards so far, so I don't have any cash at all...

182
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,220
Oh, I remember!

183
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,000
Senpai, I lent you 3,000 yen the other day.

184
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
If you return that, I'll pay it.

185
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,460
What?

186
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,220
Damn it!

187
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,900
You have to pay it here before you get rid of the card.

188
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,620
Look, it's ramen.

189
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,600
It's 2,550 yen.

190
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,780
Oh, sorry.

191
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,840
What? Senpai?

192
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,740
I have some money.

193
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,200
This is not Ito Hirogumi.

194
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,420
Is this really a 1,000 yen bill?

195
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,320
Don't underestimate me!

196
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,660
Your design has changed over 10 years!

197
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,520
Oh, really?

198
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,540
It's been a long time since I saw a picture of you.

199
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,220
You're a good detective.

200
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,400
Oh, maybe this is...

201
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,240
What's this time?

202
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,380
I don't think you don't know the 500 yen bill.

203
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Is this really the 500 yen bill?

204
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,020
What?

205
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,060
When did you become human?

206
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,880
Live with that money this month.

207
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,640
What?

208
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,040
Only 2,000 yen?

209
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,880
2,550 yen.

210
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,800
But there's still half a month to go.

211
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,420
Only half a month?

212
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,840
Don't worry.

213
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,100
I've secured a place to stay.

214
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,080
What?

215
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,680
Really?

216
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,900
Here.

217
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,700
This is a lot of money.

218
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,060
That's right.

219
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,220
And you'll be staying in this room from today.

220
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,740
This is Senpai's room, isn't it?

221
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,680
That's right.

222
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,020
If you pay 100 yen per night, it's much cheaper than the transportation fee to your house.

223
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,140
Really?

224
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,020
It's much cheaper than the transportation fee to your house.

225
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,680
What?

226
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,500
Are you taking money?

227
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,900
Of course.

228
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,640
This room looks dirty at first glance, but there are many ideas of life-saving wisdom based on contracts and product ideas.

229
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,980
For example...

230
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,940
This is it.

231
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,300
Isn't it bean sprouts?

232
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,680
That's right.

233
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,560
Put the bought bean sprouts in a sponge soaked in water, and then eat them.

234
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,100
This is called dry breakfast.

235
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,460
The green onion and parsley can be once season if you plant them in soil like this.

236
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,440
For example, the tissue det Gold media asked to deliver to the town will sell their without mistake.

237
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,740
Get the deal in the end of the year, at the shopping street, service information such as sales of hangover drinks, and verify advertisements.

238
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,900
Don't forget to write the paper to the bean.

239
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,100
I've never had a chance to spend money on a product that's not legal.

240
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,540
I've never had a chance to spend money on a product that's not legal.

241
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,300
In the case of the company, it's a luxurious life of virtual poverty that is a part of social studies.

242
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,880
I'm serious. For a while, I will contact my family and my company.

243
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,020
Okay, I got it. It's a tough road, so get a good job.

244
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,120
350 yen. There are still 4 or 5 days until the end of the month.

245
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,560
Here, Kei-chan. Tea.

246
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,700
Oh, sorry.

247
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,880
Kei-chan, are you making a tie at the convenience store again?

248
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,480
Yes. It's fast, cheap and easy.

249
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,720
I started to eat at the convenience store, and I found a lot of things.

250
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:44,440
Even if you make a knot, the price, taste and way of rolling the seaweed are slightly different depending on the store.

251
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,180
For example, pulling from both sides or pulling out the inside of the paper.

252
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,620
But today I found something even more amazing.

253
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,420
Ta-da!

254
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,140
The classic three-storied type with seaweed is cheap from the beginning.

255
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,380
I like the seaweed that is wet, so I bought this.

256
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
This is an ideal dish that can be wished or granted.

257
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,560
Kei-chan is surprisingly talented.

258
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,280
I have something to deliver to the director, so please take care of it.

259
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,740
Yes, I understand.

260
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,560
Excuse me.

261
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,860
Yes, what happened?

262
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,400
I heard that I dropped my wallet somewhere.

263
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,500
Okay, I was able to deliver the paper.

264
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,340
So, if possible, I want to borrow a train ticket.

265
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,320
That's a problem.

266
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,260
Well, how much is it?

267
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,840
Can you return it if it's available?

268
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,580
Just about 350 yen.

269
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,160
I'm glad.

270
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,420
350 yen is just right.

271
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,300
Okay.

272
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,160
Well, take care of this and please return it.

273
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,260
Thank you.

274
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,980
You absurd!

275
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,720
What's the point of lending the money to the Red Valley?

276
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,680
It's the security of the post office.

277
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,280
It's natural.

278
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,960
I'll do it.

279
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,120
No, you can't.

280
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
I'm underestimate the people of the city.

281
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,140
What?

282
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,000
Even if you become a dead body,

283
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,060
I'm sure someone will help me.

284
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,960
I'm not. I just wanted to save someone in trouble.

285
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,860
You're the one in trouble now.

286
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,340
You gave him 350 yen worth of cash as a life-saving gift.

287
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,660
Do you know how reckless that is?

288
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,320
It's a million years too early to save a person.

289
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,420
I'll cool my head a little.

290
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:22,680
I'll cool my head a little.

291
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,180
You gave him 350 yen worth of cash as a life-saving gift.

292
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,140
Do you know how reckless that is?

293
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,640
You gave him 350 yen worth of cash as a life-saving gift.

294
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,140
I don't think the owner will show up, but I'll keep it for now.

295
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,100
You're so quiet that I can't tell. You're a crazy person.

296
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,040
I thought about what you said last night.

297
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,380
But I think what I did was right.

298
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,160
You're so stubborn.

299
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,140
You'll be gone in 4 or 5 days.

300
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,800
You can't live without food.

301
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,720
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

302
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,860
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

303
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,920
Turn that corner and look to the right.

304
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,060
I feel sorry for him.

305
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,620
You're so unfair.

306
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,120
You don't know when I'm hungry.

307
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,560
You're being too nice because I didn't eat enough.

308
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,460
You're being too nice because I didn't eat enough.

309
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,180
You're being too nice because I didn't eat enough.

310
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:50,720
You can see, you can see.

311
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,340
You're the same person. You're the same man.

312
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,620
In Ryo's case, it's different.

313
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,040
Nakagawa will...

314
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,580
Shut up!

315
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,760
Ah, fuck.

316
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,440
Special service, Nakagawa.

317
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,720
Let me introduce you a part-time job.

318
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,940
Alright, please.

319
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,500
I don't care, just eat your fill.

320
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,540
What's your name?

321
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,940
My name is Keiichi Kawanaka.

322
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,140
Kawanaka?

323
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,760
I'm late to work because the previous rain is making it hard.

324
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,680
Alright, I'll do my best.

325
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,380
Alright, I'll take care of you.

326
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,760
I'm counting on you.

327
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,080
Kanaka, wait a minute.

328
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,200
Yes, sir.

329
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,140
What's your name?

330
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,260
Well...

331
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,500
What? Everyone's at your place.

332
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,740
Yes, it was the scene of my company.

333
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,060
If you were the owner of Nakagawa Group, everyone would be upset.

334
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,020
I know. I can't say it out loud.

335
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,800
Hey, Kanaka.

336
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,740
Yes, sir.

337
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,760
Kanaka, you're going to help me today.

338
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Take, take care of him.

339
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,600
Oh, that's tough.

340
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,900
Are you okay, brother?

341
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,140
Yes, sir.

342
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:56,920
Thank you.

343
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,700
Thank you.

344
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,980
The fried rice and rice at that time...

345
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:08,860
What?

346
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,160
Are you Nakagawa's boss?

347
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,680
What?

348
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
This is what I mean.

349
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,220
The fried rice and rice industry?

350
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,720
Hachinosu Real Estate?

351
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,540
Dotanba?

352
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,920
You came to see Kei-chan?

353
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,480
I think I want to make a promotion for the next president of Nakagawa Group.

354
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,340
I see.

355
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,400
Unfortunately, Nakagawa is not present.

356
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,120
But I, who is his boss and a relative of his, will take over.

357
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,460
You are a relative of yours?

358
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,360
Yes.

359
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,720
My brother, Kinjiro's wife, is the eldest daughter of the wife of Nakagawa's grandmother's sister's son's divorced wife.

360
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,580
Ryouchi-san, how about drinking?

361
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,960
I'm more or less liquid.

362
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,260
How well can you go around the golf course?

363
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,280
I will go around.

364
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,500
What food do you like the most?

365
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,780
Judo...

366
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,880
Oh, I mean steak.

367
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,420
It's in Matsunaka.

368
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,160
hyo, what are you going to do?

369
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,760
Oh, dear.

370
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,460
Oh, brother, where are you rolling in the concrete?

371
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:10,960
This way.

372
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,180
I'm sorry.

373
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,980
How is it? Isn't this job easy?

374
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,480
Yes.

375
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,060
You're a police officer, right?

376
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,100
Did you get into card law?

377
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,760
What?

378
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,980
No, I heard you were talking about that at that ramen shop.

379
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,060
Well, there are various reasons for this.

380
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,840
Well, you seem to be serious, so I'll tell you a lot.

381
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,560
Thank you.

382
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,560
Hey, Yama, please organize the traffic on the front.

383
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,640
Yes.

384
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,040
Are you going to organize the traffic?

385
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,380
Yes. I'm saving the security personnel expenses at this station.

386
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,020
To such a place.

387
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,460
Kanaka, please help Yama.

388
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:54,800
Yes.

389
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,740
Don't look down on me like my real brother.

390
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,280
Listen to me.

391
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,080
Yes, sir.

392
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,580
Come on, come on.

393
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,100
What are you doing?

394
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,480
Excuse me.

395
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,940
I'm sorry.

396
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,140
I'll guide you.

397
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,340
Hey, hurry up.

398
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,240
Come on.

399
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,920
I'm sorry.

400
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,220
Can I go to the national road?

401
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,640
Yes, sir.

402
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,100
I'll guide you now.

403
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:20,900
Come on.

404
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,900
Come on.

405
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,920
Let's go.

406
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:25,820
Come on.

407
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,620
I'll cut it again today.

408
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,860
Yama, I'll go ahead of you.

409
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,120
Oh, I got it.

410
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,100
Wait a minute.

411
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,060
OK.

412
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,520
Thank you for waiting for a long time.

413
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,300
Please go ahead.

414
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,760
I'll go.

415
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,720
Thank you.

416
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,060
It's a must-do.

417
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,760
I've been working on my own business for a long time.

418
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:46,900
What?

419
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,580
That's right.

420
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,700
Don't you have anything to say?

421
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,360
Yes.

422
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:50,700
That's great.

423
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,280
I'm sure you'll be able to sell it.

424
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,620
Yes.

425
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Good luck.

426
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,240
Thank you.

427
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,980
Thank you.

428
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,220
Thank you.

429
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,440
I'm glad I got the money.

430
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,380
Thank you.

431
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,300
Thank you.

432
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,380
Thank you.

433
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,260
I'm glad I got the money.

434
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,520
Thank you.

435
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:10,740
Thank you.

436
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:10,920
Thank you.

437
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,700
I'll go upstairs.

438
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,840
What's up, Nii-chan?

439
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,740
Are you going to meet the field director?

440
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,740
No, I'm...

441
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,140
Nii-chan, do you want a drink?

442
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:18,860
Yes.

443
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,720
Well, the cup is...

444
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,440
I don't need anything like that.

445
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,860
Just close the lid like this with your finger.

446
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,240
Delicious!

447
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,740
One more!

448
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:32,880
Come on!

449
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,240
As expected of Maruno.

450
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,940
He's different.

451
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
Foie gras, caviar, and steak.

452
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,960
I'm sorry for having you eat this in the middle of the day.

453
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,480
Nii-chan, what are you going to do in the future?

454
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,920
Huh? The future?

455
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm going to be a great architect of the future.

456
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,380
Right, Yama?

457
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,160
Stop it.

458
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,840
I'm going to be a night shift at the industrial college.

459
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,880
Huh.

460
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,140
Next year,

461
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,080
I'm going to take over the design office of Nakagawa Construction,

462
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,040
but it's a high competitive position there.

463
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,560
Yama has different eyes from other people.

464
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,160
The other day,

465
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,980
you said you wanted to combine the zoo with the hotel, right?

466
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,840
It's just a thought.

467
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,340
It's interesting.

468
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,000
If I'm the president, I'll take over immediately.

469
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,740
I want to hire someone like that, too.

470
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,960
Oh, no.

471
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,560
You're like a president, Nii-chan.

472
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
It's fun.

473
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,000
Then let's get going.

474
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,460
Are we going to Ginza this time?

475
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,700
Or Akasaka?

476
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,140
Before that, let's go to Nakagawa Junior.

477
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,540
Oh, right.

478
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,060
Okay.

479
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,740
Leave it to me.

480
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,600
Okay, that's it for today.

481
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,320
Oh, it's over.

482
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,740
It was a tough day.

483
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,780
Are you okay?

484
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,140
I'm fine.

485
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,600
Here, here.

486
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,740
Onzoshi from Nakagawa Group is here.

487
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,060
Hey, Nakagawa.

488
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Senpai.

489
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,540
That person is...

490
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,700
Nakagawa Junior...

491
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,260
Nakagawa!

492
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,600
I brought you a business story as a relative.

493
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,540
Nakagawa?

494
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,680
You've got the wrong name.

495
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,280
Nakagawa?

496
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Please tell your father about it.

497
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,940
I can't do that.

498
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,980
I'm...

499
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,120
I see.

500
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,200
Of course, I'm the son of the president of Nakagawa Group.

501
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,480
I can't say it without saying it.

502
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,900
Senpai is trying to see if I'll protect him.

503
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,440
Nakagawa?

504
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,040
Who is that?

505
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,280
I'm Kawanaka.

506
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,360
Kawanaka!

507
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,780
Kawanaka?

508
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,780
Yes, it's Kawanaka.

509
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,640
Why?

510
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,520
Don't make a fuss.

511
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,140
You're not the same person.

512
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,440
Ryo, what's going on?

513
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,320
Did you trick us?

514
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,400
Please, tell us the truth.

515
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,320
Senpai is trying to test my courage.

516
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,600
I can't do that.

517
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,540
That's not true.

518
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,100
Don't joke, Senpai.

519
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,260
I'm Kawanaka.

520
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,740
Kawanaka!

521
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,640
It's true.

522
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,120
It's not a lie.

523
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,100
Believe me.

524
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,500
Anyway, let's talk over there.

525
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,200
He's the founder of Nakagawa Group.

526
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,740
I'm sure you can't afford to take money from the two of you.

527
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,020
Is he really from Nakagawa Group?

528
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,660
Hey, Kawanaka.

529
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,320
Take your pay today.

530
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,160
Okay.

531
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,520
Thank you for everything today.

532
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,700
You helped me.

533
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,900
Someday...

534
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,920
Nakagawa!

535
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,920
Don't say it again.

536
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,560
Help me!

537
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,120
Hey!

538
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,400
Ryo, I'll take your lunch.

539
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,840
Steak on Matsuzakagyu.

540
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,660
There's no such thing in Tsurukame Prefecture, Ryo.

541
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,600
Can I eat ramen now?

542
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,000
How about paying for it?

543
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,500
Damn it.

544
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,980
They just stole it.

545
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,140
And they gave me a bank note.

546
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,340
What are you going to do, Kei?

547
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,880
I'm going to make something and eat it.

548
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,780
I don't need it.

549
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,620
Kei, you're getting better.

550
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,120
Really?

551
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,160
What a jerk!

552
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,800
You can eat expensive food like a rich man.

553
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,920
That steak was delicious.

554
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,500
Hey, this is for Mr. Nakagawa.

555
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,400
Nakagawa?

556
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,160
Yes.

557
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,420
Sign here, please.

558
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,480
I got it!

559
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,240
I won the prize!

560
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,840
I kept my senior's advice and put out a postcard.

561
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,580
I'm so glad!

562
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,800
The last time.

563
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,920
The other day, Somo helped me a lot.

564
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,720
I want to thank him.

565
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,000
So, I'll invite him to my house.

566
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,040
What?

567
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,600
Well, of course.

568
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,160
Huh?

569
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,540
At that time?

570
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,600
This cat is eating real cat food!

571
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,660
What?

572
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,740
I gave 100 million yen to Mr. Nakagawa,

573
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,100
the honest man who gave me 100 million yen.

574
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,140
What?

575
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,300
100 million yen!

576
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,620
After all,

577
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,320
No matter how Nakagawa turns around,

578
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,500
he will be rich.

579
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,300
So, compare this.

610
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,540
Oh, this is the simulation game that I developed with Nakagawa-sensei?

611
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,000
Okay! Let's try it together!

612
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,180
Huh? If I'm not here, how will everyone's life be?

613
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,100
Is there such an absurd story?

614
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,680
Next time, "Repeat Life"!

615
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,660
I look forward to working with you!
