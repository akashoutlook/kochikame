1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,480
Please turn on the light for the TV to see the room.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,640
Please turn on the light for the TV to see the room.

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,440
The poor are coming to me.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,560
I'm not here but I'm worried.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,480
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

6
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,900
It will be somehow.

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:53,300
I have no job.

8
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:21,820
If you know, just follow me quietly.

9
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,540
I have no job.

10
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,140
The End

11
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,240
The End

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,160
The End

13
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,200
In the year 2301,

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,440
the life form of the Earth was in danger of extinction

15
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,500
due to the bacteria attack of the Dubidaba Seijin who were aiming for the earth's conquest.

16
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,780
On that day, at the secret base of the Earth Defense Force,

17
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,920
an important meeting was about to be held

18
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,300
to respect the lives of humanity, no, all living things on the earth.

19
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,080
The End

20
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,980
Today, there is no other reason why I have you all here.

21
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,200
Because the countermeasure against the Dubidaba Seijin's killing virus,

22
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,600
Shabadobi 11PM, has been finally discovered.

23
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:54,880
Really?

24
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,760
Really?

25
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,900
Then, Dr. Iidabashi, please explain.

26
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,280
Nice to meet you all.

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,940
I'm Iidabashi from Paradise Research Institute.

28
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,860
I have thoroughly researched the antibodies that can fight against Shabadobi 11PM,

29
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
including the past database.

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,240
As a result, I was able to discover only one of those antibodies with that possibility.

31
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,620
Please look at the screen.

32
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,980
This is the antibody that was found 300 years ago from a certain police officer's lymph node in Japan.

33
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,660
Surprisingly, this was an invincible antibody that could defeat any virus.

34
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,680
However, at that time, it was a very strong attack,

35
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,500
so it was dangerous for anyone other than the person who was infected.

36
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,920
So, the research was cut off.

37
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,240
Wow.

38
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,340
However, it is the 24th century now.

39
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,280
If we use the current medical science, we can control this antibody.

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,040
What?

41
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,940
Is it true?

42
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,440
Yes.

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,060
And this is the simulation result for Shabadobi 11PM.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,600
Wow.

45
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,660
If we can obtain this antibody and produce a large amount of vaccines,

46
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,100
we can eliminate the threat of Dubidaba Seijin's recent attack.

47
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,040
That's great.

48
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,820
That's great.

49
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,240
We can defeat the Dubidaba Seijin.

50
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,320
We can defeat the Dubidaba Seijin.

51
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,700
Professor, what is the name of that antibody?

52
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,240
The name of the star that saves humanity is Ryotsu GPX.

53
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,180
The only person who has that antibody is this Ryotsu Kankichi.

54
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,640
Ryotsu!

55
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,720
Ryotsu!

56
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,820
Ryotsu!

57
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,940
Ryotsu!

58
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,080
Ryotsu!

59
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,220
Ryotsu!

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,200
Ryotsu!

61
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,640
Ryotsu!

62
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,720
I recognize Ryotsu Kan-Kichi.

63
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,220
Ryotsu! Ryotsu! Ryotsu!

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,380
Let's go!

65
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,240
If you want to play baseball,

66
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,980
You need to be like this!

67
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,800
We'll give you a chance!

68
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,480
One more!

69
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,180
Ten!

70
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,620
No, no, no!

71
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,360
Oh, I won!

72
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,520
Don't worry!

73
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,720
The game is just beginning!

74
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,600
Tamachi!

75
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,140
Don't lose to such a cowardly man!

76
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,040
I know!

77
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,260
Director! Chief!

78
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,580
What's going on?

79
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,920
Ah, I'm sorry.

80
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,520
Reiko.

81
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,100
Actually, the director was sent to a shopping street to get a ticket for a pair ticket to a hot spring trip to Kyoto.

82
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,780
Unfortunately,

83
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,400
That day was Reiko's wedding.

84
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,560
If someone asked me to give it to him,

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,880
It would be a rock-paper-scissors competition.

86
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,800
One was decided by Ohara-kun,

87
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,860
But Ryotsu said the other was decided by baseball.

88
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,480
Then all the girls will get off.

89
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,680
It's Ryo-chan's usual cowardly hand.

90
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,540
But Komachi-chan has that personality.

91
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,200
Yo-yo-yo!

92
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,940
Oh, no!

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,140
Then Komachi,

94
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,060
Let's take it off!

95
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,820
Take it off?

96
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,980
You can take it off if you want.

97
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,300
Oyama!

98
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,180
We are Budokans!

99
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,460
We are Budokans!

100
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,340
I was born in this region!

101
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,540
Out!

102
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,880
If you do this,

103
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,140
I'll shake your ass out!

104
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,440
I'll shake your ass out!

105
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,300
I won!

106
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,600
That's what I called you!

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,180
Ah!

108
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,720
Don't put it off!

109
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,860
Cowardly gentleman!

110
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,500
Hey, Ryotsu!

111
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,300
You lose!

112
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,240
I won't forgive you for being so

113
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,480
sissy!

114
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,960
Don't worry!

115
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,580
Here!

116
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,580
How unfair!

117
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,600
You're wearing two pairs of pants!

118
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,060
There's no law that says you're not allowed to wear

119
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,840
any pair of pants!

120
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,460
Now, let's go to the next one!

121
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:07,580
Yeah!

122
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,240
How many pairs of pants are you wearing?

123
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,940
Now, here I go!

124
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:32,280
Now, what are you going to do, Komachi?

125
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,760
How frustrating!

126
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,060
I got the Kyoto trip here!

127
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,420
Oh!

128
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,320
Ryotsu Jitchoku, here I come!

129
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,300
Please come in.

130
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,960
Excuse me.

131
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:48,960
You can go.

132
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,280
I was wondering if the descendants of Ryotsu Kan'kichi

133
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,280
were among the defense force.

134
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,940
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,340
As the grandson-grandson-grandson-grandson

136
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:03,480
of Ryotsu Kan'kichi's brother,

137
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,720
you are the most suitable.

138
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,160
Oh, roast staff of Ryotsu.

139
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,280
I have a question.

140
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,620
Your mission is to find Ryoutsu Kankichi in Japan in 2001 and bring back Ryoutsu GPX.

141
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,240
Listen, your life is at stake! Please!

142
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,620
Yes! Even if I die, I'll bring back Ryoutsu GPX!

143
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,780
And this is the man called Ryoutsu Kankichi.

144
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,660
Well done, Miss Termi!

145
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:47,640
Listen, before the Earth Defense Force contacts us, we must eliminate Ryoutsu Kankichi.

146
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:59,160
Without Ryoutsu GPX, the Earth will be ours. Go, Miss Termi!

147
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,180
Roger.

148
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,280
Yes, Miss Termi.

149
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,540
I'm sorry, Nagaga.

150
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,320
Please enjoy the trip with the Chief and Kyoto!

151
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,240
Yes, sir!

152
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,640
Hey, wait! Wait!

153
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:28,880
Ryoutsu, it seems you were too sleepy to make it in time.

154
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,980
Now you can enjoy Kyoto alone.

155
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,440
Chief! Chief! You're mean!

156
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,000
R-Ryotsu, did you make it in time?

157
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,580
I told you I'd give Ryou a call in the morning!

158
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,400
Oh, really?

159
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,600
Well, I've been forgetting things lately.

160
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,660
I was about to be late, and I was in a hurry.

161
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,820
It was hard for me.

162
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,960
You should have been late.

163
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,780
What is it, Chief?

164
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,920
It seems you don't want to go on a trip with me.

165
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,300
Of course I don't!

166
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,460
I've never had anything good after going on a trip with you.

167
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,460
Like the last time we went to Paris...

168
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,220
It was my fault!

169
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,900
It's all right. I didn't have breakfast.

170
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,180
Then go on your own!

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,220
I can't believe I'm going to be with you for the next three days!

172
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,040
Oh, really? You're a bad boy!

173
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,140
W-W-Whatever...

174
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,640
Hey, you almost ate it. I'm going to cook him for you!

175
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,820
Well. That's a good day today.

176
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,560
You didn't eat much today, were you?

177
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,240
It seems like a volver to live a life like this, so...

178
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,000
W-What the hell is this?

179
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,040
R-Ryotsu...

180
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,040
Yes.

181
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,580
Where are you coming from?

182
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,160
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,260
Why are you here?

184
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,840
Didn't you go to Kyoto with Oharu?

185
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,700
No, I...

186
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,880
And what's that weird cosplay?

187
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,820
Change into your uniform!

188
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,480
Yes.

189
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,240
I'm glad I can wear something like this.

190
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,840
Does it look like the person named Ryotsu Kankichi?

191
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,900
I wonder if it's similar to someone named Ryotsu Kankichi.

192
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,920
As I thought, it's Ryotsu Kankichi!

193
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,860
No, I'm...

194
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,940
Why are you here?

195
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,860
Why?

196
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,960
I got it!

197
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,440
You bought the travel sword you got with your cheating baseball.

198
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,120
You sold it in a gold sword shop.

199
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,920
What?

200
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,820
That's right.

201
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,160
You're the worst man.

202
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
You're also the No. 1 man who doesn't want to marry for 12 years in a row!

203
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,060
No, no.

204
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,820
That's not it.

205
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,400
If you don't, you'll be married for 30 years in a row.

206
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,720
What?

207
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,680
I'm very sorry.

209
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,560
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,400
R-Ryotsu Kankichi lowered his head!

211
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,060
Something's wrong with him today.

212
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,880
Let's go.

213
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,460
Is the legend of Ryotsu Kankichi that was told to my house true?

214
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:10,940
Mr. Ryota!

215
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,840
We found it!

216
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,300
You!

217
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,160
What's the matter with you?

218
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,620
You're a liar!

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,180
This is also the legend.

220
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,440
This is what it is!

221
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,240
"A short kamikaze"

222
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,660
"A short kamikaze host"

223
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,500
"A short kamikaze host"

224
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:32,660
"A short kamikaze host"

225
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,800
"A short kamikaze host"

226
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,200
"A short kamikaze host"

227
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,620
"A short kamikaze host"

228
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,980
"A short kamikaze host"

229
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,160
It... It's... It's foam.

230
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,660
Senpai!

231
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,840
You want to see me?

232
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,220
Ryo-chan?

233
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,880
If you marry me, you won't be able to see me.

234
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
I want to see you, Ryo-chan.

235
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,040
Please tell me where you are.

236
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,200
Unfortunately, Senpai is on a trip to Kyoto.

237
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,440
-Kyoto? -Excuse me.

238
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,700
-Ryo-chan? -Ryo-chan?

239
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,660
What's wrong, Senpai?

240
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,660
Didn't you make it on time for the bullet train?

241
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,420
No, it's not that.

242
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,580
It's not that.

243
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,580
I'm...

244
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,920
Ryo-chan is 95% confident that he is the real Ryo-chan.

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,940
Ryo-sama!

246
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,060
What are you doing to my Ryo-sama?

247
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,020
N-no way!

248
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,740
W-what's wrong with him?

249
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,400
He's 24 years old.

250
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,240
He's the Terminator, a robot killer from the 24th century.

251
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,980
Terminator?

252
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,660
Why do you know me?

253
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,280
Don't tell me you're...

254
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,980
Exactly!

255
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,020
I've been under the command of the Earth Defense Forces since the 24th century.

256
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,480
My name is Ryo-tsu.

257
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,520
What?

258
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,240
You're not Ryo-tsu Kankichi?

259
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,060
Kankichi is my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grand-grandfather's brother.

260
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,760
You're not Ryo-chan?

261
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,740
Please stop joking around, senpai.

262
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:15,660
Whatever.

263
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,680
If you kill me, there won't be any people left who can carry G.P.X. to the 24th century.

264
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,280
Die!

265
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:23,800
Run!

266
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:45,880
Ah!

267
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,580
- He's not here! - He's a fast runner!

268
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,160
When the sound of the night-time whistle started,

269
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,500
it seemed like he ran away in a hurry.

270
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,520
Maybe he's weak to the sound of a certain frequency.

271
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,620
Um, I don't know what it is at all!

272
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,240
That's right! Please explain!

273
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,720
Um...

274
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,760
Ryotsu, it's Jitchoku.

275
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,360
Jitchoku!

276
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,920
What do you mean by 24th century or something-ancient?

277
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,620
All right, everyone. I'll explain it to you properly.

278
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,280
What?!

279
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,840
Is that what the Earth will look like 300 years from now?

280
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,800
You wouldn't believe it, but it's true.

281
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,740
What?

282
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,480
I thought you were talking about the world of manga.

283
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,220
I thought you were talking about the world of manga.

284
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,460
But it's a lame name for a Terminator.

285
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,940
Yeah, because he's a flying adult.

286
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,660
Anyway, it's true that Ryo is aiming for his life.

287
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,500
I'll call you, senpai.

288
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,020
What's with the noise?

289
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,820
Use your mobile phone as a deck.

290
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,240
I know.

291
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,220
I'm on a treat trip now.

292
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,420
I can't keep up with you if you keep bothering me.

293
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,000
It's not working.

294
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,720
It's not connecting.

295
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,900
If we wait, Ryo and the manager will be in danger.

296
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,280
We'll go to Kyoto, too!

297
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,820
Yeah!

298
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:29,920
Eh?!

299
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,900
We'll go to Kyoto, too!

300
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,320
Then we'll go straight to the inn and have a big drink.

301
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,540
Then we'll go straight to the inn and have a big drink.

302
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,380
What are you thinking?

303
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,180
What are you thinking?

304
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,980
That's why we don't have to come to Kyoto.

305
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:41,980
That's why we don't have to come to Kyoto.

306
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,720
If we were going to come to a temple, we wouldn't have come here.

307
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,600
Of course! A guy like you who got a punishment is a perfect opportunity!

308
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,040
I'll use you to purify that rotten heart!

309
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:06,840
Chief, let's take a picture here.

310
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,180
With a self timer, the two of us together...

311
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,680
Let's leave it around here.

312
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,120
Chief, a little more right...

313
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,940
Yes, like this.

314
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,540
Hehehe, what are you dressed up for?

315
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,440
Ryo Tsukan Kitsu, 100% Probability of the real person.

316
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,800
Okay, here we go.

317
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,060
Target locked on.

318
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,500
Here we go!

319
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,960
What are you doing?

320
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Hahaha, I'm just playing with the trash.

321
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,280
Just kidding.

322
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,960
Generally, when you go on a trip,

323
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,740
there's no one who can wear something so easy to slip.

324
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,300
Oh well, next up is the Kiyomizu Temple.

325
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,480
Hey, Chief!

326
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,400
The two-shot photo is not ready yet!

327
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,300
Please wait for me, Chief!

328
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,140
Da!

329
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,280
Oh, no!

330
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,800
It's the Koke Temple, the Koke Temple!

331
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,220
Let's do this forever.

332
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,000
Chief...

333
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,620
Here, cheese!

334
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,640
Now, next up is Ryo.

335
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,060
Let's go to the Kiyomizu Temple.

336
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,260
Wait a minute, Chief.

337
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,700
I haven't even taken a single photo yet.

338
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,380
Hmph, it's a waste of film.

339
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,140
Chief, that's too much.

340
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,760
Traveling is a way off, and I'm a pathetic person.

341
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,300
Okay, I'll just take one.

342
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,140
Hehehe, please.

343
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,140
Chief, please take a cool one.

344
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,980
Chief, please take a cool one.

345
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,160
Chief, please take a cool one.

346
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,680
Chief, please take a cool one.

347
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,680
Chief, please take a cool one.

348
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,540
Here, cheese!

349
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,920
Huh...?

350
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:51,900
Yui!

351
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,980
Yui!!!

352
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,700
R-Ryo!

353
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,680
Yieee!!!

354
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,080
Argh!

355
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,260
I really fell from the Kiyomizu's line.

356
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,960
Idiot!

357
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,020
Huh?

358
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,520
Is there anyone to destroy the Kiyomizu Temple?

359
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,080
That's not true! I didn't break it!

360
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,440
Why don't you worry about me?

361
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,320
It's okay! You won't die that easily!

362
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,720
Hey, you're the chief's bad guy!

363
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,080
So this is the 21st century Kyoto.

364
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,580
So what are you going to do, Kei?

365
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,740
You two must be traveling around Kyoto.

366
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,160
Even if I say that, there are too many famous places in Kyoto.

367
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,820
We have to find them quickly.

368
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,600
Otherwise, Senpai's life will be in danger!

369
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,020
Chief, why do I have to sit in the front?

370
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,960
To purify your rotten heart.

371
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,860
I'll be quiet until I do that.

372
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,640
It can't be helped.

373
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,360
Ah, again.

374
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,880
What?

375
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,120
It's a mole!

376
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,780
This is heavy!

377
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,020
Just a bit...

378
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,620
Oh, no, no!

379
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,640
Now it's here, the idiot mole!

380
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,180
Let's get out of here!

381
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,620
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

382
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,340
Come on! Come on! Come on!

383
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,800
Come on! Come on! Come on!

384
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,100
Come on! Come on! Come on!

385
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,760
Come on! Come on! Come on!

386
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,640
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

387
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,160
Damn it! That Mogura is so quick to run away!

388
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,120
You idiot!

389
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,420
What are you doing to the national heritage site?

390
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,160
I will definitely kill you!

391
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,700
Ah, hot spring trips are only for this.

392
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,560
However, Ryotsu, it's not good to travel with you.

393
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,380
Yes, yes, it's the 65th time I've talked about it.

394
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,900
Ah, damn it, I have to bow my head to get here.

395
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,340
Yes, yes, I understand.

396
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,060
In general, Ryotsu, do you know how much I'm suffering for you?

397
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,220
Yes, I understand.

398
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,520
It's not good to travel with you.

399
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,400
Yes, yes.

400
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,360
You're bowing your head to get here.

401
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,620
It's the 66th time.

402
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,140
Did you say something?

403
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,180
No, no, no.

404
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,440
I really can't be like Chief Ohara.

405
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,680
I'm here.

406
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,860
Did you finally understand, you idiot?

407
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,100
You can't be like Chief Ohara.

408
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,960
Chief, I'm going back to my room.

409
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,140
I see.

410
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,980
There's a bus that's surprisingly fast if there's a car.

411
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,380
It's the type that's easy to get lost.

412
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,680
I see.

413
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,540
Don't care for thet he care about me.

414
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,500
Ryotsu.

415
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,260
All right.

416
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,980
Hey, hey, hey.

417
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,640
It's no police office to do such a challenging thing.

418
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,100
Please stop, chief.

419
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,720
We can see a little further from here.

420
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,440
S-S-Shh.

421
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,140
Uncle, I can't stand these.

422
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,380
Don't do it.

423
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,540
My god.

424
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,240
What?!

425
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,120
I'm sorry!

426
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,180
-Excuse us! -Excuse us!

427
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:00,840
I will kill Ryotsu Kankichi for sure!

428
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,500
Thanks to you, I was able to become a commander!

429
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,180
The chief will kick the house!

430
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,280
-I will be a commander! -Captain Ryo!

431
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,380
W-what are you doing?

432
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,320
Ryo! Are you okay?

433
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,560
I'm so glad!

434
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,700
Why are you here?

435
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,140
Actually...

436
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,640
What?

437
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,140
Oh...

438
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,080
Oh...

439
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,240
Why are there two of us?

440
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
Since the 24th century...

441
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,680
Hmm...

442
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,420
It's like a dream...

443
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,640
I can't believe it.

444
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,640
Then, the reason why I fell off the stage of Kiyomizu,

445
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,620
and the Mobra Incident in Ryoanji...

446
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,820
Could it be...

447
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,060
It's definitely Terminator's doing!

448
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,400
Come on, Ryotsu!

449
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,560
Ryo!

450
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,000
What's wrong?

451
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,820
You shouldn't bring such a robot!

452
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,380
You're my descendant!

453
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,900
Stop it, Ryotsu!

454
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,580
Ugh...

455
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,940
Really...

456
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,600
My family...

457
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:08,940
You're just like the legend!

458
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,120
Shut up!

459
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,720
I've been thinking of dying many times!

460
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,860
Don't be ridiculous!

461
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,760
You're so annoying!

462
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,280
Anyway, your body, the Ryotsu GPX,

463
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,180
is destined for the future of the Earth!

464
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,180
I will drink it under any conditions!

465
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,200
So please let me take it back!

466
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,720
Please!

467
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,240
What?

468
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,520
Hey!

469
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,880
I just told you that I will drink it under any conditions!

470
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,220
Y-yes!

471
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,200
I got it!

472
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,660
Then I'll take my body for a million yen!

473
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,360
A-a million yen?

474
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,600
Y-you...

475
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,560
You may be conquered by the aliens 300 years from now!

476
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,280
That's right!

477
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,520
Don't try to make a fortune by putting yourself in the weak spot of people!

478
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,620
Hmm!

479
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,600
Whatever you say,

480
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,080
if you don't give me a million yen,

481
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,780
I won't give you back my body!

482
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,800
Now, what are you going to do?

483
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,080
Okay, I understand.

484
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,720
What?

485
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,780
I've prepared your documents from the future.

486
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,500
I thought there might be something like this,

487
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,680
so I prepared them.

488
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,540
Here you are.

489
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,280
What?

490
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,080
What is this?

491
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,460
As you can see, it's a million-yen bill.

492
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
A million-yen bill?

493
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,480
You idiot!

494
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,060
It's meaningless if it's not money that can be used in the 21st century!

495
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,360
Even if you say that...

496
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,380
How about a gold worth a million yen?

497
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,640
A gold?

498
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,680
If it's a gold, I can sell it here!

499
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,540
Okay!

500
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,400
I'm okay!

501
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,300
But, it's hard to collect a gold worth a million yen from now on!

502
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,520
If we go back to the 24th century,

503
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,400
I think we can get it back somehow.

504
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,660
Okay, then get it ready quickly!

505
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,440
Okay.

506
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,700
Then, I'll go back to Tokyo with the time machine.

507
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,120
Can you use the helicopter?

508
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,260
Oh, it's okay because I have this.

509
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,040
At that time!

510
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,500
Wow!

511
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,500
You're a cat-shaped robot!

512
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,180
If I used this from the beginning,

513
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,140
I would have been able to come to Kyoto immediately, right?

514
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,340
I'm sorry.

515
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
I had to prepare a helicopter,

516
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,300
so I couldn't say it.

517
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,400
Then, I'll go back.

518
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,240
It seems that the story is true.

519
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,300
Oh, I forgot to wear my shoes.

520
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,840
Well, it's okay.

521
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,020
Here we go.

522
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,640
But, somehow...

523
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,960
I was cut.

524
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,080
I couldn't get help from the Kyoto sub-district.

525
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,460
It's not impossible.

526
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,700
It's like a SF story.

527
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,760
If this happens,

528
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,220
I'll go out directly

529
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,380
and ask for your help.

530
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,340
Okay, then.

531
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,060
I'll ask for your help.

532
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,360
Don't worry.

533
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,520
I just asked them for help.

534
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,280
Eh?

535
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,960
To whom?

536
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,360
More importantly, I'm hungry.

537
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,340
Let's eat.

538
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,360
Monster!

539
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,120
What are you saying

540
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,240
that the fate of future humanity is in your hands?

541
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,300
More than the future for hundreds of years,

542
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,560
I came to Kyoto,

543
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,320
so let's eat something delicious!

544
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,600
Excuse me.

545
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,520
Huh?

546
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,400
I've prepared a meal.

547
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,840
Oh, it's a good timing.

548
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,780
Huh?

549
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,540
Oh, it's a big one.

550
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,820
What about the meal?

551
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:13,740
Eh?

552
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,800
Ah!

553
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,300
Ah!

554
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,540
Ah!

555
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,620
Ah!

556
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,220
Ah!

557
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,440
Ah!

558
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,460
Ah!

559
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,940
What are you doing to me?

560
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,280
Ah!

561
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:30,920
Ah!

562
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,520
Ah!

563
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,060
Mariya, are you okay?

564
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,500
Ah!

565
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,440
Captain,

566
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,620
I remember where you were.

567
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,400
You're a growing up.

568
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,040
It's a terrible situation.

569
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,600
We have to do something about it as soon as possible!

570
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,240
Uch…

571
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,280
Ah…

572
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,920
Uch…

573
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,660
Uch…

574
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,380
I won't let you get away!

575
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:55,980
S shameful loser!

576
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:56,940
S shameful loser!

577
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,380
Ugh!

578
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,360
I can't run away anymore.

579
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,000
Prepare yourself!

580
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:13,600
Oh, a firecracker!

581
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,360
That was pretty quick.

582
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,260
I was in a camp in Kurama-yama.

583
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,880
Are you Ushiwakamaru?

584
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,840
Who are you?

585
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,060
I'm not just a skeleton.

586
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,200
When an incident happens on the land,

587
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,440
I solve everything with just one firecracker!

588
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,200
I'm the leader of the Special Investigation Division, Sanbagaras!

589
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,440
Firecracker Deca-sadaima is here!

590
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,900
No analysis. No response data.

591
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,020
Then I'll kill the one who forgets!

592
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,840
Wait!

593
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,560
Terminé-chan, I don't like to fight.

594
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,580
Let's throw away our weapons and talk about this.

595
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,860
You...

596
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,540
Now, you, throw your weapons away!

597
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,520
Oh, no, again.

598
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,580
Don't be in a hurry.

599
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,780
Time to eat.

600
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,200
You must have a surprise for the first time.

601
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,140
I don't get it.

602
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,740
That's meaningless!

603
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,080
Now, the meal is over.

604
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,240
You're going to do it, after all?

605
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,860
What are you doing?

606
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,380
Now, you'll be naked, too.

607
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,080
W-What are you thinking?

608
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,440
Why do I have to be naked?

609
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,540
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

610
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,420
When humans are born, they're all naked.

611
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,440
Why don't we talk to each other in a pure heart like babies?

612
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,500
Idiot! That's a robot!

613
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,920
That's not what we're talking about!

614
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,740
All right, fine.

615
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,580
What? You're kidding!

616
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,300
But I was a little happy.

617
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,840
What?

618
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,920
That's not me!

619
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,220
I got it!

620
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,520
Hey!

621
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,320
I-I-I lost!

622
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,440
Hey, you! Don't try and decide who wins!

623
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,080
It is a loss for me!

624
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,960
Hey, you! I forgot about this!

625
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,500
Uwaaaah!

626
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,080
It's no use running away!

627
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,100
Hai!

628
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,920
Uwaaaah! Stop it, you idiot!

629
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,420
Uwaaaah!

630
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,960
Nyeh!

631
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,300
Ugh!

632
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,060
Uwaaaah!

633
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,880
La la la la la la la!

634
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,320
Love the sea and protect justice!

635
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,400
Who read this, Poseidon?

636
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,960
I'll put it in my tank!

637
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,800
In my tank!

638
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,500
Snikkon!

639
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,020
La la la la la la la!

640
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,720
I am the captain of the Water Police Force, Umino Dodaemon!

641
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,680
The

642
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,740
Dolphin Degga!

643
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:38,740
I can't analyze it! I can't analyze it!

644
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,920
A-Also...

645
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,100
You came to a good place!

646
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:43,960
Hahaha!

647
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,280
I'm here, so it's fine!

648
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,620
Dolphin!

649
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,360
Come on!

650
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,400
Come on! Dolphins!

651
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,740
Hehehe!

652
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,240
Well, you know...

653
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,400
It's a promise, after all!

654
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,480
Dolphins!

655
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,440
Hehehe!

656
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,200
Let's go!

657
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:18,980
Duh!

658
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,640
Yes!

659
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,460
Duh!

660
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,740
All right!

661
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,020
Next!

662
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,060
Hehehe!

663
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,660
Come on!

664
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,180
That's right!

665
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,800
Duh!

666
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,580
Duh!

667
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,400
Duh!

668
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,080
Duh!

669
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,040
Duh!

670
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,860
Duh!

671
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,960
Duh!

672
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,080
Duh!

673
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,560
Duh!

674
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:44,760
Duh!

675
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,540
Duh!

676
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,380
Duh!

677
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,580
Duh!

678
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,140
"The Dolphin"

679
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,400
No! My cute dolphins are...

680
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,320
...in a big trouble!

681
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,300
Hey! I'm on board too!

682
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,080
This Dolphin is a one-man ride!

683
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,260
Sorry, Ryotsu!

684
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,760
You didn't come to save me, did you?!

685
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,720
"The Dolphin"

686
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,860
Don't look at me like that!

687
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,780
"The Dolphin"

688
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,220
The moon's energy is in my back!

689
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,760
The stick of justice is in the dark!

690
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,820
If it's a sky incident, I'll take care of it!

691
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,540
The next death, the giant giant!

692
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,400
The same, the giant Venus!

693
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,620
I'm on board!

694
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,840
I don't care about the factory that's long!

695
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,220
Help me quickly!

696
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,440
Sure!

697
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:11,660
"The Dolphin"

698
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,240
"The Dolphin"

699
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,320
Go!

700
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,800
"The Dolphin"

701
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,460
Bye!

702
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,200
"The Dolphin"

703
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,760
What the...!?

704
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,240
"The Dolphin"

705
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,940
Hey, they're coming this way!

706
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,780
They'll get us!

707
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:38,900
"The Dolphin"

708
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,540
I'll do it this way!

709
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,080
I'm the giant Venus, Henshinder!

710
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:45,720
I got it!

711
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,900
I don't have to do that!

712
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,540
Make up!

713
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,200
Let me explain!

714
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,160
When the Moonlight Giant transforms into Q-chan,

715
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,080
he can run 42.195 kilometers with his strong mental strength!

716
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,980
Q-chan, let's start here!

717
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,380
Yes!

718
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,260
I don't understand! I don't understand!

719
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,620
It's impossible!

720
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,320
Director! Where's Director?

721
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,540
Please praise Q-chan.

722
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,560
Ah, Director!

723
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,660
Damn it!

724
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,340
He's always doing those time-out jokes,

725
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,980
and now this is what's happening!

726
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,320
But what am I supposed to do if the Special Giant doesn't work at all?

727
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,580
DRIVE ON!

728
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,120
-Senpai! -Ryo-sama!

729
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,800
Ryo-chan!

730
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,500
Hey, it's you! Get me down!

731
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,260
Ryo-sama, I'm home!

732
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,020
Ryo-sama, are you all right?

733
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,840
Maybe, but...

734
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,040
Ryotsu, we finally got the Kyoto city police to act!

735
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,140
Senpai, where's he?

736
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,240
He's in the basement.

737
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,200
That's what we're talking about!

738
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,000
There they are!

739
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,240
Fire!

740
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,400
The Batow Car that the Kyoto prefecture gave us...

741
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,860
What are you talking about at a time like this?!

742
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,720
Damn it!

743
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,960
Nakagawa, get him!

744
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:53,660
Yes!

745
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,520
You're not getting away!

746
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,680
Maria, hurry up!

747
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,160
I know, boss!

748
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,600
I know, boss!

749
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,720
I did it!

750
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,820
Maybe.

751
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,820
You really did it.

752
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,100
What?

753
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,860
What?

754
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,060
Why did you become me?

755
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,620
And you're so innocent.

756
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,580
I went to the public bath.

757
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,520
It's not up to you, chief Ohara.

758
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,060
It's not up to you, chief Ohara.

759
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,240
This is my weakness.

760
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,420
It's different.

761
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,620
Robots in the 24th century are pretty stupid.

762
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,000
I'll kill you!

763
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,540
I won't let you touch one finger of the

764
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:24,060
You're getting in the way!

765
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,720
Leave me alone!

766
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,840
Maria!

767
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,820
Great news is coming in from Kyoto.

768
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,360
Today's on-site, Mr. Yamazaki!

769
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,520
erna!

770
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,320
O-Ohara-kun!

771
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,780
Suddenly, a mysterious giant sea monster appeared in Kinkaku City!

772
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,240
Surprisingly, the monster is...

773
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,720
-It's me! -No, that's not me!

774
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,480
-I'm the real one here! -What are you doing?!

775
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,420
We're live-streaming!

776
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,980
That's a robot called "Termine-chan" that can transform into anything!

777
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,620
-Termine-chan? -Believe me!

778
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,320
The real one is...

779
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,620
Kinkaku!

780
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,120
It's terrible! A huge sea monster has started running off!

781
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,360
You idiot!

782
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,340
It's an pesticide that falled from under the sea!

783
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,060
Wait!

784
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,440
Hey, how could you keep clicking up these things earlier?

785
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,100
Well...

786
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,300
Hey, how could you keep clicking up these things earlier?

787
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,440
But what will be shown if you draw it?

788
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,960
Camera! It's a gold-plated paper pot!

789
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,120
Gold-plated paper pot!

790
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,060
Alright! Camera, change!

791
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,140
How's that?

792
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,780
This is the real gold-plated paper!

793
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Oh no!

794
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,940
Oh no! It's on the front of the gold-plated paper!

795
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,880
It's on the front of the gold-plated paper!

796
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,100
-Ryo-chan! -Ryo-chan!

797
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,920
Die!

798
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,340
I crushed the gold-plated paper pot!

799
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,880
Ryo-chan!

800
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,900
I'll kill you!

801
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,000
Wh-What's that?!

802
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,220
Senpai!

803
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,440
Looks like you made it in time.

804
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,400
Nagagawa! Reiko! What's going on?

805
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,280
Actually, when Mr. Jitchok was being targeted at the emergency room...

806
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,860
...Terminator-chan was really reluctant to hear the sound of the boiling pipe!

807
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,760
Terminator-chan is weak to that sound.

808
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,820
Is that true?

809
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,020
How fast! Pick up the speaker!

810
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,820
Roger! Commence operation!

811
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:23,320
What was that great noise?

812
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,300
Na-Nagagawa, you're not even going to scare them?

813
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,920
Oh no! That's weird...

814
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,740
Oh, I've got it...

815
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:35,440
What are you thinking about, Kourin?

816
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,360
Damn it!

817
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,620
It's strange. I was so scared that I was shaking back then.

818
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,560
You said it was a boiling night.

819
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,060
Yeah.

820
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,320
A boiling night, huh.

821
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,480
Maybe...

822
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,600
Ryo!

823
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,740
Ryo!

824
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,820
Ryo!

825
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,240
Senpai!

826
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,780
What are you doing, Giryou-chan?

827
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,780
Ouch!

828
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,560
Ouch!

829
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,920
Ouch!

830
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,840
Oh, no!

831
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:33,960
Ouch!

832
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,620
With this, I'll take it down!

833
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,440
Ouch.

834
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:52,780
Oh? The Terminator is...

835
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,520
Wh-Wh-What's wrong?

836
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,160
Sir!

837
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,020
Just as I thought.

838
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:57,840
Huh?

839
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,240
Good grief! Who was he to be so weak?

840
00:42:59,440 --> 00:42:59,720
Huh? Good grief! Who was he to be so weak?

841
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,520
It wasn't sound, it was fire!

842
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,760
I see!

843
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,860
Nakagawa, gather gas in the whole of Kyoto with a tank lorry!

844
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,780
We're going to get rid of him!

845
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:07,880
Idiot!

846
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,160
If we do that and Kyoto becomes a disaster, what are we going to do?

847
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,960
Even if we do that, it's a disaster, so there's no way we can do anything about it!

848
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,540
Gozu Tank Team!

849
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,140
Kill them!

850
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,240
Wait!

851
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,640
I'm going to get a bit of a bite!

852
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,500
That's right! It's a tank lorry in the middle of Kyoto!

853
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,100
Eh? Where?

854
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,220
No matter where you say it...

855
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,460
Yes!

856
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,140
Maria!

857
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,760
Maria, are you okay?

858
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,200
Yes. I was thrown off and crashed into the mountain...

859
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,140
So, where are we now?

860
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,320
We're here...

861
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,020
Daimonji Mountain!

862
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,660
Daimonji Mountain?

863
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,240
That Daimonji mountain in Daimonji Yaki?

864
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,060
That's it!

865
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,200
It's the only place in Kyoto that can burn a great fire!

866
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,240
Tank lorry, forward to the tank lorry!

867
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,000
Our destination is Daimonji Mountain!

868
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,080
Let's gather at Daimonji Mountain!

869
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,340
Again!

870
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,340
Our destination is Daimonji Mountain!

871
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,940
Here they come!

872
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,060
Take this!

873
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,240
Gozu's Tank!

874
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,980
Here we go!

875
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:39,900
We're here!

876
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:40,740
We're here!

877
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,600
St grav!

878
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,380
We are here!

879
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,080
Let's get into the tank!

880
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,200
We're here!

881
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,320
They might not want us there!

882
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,100
I'm not waiting for you!

883
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,000
Senpai!

884
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,960
Help me, Nakagawa!

885
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,440
We have gathered the Tankrollies at Daimonji Mountain.

886
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,900
Senpai, please send the Terminators to Daimonji Mountain!

887
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:15,760
Please do it!

888
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,860
Hey, put on your pen!

889
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,840
Alright! I'm ready!

890
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,060
Senpai, I'm counting on you!

891
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,820
Ryozu, you're not ready yet?

892
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,780
He's here!

893
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,580
He's almost there!

894
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,220
Ryozu!

895
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,480
Ryozu, the Tankrollies are ahead of us!

896
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,540
Okay! Roger that!

897
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,520
Wait for me, Ryozu!

898
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,340
The mountain roads are really tough.

899
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:20,040
You can't escape anymore.

900
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,080
I'll crush you!

901
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,880
Idiot!

902
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,100
Ryozu!

903
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,600
Ryozu!

904
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,740
W-What is this?

905
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:43,700
Beat!

906
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,620
Hey, Terminator!

907
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,260
Your mother is coming!

908
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,620
Hurray! Hurray!

909
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,800
Hurray! Hurray!

910
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,380
Idiot!

911
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,540
Ryozu!

912
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,400
Wait for me!

913
00:46:59,320 --> 00:46:59,760
Ryozu!

914
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,280
Arghh!

915
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,120
I got you! You're a Terminator!

916
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,260
What did you do?

917
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,560
What do you mean?

918
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,420
Yes!

919
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:09,880
What does it mean?

920
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,300
W-What is this!?

921
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,280
Uh!

922
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:20,820
What?

923
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:20,920
Roar!

924
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,760
Roar!

925
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,000
Roar!

926
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,420
Roar!

927
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:23,780
Groar!

928
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,620
Gwaaahhh!

929
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,580
Roar!

930
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,180
R-R-R-Roar!

931
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,660
And then...

932
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,460
Alright! I did it!

933
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,540
Ryo-sama!

934
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,220
Oh, Maria! I called you!

935
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,480
If it's for Ryo-sama's sake, even if it's in fire or water!

936
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:52,960
It's in the water!

937
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,700
It seems that it's settled down in one fell swoop.

938
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,600
But I never thought that we would be able to see Daimonji-yaki without the season.

939
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,380
Alright, we're done.

940
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,100
With this, the future of the Earth will surely be saved.

941
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,120
It's pretty easy, isn't it?

942
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,240
Well then, everyone, thank you for your cooperation.

943
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,040
That was good.

944
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,900
Hey, I wonder if my gold will really arrive.

945
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,900
Yes, I think it will arrive soon.

946
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,460
Oh, it seems that it has arrived.

947
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,120
Well then, I'll take my leave now.

948
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,340
Please be careful.

949
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,500
Take care.

950
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,840
Yes, thank you very much.

951
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,120
Gold! It's my gold!

952
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,360
With this, I'm rich again!

953
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:50,700
It's a gold!

954
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,680
It's a gold!

955
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:52,880
No, you can't.

956
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,020
All of that gold is confiscated.

957
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,240
Huh? Why?

958
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,020
How much damage do you think you've done to Kyoto in this incident?

959
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,920
That's all Terminator's job, isn't it?

960
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,060
This is my gold!

961
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,060
No, you can't!

962
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,260
I'll use it as a refund fee.

963
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,060
That's right!

964
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,000
Hey, Chichoku!

965
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,140
Get me another trillion yen!

966
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,420
Yes!

967
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,280
Hey!

968
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,040
Wait, Chichoku!

969
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:16,900
Wait a minute!

970
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,420
Huh?

971
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,500
Huh?

972
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,000
W-What's going on?

973
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,060
It seems that the time warp entrance has been blocked.

974
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,480
I-I can't believe it!

975
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,380
At one time, in the year 2301,

976
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,980
thanks to the Ryotsu GPX, which was brought back from the 21st century,

977
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,520
the Earth regained its peace once again.

978
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,840
It was a joyous, joyous...

979
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:42,280
There's no joyous thing!

980
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,880
This is the Honen Horizon's Stabilization Adventure!

981
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,940
Everyone, get ready to participate!

982
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:03,040
Go for it!

983
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,200
Atrocious!

984
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:08,880
This is the Honen Horizon!

985
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,280
Go for it!

986
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,520
Go for it!

987
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,820
Go for it!

988
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,840
Uh, I'm bored!

989
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:13,880
Then, how you're going to survive the rest of the day?

990
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,360
I can feel a miracle.

991
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,480
Hm...

992
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:26,140
So I kept kicking until I got home

993
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,560
When I was a red stone on the road

994
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:37,340
Everyone was a child once, but everyone forgot

995
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,800
A religious man with a scary face

996
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,520
A girl with a loose heart

997
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,500
A girl with a burning heart

998
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,700
Look at that corner

999
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,460
You'll see everyone

1000
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,160
There's a turtle over there

1001
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,900
There must be a turtle

1002
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:09,040
Everyone, come to our town
