00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,920
"The Greatest Fiction"

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,240
When you watch TV,

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,780
make your room bright and

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,860
look away.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:13,800
"The Greatest Fiction"

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,020
"The Greatest Fiction"

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,620
Come to me,

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,220
you poor boy!

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,380
I'm not here,

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,180
but I'm worried.

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:28,900
What are you going?

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,800
Look at the blue sky,

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,960
the white clouds.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,180
After a while,

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,820
I hope it's going to work out.

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,980
"The Greatest Fiction"

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,160
The old lady

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,800
Come to me!

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but I'm worried

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,980
Look, the red cloud is burning

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,580
It'll be alright somehow

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,580
You know, right?

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,220
You know, you know!

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,700
If you know, then keep quiet and follow me!

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,760
I'll be waiting for you!

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,080
I'll be waiting for you!

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,000
Kisan Sanzan! Once again!

28
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,120
Hmm...

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,300
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

30
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,320
I'm worried about tomorrow.

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,280
Ah!

32
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,380
I see. Tomorrow is March 3rd, Ryo-san's birthday.

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,620
I can't see Ryo-san's face on his birthday every year.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,720
I can't go to work. I can't stay at home.

35
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,200
How about going to the game field?

36
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,740
The game field?

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,100
No, I'm going to lose!

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,780
Then, what about the pachinko?

39
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,560
Pachinko?

40
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,020
If I lose, the ceiling will break and the pachinko balls will fall.

41
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,500
I'll go to the manga cafe and read the manga.

42
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,340
If I lose, the ceiling will break and the pachinko balls will fall.

43
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,860
The manga cafe?

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,280
I feel like I'll get in trouble for the fire.

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,580
Don't you think you're too worried?

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,380
No, I'm not!

47
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
I've been in trouble so far!

48
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,820
But I don't think that your bad luck is just because it's your birthday.

49
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,920
Ryo-san always seems to be in trouble.

50
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,260
That's the momentary end.

51
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,320
I'm in trouble.

52
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,840
Really?

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,100
I'm worried about my self-preservation.

54
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,200
Self-preservation?

55
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,380
Yes.

56
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,060
When I think that today is a bad day, I remember only bad things.

57
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,640
When I think that today is a good day, I get a good impression.

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,700
Good and bad days are determined by the mood of the day.

59
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,440
Ryo-chan thinks that bad things will happen on her birthday, so she feels like she's in trouble.

60
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,760
But in fact...

61
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,740
That's right.

62
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,600
Let's have a birthday party for Ryo-chan tomorrow.

63
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,080
What?

64
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,020
Really?

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,060
Yes.

66
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,460
After Ryo-chan finishes her work, I'll make you some food.

67
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,120
I'll prepare a present for you.

68
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,340
Then I'll have one too.

69
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,880
That's a good idea.

70
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,600
Let's call Honda-san, Volvo-san, and Sakonji-san and have a fun party.

71
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,660
Yes!

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
But maybe the party will be canceled because of some incident.

73
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,080
It's not good to think like that.

74
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,620
That's right.

75
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,220
Tomorrow is a good day.

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,800
If you think so, it will be a good day.

77
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,000
Got it?

78
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,920
Yes.

79
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,840
Finally, my birthday is coming this year.

80
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,900
Mail?

81
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,520
I think today will be a lucky day for Ryo-chan.

82
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,320
I believe so.

83
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,560
I believe so, too!

84
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,340
Yes, I do.

85
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,180
It's a nice day.

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,820
I'm sorry!

87
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,140
You're a good boy!

88
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,940
You're a good boy!

89
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,180
I think today will be a lucky day for Ryo-chan.

90
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,920
I believe so.

91
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,300
That's right.

92
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,100
I'm lucky today.

93
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,060
Thanks to you, I saved something.

94
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,100
Thank you.

95
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,220
It's just water from squeezing out my muscles...

96
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,880
Well then, let's eat and go out.

97
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,700
I think the rice balls I bought last night...

98
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,840
My rice balls!

99
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,420
Hey, give them back!

100
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
No, no, no!

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,180
Wait!

102
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,420
Give me back my rice balls!

103
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,380
No!

104
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,860
Damn it, what's going on?

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,960
My breakfast!

106
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,940
I think today will be a lucky day for Ryo-chan.

107
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:18,960
I believe so.

108
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,540
I believe so.

109
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,880
Yeah, I'm lucky today.

110
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,780
That's right, today Reiko will prepare a lot of delicious food.

111
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,720
It's better to eat a little less rice.

112
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,040
No, if I ate that rice ball, I wouldn't be able to eat delicious food.

113
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,240
Lucky, lucky.

114
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:40,680
Ah!

115
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,660
Ah!

116
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,840
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

117
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,340
Huh?

118
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,000
I've been wearing sandals for a long time!

119
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,600
Maybe the wind I've been wearing...

120
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,420
Maybe it's because of the sandals.

121
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,340
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

122
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,220
Tonight is a party, so changing my mood a little...

123
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,440
Glad I had a sandal broken!

124
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,160
Huh?

125
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,860
The brake doesn't work!

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,660
Ah!

127
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,980
Ha-ha-ha!

128
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,600
Ah, no, no, no!

129
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,200
I'm dead!

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,340
Ah!

131
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:18,680
Come on!

132
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,620
I was saved in a soft place where I fell.

133
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,700
Water, water, water!

134
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,720
I'm glad there's a river nearby.

135
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,980
Senpai, you're late.

136
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,280
I guess I'm not.

137
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm here.

138
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,900
Ryo-chan!

139
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,720
What's wrong, senpai?

140
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,200
I went to Tokyo Bay.

141
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,520
What did you go to?

142
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,780
I had a lot of things to do.

143
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,060
Ryo-chan is the star of tonight's party, so don't go anywhere without permission.

144
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,720
I know.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,200
I brought you the three greatest delicacies of the world, truffles, foie gras, and caviar.

146
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,780
It's the best you can think of.

147
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,180
Please eat half of them.

148
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,700
Really?

149
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,640
Yes.

150
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,080
And the sake is also the best in the world.

151
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:22,980
Lucky!

152
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,300
I can't wait to try them.

153
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,240
Senpai, how about going to the battle?

154
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,620
That's right. Tonight's the party, so you should feel refreshed.

155
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,900
That's right. I'll do that.

156
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,020
Have a good day!

157
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,360
Ah!

158
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,940
What's going on?

159
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,700
There are crows everywhere!

160
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,560
A lot of crows.

161
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,440
What?

162
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,120
What's that?

163
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,640
Ryo-chan!

164
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,360
Let me go!

165
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,580
You can't get away!

166
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,660
3 of us together!

167
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,300
3-line Joy!

168
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,560
Okay!

169
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,500
Next, the trampoline set!

170
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,740
Hey! Let go!

171
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,040
Let go!

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,360
Stop it!

173
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,820
Stop it!

174
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,380
Hmm...

175
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,040
Senpai, what about the bath?

176
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,880
If I leave now, I feel like I won't be able to return.

177
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,880
Is that so?

178
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,780
Um, Ryo-san...

179
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,900
It's time for patrol, but...

180
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,080
You guys go ahead.

181
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,380
I'm going to take a day off.

182
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,660
Oh.

183
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
It's okay, Ryo-chan.

184
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,780
If you open the birthday party safely,

185
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,260
all the bad luck you've had will be blown away.

186
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,020
I wish so.

187
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,240
Okay, I'm going.

188
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:12,940
Wait!

189
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,140
I have to go to the library, too.

190
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,800
Ryo-chan, take care of the house.

191
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:17,940
Yeah.

192
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
I'm not going anywhere today.

193
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,860
See you!

194
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,680
I'm so bored.

195
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,680
I'll make a plastic model.

196
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,760
This one.

197
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,540
This will be easy on the desk.

198
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,200
Here we go.

199
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,020
Here we go.

200
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,600
Hello?

201
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,680
Senpai, I found a very interesting shop

202
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:42,840
while patrolling.

203
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,040
It's an interesting shop.

204
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,400
It's an old toy store,

205
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,340
and there seems to be something you like.

206
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,280
What? Really?

207
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,140
Okay, I'm going right now.

208
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,340
What?

209
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,480
I feel like I won't be able to return here

210
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,660
if I go out now.

211
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,580
Senpai, what's wrong?

212
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,740
There's nothing good there anyway.

213
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,040
It's just a waste of time.

214
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,460
What?

215
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,300
I'm not going.

216
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,160
But, senpai...

217
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,280
I don't want to get a call like this again.

218
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,180
I'm going to turn off the power so you don't have to come.

219
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,580
Just in case,

220
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,200
I'll hang it on my desk

221
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,460
so I don't have to go out all the time.

222
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,560
Huh?

223
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,880
If I hang it on my desk,

224
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,380
I can't make a plastic model.

225
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,060
Here.

226
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,960
This is good.

227
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,480
I'm starting to feel tired.

228
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,400
I've been up all morning.

229
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,020
What?

230
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,220
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,320
I'm sorry.

232
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm here to get my desk.

233
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,060
Um, hello?

234
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,340
Stop it.

235
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,780
He's really bad at waking up.

236
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,220
If you wake him up,

237
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,900
it'll be a big deal.

238
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,440
Is that so?

239
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,000
But, which desk should I bring?

240
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,920
This one, I guess.

241
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,200
There's nothing on it.

242
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,700
Put it on the truck.

243
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,820
Okay.

244
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,540
Ready, set...

245
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,840
Go!

246
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,120
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,900
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,240
I feel refreshed after going to the bathroom.

249
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,700
Okay.

250
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,440
Shall we go?

251
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,700
♪ Limitless

252
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
-Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

253
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:57,340
W-What the...? What's going on?!

254
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,840
Why?!

255
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,820
I'm back.

256
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,620
Oh, the desk is gone.

257
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,980
I heard that the old desk was going to be taken by the business.

258
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,740
But it wasn't here.

259
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,320
Where's Ryo?

260
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,460
Ryo!

261
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,680
Where did he go?

262
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
He said he wouldn't leave here.

263
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,580
I have a bad feeling about this.

264
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,820
Damn it!

265
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,320
Why is the desk I was supposed to be on here?

266
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,400
Why is it here?

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
Oh, the key!

268
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,680
The key!

269
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,200
The key!

270
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,040
The key!

271
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,200
Damn it!

272
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,860
I'm on the expressway!

273
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,680
Where are we going?

274
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,960
Huh?

275
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,340
Ryo, you're not here?

276
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,120
No.

277
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,940
When we got back...

278
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,060
You were saying something about the competition.

279
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,920
But I was really looking forward to today's party.

280
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,840
And he said he didn't want to leave the station.

281
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,940
But it seems he turned off his cell phone.

282
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,820
Anyway, let's get ready for the party.

283
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,660
Yes.

284
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,440
Let's go.

285
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,640
We'll look for Senpai.

286
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,040
Okay.

287
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,960
I'll leave it to you.

288
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,140
Then I'll contact him around here.

289
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,300
It can't be.

290
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,320
Snow?

291
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,600
It's snowing.

292
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,060
Damn it!

293
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,400
The weather forecast is off.

294
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,560
It's snowing.

295
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,080
It's cold when we go fast in this cold weather.

296
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,340
Kawatsunagi is still better.

297
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,500
I'll invest if it's free.

298
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,200
What's wrong?

299
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,260
There's a human hanging on the back of that truck.

300
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,320
It can't be.

301
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,240
There's a picture on the truck.

302
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,300
I see.

303
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,160
It is.

304
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,660
But it's a real picture.

305
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,120
The feeling of rain is getting stronger.

306
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,440
It's dangerous.

307
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,600
It's dangerous! It's dangerous!

308
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,040
Oh, right! I had this!

309
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,500
I'll ask Nakagawa to come and help me with my phone.

310
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,680
Yes!

311
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,320
Senpai! What happened? You suddenly disappeared!

312
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,160
I don't know what happened!

313
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,200
I was sleeping in the toilet and then I suddenly came out!

314
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,720
So, where are you now?

315
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,060
Umm...

316
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,340
I'm in Aomori!

317
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,240
I'm heading to Hokkaido...

318
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,880
Damn, it's a street!

319
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,060
What a mess!

320
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,400
Did you contact Ryo-sama?

321
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,660
Yes, but he disappeared immediately.

322
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,260
Did you find out where he is?

323
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,040
No, I just found out later.

324
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:11,960
Oh?

325
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,360
Maybe he's not around here.

326
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,320
Maybe he's not around here.

327
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,300
I'll try to find out more about it.

328
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,340
Finally I'm in Hokkaido!

329
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,340
What's this road?

330
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,020
It's not paved!

331
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,960
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

332
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,680
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

333
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,100
Oh, crap! The trail was wrong.

334
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,420
Guess I have to go into that road.

335
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,240
What?

336
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,900
Don't worry.

337
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,080
You probably can make it through a deep river like that.

338
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:58,980
Hey!

339
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,080
Hey, where are you going?

340
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,220
Stop! Don't fall!

341
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,860
Hey, stop!

342
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,240
Oh, crap!

343
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,100
Bung!

344
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,080
It's okay.

345
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,960
Bung!

346
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,080
Oh...

347
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,960
-Let's go. -Yeah.

348
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,480
-The machine stopped. -I think something got stuck in it.

349
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,760
Sake

350
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,160
I forget.

351
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,500
It downed here.

352
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,960
I almost stammered.

353
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,180
Sake

354
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,520
I thought to die.

355
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,740
Somehow the task is done.

356
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,360
I can go back to Kameyaru.

357
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,840
Why do I have to climb the river at this time?

358
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,560
"Aaaaaaah!"

359
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,700
"Hey, stop it! I'm going home to the squirrels!"

360
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,060
"The world's three greatest gods and the world's most famous beasts are waiting for me!"

361
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,600
"W-what?"

362
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,780
"Why is the bear still sleeping?"

363
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,780
"Aaaaaaah!"

364
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,460
"Aaaaaaaah!"

365
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,320
"Aaaaaaah!"

366
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,280
"G-gurana!"

367
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
"Hey, stop it!"

368
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,900
"It's not good for me to eat!"

369
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,280
"I'm going to eat you, bear!"

370
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,760
"You're in my way!"

371
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,440
"Look at me! I'm not going to let you get away with this!"

372
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,920
"I'm going back to the squirrels and I'm going to drink the world's most famous beasts!"

373
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,580
"What?"

374
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,060
"W-what?"

375
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,220
"Hey, let go!"

376
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,340
"What are you going to do to me? You're going to eat me anyway!"

377
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,760
"I'm going back to the squirrels and I'm going to drink the world's most famous beasts!"

378
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,580
"I'm going back to the squirrels and I'm going to drink the world's most famous beasts!"

379
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,780
"G-gurana! G-gurana!"

380
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,660
"It's decided!"

381
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,420
"Uwaaahhh!!!"

382
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,440
"Uwaaahhh!!!"

383
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,000
"Uwaaahhh!!!"

384
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,780
"Aaaaaaaah!!!"

385
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,920
"The third Pet Bottle Rocket Competition is finally at its climax!"

386
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,180
"Today's target rocket is finally here, the fireworks of your life!"

387
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,340
Here it comes!

388
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
How far will it go?

389
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,860
Countdown begins!

390
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,160
8

391
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,180
7

392
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,400
6

393
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,500
5

394
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,620
4

395
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,320
3

396
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,420
2

397
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,100
1

398
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,960
Stop it!

399
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,100
Stop it!

400
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,680
There's no one here.

401
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,840
What's this?

402
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,320
It's so cold!

403
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,620
Damn it!

404
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,420
I came to the North Pole again just like last year.

405
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,160
March 3rd is the worst.

406
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,940
No, today is not the end of the day.

407
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,040
If I go to the party, I will have a hard time laughing.

408
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,620
What?

409
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,620
There are many white bears!

410
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,060
All right!

411
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,020
I'm motivated.

412
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,440
I don't want to be calm.

413
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,440
I can do anything.

414
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,060
I'll go back to my dream.

415
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,180
The three greatest celebrities in the world,

416
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,140
the world's famous people,

417
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,840
and the presents from everyone are waiting for me.

418
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,660
All kinds of surveillance videos from around the world

419
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,640
will be sent to this plane in real time.

420
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,940
You will definitely find your seniors.

421
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,500
President, I found someone like that.

422
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,280
Really?

423
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,800
Yes, please take a look.

424
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,780
Let's zoom in.

425
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,420
Yes.

426
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,700
Senpai!

427
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,620
Ryotsu!

428
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,440
Yeah!

429
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,080
Damn it!

430
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,700
There are still so many of them!

431
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,800
No good.

432
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,700
I can't even get a sense of distance.

433
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,640
After all, March 3rd is...

434
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,000
What?

435
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,160
Senpai!

436
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,700
Nakagawa!

437
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,860
Senpai!

438
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,100
Yes!

439
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,480
Let's go, Ryotsu!

440
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,120
Are you all right, Senpai?

441
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,320
I'm fine.

442
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,020
Okay, it's over.

443
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,160
Hi, Mr. Ryo!

444
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,280
Welcome back!

445
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,820
Are you ready to party?

446
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,460
Yes, we're ready.

447
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,980
March 3rd is not over yet.

448
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,460
It's not working. Let's make it the best day ever!

449
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,520
Oh, this is...

450
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,360
-Yay! -Thank you!

451
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,860
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

452
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,220
Senpai, this is a present from me.

453
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,820
Oh, a 50-inch plasma TV!

454
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,720
I'll use the game software.

455
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,280
This is the limited edition "Sensha Yaro" that was released 3 years ago.

456
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,540
You got it well!

457
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,960
I bought this at the toy store.

458
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,820
-Me too. -I'll take this.

459
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,540
It's a proof of my love.

460
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,000
Thank you, everyone.

461
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,360
This is the best day ever!

462
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,660
Ryo, turn off the candlelight.

463
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,500
Oh, it's Reiko's homemade cake.

464
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,960
All right.

465
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,560
Hello?

466
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,840
Oh, Captain.

467
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,280
I found Ryo.

468
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,780
Yes, I got it.

469
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,820
What? It's Captain Bakuryu.

470
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:50,740
Captain Bakuryu?

471
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,020
Yes, he was helping me with your research.

472
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,660
I see.

473
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,940
He said he's going to pass through this sky and hand out the present.

474
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,380
Hand out?

475
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,400
Oh, it's the sound of a helicopter!

476
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,340
Huh?

477
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,280
It looks like a model of a tank.

478
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,940
That's good, Senpai. I love tanks.

479
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,520
I love tanks.

480
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,100
But the track is too big.

481
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,280
I know.

482
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,660
No, that's the real one.

483
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,060
A present for you!

484
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,200
Senpai, watch out!

485
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,480
The plasma TV, the game, and my party!

486
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,320
Right now, the 3rd of March is over.

487
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,160
This year was the worst day of my life.

488
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,200
Damn it!

489
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,220
That's why I hate March 3rd so much!

490
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,820
March 3rd

491
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,080
March 3rd

492
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,940
March 3rd

493
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,720
March 3rd

494
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:18,880
March 3rd

495
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,040
March 3rd

496
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,360
March 3rd

497
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:31,220
March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd

498
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,100
March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd

499
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:47,080
March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 3rd March 2

500
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,440
I'm saving someone, every once in a while

501
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,460
Baby, do you know me?

502
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,380
I'm heading for tomorrow

503
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,920
I'm breathing with a nice spirit

504
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,740
Don't get sick, I'll do what I have to do

505
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,520
I'm breathing with a cute spirit

506
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,940
What's hard to understand

507
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,340
I want to show you

508
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,920
I want to show you

509
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,960
It's better than starting over

510
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,560
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

511
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,480
When I was a kid, we were influenced by adventure movies

512
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,980
So we decided to go to Sumida River by hand

513
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,280
From Senjuohashi to Tsukuda Island

514
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,300
It's an adventure trip

515
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,840
But it doesn't go as cool as the movie

516
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,180
Next time, "Adventure Kankichi"

517
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380
Thank you for watching!

518
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,780
There's a turtle over there

519
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,140
There's a turtle for sure

520
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,760
Everyone, come to our town

521
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,800
Thank you!
