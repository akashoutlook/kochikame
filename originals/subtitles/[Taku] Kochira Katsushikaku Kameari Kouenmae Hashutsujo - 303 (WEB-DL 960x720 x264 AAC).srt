THE RACING PEOPLE

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,720
TO TAPE

19
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,380
Well, well. I haven't been in a very good mood lately.

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,640
The tea I got from after one job has weer good.

21
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,180
Yes, chief.

22
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,320
Hideyo, your legs are shaking.

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,280
You can't do this, Hideyo.

24
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,580
You're lacking in exercise.

25
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,880
Dad, are you okay?

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,580
I'm fine.

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,900
Next is the abdominal exercise.

28
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,080
One, two, one, two, one, two, three, four...

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,440
Dad, your body is stiff.

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,380
I'm trying my best.

31
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:17,740
I'm doing it.

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,060
But I'm sick.

33
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,300
If you do it, you can do it.

34
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,540
Ryo.

35
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,540
Ryo.

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,020
No.

37
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,560
Not "no".

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,600
You were selling oil here again.

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,960
No, it's not.

40
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,660
It's a patrol in the park.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,940
Ryo, it's painful.

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,680
Yes.

43
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,360
So what happened, chief?

44
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,340
It's the autumn of sports.

45
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,660
Well, actually...

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,120
Daisuke's sports day?

47
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,520
In my school, the students and the subordinates are divided into red and white groups and participate in the competition.

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,780
We'll win.

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,740
Ryo, come and see us.

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,220
I said it well, Daisuke.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,120
That's the spirit.

52
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,320
So the chief himself trains his wife and grandchildren.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,820
It's a wonderful family love.

54
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,260
Oh, I want to cry.

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,140
You're saying something like that on purpose.

56
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,980
You who can only move with money can understand.

57
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,160
I'm being called.

58
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,160
All right.

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,160
Next, dash to that slide.

60
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,100
Repeat five times.

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,240
Ready.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,840
All right, Daisuke.

63
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,180
Go.

64
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,400
Don't lose, dad.

65
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,720
Goal.

66
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,580
Just a little more.

67
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,160
Go for it.

68
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,580
Goal.

69
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,660
All right.

70
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:54,840
Second.

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,780
Goal.

72
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,240
Goal.

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,760
Goal.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,600
Goal.

75
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,700
Goal.

76
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,140
All right.

77
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,520
Good.

78
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,620
Wait, wait.

79
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,560
Good job.

80
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,300
Goal.

81
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,820
Goal.

82
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,780
Goal.

83
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,180
Goal.

84
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:10,740
Goal.

85
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,940
Goal.

86
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,040
Goal.

87
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,660
Goal.

88
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:16,800
Goal.

89
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,160
All right, forget it.

90
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:20,940
Damn it.

91
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,940
Dad, are you okay?

92
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,840
Hideyo.

93
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,660
Are you all right?

94
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,980
Well, let me see.

95
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,720
Are you okay?

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,060
I'm all right.

97
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,780
I can't get it.

98
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,100
Ryozu, let him play.

99
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,680
All right.

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,360
Yeah.

101
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,060
I don't think they can play tomorrow.

102
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,460
If you rest tonight...

103
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,360
If you force yourself, you'll be late for your treatment.

104
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,960
Hideo-kun, don't worry. I'll do something about it.

105
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,740
What? I'm going out instead?

106
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,220
Daisuke is working so hard. There's no way you can leave him alone.

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
Hideo-kun can't go out. You're the only one who's got time and energy.

108
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,220
It's for Daisuke.

109
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,760
But...

110
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,500
Ryo-chan, please go out.

111
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,400
You're always the only one who's got time and energy.

112
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,380
Wait a minute.

113
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,960
You're suddenly telling me that.

114
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,740
I have a schedule.

115
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,840
I'm sure Sunday is full of schedules.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,280
I have to work until 5:00 a.m. and TV until 12:00 p.m.

117
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,780
Monkey.

118
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,580
You want that, don't you?

119
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,300
No, I don't.

120
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,020
Then I'll be like a money-grubber.

121
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,520
Oh, yeah.

122
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,360
Then...

123
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,640
Oh, I'm bored.

124
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,340
I'm bored of the day.

125
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,780
I'm bored of my schedule.

126
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,680
It's too early.

127
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,460
It's a trick to make money.

128
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,540
Whatever happens, we'll definitely make Daisuke's red group win.

129
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,700
Leave it to me.

130
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,720
It's cheap.

131
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,860
If you lose, I'll double it and give it back to you.

132
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,220
It's okay.

133
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,200
Then I have to get ready for tomorrow and get ready to go out.

134
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,120
I'll excuse myself today.

135
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,320
That's the silver.

136
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,080
I'm not in a good mood.

137
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,960
Are you really okay?

138
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,180
Well, the one who can beat Senpai with physical strength is Hiroshi, but there are not many people.

139
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,820
That's for sure.

140
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,280
Honda, I'm going again.

141
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,540
But Senpai, are you okay?

142
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,080
I'm exercising.

143
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,260
I see.

144
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,860
The opponent is a young man with a lack of exercise.

145
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,400
That's what I'm going to be.

146
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,440
That's right.

147
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,280
If you don't bring an Olympic player, you won't beat Senpai.

148
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,720
That's right.

149
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,840
That's right.

150
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,780
Next.

151
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,780
Oh, that's right.

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,660
That's right.

153
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,340
That's right.

154
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,000
That's right.

155
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,880
That's right.

156
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,340
That's right.

157
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,060
That's right.

158
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,740
That's right.

159
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,180
Now, my motto is to deepen the bond between parents and children.

160
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,020
Therefore, I would like everyone in the family to participate in the competition.

161
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,720
Ryo-chan? What happened?

162
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,660
It's late.

163
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,380
That idiot.

164
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,020
He is late for such an important time.

165
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,100
That's him.

166
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,320
Ryo-kun.

167
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,280
Mr. Honda?

168
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,480
What's wrong?

169
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,280
We've been drinking together since last night.

170
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
We've been drinking since last night.

171
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,240
What?!

172
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,060
I fell asleep in the middle of it, but Senpai kept drinking until just a while ago.

173
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,740
My head hurts!

174
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,980
Are you okay with this?

175
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,140
Senpai, wait a minute!

176
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,960
Senpai, wake up! Senpai!

177
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,640
Ryo-chan, wake up!

178
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,720
You can't do that!

179
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,420
I can't drink anymore.

180
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,740
I'm freezing! What am I going to do?!

181
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,300
Are you awake, idiot?!

182
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,820
Chief!

183
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,200
Senpai, it's a sports day!

184
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,320
A sports day?

185
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,000
It's Daisuke-kun's sports day. It's about to start.

186
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,080
Ah, I see.

187
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,040
Don't be so stubborn, Ryo-chan.

188
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,140
We're going to have a 100-meter-long competition soon.

189
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,300
Senpai, can you run?

190
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm fine.

191
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,980
Let's see...

192
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,680
This is fine. Don't worry. It's a perfect hand.

193
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,420
The first event is a 100-meter-long race.

194
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,480
The competitors will gather at the first gate.

195
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,620
All right! Leave it to me!

196
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,840
Ryo-chan, are you really okay?

197
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,080
Easy, easy.

198
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,340
Uh, I was in the red team.

199
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,620
I've seen that before.

200
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,360
Huh? Isn't that Tsuruta, a player from the J-League?

201
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,620
What?

202
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,460
That's right. He's the Japanese representative, Tsuruta.

203
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,280
Why is there such a guy?

204
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,580
You're surprised too soon. Look over there.

205
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:32,880
Huh?

206
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,680
It's Hayami Shunsuke of the Olympics.

207
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,000
What? Is there a 100-meter Japanese record holder?

208
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,700
Yes. He's a father of a freshman. He's a famous student.

209
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,600
Damn it. I've never seen such a strong opponent.

210
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,780
Is there a famous person in the red team?

211
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,180
There is. Look!

212
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,300
Ah, thank you. I can't do anything alone.

213
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,400
Haku-san, Minamiyama of the Japanese Academy.

214
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,280
Jambaraya, the composer.

215
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,120
Uh, and the professor of the university.

216
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,260
I won't be a full power!

217
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,440
Hmm, this is really bad if I don't get serious.

218
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,100
The 100-meter race is about to start.

219
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,820
I hope the strong opponent is not the opponent.

220
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,480
He's a little weak, Ryo-san.

221
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,760
Ready!

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,460
Now, the first group has started.

223
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,280
Tsuruta has already jumped out.

224
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,940
He's pulled out the other players in a flash.

225
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,700
Tsuruta is already in the straight line.

226
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,080
Goal!

227
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,280
Tsuruta is in first place, as expected.

228
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,980
How is his record?

229
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,840
He's got 10.09 seconds!

230
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,300
In a non-eventual participation race in elementary school, he suddenly got 10 seconds.

231
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,420
He's finally a senior.

232
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,340
Ryo-san, do your best!

233
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,160
Now, Hayami, the Japanese record holder, is in this group.

234
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,960
Will he be able to break the record of Tsuruta earlier?

235
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,880
About the position...

236
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,040
Same group, huh?

237
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,060
Ready!

238
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,780
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

239
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,280
Good job!

240
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,920
Good job!

241
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,660
Hayami started lightly, but he was caught in a flash.

242
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,720
Oh, no!

243
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
Is this a human or a gorilla?

244
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,100
Hayami is chasing a player with a fierce momentum.

245
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,380
Damn it!

246
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,680
Fukie Takagawa is racing!

247
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:23,940
Oh, no!

248
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,260
Why is he so furious?

249
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, no!

250
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,300
It's the gorilla again!

251
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,360
No, a general faster than Hayami caught up with him!

252
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,980
That's a great dead heat!

253
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,420
Goal!

254
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,520
Hayami, the first shot!

255
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Oh...

256
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,500
That was close, wasn't it?

257
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,680
Idiot!

258
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,740
Don't be silly, Ryo-tsu!

259
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,640
Hm...

260
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,920
I can't stand this anymore...

261
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,400
I can't wait.

262
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,740
Wow, what a record!

263
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,680
It's a record for Japan!

264
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,980
Hayami has updated his own record!

265
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,160
I see!

266
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,620
Then I'm not a 9 second record, either.

267
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,040
You're kidding me!

268
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,120
Awesome!

269
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,560
Stand in position!

270
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,940
Ready!

271
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,060
Nice, Daisuke!

272
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,500
Daisuke!

273
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,040
Nice, Daisuke!

274
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,700
Go, Grandpa!

275
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,920
-Yay! -Good job, Daisuke!

276
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,480
-Good job, Mom! -Good job!

277
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,060
-You practiced a lot. -Yeah!

278
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,500
Ryotsu, why don't you learn from Daisuke?

279
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,720
Next is the hammer throw competition.

280
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,240
Okay, I got it next.

281
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,400
That was close!

282
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,960
He fell on the 85-meter line.

283
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,560
The white team's Mizobuchi had only one meter left!

284
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,240
What? That Olympic Mizobuchi?

285
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,240
Why are there so many Olympic and pro athletes?

286
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,260
I don't believe this!

287
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,860
Episode 1: The

288
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,000
He was 28 points behind.

289
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,320
Daisuke won the first place, so do something about it, Ryotsu.

290
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,020
Even if I say that, it's the opponent's opponent no matter how hard I try.

291
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,140
Do something about it.

292
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,220
I won't let you lose, Ryotsu.

293
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,000
No way!

294
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,480
Next is the sand draw by FUKEI.

295
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,120
The sand draw is my specialty.

296
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,340
Now...

297
00:13:59,340 --> 00:13:59,740
What?

298
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,180
There's a sumo wrestler!

299
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,100
The red team is...

300
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,340
I knew it.

301
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,720
Listen.

302
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,000
There are two sumo wrestlers.

303
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,800
If you do it properly, you won't win.

304
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,700
So...

305
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,060
FUKEI versus the sand draw.

306
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,520
Which will win, the red team or the white team?

307
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,580
The white team with the sumo wrestler is the winner?

308
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,840
That's right!

309
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,700
Yes!

310
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,740
That's right!

311
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,440
Yes!

312
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:33,920
Yes!

313
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,260
Yes!

314
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,020
Yes!

315
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:37,940
Yes!

316
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,160
Yes!

317
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:38,780
Yes!

318
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,820
Yes!

319
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,100
The red team!

320
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,820
This is the red team's victory!

321
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,640
It's here.

322
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,500
Wow!

323
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,860
I won, I won, I won, I won!

324
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,560
It's a bit hard.

325
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,620
Ryosan is amazing, mom.

326
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,580
I can count on you.

327
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,860
Yeah.

328
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,240
I'll leave it to you.

329
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,460
I've got this!

330
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,880
I'll give you a box with the bet!

331
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,180
Well, give me the box on it.

332
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,120
Let me take a look and look at it.

333
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,140
Give him a little more patience.

334
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,400
Oh, I can't wait to see the odds.

335
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,380
You won't win this time!

336
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,160
You're too calm right now.

337
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,900
I'm down!

338
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,080
I can't do this!

339
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,900
You're doing it wrong!

340
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,140
I've got this!

341
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,020
I've got this!

342
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,620
I've got this!

343
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:21,980
I've got this!

344
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,340
I've got this!

345
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,060
I've got this!

346
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,940
For you, alcohol is the same as gasoline.

347
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,880
For you, alcohol is more like water than gasoline.

348
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,340
Now, water. It's real.

349
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,160
Drink this.

350
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,200
The first program of the afternoon is

351
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,760
"The Big Ball Rolls by Fukuoka".

352
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,580
Ready!

353
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,120
Oh! Red team is so fast!

354
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,500
White team is pulling them away!

355
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,020
Red team is pulling them back quickly.

356
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,820
Goal! Red team wins!

357
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,980
Next is "The Ball Rolls by Kei".

358
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,040
Ready!

359
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,420
It's you!

360
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,800
I won't lose!

361
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,600
What?

362
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,100
I can take it off.

363
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,420
It's glued with instant adhesive.

364
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,060
And this is garlic.

365
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,020
What?

366
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,120
I got you!

367
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,720
What?

368
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,040
I got you!

369
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,980
It's the payback I had just had!

370
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,420
Dang you!

371
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,100
What?

372
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,000
It's a shrimp!

373
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,680
You did it! It brought me down again!

374
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,100
You really are Ryo-chan!

375
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,280
You really are like a senior.

376
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,880
You're so dirty as usual.

377
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,760
Next is "The Ball Rolls by Kei".

378
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,940
Huh? It's the Kokaiki Jido!

379
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,760
Huh? They're collecting stamps for the Yamanote Line?

380
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,180
One signal machine? That's impossible!

381
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,060
I-It's impossible! I want to borrow a car!

382
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,100
No way!

383
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,780
The Red Team and the White Team have only 10 points left!

384
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,820
Two more games.

385
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,080
With this 800m relay, if the parents win with two or three players, they can turn the tables.

386
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,580
But Senpai, if you say relay...

387
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,620
The opponents are Hayami and Tsuruta.

388
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:19,760
They're the best players.

389
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,880
Compared to that, this team is...

390
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,180
So it's them after all.

391
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,840
What should we do, Senpai?

392
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,500
Hmm...

393
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,580
Now, there are two more games left.

394
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,860
First up is the non-competitive relay.

395
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,700
So the first one is Tsuruta.

396
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,040
That means Hayami is the anchor.

397
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,900
Get to the edge!

398
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,640
Huh?

399
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,200
Ryo-san, do your best!

400
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,640
Ryo-tsu!

401
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,500
Ready!

402
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,240
Start!

403
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,820
Tops off have Tsuruta from the White Team!

404
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,300
Ryo-tsu from the Red Team is also right behind them!

405
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,180
The Red Team is in the lead!

406
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,140
Yay!

407
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,680
The Red Team is in the lead!

408
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,780
The White Team is also in the lead, with a 1st place baton!

409
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,000
But he got through in a flash!

410
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,340
The White Team's third player has the baton!

411
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,900
The Red Team has finally gotten the baton!

412
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,440
I've calculated all this.

413
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,440
Change.

414
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,600
What?

415
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,560
The third-class of the White Team is leaving the Red Team!

416
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,440
Hey, Red!

417
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:24,880
Don't run around!

418
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,600
The fourth-class of the White Team is doing a button-touch!

419
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,780
The Red Team is finally doing a button-touch!

420
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,240
The White Team is definitely at the top!

421
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,220
Oh, the fourth-class of the Red Team is fast!

422
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,080
They took the top back in no time!

423
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,340
They're widening the gap!

424
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,200
That's...

425
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,280
It looks like Ryo-chan.

426
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,640
The Red Team is doing a button-touch!

427
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,980
The fifth-class of the White Team is 200 meters ahead!

428
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,560
Can they make it?

429
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,420
The Red Team is only half way through!

430
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,240
Oh, they're falling!

431
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,620
Meanwhile, the White Team is at the top!

432
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,220
Poor thing...

433
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,600
The White Team is leading the Red Team!

434
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,140
It's the last spurt!

435
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:08,940
Let's fly!

436
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,660
The red team is doing a button-touch!

437
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,040
The red team is doing a button-touch!

438
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,220
The red team is doing a button-touch!

439
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,400
What's going on?

440
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,540
The White Team is flying to the top!

441
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,860
The red team is doing a great job!

442
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,260
Ryo-chan's doing a good job, too!

443
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,260
Go, Ryo-chan!

444
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,380
The Red Team is doing a great job!

445
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,440
The Red Team is doing a great job!

446
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,280
The Red Team is doing a great job!

447
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,980
They've broken the gap!

448
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,300
They've broken the gap!

449
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,740
They've broken the gap!

450
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,700
The red team is finally doing a button-touch!

451
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,580
I'm exhausted...

452
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,660
I'm so thirsty!

453
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,060
Ouch!

454
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,620
Stop!

455
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,240
My back hurts!

456
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,240
Ryo-chan!

457
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,100
Ryo-chan!

458
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,680
Are you alright?

459
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,600
Yes.

460
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,240
I-I-I'm fine...

461
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,300
The last race is the triplets...

462
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,720
Ryo-san, you can't do it!

463
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,200
What's with this?

464
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,160
Ryo-tsu-san, don't overdo it.

465
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,380
You've done a good job.

466
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,020
It's finally the last triplets race.

467
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,660
The players will be gathered at the entrance gate A...

468
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,980
Yeah, it's the last race!

469
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,380
I'm going out.

470
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:34,900
What?

471
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,920
Where are your legs?

472
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,300
It's not perfect, but I'll do my best for Daisuke.

473
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,680
Papa...

474
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,120
Listen, Daisuke.

475
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,220
The triplets aren't going to run alone.

476
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,240
Help Papa, okay?

477
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,160
Okay!

478
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,220
Okay, you two.

479
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,720
Do your best.

480
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,540
Daisuke, do your best!

481
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,440
Okay!

482
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,340
Ryo-san, I'll do my best!

483
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,080
Okay, well said!

484
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,600
Ready!

485
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,060
Now, the last race.

486
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,760
The triplets start!

487
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,820
Daisuke, do your best!

488
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,520
You!

489
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,960
Daisuke, go!

490
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,260
Go!

491
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,240
You're the best!

492
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,520
Daisuke, you're the best!

493
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,460
Ryo-san, you're the best!

494
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,180
You're the best!

495
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,220
You're the best!

496
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,280
Then you'll get a chance to run a lot.

497
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,000
Daisuke, you're the best!

498
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,220
Daisuke, you're the best!

499
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,200
You're the best!

500
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,720
You're the best!

501
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,760
You're the best!

502
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,860
C'mon, guys!

503
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,180
One, two, three!

504
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,480
Go!

505
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,600
I know!

506
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,060
I'm sorry, dad! I-I'm fine!

507
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
I-I'm fine!

508
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,340
Oh, Hideo-kun!

509
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,240
The No.1 in the Red Team suddenly speeds down!

510
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,420
He's going to be overtaken one by one!

511
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,480
Hold on, dad!

512
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,180
Daisuke, don't give up!

513
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,720
That's right! I'll reverse it!

514
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,460
The No.1 in the White Team is in first place!

515
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,940
And the No.2 in the White Team is also in first place!

516
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,820
He's a little far away, but the No.2 in the Red Team is also in first place!

517
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,100
Something happened on the way, but the No.1 in the Red Team is also running desperately!

518
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,400
Dad, don't push yourself too hard! Let's stop!

519
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,820
Daisuke, don't give up!

520
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,460
The goal is just a little further!

521
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,240
Let's run to the end with the power of the two of us!

522
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,360
Yeah! I got it!

523
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,420
Daisuke! Just a little more!

524
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,100
You can do it! Last Spurs!

525
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,120
Daisuke! You can do it!

526
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,620
Now, the No.1 in the Red Team hasn't given up, and he's finally reached the goal!

527
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,260
Daisuke, you're great!

528
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,200
You didn't give up and ran to the end!

529
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Yeah! Dad did a good job, too!

530
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,000
This guy is...

531
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,560
.

532
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,480
.

533
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:39,680
.

534
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,720
.

535
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:40,740
.

536
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:40,820
.

537
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,920
.

538
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,160
.

539
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,200
.

540
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,680
. . .

541
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:03,440
. . . . . . . . . . .

542
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,460
. . . .

543
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:03,620
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

544
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:03,740
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

545
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,640
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

546
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,260
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

547
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,460
.

548
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,180
.

549
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,500
Um, um, that 10,000 yen is...

550
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,540
I don't mind that.

551
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,420
But I have a favor to ask.

552
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,340
Huh?

553
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,580
Come to my sister Sakura's sports event.

554

You'll win this time.

555
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,320
101, 102, 103, 104, 100...

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,480
This is an international kindergarten, so it's an international tournament.

557
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,980
There's a world record holder.

560
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,240
What's this?

The head is at a wedding.

562
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,940
Nagagawa is in Europe.

563
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,160
Terai is sick.

Today I'm alone with Reiko.

565
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,300
Hey, Maria!

566
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,620
What are you doing all of a sudden?

567
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,180
There's no way Reiko and I are alone.

568
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,880
