♪ I somewhat see today ♪

00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,560

00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:21,040

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,340
I wonder if I'll go if I do

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,480
He laughed at me saying that I was just crying

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,400
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,760
I can't help but cough

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,880
I can't change a single grumble

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape is strangely gentle

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,380
From the fountain of the Tungari-boshi

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,940
to the Taishakuten

15
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,960
the sun sets

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,540
Tomorrow will end already

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,920
Katsushika and Shibamata

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,360
will be happy again

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,900
I'm tired of it

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,900
I'm tired of it

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,600
I'm tired of it

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:51,880
I'm a fool

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,120
I'm a fool

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:17,680
Katsushika and Shibamata

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,300
will be happy again

26
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,820
Saori

27
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:21,880
Ta-chan

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm so happy.

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,360
Sakonji!

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,140
Sakonji!

31
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,160
Sakonji!

32
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,720
What are you doing?

33
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,920
Get out of here!

34
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,400
What's he saying?

35
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,020
It's a waste to run away in this situation.

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,580
Right, Saori?

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,420
Huh?

38
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,100
One push!

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Before that...

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,500
Ryotsu! We beat Sakonji!

41
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,880
Oh, he's happy with the man's heart.

42
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,340
Th-This is a practice match, but we lost five times.

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,580
What happened to Sakonji?

44
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,360
Ryotsu, do you have any idea?

45
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,440
That idiot was thinking about Saori's Doki-Memo during the match.

46
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,780
Doki-Memo? What's that?

47
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,760
Could it be the Doki-Doki Memorial of the love simulation game?

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,200
Huh?

49
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,900
You're still playing?

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,720
CD, poster, fancy goods, and all kinds of Doki-Memo goods.

51
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,020
And a lot of bones, too.

52
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,540
Sakonji is no longer a fighter.

53
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,620
He's a super Doki-Doki Memorare now.

54
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,820
I'm not kidding.

55
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,720
Next month is the national tournament.

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,900
Everyone is expecting to win.

57
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,840
Why are you so into such a game?

58
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,980
Don't hit me.

59
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,520
I can't help it if I get stuck.

60
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,660
Well, I'll give up this time.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,480
Let's hope for the next tournament.

62
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
I'll be too tired to play Doki-Doki Memo by then.

63
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,180
Well, you taught me.

64
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,800
Ryotsu, immediately separate Doki-Doki Memo and Sakonji,

65
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,060
and concentrate on Judo.

66
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,100
What?

67
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,560
If Sakonji can't win, you won't get a bonus or a bonus.

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,940
Why would that happen?

69
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,040
Because it's your responsibility.

70
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,480
No way.

71
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,320
W-Wait!

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,460
Hey, shut up!

73
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,020
I'm getting a bonus and a bonus.

74
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,380
Stop!

75
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm going to die!

76
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,040
Sorry.

77
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,260
I'm trying to take my Saori, so I can't help it.

78
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,560
My Saori?

79
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,020
I'm pretty sure you said you were into Doki-Doki Memo.

80
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,580
I see.

81
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,860
You always forget about it when your brother comes to play.

82
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,680
You're a troublemaker.

83
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,360
I see.

84
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,920
Then your brother must be in trouble, too.

85
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,580
I'll pay you back.

86
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,340
Wait!

87
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,740
Do you want to be charged with murder?

88
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,340
S-Sorry.

89
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,240
Anyway, I'll keep this in my office.

90
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,920
Tell your brother to come get it.

91
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,200
No way.

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,540
What should I do, Saori?

93
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,880
Your...

94
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,400
Your life without you...

95
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,460
I can't think about it!

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,160
Huh?

97
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,280
Boshi...

98
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,320
Hey, wait!

99
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,420
That's...

100
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,180
That's the last Saori I'll ever have!

101
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,180
Saori!

102
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,120
Saori!

103
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,100
Saori!

104
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,020
Saori!

105
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,380
Gaki!

106
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,100
Whoa!

107
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,880
That was close.

108
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,860
Although, that wasn't really funny.

109
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,240
I think it's Sakonji's.

110
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,020
Weird.

111
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,300
There's something about this.

112
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,740
Hey, you.

113
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,000
Huh?

114
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,220
You're not going to swear?

115
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,580
Huh?

116
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,500
Oh!

117
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,660
Ah! Help me!

118
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,560
Ah!

119
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,220
Ah!

120
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,800
Saori.

121
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,860
Where are you, Saori?

122
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,540
What?

123
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,520
You're kidding, right?

124
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm serious!

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,200
I'm serious.

126
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
Saori, Saori.

127
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,360
You're a patient with no symptoms.

128
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
You're so lucky to have won the game.

129
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,640
But...

130
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,680
If it's true...

131
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,600
Sakonji can't win.

132
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,460
And I'll give him a bonus.

133
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,520
I'm sorry!

134
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,260
Honda, show me the way!

135
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:58,800
Huh?

136
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,880
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,440
If I let you go, I won't leave you alone.

138
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,780
No way.

139
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Look, Senpai.

140
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,580
Huh?

141
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,400
Sakonji.

142
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,560
Look! What's wrong with you?

143
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,420
You're always so cold.

144
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,480
No, that's not the way I look.

145
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,200
But look at that face.

146
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,380
Huh?

147
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,120
Huh?

148
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:23,900
Right?

149
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,000
S橋

150
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,340
What's wrong, Senpai?

151
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,340
What's making you so bad?

152
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,640
This is the theme for the opening of Doki Memo.

153
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,240
But I don't think you bought it after breaking my ceremony.

154
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,820
Pikori!

155
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,740
Sakonji!

156
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,100
You brat!

157
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,780
I'm Pikori!

158
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,520
Ah!

159
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,500
In 1988, on April 9th, change was announced into the school year.

160
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,260
"If I wait here, I can see Saori."

161
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,120
*crying*

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,800
Senpai, what's going on?

163
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,660
There's nothing on the screen, but you're...

164
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,140
It's the forbidden symptom.

165
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,600
Ehhh...

166
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,100
Huh?

167
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,020
It's no use.

168
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,700
If other characters appear,

169
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,460
Saori won't be able to appear, right?

170
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,060
Eh?

171
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,680
N-No, Sakonji!

172
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,360
We're not characters from the game!

173
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,860
Please be a little more creative!

174
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,000
S-S-Sorry...

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,440
S-S-Sorry...

176
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,300
S-S-Sorry...

177
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,380
S-S-Sorry...

178
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,200
S-S-Sorry...

179
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,920
So, the forbidden symptom is still there?

180
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,760
So, the forbidden symptom is still there?

181
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,500
Yeah. I want my body to be healed for the sake of the bonus and the bonus.

182
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,600
Yeah. I want my body to be healed for the sake of the bonus and the bonus.

183
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,740
But it's not for Sakonji.

184
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,440
But it's not for Sakonji.

185
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,680
Of course.

186
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,480
But he's just a senior.

187
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,460
If it's a game, his body will remember it.

188
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,300
See?

189
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,380
You have to be more creative, right?

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,240
Saori!

191
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,700
Saori? Where are you?

192
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,460
Where are you?

193
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,740
You have to be more creative!

194
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,980
But, Mama...

195
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,760
Saori...

196
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,420
Are you okay, teacher?

197
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,720
Sakonji, teacher!

198
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,740
She doesn't remember it perfectly.

199
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:21,520
She doesn't remember it perfectly.

200
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,700
No, I'm not joking.

201
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,920
Come here, Sakonji!

202
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,840
What?

203
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,140
Are you going to let Saori do it?

204
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,560
I'll do the opposite.

205
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,280
I'll train in the mountains far away from humans and make her forget about Saori.

206
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,040
I'll train in the mountains far away from humans and make her forget about Saori.

207
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,340
No!

208
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,200
What?

209
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,140
Do you remember it?

210
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,520
Stop worrying!

211
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,900
Saori! Don't forget about Saori!

212
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,800
I don't want to die!

213
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,680
I don't want to die!

214
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,060
Did you see her?

215
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,420
No.

216
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,920
Damn it. Where is she?

217
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,020
She's here!

218
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,080
She went inside!

219
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,500
Wait, where is that store?

220
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,160
No!

221
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,100
She's here!

222
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,040
Saori!

223
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,100
I think one-sixth of Saori is here today.

224
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,840
I think one-sixth of Saori is here today.

225
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:11,900
What?

226
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,060
You're a bad boy.

227
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,560
I'll beat you up!

228
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,380
I'll beat you up!

229
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,380
I'll beat you up!

230
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,680
I'll beat you up!

231
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
Give me...

232
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,620
Give me Saori!

233
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,760
Give me Saori!

234
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,140
Give me Saori!

235
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,740
I'll beat you!

236
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,220
Let go, you wretch!

237
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,440
What are you talking about, Ryosuke?

238
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,020
Don't be ridiculous!

239
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,900
You were trying to buy Saori!

240
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,720
Saori?

241
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,020
Oh, that's right. You're going to cut the silk.

242
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,320
Then why did you join the art school?

243
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,940
I-I mean, I'm the head of the school, right?

244
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,760
I thought I'd try making it for you, Kibun.

245
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,860
Yes, sir.

246
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,760
You're lucky. This is the last one...

247
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,100
Hey!

248
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,420
I'll take this as well!

249
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,640
Y-Yes.

250
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,960
Zagonji, are you really interested in plums?

251
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,300
Of course.

252
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,020
Even though it looks like it, I made them a lot when I was a kid.

253
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,520
I see...

254
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,620
It seems like you're back to the Zagonji you're used to.

255
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,320
I hope so.

256
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,440
Here.

257
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,320
All of them cost 85,350 yen.

258
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,620
What?!

259
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,180
They're all exclusive, so you can't take them.

260
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,000
K-Kan! Wrap it for me!

261
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,520
Now then...

262
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,560
Saori is finally back!

263
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,780
There. I'll wrap it for you!

264
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,980
Whoa!

265
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,000
What?!

266
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,700
What's this?!

267
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,380
Uh...

268
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,420
Saori...

269
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,480
Saori!

270
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,080
I don't know what's inside the figure, so I'm going to do it.

271
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,140
Which one do you want?

272
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,840
Wait...

273
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,480
When I saw the figure at the plumber's, it was back to normal, wasn't it?

274
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,120
I think I can use this one...

275
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,480
Saori!

276
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,160
Wait...

277
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,000
I thought, why are you doing this to my company?

278
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,340
Ohara!

279
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,220
Yeah!

280
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,640
Today's practice match looks good, right?

281
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,700
Do you suppose Sakonji will lose by one to six?

282
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,420
Well, I did give him the liquid endgame, but you think Ryotsu is running away from Sakonji, just like that?

283
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,620
Saori...

284
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,580
Sakonji!

285
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,300
Ryo-Ryotsu...

286
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,140
What's wrong? You look very upset.

287
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,720
It's nothing.

288
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,900
Go over there.

289
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,740
I see.

290
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,980
I brought some presents.

291
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,600
What's this?

292
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,240
What's this?

293
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,840
Sakonji!

294
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,460
Sakonji!

295
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,300
Sakonji!

296
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,580
Calm down!

297
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,020
I'll let you touch it.

298
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,380
Hold it!

299
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,580
Just a little.

300
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Don't do it too much.

301
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,720
I know.

302
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,160
Ouch!

303
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,280
It hurts!

304
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,240
How are you feeling?

305
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,760
I feel better.

306
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,300
Alright, Sakonji.

307
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,060
Let's make a deal.

308
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
If you win this match,

309
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,260
I'll give you this figure.

310
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,740
Hold it!

311
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,360
If you win this match,

312
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,140
I'll give you this figure.

313
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,800
If you win this match,

314
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,480
you'll be mine.

315
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,300
You'll be mine.

316
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,180
You'll be mine.

317
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,060
Japan!

318
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,980
It's the final!

319
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,040
It's the final!

320
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,500
I hope it goes well.

321
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,160
I hope it goes well.

322
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,320
Ouch!

323
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,020
Ouch!

324
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,380
It hurts!

325
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,300
Ouch!

326
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,020
He threw me.

327
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,640
What are you saying, Reiko?

328
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,960
You can't throw a kid seriously.

329
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,520
But he threw me so beautifully.

330
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,160
I'm teaching you the technique.

331
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,540
Damn it.

332
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,460
Hey, Sakonji.

333
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,860
Sorry.

334
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,120
Oh no, it's a dangerous symptom.

335
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,740
If the chief finds out, it'll be a disaster.

336
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,640
Okay, that's all for today.

337
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,320
What?

338
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,440
Hey, Sakonji.

339
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:10,940
It's me, Saori.

340
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,520
Try to do it as you always do.

341
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,800
Come on.

342
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,840
Oh, Saori.

343
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:20,900
Ouch!

344
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,540
Okay, okay.

345
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,220
It doesn't work!

346
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:23,720
What?

347
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,040
What?

348
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,720
Hey, idiot.

349
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,220
Try touching it more.

350
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,700
Come on.

351
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,340
Come on.

352
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:29,900
Come on.

353
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,640
It's no good.

354
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,560
Huh?

355
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,400
What?

356
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,860
Did I lose my motivation just by the same figure?

357
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,200
Saori's figure?

358
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,740
It's here.

359
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,320
Really?

360
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,760
The one that just joined the school today...

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,440
It's Saori's 1/3 figure.

362
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,840
His length is over 50cm.

363
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,840
Okay, I won!

364
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,420
Idiot.

365
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,320
Don't make a loud voice.

366
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,900
Are you okay, Ryotsu?

367
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,580
Are you okay?

368
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,860
I'm okay, so hurry up.

369
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,240
Put your hands down!

370
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,140
Do you have to do all these things?

371
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,000
It's not like you can't do them, Saori.

372
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,220
One, two...

373
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,280
Three...

374
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,880
Four...

375
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,640
Nine...

376
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,920
Ten...

377
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,320
The last one is mine.

378
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,860
inomini...

379
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,880
Here, take him.

380
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,740
You can't just put him on the stage with me, Saori.

381
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,360
One, two...

382
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:30,460
One, two, three...

383
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,000
Five...

384
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,280
Seven...

385
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,840
And one...

386
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,160
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

387
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,040
Oh, you're almost done! You touched it too much!

388
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,020
The figure of Gensundai will be sold.

389
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,100
Really?

390
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,120
There's no place to put it in a regular store, so it's only for mail.

391
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,020
What should we do?

392
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,800
Of course! Order it now!

393
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,840
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

394
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,740
Ahoy!

395
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,900
Wait, it'll be here soon.

396
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,180
Hey, Yotsu, here's your delivery.

397
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,880
Oh, here it is. It's really big.

398
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,140
Ahoy!

399
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,960
Be happy, Sakonji. I've already painted it, so you'll be able to touch it right away when you open it.

400
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,000
There we go.

401
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,720
Hey, I only ordered one.

402
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,000
That's fine. If you contact the manufacturer, there are ten types in total.

403
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,760
T-ten types?

404
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,160
What should we do?

405
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,660
I'll have Daikin return it to Sakonji later, so it's fine.

406
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,820
Yoku, hurry up and buy this!

407
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,520
Got it!

408
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:30,880
Okay!

409
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,820
Bye!

410
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,900
Oh! Saori!

411
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,820
I'll make it, y'know?

412
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,920
Saori...

413
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:47,160
Chon! Chon! Chon! Chon! Chon! Chon! Chon! Chon!

414
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,820
A-ah!

415
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,480
Ah!

416
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,200
channels!

417
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,920
테

418
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,040
Then I'll go practice.

419
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,440
I'll do it! I'll win the national tournament!

420
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,280
Well, if I have this much money, I'll be able to hold the tournament.

421
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,300
Ryosu, is Ryosu here?

422
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,360
What is it, chief?

423
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,320
It's not what it is.

424
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,500
Sakonji has been skipping practice lately.

425
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,560
What?

426
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,820
The judo game is tomorrow, right?

427
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,880
Sen...Senpai!

428
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,920
I don't know!

429
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,180
Ryosu!

430
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,620
You're not taking my advice and taking my money, are you?

431
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,380
I'm not doing that!

432
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,660
I'm getting paid and bonuses, too!

433
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,000
I see.

434
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,000
I see.

435
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,400
Sakonji, you're not listening anymore?

436
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,340
Sakonji!

437
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:53,360
Hello, Ryosu.

438
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,040
Welcome.

439
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,940
What are you doing?

440
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,040
What about practice?

441
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,880
The tournament is tomorrow.

442
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,100
Practice?

443
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:00,860
The tournament?

444
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,860
What is it?

445
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
It's not about anything.

446
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,620
It's judo.

447
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,280
Judo.

448
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,240
Judo?

449
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,520
Oh, that.

450
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,140
Not that.

451
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,240
Drink it first.

452
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,620
Is it a high-tech game?

453
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,020
And it's all in one!

454
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,740
You're a loser!

455
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,440
You're wearing pants.

456
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,080
It's not that kind of problem!

457
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,760
Now, hurry up and go to the dojo.

458
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,500
Chief Ohara is waiting.

459
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,900
I don't want to.

460
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,580
What?

461
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm staying in this room all the time.

462
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,920
I'm going to live with Saori and the others.

463
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,580
Oh, no.

464
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,000
Because of the sudden stimulus,

465
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,140
I'm back to being a former Saori addict.

466
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,540
No, I'm more unlucky than before.

467
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
The chief is suspecting us.

468
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,100
If we find the figure,

469
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,980
we'll all be taken away.

470
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,140
Taken away?

471
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,180
Yes.

472
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,180
Saori will disappear from this room.

473
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,700
I don't want to be separated from Saori anymore!

474
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,800
So hide it right away.

475
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,720
Yes.

476
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,320
Yes.

477
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,040
We'll put it in the closet.

478
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,880
It's hard to put the futon out even if I put it out.

479
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,180
I have no choice.

480
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,560
I'll hide the rest in my room.

481
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,120
No, no.

482
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,880
Don't put it out of this room.

483
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,660
You've changed too much.

484
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,960
I understand.

485
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,520
Don't cry.

486
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,780
I'll hide it somehow.

487
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,920
First, I'll hide one under the stream.

488
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,180
My smile is creepy.

489
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
Sorry, Saori.

490
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,860
Now, four more.

491
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,720
You're hiding the whole thing in the fridge.

492
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,080
What?

493
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,040
I get it.

494
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,700
I'll think of another way.

495
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,480
It's only in the sandbag.

496
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,520
That's terrible.

497
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,960
Next, we'll put the statue over there.

498
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,340
Are you hiding it?

499
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,940
I won't tell you how luxurious it is.

500
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,340
Two more.

501
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,000
What?

502
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,540
I'm Ohara.

503
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,140
Sakonji, can I help you?

504
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,820
What's going on, Ryo?

505
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,640
I don't know.

506
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,400
I didn't even hear the chief coming.

507
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,620
Put one in the closet.

508
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,280
One more?

509
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,720
He's not here?

510
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,760
Excuse me, Ryo.

511
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,700
Chief, are you visiting me?

512
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,660
Are you injured?

513
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,460
It's just a cold.

514
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:13,880
Cold?

515
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,320
The tournament is tomorrow.

516
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,860
Are you okay, Sakonji?

517
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,360
Yes, well...

518
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,880
Saori is my chikumi!

519
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,120
He seems to be in a fever.

520
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,820
But he's much better than yesterday.

521
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,100
Really?

522
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,900
Ryo.

523
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,460
Yes?

524
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,560
You're not getting any better, are you?

525
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,880
You can't get a cold in a cold room like this.

526
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,040
You should put a stove on.

527
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,860
Okay.

528
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,140
Okay, chief.

529
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,640
Leave the rest to me.

530
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,300
Well, then.

531
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,520
Make sure you get better, Sakonji.

532
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,160
Yes, sir.

533
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,860
Sakonji,

534
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,520
you're done.

535
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,300
You're such a pain in the ass.

536
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:57,960
Get up.

537
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,860
Get some fresh air and cool your head.

538
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:01,920
Here.

539
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,220
Finally, you're awake.

540
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,740
I'm calling.

541
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,260
Saori...

542
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,840
Saori and his friends are calling.

543
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,080
Saori!

544
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,680
Saori!

545
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,140
Saori!

546
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,380
Saori!

547
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,820
Saori!

548
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,860
Saori!

549
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,360
Saori!

550
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,400
Saori!

551
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,700
Saori!

552
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,300
Saori!

553
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,540
Saori!

554
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,240
Saori!

555
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,820
Saori, Saori.

556
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,860
Saori!

557
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,660
Saori!

558
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,220
Saori!

559
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,720
Saori!

560
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,480
and my bonus and fee too...

561
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,680
Six!

562
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,120
Seven!

563
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,760
Eight!

564
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,760
Nine!

565
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,640
Ten!

566
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,740
One!

567
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,700
Until then!

568
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,540
He won!

569
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,560
He's the winner!

570
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,320
As expected, in the real game, he's showing off his strength.

571
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,580
Well done, Ryotsu!

572
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,820
Well, if I had said so, you would have known it would turn out like this.

573
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,800
Thanks to you, my bonus and my paid salary were saved.

574
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,580
Then why don't you be even more happy?

575
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,640
Look! He's crying so much in excitement.

576
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,500
This victory made him so happy.

577
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:40,780
Yeah.

578
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,660
I don't know what will happen after this.

579
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:44,860
I don't know.

580
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,840
Now that the tournament is over, I can't even think about where I will be angry next.

581
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,840
Saori!

582
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,400
Give me Saori!

583
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:07,940
You're here again, Shiratori Reiji!

584
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,300
But what is that camping car?

585
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,440
You don't know the fun of camping at all!

586
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,040
Alright!

587
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,720
I'll teach you the real thing!
