1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,620
When you watch TV

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,720
Make the room brighter and look away

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:25,300
The end of the rain, as if someone is calling

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,440
The end of the rain, as if someone is calling

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,400
I walked while looking back

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,440
I reached out to my mom

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,120
I felt a strange feeling at that time

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,380
So I walked on the black side of the Ake-do-gai

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:55,280
I walked on the black side of the Ake-do-gai

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,360
Everyone was a child once

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,700
But everyone forgets

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,280
A politician with a grand face

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,620
A blue-eyed old lady

14
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,140
Turn around and see that corner

15
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,520
You can see everyone

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,540
There are a lot of walls over there

17
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,940
Ah, the Kamehameha

18
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone, come to our town

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,620
Thank you!

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,200
Change it with calcium!

21
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,940
The story is going up!

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,760
How about we start the lesson now?

23
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,780
Hey, your eyebrows are connected.

24
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,020
Don't mess with me!

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,280
Are you going to teach me or not?

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,560
Okay, I'll do it.

27
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,420
Really?

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,880
If you pay me a million yen for the lesson, I'll pay you.

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,640
You bastard!

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,720
You're not going to pay me!

31
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,200
Are you going to take off your clothes?

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,780
I'm against violence!

33
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,880
Call the lawyer!

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,640
Call him and teach me!

35
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,260
Stop it, Ryo!

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,700
Take that!

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,340
Not yet!

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,700
I don't want to see you anymore!

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,620
Hurry up and teach me!

40
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,260
Come on!

41
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,380
Hurry up!

42
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,800
I'm not going to leave you!

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,840
Hey, you're so stubborn!

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,220
You should have beaten this villain!

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
He's not a real villain!

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,340
That's right.

47
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,780
This is a research competition.

48
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,580
Hey, stop it!

49
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,040
No, no!

50
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,500
It's my turn!

51
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,320
Do you always do this kind of research?

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,600
No, not at all.

53
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,920
This is where my true power comes from!

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,340
If you beat him a little more,

55
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,500
you will be punished for sure!

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,580
Okay, you got it!

57
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,740
Come on, Ryo!

58
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,060
Take this and teach me!

59
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,100
That's right!

60
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,560
Ryo, it's a game you want to play!

61
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,180
Do you hate to watch the police doing this?

62
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,760
You're right, Geogre.

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,260
I can't lose to them.

64
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,780
If you're going to thank them,

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,480
you should have pretty good luck.

66
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,340
You heard, give it away to Kikuni.

67
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,660
Hey, stop!

68
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, no, the Roman numerals.

69
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,440
It's a "buzz." That means you're disqualified.

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,580
What about my bonus then?

71
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,660
You can't get it! There's no bonus!

72
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,960
No! No way!

73
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,740
Damn it! I thought I'd get an extra bonus, but I can't get it!

74
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,740
Ryo-chan's way of doing things is too rough.

75
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,900
Why? I'm doing worse things in the historical drama!

76
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,600
I'm doing even worse things in the historical drama!

77
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,240
Unlike in the old days, we need to be more considerate of human rights now.

78
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,040
You need courage and patience for investigation, like Chief Ohara.

79
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,220
What about the Chief? I have courage and patience!

80
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,360
I made 100 plastic models and played games for 48 hours in a row!

81
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,740
Excuse me, the ball...

82
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,220
You... You just hit me with the ball!

83
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,220
I-I'm sorry.

84
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,980
You're never going to play here again!

85
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,660
You're never going to play here again!

86
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,400
Where was your patience and patience for such a moment?

87
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,520
That was a light joke, wasn't it?

88
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,240
I wanted to bring a story to bring your bonus back to life.

89
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,080
The bonus is back?

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,540
It's no use getting worked up.

91
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,700
Then please say it soon, Chief.

92
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,120
That's a bad boy.

93
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,800
Anyway, follow me.

94
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,360
Yes, I will follow you.

95
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,760
Debate school?

96
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,320
Let's go.

97
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,320
I've been waiting for you.

98
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm the head of the school,

99
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,680
Katta Toron.

100
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,520
I'm Ohara from the Katsushika school.

101
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,500
And this is the problem,

102
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,140
Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

103
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,440
Ouch!

104
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,560
Please stop, chief.

105
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,680
What school is this?

106
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,320
That's why I'm talking about debate.

107
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,560
Was "debate" a pun?

108
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,340
If you're going to say that, it's "rebate"!

109
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,700
Debate is a discussion session.

110
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,880
For example,

111
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,800
you decide on the themes of socialism and democracy,

112
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,280
discuss which is better,

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,700
and tell the other person.

114
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,380
The winner or loser is decided by the gallery.

115
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,240
Well, you can say it's a sport based on words.

116
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,860
Hmm, I see.

117
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,840
In short, it's a quarrel.

118
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,720
It's not just a quarrel.

119
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,480
You have to convince the surroundings with words.

120
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,440
Courage, patience,

121
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,560
and even more,

122
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,960
you need to have a very advanced debate technique.

123
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:49,940
I see.

124
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,460
Your biggest problem is that you can't say anything.

125
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,320
From now on, you have to go to this school for two weeks

126
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,280
and you have to do something about your personality.

127
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,820
Two weeks?

128
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,020
Do I have to spend two weeks with this old man?

129
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Not "old man",

130
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,560
it's "Katta Toron".

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,020
Otherwise, you won't get a bonus.

132
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,880
I understand.

133
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,360
By the way,

134
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,420
I've been wondering,

135
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,920
why are the letters of "tsu" so small?

136
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,280
Hehehe.

137
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,420
What's wrong, Sensei?

138
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,900
You're already losing.

139
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,900
What did you say?

140
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,660
You still don't get it?

141
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,980
You've fallen into the trap of the debate I set up.

142
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,700
A trap?

143
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,860
What do you mean?

144
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,840
Anyone will soon realize that the letters of "tsu" are small.

145
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,280
Next question.

146
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,140
I'd like to ask you a question.

147
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,740
But,

148
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,300
I'm sure the person who asked the question

149
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,940
has already guessed it.

150
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm sure the answer is ready.

151
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,420
Therefore,

152
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm going to ask you a question,

153
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,380
but you'll have to use your theory of the theory.

154
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,180
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,520
You'll be beaten to death.

156
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,780
This is "Katta-ryu Debate Jutsu".

157
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:09,640

170

No matter what the other party says, you must not use violence.

171
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,900
Yes sir!

172
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,320
What is it, Ryotsu-kun?

173
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,100
Why are your "tsu" letters so small?

174
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,460
I told you earlier that it's a trap!

175
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,400
I'm worried about it, so it can't be helped!

176
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm waiting for the real theory!

177
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,140
I want to hear that theory!

178
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,200
Well then, one more important point is...

179
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,120
Hey, don't fool me!

180
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,260
I'll tell you strongly.

181
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,520
Hey, you don't really think about theory or anything, do you?

182
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,920
Actually, you just want to get attention, that's all.

183
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,760
You're so stupid.

184
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,400
Damn it!

185
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,160
What are you doing? You suddenly...

186
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,300
Stop asking me stupid questions and concentrate on my attack!

187
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,100
I thought violence wasn't allowed!

188
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,520
You're so noisy.

189
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,380
I'm the one who rules here!

190
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,940
This is the "Katta-ryu" debate technique.

191
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,160
I'm the one who rules here, Ken.

192
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,300
That's not a debate!

193
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,040
If you're going to do that, then you're fighting the Ryotsu-ryu!

194
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,840
What are you doing towards the front?

195
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,160
There are teachers and students here!

196
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,580
What are you doing?

197
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,780
You two are each on my side.

198
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,460
Alright, then, I won't be fighting at the front.

199
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,440
Let's do it thinking about the front.

200
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,720
Let's do it thinking about the back.

201
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,280
I'm not going to fight against the front.

202
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,560
I'll make Ryotsu-ryu in my area, then, me in your area, and...

203
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,320
Oh, that's far out!

204
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,520
Of course, I'm the one who rules this school.

205
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,180
I am, of course.

206
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,520
If you're going to be angry, you have to supply calcium.

207
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,760
But it won't work even if you supply it during the debate.

208
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,540
You should have said that!

209
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,380
I'm in charge here.

210
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,440
You didn't use any calcium at all.

211
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
I was just trying to be angry.

212
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,500
You were serious.

213
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,200
I don't care. I'm in charge of whether you graduate from this school.

214
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,580
You know that, right?

215
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,120
That's right. My bonus is in charge.

216
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,760
I have a nice present for you.

217
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,100
A bottle of high-quality calcium from the right.

218
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,740
A little high-quality calcium from the left.

219
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,020
Which one do you want?

220
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,400
Are you taking money?

221
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,620
I'll fix your angry life!

222
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,080
You think you can buy it?

223
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,800
No! You fix it first.

224
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,820
Besides, I don't have money to buy such a thing.

225
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,540
Then, I'll buy all your meals from today.

226
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,620
What?

227
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,880
Fish with a lot of calcium.

228
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,320
This is the only way to get rid of it.

229
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,420
Fish are full of calcium, so you should eat them as usual.

230
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,640
You're joking, right?

231
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,440
Why do you have to eat all that?

232
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,020
Don't you want a bonus?

233
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,140
Oh, I see.

234
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,500
I see. I should eat them.

235
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,800
Then, I'll go patrol.

236
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,940
Damn it! I was so frustrated that I didn't want to eat fish for three days.

237
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,940
I'll listen to the radio and calm down.

238
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,120
It's time for the race.

239
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,700
The hero this time is a raccoon.

240
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,740
Take this raccoon to the front of the court and sing like this.

241
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,040
Tan-tan-tanuki's

242
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,460
And finally, the butt.

243
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,560
That's it.

244
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,780
It's easy, isn't it?

245
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,200
But won't you get angry?

246
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,760
It's okay.

247
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,460
If you see this sign, you'll forgive me.

248
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,000
Because it's famous on TV.

249
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,980
It was popular before that a raccoon carried a bag and went to a bag shop.

250
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,460
If you like this time, I'll think about it.

251
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,540
Really?

252
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,260
Yes, I'll do my best!

253
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,200
All right, good. That's it.

254
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,200
There, there.

255
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,640
There, there, there.

256
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,920
Why can't I reach it?

257
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,460
Um.

258
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,880
What?

259
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,560
What?

260
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,060
What?

261
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,900
No, no. I cut it.

262
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,040
What can I do for you?

263
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,260
Well, um.

264
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,180
Tan-tan-tanuki's

265
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,900
I'm Andriyanov.

266
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,080
No, no.

267
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,380
But, but, my butt hurts.

268
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,180
You!

269
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,620
You! Are you kidding me?

270
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,660
No, no.

271
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,140
I'm not kidding.

272
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,320
I'm just a job.

273
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,900
Do you have such a job?

274
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,860
Yes, I do.

275
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,220
Hello, hello.

276
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,280
It's a surprise camera.

277
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,520
What?

278
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,340
Um. That surprise camera.

279
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,220
What's wrong with that?

280
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,360
Normally, if you say surprise camera,

281
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,260
I'll forgive you.

282
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,540
No, no.

283
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,120
No matter how much I try, I'll be angry now.

284
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,780
The patience is not good at all.

285
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,920
You!

286
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,180
I'm waiting.

287
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,180
I have to get into the kitchen.

288
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,480
I should have prepared this question.

289
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,120
Oh, that rice.

290
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,860
I'm looking forward to it.

291
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,460
It's talking about you.

292
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:32,660
Don't hold it up.

293
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,280
Hey, what's up with him?

294
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,860
He's my teacher.

295
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,400
I've a chance to teach him.

296
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,060
I'll do my best.

297
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,300
Thank you very much.

298
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,540
That's not true.

299
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,380
I'm what?

300
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:44,820
What?

301
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,020
I don't see the meaning.

302
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,980
But I can say all Digimon's names.

303
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,000
What's the use of knowing that?

304
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,520
I'm familiar with military weapons and I know how to shoot the Patriot Missiles correctly.

305
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,060
Even if you know that, you can't talk to the common people.

306
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,060
You're naive.

307
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,900
The one I'm debating against is mainly a criminal.

308
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,100
A criminal is a person who has violated common sense.

309
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,720
There's no way a common sense would work against such a person.

310
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,600
That's true.

311
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,300
To tell criminals, the more useful is to have maniacal knowledge.

312
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,140
I see.

313
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,780
Oh no! I was told off!

314
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,340
Cut!

315
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,700
I knew you were good at teaching me.

316
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,260
You've mastered the debate technique so far.

317
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,860
So, are you graduating?

318
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,500
Yes. But...

319
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,500
But?

320
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,180
Well, if you don't get angry today, you'll get a little bit of a promotion.

321
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,420
Oh, I don't have any bonuses.

322
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd put it here.

323
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,320
I-I'm sure this is a super rare plastic model that you got from overseas.

324
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,960
What?

325
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,540
This?

326
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,620
A-A model that has a shape will break one day.

327
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,580
Don't worry about it, Reiko.

328
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,200
I'm really sorry.

329
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,280
It's okay. It's okay.

330
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
Excuse me, ball.

331
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,280
Uh...

332
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,940
I-Is that a ball?

333
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,600
Uh...

334
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,720
You're not going to play here from now on, are you?

335
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,960
Yes! Thank you!

336
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,020
I-I'm sorry.

337
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,520
Ryo, you were always so loud.

338
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,200
I'm not stupid enough to get angry and get a bonus for this.

339
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,380
I'm going to call Ryo the Buddha from now on.

340
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,400
Oh no!

341
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,140
That's where the drunkenness is raging!

342
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,700
What?

343
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,920
What did you say?

344
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,440
Uh...

345
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,800
What should I do?

346
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,380
Here.

347
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,000
Is Ryo really going to investigate?

348
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,600
Hey, leave it to this Buddha Ryo-san.

349
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,180
Damn it.

350
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,640
Don't you have any alcohol?

351
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,120
Well, will you tell me your name?

352
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,680
You're an idiot.

353
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,660
Wait, I'm just kidding.

354
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,260
Senior.

355
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,460
Senior, it's important to listen to your partner.

356
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,340
I know.

357
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,740
Don't worry, Kagawa.

358
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,360
Hey, alcohol.

359
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,540
You like alcohol too? I like alcohol too.

360
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,700
Yeah. You're a good match, Omari-san.

361
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,320
Yeah, yeah. Alcohol is delicious, isn't it?

362
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,900
I want to drink it with you two.

363
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,620
Yeah.

364
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,320
That's right. Will you tell me your name?

365
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,920
Oh, my name.

366
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,440
Okay, I'll write it down.

367
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,540
Senior.

368
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,360
You did it, Ryo-chan.

369
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,020
Yeah.

370
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,920
If you come this far, you'll be in trouble.

371
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,100
Okay, I wrote it down.

372
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,600
Which one?

373
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,500
That's a rare name, isn't it?

374
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,580
I'll take a deep breath.

375
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,400
You're lying, you idiot!

376
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,720
Senior.

377
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,240
Ryo-chan.

378
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,300
She's laughing.

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,540
Are you okay?

380
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,480
I'm not.

381
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,060
But you always take your hands out long ago.

382
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,120
I was born to be like that.

383
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,720
I can't do anything like that to my father if I take my hands out during a discussion.

384
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,560
Is it the effect of calcium?

385
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,020
I wonder how long it lasts.

386
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,420
Well, after your play is over, will you tell me your name and address?

387
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,700
Yeah.

388
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,440
I'll tell you if you show me your address.

389
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,200
Nakagawa.

390
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,600
Yes.

391
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,540
Bring me some small fish.

392
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,140
Okay.

393
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,020
Here you go.

394
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,580
I'll give you some calcium.

395
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,000
What?

396
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,620
You're eating small fish.

397
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,120
You're a big fish, aren't you?

398
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,160
Actually, I was a whale in my natural life.

399
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,000
That laugh is scary.

400
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,700
Really?

401
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,940
If you show me your address, I'll tell you.

402
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,980
Of course.

403
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,100
Here you go.

404
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,160
Wow, it's real.

405
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,380
Well, will you tell me?

406
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,640
You're a really nice person.

407
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,500
Well, will you tell me?

408
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,080
Yes, I'll tell you anything.

409
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,240
I finally understand.

410
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,020
You did it, Senpai.

411
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,220
I'm glad, Ryo.

412
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,220
Well, it's all thanks to you, Ryo.

413
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,180
What?

414
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:33,920
What?

415
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:34,840
What?

416
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,080
What?

417
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,020
I won't be fooled.

418
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,920
I've been caught.

419
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,100
I did it.

420
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,340
Senpai.

421
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,060
Didn't I tell you?

422
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,460
I won't get angry anymore.

423
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,840
This much is enough to play.

424
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,600
Now, will you give it back?

425
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,640
I'll write! I'll write! I'll write anything!

426
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,600
So please forgive me!

427
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:08,940
Eh?

428
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,740
I-I've endured it...

429
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,580
But, Ryo-chan's now is 100 times scarier than usual!

430
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,080
Ah, it's big!

431
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,560
After this festival's celebration, today's work is done.

432
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,300
Yeah, with this, my training is over.

433
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,780
I can get a bonus too-

434
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,020
Ah!

435
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:33,960
You!

436
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,620
It's not you!

437
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,760
It's Katta Toron!

438
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,700
Hey, Ryozu!

439
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,220
You're rude to your teacher!

440
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Katta-san came all the way here to give you a bonus for graduation!

441
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,820
That's right!

442
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,060
Ah!

443
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,960
Ouch!

444
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,180
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

445
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:53,800
Ouch!

446
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,660
If you give him a bonus for graduation,

447
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,820
I'm sure he'll be able to...

448
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,990
I'm sure he'll be able to...

449
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,240
I'm sure he'll be able to...

450
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,500
I'm sure he'll be able to...

451
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Kanda, I'm really sorry!

452
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,180
If you're going to give him a bonus,

453
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,380
I'd like to ask you to hurry!

454
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,380
Ouch!

455
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,080
If it's not past 12:00,

456
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,520
I'm not giving you this.

457
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,440
Tch.

458
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,620
I was told that I'd be fine.

459
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,660
Nakagawa-kun,

460
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,520
is Ryozu really okay?

461
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,700
Yes.

462
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,080
No matter what happens,

463
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,980
he won't get angry.

464
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,160
Well then, I'll get going!

465
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,760
Ouch!

466
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,480
Oh!

467
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,720
I-I'm sorry...

468
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,320
It's fine.

469
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,080
There are a lot of people out today.

470
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,880
If you run, you'll get hurt.

471
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,540
Yes, sir!

472
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,360
Be careful.

473
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,980
Yes, sir!

474
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,600
Oh, I see.

475
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,620
His personality has changed.

476
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,820
He's fine in this state, though.

477
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,540
Everyone,

478
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,560
thank you for your hard work.

479
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,340
Please.

480
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,440
No, we're still working.

481
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,260
Please, have a drink.

482
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,880
No, I'll have a drink.

483
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,080
Isn't that a little too much?

484
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,740
It's a festival.

485
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:02,900
It's a festival.

486
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,420
Well, here you go.

487
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,080
Don't hesitate.

488
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,200
Is that so?

489
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,740
Then, just one drink.

490
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,820
This is a wonderful drink.

491
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,100
As expected.

492
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,700
Today seems to be a day of good health.

493
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,380
What?

494
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,280
What happened?

495
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,560
The police are scared,

496
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:31,980
so I can't drink.

497
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,000
Senpai, that guy...

498
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,280
You're trying to try me again, aren't you?

499
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,460
Leave it to me.

500
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,780
What's wrong, sir?

501
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,960
I saw him somewhere.

502
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,260
He's lost his mind again.

503
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,220
Now, he's in the way of other people.

504
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,920
Let's go over there.

505
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,240
Don't touch me!

506
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,520
Are you all right, sir?

507
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,080
Don't be so rude!

508
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,240
This is...

509
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,280
I can't stand it!

510
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,180
I can't stand it!

511
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,280
I can't stand it!

512
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,800
I can't stand it!

513
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,160
What?

514
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,860
He's just going crazy over a drink?

515
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,200
Yeah.

516
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,900
I didn't think he was that bad at drinking.

517
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,560
Then, are you trying to test him?

518
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,720
I'm sure he's thinking a lot.

519
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,640
I see.

520
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,740
I-Is that so?

521
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,180
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

522
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,600
Ouch!

523
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,160
For the bonus, I...

524
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,040
I-I can't stand it!

525
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,060
Hey, you're gonna have to pay for it.

526
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,480
I-I can't stand it!

527
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,680
I-I can't stand it!

528
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,600
I can't stand it!

529
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,300
I don't care about the bonus.

530
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
I'll destroy you!

531
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,620
I'm still not done!

532
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:54,640
I'm finally scared of you.

533
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,360
I don't care.

534
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,920
Let me go!

535
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,960
I like alcohol.

536
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,320
But I hate drinking!

537
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,920
Ryo, you're gonna hit my heart!

538
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,580
Wait!

539
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,840
If we talk, I'm sure we'll understand each other!

540
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,220
Shut up!

541
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,180
You bastard!

542
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,100
How dare you!

543
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,280
Help me!

544
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,200
Stop it!

545
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,820
I had a bad feeling about this...

546
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,740
I know. Ryo-chan's personality doesn't change suddenly.

547
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,600
So, where is Senpai now?

548
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,140
So that we don't bother other people, we're doing special training alone.

549
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,640
You! It's dirty! It's the fish we caught!

550
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,840
The bones of the fish contain a lot of calcium.

551
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,820
The bones will be yours later!

552
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,740
What are you talking about? Let me eat it too!

553
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,100
You bastard!

554
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,160
Stop it!

555
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,820
Let me eat it!

556
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,840
I'm the genius magician Pierre Nishikaguchi.

557
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,060
I'm sure you're cheating by calling me a mansion.

558
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,400
I'll show you how to escape with my magic.

559
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,520
Next time, I'll be a body magician.

560
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,800
See you!
