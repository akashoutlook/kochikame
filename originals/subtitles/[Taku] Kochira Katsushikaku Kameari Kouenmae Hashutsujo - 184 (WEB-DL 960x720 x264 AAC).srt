1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,420
What所謂の雛鳴火?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,700
de-de-te-テレビを見るときは When you watch TV

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,520
部屋を明るくして 離れてみてね light up your room and look at the distance

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:29,760
だれかが呼んでるような 雨上がりのことを When someone comes to you after it starts to rain

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,220
I walked towards my mother looking back

6
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:42,460
I felt that strange feeling back then

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,220
So I tried walking on a black street

8
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:59,060
To the Aged Gai tile

9
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,940
But everyone forgets

10
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,320
Politicians with a proud face

11
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,780
And the blue aunt above their eyes

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,460
Turn around and look

13
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,220
At that corner

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,780
You can see everyone

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,540
There is a turtle over there

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,340
Ah, there must be a turtle

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone come to our town

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,580
Thank you!

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,760
Run! Turtle King!

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,960
He went into the last straight in the fourth corner

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,640
Nerima Gallop is in the lead

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,680
Fujiteru Begin from the outside

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,740
Will Nerima Gallop be able to escape?

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,140
Fujiteru Begin, Fujiteru Begin, Fujiteru Begin

25
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,540
He's out

26
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,620
Fujiteru Begin is the winner!

27
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,540
In a moment, my salary for this month will be...

28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,140
Pa...ka...

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,660
Is there a turtle among these?

30
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,800
Because I look like this

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,580
I'm a turtle

32
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,700
To think you're sly, idiot

33
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,400
behind the curtain

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,700
That will never be me

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,020
How pitiful

36
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,140
A poor citizen

37
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,980
I'm so miserable

38
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,360
But a police officer is a human

39
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,540
And for us, the salary

40
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,120
Is even more量

41
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,200
Does he even feel the need

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,520
For paying a salary?

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,480
That's right

44
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,420
Nakagawa and Reiko

45
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,600
Are not so good at making money

46
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
That's why they say that

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,960
Like me

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,680
I have to pay money monthly

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,400
Every two weeks

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,580
Try to live a life of only cup ramen before the break.

51
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,760
It is natural to try to increase the small amount of money by 1 yen.

52
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,560
Then, don't gamble on the field or the forest.

53
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,560
You can also make a lot of money.

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,480
The director says so.

55
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:17,000
There is no purpose and it is not my business to just save money.

56
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,840
Then you should find a purpose.

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,480
That's right, Ryo-chan.

58
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,540
Like saving up for marriage expenses.

59
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,900
Like buying a car.

60
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,240
There is also the idea of having a "my home".

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,700
Marriage, car, my home.

62
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,440
Oh, I don't like it.

63
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,260
How can you save money with such a dreamless thing?

64
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,400
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,400
Marriage, car, my home are all great dreams.

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,280
That's why it's a dream that the common people see as a celebration of the life of the life-saving band.

67
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,960
It's not something that can be felt by a bigger man.

68
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,740
You're a little too much.

69
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,660
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:56,900
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,540
You are too much.

72
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,600
Anyway, I will not allow you to do any previous job of salary.

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,920
You do something on your own.

74
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,180
I see.

75
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm really a sleeper.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,920
That's right.

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,940
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,160
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,260
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:16,840
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,940
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,340
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,220
Anyway, I will not allow you to do this.

88
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,120
Really?

89
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,900
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,800
Really?

91
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,920
Yes, I'm sorry.

92
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,700
I'm really sorry.

93
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,480
What must I do?

94
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,840
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,900
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,940
5 billion yen!?

97
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,260
It doesn't matter how much I earn.

98
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,040
I believe that winning as the owner of the racing track is a man's dream.

99
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,540
Here it is!

100
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,980
No matter how many tricks you play in the race, you can only get it.

101
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,120
It's better to be the owner of the horse than the horse.

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
Then you can earn money.

103
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,340
Why didn't you notice such an easy thing?

104
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,720
I'll do it! I'll be the owner of the racing track!

105
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,020
What? You're going to buy a horse?

106
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,740
This shiny hair, this supple waist, this guy will become a famous horse that can run the Fuji TV.

107
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,760
I'm not mad at him.

108
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,700
Are you saving money for that?

109
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,660
Are you serious, senpai?

110
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,460
I'm serious, very serious.

111
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,000
I save 100 yen a day for food for saving.

112
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,320
That's a lot of money.

113
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,100
That's why you're so poor.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,900
I'll be a nutritionist.

115
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,820
So how much is this horse worth?

116
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,440
It's 18 million yen.

117
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,880
18 million yen!?

118
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,740
So how much did you save?

119
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,360
Yesterday it was 8790 yen.

120
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,180
Now it's 1799210 yen.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,500
I have a headache.

122
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,660
Senpai, shouldn't you not push yourself?

123
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,680
That's right. You better save it.

124
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,120
Shut up! Are you going to blame my savings plan?

125
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,300
No, I didn't mean that.

126
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,220
If you think about my way of saving, you can save 18 million yen in 10 days.

127
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,660
What?

128
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,420
No way, 18 million yen in 10 days?

129
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,860
I can't believe it.

130
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,840
You're so ignorant.

131
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,660
Fine, I'll explain.

132
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,280
My way of saving.

133
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,200
I'll save it today.

134
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,180
For example, I'll start with 10 yen for the first day.

135
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,220
I'll add 20 yen the next day.

136
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,880
Then I'll add 40 yen the next day.

137
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,380
I'll add more and more.

138
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,060
I can save it without any difficulty.

139
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,660
Look at this chart.

140
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,580
Yesterday it was 8790 yen.

141
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,740
Now it's 18 million yen in 10 days.

142
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,580
That's amazing.

143
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,200
In a way, yes.

144
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,640
You're surprised, aren't you, boss?

145
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,240
Don't tell anyone.

146
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,000
This savings plan is my speciality.

147
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,020
Do you think you can save it seriously?

148
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,860
Where will you get the 900 million yen in 10 days?

149
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,680
Leave it alone. I don't care.

150
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,480
It's almost time for me to be the owner of this horse.

151
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,840
I've even thought of a name.

152
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,840
In other words, Kameari King.

153
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,460
What do you think? It's a strong name, isn't it?

154
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,280
I wonder if the king and the king are both kings.

155
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,020
Probably.

156
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,620
It's strange.

157
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,180
Suddenly it's getting harder to save.

158
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,180
It shouldn't be impossible to calculate.

159
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
I was prepared to be a little tight.

160
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,980
Let's calculate again.

161
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,060
I knew it.

162
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,540
Why?

163
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,240
Is there a problem with the plan?

164
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,620
Uh?

165
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,920
Kameari King!

166
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,380
Kameari King wins!

167
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,360
Kameari King wins!

168
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,960
A strong 8-9-7 win!

169
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,260
He wins the derby!

170
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,540
Will he give up?

171
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,420
A man's romance!

172
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,740
5 billion yen!

173
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,140
A senior?

174
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,380
That's right.

175
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,720
He's putting money, tools and treasures into the market and selling them.

176
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,040
Good morning, everyone.

177
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,080
Ryotsu, what's wrong?

178
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,300
What's wrong with me?

179
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,840
You look pale. What kind of life are you living?

180
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,160
What do you mean?

181
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,320
I live with 5 yen a day.

182
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,100
5 yen?

183
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,680
Is there anything you can buy with 5 yen?

184
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,040
No.

185
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,340
I bought a pack of biscuits for 210 yen.

186
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,880
I counted them, and there were 31.

187
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,380
That's 5 yen a day.

188
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,100
Chubu chubu chubu chubu chubu.

189
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,860
Other than that, I only have water and grass.

190
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,120
Grass?

191
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,600
A big box and a lot of grass.

192
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,860
Are you a rabbit?

193
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,420
Why are you doing such stupid things?

194
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,540
When I was in class, I started working as a barber.

195
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,980
Then who do you want to be?

196
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,180
That's right.

197
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,880
He's a man who lives together with the class.

198
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,300
Bring it and I'll show you what I store.

199
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,960
I thought you were aушка.

200
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,340
What do you mean?

201
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,820
Bring it with you.

202
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,380
The price is limited, so we don't need to do anything.

203
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,420
I don't need to worry about that.

204
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,780
Recently, there are only plastic bottles, so there are fewer bottles and cans.

205
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,200
It's an ice cream stick.

206
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,960
I'll sell it to the children for half the price.

207
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,540
Is there anything else?

208
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,220
No, I can't.

209
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,940
Why? I'm stuck here.

210
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,360
The

211
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:48,720
Senior, don't be so discouraged.

212
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,640
Senior?

213
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,740
No, it's not good. I'll pay you back with this money.

214
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,200
What? That horse has sold out?

215
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,520
Yesterday, someone asked me why I wanted it.

216
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,100
Damn, you were so late.

217
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,920
It was a pity.

218
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,640
I want a horse, sir.

219
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,360
36,000 yen.

220
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,340
36,000 yen?

221
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,900
Are you crazy?

222
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,200
You think you can buy a horse for 36,000 yen?

223
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm crazy. Look at my eyes.

224
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,560
All right.

225
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,480
I like that man.

226
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,980
I'll sell it for 36,000 yen.

227
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,340
Is it true?

228
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,840
The father is different from the brother.

229
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,580
This is also a famous horse.

230
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:42,860
Oh?

231
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,180
Even more, that Fuji TV Silver, which I bought to celebrate the fall, is the same as my birthday.

232
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,020
It looks fast.

233
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,300
I'm buying it. It's because he's my brother.

234
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,920
Now I'm a horse owner, too.

235
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,900
Nyahahaha.

236
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,520
Nyahahaha.

237
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,060
Hahaha.

238
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,800
Senpai, if your parents are different,

239
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,640
it means you're completely different.

240
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,480
Yeah...

241
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,200
That's what I think when I think about it.

242
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,420
I bought it for the atmosphere.

243
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,980
Is this really a competition?

244
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,880
My legs are short and I'm fat.

245
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,940
Yeah! That old man tricked you!

246
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,320
You little...

247
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,120
You already ate it?

248
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,820
You're eating well.

249
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,940
I'm asking for some more.

250
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,060
No, no!

251
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,180
Come on, let's practice to earn 500 million!

252
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
You did it!

253
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,080
Reiko, get out of the way!

254
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,900
Ryo, please forgive him.

255
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,680
He didn't do it on purpose.

256
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,020
I'm not a fool.

257
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,440
You're a good guy.

258
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:14,720
It's a start training.

259
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,100
The match is decided by the start.

260
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,000
If you're late, it's over.

261
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,900
That's where...

262
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,980
You're just a morning girl.

263
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,800
Don't listen to me.

264
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,900
You bastard!

265
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,520
It starts at the same time as the gate opens.

266
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,200
Okay?

267
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,800
I'm going to do it.

268
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,300
I'll do it.

269
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,460
All right!

270
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,940
I'll do it!

271
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,760
Look at me!

272
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,840
I'll do it!

273
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,520
I'll do it!

274
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,280
I'll do it!

275
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,380
I'll do it!

276
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,920
I'll do it!

277
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,880
I'll do it!

278
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,260
I'll do it!

279
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,300
I'll do it!

280
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,480
I'll do it!

281
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,260
I'll do it!

282
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,180
I'll do it!

283
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,360
I'll do it!

284
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,100
I'll do it!

285
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,080
I'll do it!

286
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,280
I'll do it!

287
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,160
I'll do it!

288
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,960
I'll do it!

289
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,080
I'll do it!

290
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,980
I'll do it!

291
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,220
I'll do it!

292
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,260
I'll do it!

293
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,480
I'll do it!

294
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,740
I'll do it!

295
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,320
I'll do it!

296
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,340
I'll do it!

297
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:13,920
I'll do it!

298
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,840
I'll do it!

299
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,260
I'll do it!

300
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,400
I'll do it!

301
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,980
Ryo...

302
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,140
I'll do it!

303
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,640
I'll do it!

304
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,120
I'll do it!

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,160
You're going to be a star in Nakayama Sports Stadium!

306
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,140
Alright, you have to run as fast as you can to the sign over there.

307
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,660
Got it?

308
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,820
Let's go! Ready, start!

309
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Move your weight quickly and push hard with your hind legs!

310
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,360
Push hard with your hind legs!

311
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,920
You're almost there! Keep going!

312
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,920
Huh? What's this guy doing?

313
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,440
How can he be so good at making a difference to a human?

314
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,340
Are you up for it?

315
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,400
What?

316
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,980
What? Can't you run because you're hungry?

317
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,700
Then why don't you eat the grass over there?

318
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,060
What? You don't like grass because you're a horse?

319
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,800
You want to eat ramen?

320
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,860
Welcome!

321
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,280
I'll have a ramen.

322
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,940
A horse!

323
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,980
A horse!

324
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,840
Not a horse, I said a horse!

325
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,900
What? You're Ryo-san! Don't surprise me!

326
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,000
If a horse talks, I'll make him a comedian, not a contestant.

327
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,500
Make him a cup of ramen.

328
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
A horse makes ramen?

329
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,100
It's an age where anything is possible.

330
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,280
Huh? What?

331
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
Don't heat the soup too much.

332
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,420
Are you a cat? Are your noodles hard?

333
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes, yes.

334
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,480
I don't want a horse to come and eat ramen.

335
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,540
Hey, wait!

336
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Thank you.

337
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,440
What's wrong? Hurry up and eat.

338
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Huh? What? Pepper?

339
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,600
Here you go.

340
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,280
What kind of food do you eat?

341
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,380
I've fed you what you should eat.

342
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,120
This time, you can run.

343
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,580
All right, get ready.

344
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,840
Ready!

345
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,380
Who told you to sleep?

346
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,080
Don't sleep! Run!

347
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,060
It's not time for a nap in kindergarten!

348
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,400
If you don't want to run, I'll shoot you in the face!

349
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,940
This is like a special training.

350
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,480
Oh!

351
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:14,920
A horse!

352
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,720
It's a real horse!

353
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,240
Ryo!

354
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,060
Ryo!

355
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,260
Put it on that horse!

356
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,900
Put it on!

357
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,720
Is that okay?

358
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,820
No, no.

359
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,680
This horse is training to become a racing horse.

360
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't have time to play with children.

361
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,980
That's fine. Put it on.

362
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,740
That's right.

363
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,560
If you don't come out, I'll tell the chief that you're skipping again.

364
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,360
Huh? Are they going to threaten the police?

365
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,560
What? Do you want me to put it on?

366
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,820
I'm the best!

367
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,540
I'm the best!

368
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,700
Hey, hey, it's the order.

369
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,680
Huh?

370
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,480
Huh?

371
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,380
All right.

372
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,160
All right!

373
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,480
Ryo!

374
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,020
Ryo!

375
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,560
Ryo!

376
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:58,880
Ryo!

377
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,240
He looks best when playing with children.

378
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,120
What?

379
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,480
Uh!

380
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,380
It's not a joke!

381
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,820
He's got a real hand!

382
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,400
I'll put everything on the racing horse!

383
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,620
bucks!

384
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,680
Not bad, baby.

385
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,100
You're awesome!

386
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,180
I'm glad I was able to drive this way.

387
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,960
What is he doing?

388
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,840
I'll beat him.

389
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,380
I'm not that dangerous.

390
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,860
With my super face!

391
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,360
Hey!

392
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,520
Hey!

393
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,180
It's my chance!

394
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,200
I'm running!

395
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,660
I'm running!

396
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,040
I'm scared.

397
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,880
I'm going to win.

398
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:44,540
I'm here.

399
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,720
So what are you going to do with this horse?

400
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,540
Are you going to let it go?

401
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,380
I can't even ask a professional.

402
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,280
Then what are you going to do?

403
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,080
I'm going to look for a part-time job that this guy can do.

404
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,080
Alright!

405
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,640
Let's go see the hero who rides the horse and runs!

406
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,580
Start!

407
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,340
Start!

408
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,000
My neck!

409
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,400
It's a part-time job, but do you have the guts to work?

410
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,100
What?

411
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,000
You don't like running?

412
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,020
You're not fit for a race car.

413
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,940
I'm starting to understand horses while we're living together!

414
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,100
If you can't do a part-time job, you should make a field here and harvest.

415
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,380
What?

416
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,160
You can't afford to work as a plumber?

417
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,220
Besides, I'm not good at cleaning.

418
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,260
Do you want to be sold to a butcher?

419
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,200
Then don't complain and just do it!

420
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:03,760
Start without complaining!

421
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,800
Alright!

422
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,320
What? You want to take a break?

423
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:19,880
You idiot!

424
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,860
You haven't even gone a meter yet!

425
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,220
I don't care about you anymore!

426
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,280
I'll make you a horse, so pick up anyone you like!

427
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,360
Shut up!

428
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,200
What on earth are you saying?

429
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,480
Hmph!

430
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,320
We'll be right back, and stay calm.

431
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,620
Okay.

432
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,820
OK.

433
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,040
Huh?

434
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,140
Huh?

435
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:03,740
Oh?

436
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,580
Somebody!

437
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,100
What?

438
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,800
Somebody help me!

439
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,660
Oh no! The car fell!

440
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,600
Satoru!

441
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,380
Help me! There's a child inside the car!

442
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,160
What?!

443
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,860
Mama!

444
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,360
Satoru!

445
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:32,660
Satoru!

446
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,780
Get down!

447
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,020
Alright, I got you!

448
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,460
I'll save you!

449
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,260
I can't do this. I'm so hungry I can't do this!

450
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,800
Damn it!

451
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:02,920
Mama!

452
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,540
Kingo!

453
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,160
Pull!

454
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,180
Pull!

455
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,980
Hang in there! Just a little more!

456
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,340
We did it!

457
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,440
Satoru!

458
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,980
Satoru!

459
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,620
Mama!

460
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,160
Kingo!

461
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:54,860
Mama!

462
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,860
We saved the lives of the children!

463
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:59,360
Mama!

464
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,320
Kingo!

465
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,220
Satoru!

466
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,980
I'm sorry about earlier.

467
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,380
I won't let you go no matter what happens!

468
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,500
Mama!

469
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,180
Excuse me.

470
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:13,660
What?

471
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,820
I've been watching your performance.

472
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,080
I've been watching your performance.

473
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,080
What performance?!

474
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,040
The husband likes your horse...

475
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,540
...and will definitely suspension it to you.

476
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,060
What?!

477
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,800
Well then, you two...

478
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,120
No matter how much money you put into it, you'll get it, right?

479
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,620
You and Kingo will be one big burden!

480
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,560
Right?

481
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,540
What?

482
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:44,700
Hmm?

483
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,400
Oh, it's a white wine!

484
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,980
