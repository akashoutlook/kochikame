1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,020
They Count on you

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,780
Make the room a little brighter for watching TV.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,060
Please, stay away from me.

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,420
There are no rich people here, so come to my house!

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,960
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,920
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,020
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,920
I know, I know, I know

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,180
If you know, just shut up and follow me

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,920
I know, I know, I know

11
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,400
Hana-chan?

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,660
It's not Hana-chan!

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,940
Jun-kun?

14
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,060
Nonsense!

15
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,220
What are you doing?

16
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,340
It said the commercial will continue!

17
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,900
It's a trailer for next week!

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,480
Is it the love bird that's being talked about right now?

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,740
I've never seen it before.

20
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,380
It was fun, wasn't it?

21
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,300
Boring!

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,540
That can't be true!

23
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,560
Now is the best time!

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,940
The best!

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,700
What's the drama with high ratings?

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,420
I'm getting 30% every week!

27
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,700
It's not only interesting because the ratings are high.

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,900
Welcome back to the Yukata Brothers!

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,860
Who decides the ratings?

30
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,520
It must be a survey or something.

31
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,560
I've never been asked to do a survey.

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,900
Do you?

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,620
I've been asked to do a survey.

34
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,060
I've never been asked to do a survey.

35
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,100
There's a device that checks the ratings on TV.

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,480
I've never seen or heard of such a TV.

37
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,440
Don't you think the media is the one who decides the ratings?

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,580
No way!

39
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,920
It's just a love song.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,860
You're the only one who's watching it.

41
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,640
I've been watching it because it's a high ratings drama.

42
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,620
I thought I wouldn't be late for the trip.

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,840
It's a Japanese style that is easy to be swept away by the boom.

44
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,160
Yes, it is.

45
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,960
Ryūtsu, why don't you play a game as a free-iary?

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,860
I've played a lot of games earlier.

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,540
Why don't you watch a video instead of that?

48
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,040
In fact, I got a video about enough goods.

49
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,940
A video about enough goods!

50
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,020
It's an educational video about the US Marine Corps of the camp set up in theлер Germany,

51
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,140
and this is a nice move.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,300
Which part of the video is interesting?

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,960
What about this one?

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,340
It's a video about theumpinance of thejeRockầun

55
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,940
It's a video to warn you against the war.

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,660
Bring me a better video!

57
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,700
Oh, right.

58
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,080
I have a lot of video of Hojo.

59
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,160
Hojo? Who is that?

60
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,300
He lives in Niconico.

61
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,500
Don't you know him?

62
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,680
I don't remember him at all.

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,300
He's like a senpai.

64
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,060
Yes.

65
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,440
Hojo is an university graduate.

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,120
He is a man who volunteers and works as a fireman.

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,600
Oh, because he's an university graduate,

68
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,280
he has a very smart face.

69
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,180
Hojo, are you there?

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,140
Yes.

71
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,320
What's wrong, Hojo? Are you sleeping?

72
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,660
Yes.

73
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,840
If this is Hojo,

74
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,880
he doesn't look like an elite of the university.

75
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,620
What do you need, Ryo-tsu?

76
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,160
What?

77
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,020
Do you know me?

78
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,740
Yes.

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,340
I'm Junsa-cho Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,780
I'm a first-time officer in the park.

81
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,480
I'm from Tokyo.

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,140
I'm from Ryo and Taito.

83
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,600
I'm the eldest son of Ryo-tsu Ginji,

84
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,860
who runs the Tsukudani store in Yorozea.

85
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,900
My brother, Kinjiro, is a lawyer.

86
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,740
Kinjiro's wife, Keiko's family,

87
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,140
Kirigayake, is a member of Nakagawa Group.

88
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,020
Wait.

89
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,800
Why are you so familiar with me?

90
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,300
Oh?

91
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,360
I know about all the people who live in this dorm.

92
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,000
All of them?

93
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,160
Yes.

94
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,000
First of all, I'm Junsa Muranaka Makoto,

95
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,400
a first-time officer in the 1st floor room.

96
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,320
I'm a member of the Kasushika-cho Traffic Division.

97
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,480
You don't have to say it.

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,260
I've heard about him before.

99
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,780
He seems to have a great memory.

100
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,800
No, I just remember what I've seen and heard once.

101
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,160
As expected of Todai.

102
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,400
Do you have a video?

103
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,260
I have about 512 videos.

104
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,460
That's a lot.

105
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,160
But they're all serious videos.

106
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,740
Isn't there anything more fun?

107
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,620
Even if you say so,

108
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,300
I'm not sure.

109
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,480
No, wait.

110
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,080
It's not like it's really recorded.

111
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,400
I see.

112
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,860
The label looks hard,

113
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,820
but it contains something different.

114
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,340
The more serious you are,

115
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,580
the more you collect dirty videos.

116
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,200
I see.

117
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,240
All right, check it out.

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,540
20 years.

119
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,300
That was the era of war.

120
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,960
That's a lot of content.

121
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,240
That's what it is.

122
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,660
I'll just clean up.

123
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,100
That's it.

124
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,020
I'll go through the video in three episodes from today.

125
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,300
Next.

126
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,520
Oh, my God!

127
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,480
What's that?

128
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,340
I got it!

129
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,500
the lens is in front of me.

130
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,400
But it's a without a word,

131
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,920
the one next to it.

132
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,660
Wow.

133
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,600
What is the difference?

134
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:13,940
Next time.

135
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,100
Ah, that's...

136
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,160
That's? What's that, Hojo?

137
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,580
N-No, it's nothing.

138
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,180
It's not nothing, is it? What machine is it?

139
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,360
No, I mean...

140
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Hmm? A machine that can't be told by people...

141
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,920
Ah! Now then, it's a machine that erases mosaics!

142
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
What did you say?!

143
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
M-Mosaics disappear?!

144
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,620
N-No, it's not! It's not such a machine!

145
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Then what?

146
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,860
Wh-What's that?!

147
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,380
Hojo-kun, if you're saying you won't tell us how to do it,

148
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,960
then we have something we can do.

149
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,240
W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W!

150
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,140
T-T-Please stop!

151
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:10,180
M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M...

152
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,300
Hahahaha!

153
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,260
What-what is this!

154
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,000
Hahahaha, stop it!

155
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,760
Th-this is the only story we can talk about.

156
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,460
This is definitely a secret.

157
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,880
Actually, this is a meter system that relative ratings are examined.

158
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,420
What?!

159
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,160
We can loo- 잡ä-á receipt ratings like this?

160
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,280
Just the other day, some BTS personnel from a rating research company came...

161
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,040
??

162
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,940
What's that?

163
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,540
Here's the thing.

164
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:50,360
You were chosen as a sample of the target group of the rating survey, so could you help us with the survey?

165
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,580
But why are you the one who's the target?

166
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Are you being fooled by the fraudulent method?

167
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,680
It's ridiculous!

168
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,760
Instead of taking the money, they gave us the license!

169
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:12,240
The channel was recorded by this device, and the radio waves were captured by this machine and sent to the survey company via a telephone line.

170
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,480
I see. That's how it was planned.

171
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,580
What I just said is a secret.

172
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,900
They were very careful to keep the meter device a secret.

173
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,980
Why?

174
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
It's because if someone finds out, they'll use it.

175
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,740
First, they'll know.

176
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,900
Second, they'll know that the person in charge of the media is excluded from the sample.

177
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,180
So, it means that the person in charge of the media wants this device so badly.

178
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,980
Fuji, can you help us a little?

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,480
No way...

180
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,520
I won't say that you don't want to help us.

181
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,240
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

182
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,620
Maybe it's because we are a little too eager...

183
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,120
That's right!

184
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,140
Manai-chan, how are you doing?

185
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,900
I'm good!

186
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,540
Let's go drink some more next time!

187
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,120
Hey, Ryotsu-chan. Long time no see.

188
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,080
Hello. I'm...

189
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,840
This is the producer I know.

190
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,120
Oh, hey. What are you doing today?

191
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,620
You brought some interesting project, right?

192
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,680
The one that can earn a lot of viewership ratings!

193
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,180
You're a guy who can earn a lot of money.

194
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah.

195
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,540
I actually came to sell the viewing rate.

196
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,940
What? Sell the viewing rate?

197
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,240
I think he's very interested in this guy.

198
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,460
This is not good. Send it to me.

199
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,420
Why do you have this?

200
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,500
It's a meter device that checks the viewing rate.

201
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,840
You're very knowledgeable.

202
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,540
Actually, this guy was selected as one of the target generations for the viewing rate survey.

203
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,260
So?

204
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,500
No, I've never seen anything like this before.

205
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,500
It's precious, right?

206
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,360
Yeah.

207
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,540
Even we businessmen...

208
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,500
No, it's because we're businessmen that we can't see it often.

209
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,480
About 6,000 generations nationwide are target for viewing rate surveys.

210
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,940
Even in the Kanto region,

211
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,340
there are 15,59 million TV generations.

212
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,520
Out of them, there are 600 generations.

213
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,600
What?

214
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,680
Out of 15,59 million, there are only 600?

215
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,880
It's 25,983 generations per generation.

216
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,540
So can you get accurate numbers?

217
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,420
It seems that there is no problem with statistics.

218
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,240
Even so, if you're getting a viewing rate of only 600,

219
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,300
this is one...

220
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,340
About 0.17%.

221
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,600
It's surprisingly small.

222
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,620
What?

223
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,920
Ouch!

224
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,320
Even if it's only 0.17%,

225
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,220
it's precious for the TV station.

226
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,280
Right?

227
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,240
That's...

228
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,060
By the way,

229
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,900
the program I was in charge of before

230
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,440
was cut off because the viewing rate didn't go to 10%.

231
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,860
Right?

232
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,940
It went up to 9.9%.

233
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,560
0.1% left...

234
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,240
If someone in the sample world watched it,

235
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,720
it would be 10%.

236
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,360
But...

237
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,120
Look!

238
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,440
This guy will help you at that time.

239
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,660
How about that?

240
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,280
10,000 per floor.

241
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,840
What?

242
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,400
No, no, no!

243
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,380
No matter how much you do,

244
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,180
don't use this kind of trick!

245
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,340
You don't want a viewing rate?

246
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,140
Well, I want a viewing rate.

247
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,060
I want it so much that it comes out of my throat.

248
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,080
But I don't want it!

249
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,520
I don't want that!

250
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,980
I can't sell my soul as a TV man!

251
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,480
I can't sell my soul as a TV man!

252
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,680
We're trying hard every day

253
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,160
to increase the viewing rate.

254
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,480
If you do such a trick,

255
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,340
you can't face the staff who are working hard.

256
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,520
Effort every day?

257
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,040
Yeah.

258
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,260
For example,

259
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,360
evening news.

260
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,380
In the past,

261
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:03,860
the market was decided from 6pm

262
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,740
when evening news was said.

263
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,960
But the content of the news

264
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,140
is similar to any other news.

265
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,520
So,

266
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,020
I thought it would be better

267
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,760
to start a little earlier

268
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,140
to increase the viewing rate.

269
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,660
Then,

270
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:15,920
one song

271
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,140
made the time of the program

272
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,400
to start earlier.

273
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,920
Other songs

274
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,180
that saw this

275
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,660
raised the time of the program.

276
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,620
The time of the news

277
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,520
was getting earlier and earlier.

278
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,560
To increase the viewing rate

279
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,080
even a little.

280
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,480
I see.

281
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,060
That's why.

282
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,460
You're going to combine

283
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,300
the news of the day

284
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,000
with the news of the day,

285
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,340
aren't you?

286
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,000
In the program,

287
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,760
efforts are being made

288
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,120
to increase the viewing rate.

289
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,900
Recently,

290
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,340
the subtitles are often

291
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,740
released in the variety show.

292
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,320
Subtitles?

293
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,040
See,

294
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,200
they're coming out

295
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
This is a role

296
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,440
that tells the viewer

297
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,000
that this is the laughing place.

298
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,360
If you watch the subtitles,

299
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,540
the viewer can laugh

300
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,180
with peace of mind.

301
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,340
This will

302
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,000
increase the viewing rate.

303
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,040
I see.

304
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,220
And,

305
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,700
to always attract the interest

306
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:06,900
of the viewer,

307
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,300
I'll put the subtitles

308
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,860
here as well.

309
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,740
Huh?

310
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,580
Do I have to do something?

311
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,640
At the end,

312
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,660
wait until the end.

313
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,020
I think

314
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,220
Well,

315
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,740
that's it for the subtitles.

316
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,360
Next time,

317
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,780
wait a minute.

318
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,400
Let's do the black cat.

319
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:36,600
The last time

320
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:36,780
it was going to be

321
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,060
a lot of black cat.

322
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,100
Ah,

323
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,020
who are you?

324
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,300
If you watch the subtitles, the viewers can relax and laugh.

325
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,220
That leads to an increase in the viewing rate.

326
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,280
I see.

327
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,240
Huh?

328
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Didn't we have the same conversation just now?

329
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,300
It's exactly the same as before the commercial.

330
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,400
The difference is about the subtitles here.

331
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,640
As you can see from the middle,

332
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,260
I'll put in a little bit of the first half.

333
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,740
Because the viewers of the recent videos change the channel immediately.

334
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,740
You're having a hard time with a lot of things.

335
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,220
I'm having a hard time.

336
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,200
What do you mean?

337
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,840
You're just doing such a silly thing and pulling the viewers.

338
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,100
It's a new thing.

339
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,260
The only number that can evaluate the program is the viewing rate.

340
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,700
It's a natural act of the TV man to try to raise that.

341
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,620
But is that really reflecting the viewing rate?

342
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,000
Of course.

343
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,800
But if the other programs imitate it at once,

344
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,680
The effect of the viewing rate increase should also be reduced.

345
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,720
Then it's another different thing.

346
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,320
Even if you don't use such a trick,

347
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,960
There is a chance that the viewing rate will be increased by 0.17%.

348
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,180
No, no.

349
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,040
Even if I want the viewing rate,

350
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,960
Can't I just do that?

351
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,080
Do you know about the viewing rate survey company that left this device?

352
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,460
Yes.

353
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,020
I got the name.

354
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,700
It's a company called Nakagawa Research.

355
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,900
Nakagawa?

356
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,500
Then maybe...

357
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:10,680
Yes.

358
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,540
It is one of the companies run by Nakagawa Keiichi-junsa, who was a first-time employee before the performance.

359
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,600
It's more convenient.

360
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,080
What?

361
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
Did you break the viewing rate meter?

362
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,580
I'm sorry.

363
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,140
I don't have a reason.

364
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,960
No, I don't know what kind of device this guy is.

365
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,340
I just cut it.

366
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,020
I'm sorry.

367
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,440
But I can't believe it.

368
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,660
Is this guy really selected by the target audience?

369
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,240
It's true.

370
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,920
Is there any evidence?

371
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,720
The name of the target audience?

372
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,100
I can't show it to outsiders.

373
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,920
I don't need to worry about that.

374
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,340
The president of this company is Keiichi Nakagawa, right?

375
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,340
I'm his boss and a relative.

376
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,880
I'm not a company.

377
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,260
What?

378
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,380
Is that so?

379
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,020
I'm not trying to abuse you.

380
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,960
I'm just looking at it.

381
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,200
Wait a minute.

382
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,820
Well...

383
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,020
Kanto, Kanto...

384
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,240
Listen, Hojo.

385
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,980
When the name comes, remember the address and name of the audience.

386
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,160
What?

387
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,580
Use your memory.

388
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,520
Okay?

389
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,600
Yes.

390
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,160
This is it.

391
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,320
I'm sorry.

392
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,140
Here, Hojo.

393
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,540
What do you think?

394
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,320
Do you have your name?

395
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,920
Well...

396
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:50,920
Well, next is the Tokyo-Kokubunji City, Nishikokubunji 2-36-6, Zenomidori.

397
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,380
Okay, that's 600.

398
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,860
So the one with this pin is the house with the ratings meter.

399
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,960
That's right.

400
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,200
So what are you going to do with it?

401
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,300
From now on, we will freely control the ratings.

402
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,780
We will become the god of ratings.

403
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,720
What?

404
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,100
Yes!

405
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,700
Um, is your grandmother living in this land all the time?

406
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,920
Over 80 years.

407
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,860
I found it.

408
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,040
The ratings meter.

409
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,440
This angle...

410
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,120
at that position...

411
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,160
Konji!

412
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,880
Press the "ha" button.

413
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,180
Okay.

414
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,500
The sales position!

415
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:38,840
Alright.

416
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,720
Alright, it's a success.

417
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,400
Alright, let's move on to the next one.

418
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,920
This is the SWA producer calling.

419
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,860
Yo, what's up Ryosu-chan?

420
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,560
If you're talking about the initial rate, I'm sorry.

421
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,760
But if you're going to make 30%, then we're talking about something else.

422
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,840
What's that supposed to mean?

423
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,640
It's the GATEBALL GO GO rating for tonight's broadcast.

424
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,460
Look forward to it.

425
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,240
"GATEBALL GO GO"

426
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,840
However, I have the final winner in my hands now.

427
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,780
GATEBALL GO GO will start soon.

428
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,740
GATEBALL GO GO!

429
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,520
Alright! I'm running on all channels!

430
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,920
Take it out!

431
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,380
Oh, zero!

432
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,980
'Sugisaki-san's right!

433
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,100
Oh, Mr. Lucky! You're so good!

434
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,040
I can't do anything!

435
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,380
Ah, Mr. Tane is leaving here!

436
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,520
Currently, the rate of "Go! Go!" in the GATEBALL is 100%!

437
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:16,960
Yay!

438
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,720
So, I won't do it!

439
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,540
Ah, the channel is being returned!

440
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,360
That's right!

441
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,520
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

442
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,480
Wheeeeee!

443
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,760
18 minutes and 40 seconds until the end of the broadcast!

444
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,540
"256" has been returned!

445
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,380
Next is "413"!

446
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,400
"218"!

447
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,040
"13"!

448
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,220
"109"!

449
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,500
"215"!

450
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,960
"444"!

451
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,400
"329"!

452
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,620
Next week on "Go! Go!" in the GATEBALL!

453
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,400
"Go! Go!" in the GATEBALL is...

454
00:19:51,440 --> 00:20:00,980
"Go! Go!" in the GATEBALL is...

455
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,300
65.3%!?

456
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,040
Mr. Tsubasa, it's a call for you.

457
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,640
Huh? Hello?

458
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,720
Did you see that?

459
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,260
The GATEBALL 55% ratings.

460
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,320
Oh, so that's your trick.

461
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,780
Now you know my abilities, right?

462
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,980
If you're interested, I can make you get higher ratings.

463
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,260
How about 100,000 yen per percent?

464
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,540
Eh? But that's the TV man's duty.

465
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm sure you were the main producer of the GATEBALL TV man.

466
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,580
Oh, yeah?

467
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,360
I'll give you a higher rating for your behind-the-scenes show.

468
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,240
What!?

469
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,200
Look forward to the next show.

470
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:40,860
Yeah.

471
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,040
GATEBALL TV MAN

472
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,560
Good evening, I'm Rodríguez Ito.

473
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,280
I'm Nancy Shimazaki.

474
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,780
All right, we'll be back on all channels except Hachi.

475
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,880
We're back to Hachi!

476
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,520
You're back to Hachi!

477
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,180
We're back to Hachi!

478
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,740
We're back to Hachi!

479
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,940
If you watch the same channel for four seconds, you'll be on the record.

480
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,780
If you don't, you'll be on a different channel.

481
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,400
The ratings are 0%!

482
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,020
I'll show the stupid TV crew how scary I am!

483
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,120
Mr. Tsubasa, it's a call for you.

484
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,640
Hello?

485
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,320
The TV man is on a break, isn't he?

486
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,060
You're...

487
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,460
He's in charge of the after-show, right?

488
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,160
I hope we get a high rating for our next show.

489
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,160
Mr. Ryo, you can't be...

490
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,440
If we have a low rating for the next show, what will you do?

491
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,160
You'll be on the wrong side.

492
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,740
But...

493
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,060
So, what are you going to do, Tsubasa?

494
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,580
Oh, I see.

495
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,520
I'll buy the ratings.

496
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,260
200,000 for the ratings of 1%.

497
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,640
What!?

498
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,980
100,000 for the ratings of this time!?

499
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,240
If you don't like it, it's fine.

500
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,800
Instead, the ratings of the behind-the-scenes show...

501
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,700
Oh, I see.

502
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,580
200,000 for the ratings of the behind-the-scenes show...

503
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,240
Alright, I'll get you the highest ratings in Japan.

504
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,180
Look forward to it.

505
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,820
Listen up!

506
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,880
The highest ratings of Japan so far is 82.4% in the 14th Kouhaku Song Contest.

507
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,360
We're going to change that record with the TV man who's going to start today!

508
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,100
Yeah!

509
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,420
The TV man who's going to start soon!

510
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,500
The TV man who's going to start soon!

511
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,140
TV Man:

512
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,680
TV Man:

513
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,680
Alright, all channels have reached eight!

514
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:29,860
TV Man:

515
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,960
TV Man:

516
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:31,800
TV Man:

517
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,360
TV Man:

518
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,920
It's getting more and more getting back to normal!

519
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,080
Once again, it's getting back to another channel!

520
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,000
TV Man:

521
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,300
TV Man:

522
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,280
TV Man:

523
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
TV Man:

524
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,460
TV Man:

525
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,240
TV Man:

526
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,380
TV Man:

527
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,380
"The

528
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,660
It seems there's some terrible news in here.

529
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,680
Sit down on the spot!

530
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,920
Yes, this is the spot.

531
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,500
This is the room of the man who caused the world to tremble by increasing the number of viewers.

532
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,700
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

533
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,320
This is the man!

534
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,600
Everyone, please look!

535
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,160
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

536
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,480
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

537
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,020
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

538
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,600
The TV guy who attacked yesterday!

539
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,060
He recorded the highest viewing rate on the TV so far!

540
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,280
It seems that the people who were the samples wanted to see the criminal who was changing their channels.

541
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,880
Ryo-chan is satisfied with the fact that he is the highest viewer.

542
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,540
He's a really nice person.

543
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,460
Well, the people in the TV department were happy that they could get the number.

544
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,180
Huh?

545
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,920
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

546
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Damn it!

547
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,160
That's him!

548
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,800
He betrayed me!

549
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,320
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

550
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,520
Wait a minute!

551
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,020
So the public bath there was not in the latter half!

552
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,740
What do you mean?

553
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,920
Damn it!

554
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,800
You're fooled!

555
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,300
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

556
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,720
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

557
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,940
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

558
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,980
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

559
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,680
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

560
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,080
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

561
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,240
"The man who caused the world to tremble"

562
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,800
After the rain, I walked back and forth

563
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,680
I was drawn to my mom

564
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:34,380
I felt a strange feeling at that time

565
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:40,240
So I tried to walk on the black road

566
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,640
I was drawn to my mom

567
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,760
Everyone was a child once, but they all forget

568
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,080
A politician with a great face

569
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,800
A blue aunt in front of you

570
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:06,080
Turn up and see that corner

571
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,900
To everyone

572
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,740
To everyone

573
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,320
I can see you

574
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,540
There's a turtle there

575
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,480
I'm sure there's a turtle

576
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,400
Everyone come to our town

577
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,600
Thank you!

578
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,200
It's forbidden, that's too much, chief!

579
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,720
Indeed, I went to the building

580
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,180
I was drunk and broke my house

581
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,560
It's bad, but

582
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,760
If I drink, what will remain?

583
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,820
Next time, mass production is prohibited!

584
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,220
Thank you!

585
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,980
There's a turtle there

586
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,760
I'm sure there's a turtle there

587
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,520
Everyone come to our town

588
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,980
Ah, it feels good

589
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,200
Look forward to the next time!
