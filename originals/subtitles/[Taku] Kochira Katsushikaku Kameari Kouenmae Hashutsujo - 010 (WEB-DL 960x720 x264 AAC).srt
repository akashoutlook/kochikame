1
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:13,860
Summer Has Come

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,320
Ah, the summer has come again, this year

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,680
the summer has come, this year

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,880
Ah, the summer has come again, this year

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,420
the summer has come, this year

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,560
it has come, it has come

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,280
with mah, I have come to Okinawa

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,160
after drinking, it is the night sky

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,460
The wind blows south

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,080
A big chest, a small chest

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,380
A guy with a big chest

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,680
A big chest

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,280
Ah, this year too

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,700
The month has come

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,040
It's come, it's come, it's come, it's come, it's come

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,160
Ah, this year too

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,660
The month has come

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,520
It's come, it's come, it's come, it's come, it's come

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,700
A big wave, a small wave

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,480
A guy with a big chest

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,160
The wind blows south

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,680
A big butt, a small butt

23
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,280
A guy with a big chest

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,380
Ah, this year too

25
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,620
The wind blows south

26
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,520
The wind blows south

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,680
This year too

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,980
Episode 1: The Big Bang

29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,420
The Big Bang: The Big Bang

30
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,600
This time, there are traffic accidents in the city of Tonai, especially in our district.

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,380
So, next week, a traffic safety guidance training session will be held in this district.

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,700
On that day, the students of this training center will participate as instructors,

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,020
so I want to give the students an idea of a training that is easy to understand…

34
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,340
There are too many accidents, Ryotsu.

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right.

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
Like the one where you break the speed on a bicycle.

37
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,980
I don't like it.

38
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,580
Or the one where you ignore the traffic lights because you're on a bicycle.

39
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,800
I don't like it either.

40
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,460
Or the one where you get into a house and destroy the shop.

41
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,580
You're so stupid.

42
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,840
Or the one who makes plastic models and doesn't listen to people.

43
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,460
That's ridiculous.

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,400
You idiot!

45
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,080
It's about you!

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,820
I'm listening!

47
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm making plastic models for mental health!

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,980
Don't mess with me!

49
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,200
Do you think that's a Helix?

50
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,460
It's just like tea!

51
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,380
Don't make plastic models and tea together!

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
What will happen to the traffic safety?

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,600
I don't know.

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,420
Anyway, think of a plan for a traffic accident before the training session!

55
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,940
I'm not kidding.

56
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,800
I have a good idea for a traffic accident.

57
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,700
It's simple.

58
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,380
You all have to get in the car.

59
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm busy making plastic models.

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Damn it.

61
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,580
Excuse me.

62
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,280
Yes?

63
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,960
Yes.

64
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,140
Do you need anything?

65
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,200
Is Ryotsu here?

66
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,560
Wow, it's you!

67
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,460
Long time no see.

68
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,540
Is he your junior?

69
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,240
Nice to meet you.

70
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,820
I'm Honda from the Traffic Traffic Team.

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,580
Actually, I'm going to join the same group as him.

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,340
So, I came to say hello.

73
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,080
Wow, it looks delicious.

74
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,840
I baked this chocolate cake.

75
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,900
Look at this.

76
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,580
Isn't Surara's face cute?

77
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,360
Surara?

78
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,960
She's the main character in an anime.

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,800
She's the girl from the park.

80
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,300
She's quite popular now.

81
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,760
I heard that.

82
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,300
She's a good actress, too.

83
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,780
She's cute.

84
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,840
She's a good actress, too.

85
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,120
Stop it.

86
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,700
I mean...

87
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,660
Damn it!

88
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,300
I'm so sorry about this!

89
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,580
Stop!

90
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,540
Stop!

91
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,180
Stop, you idiot!

92
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,340
Stop!

93
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,200
Stop!

94
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,650
Stop!

95
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,200
Stop!

96
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,660
Stop!

97
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:17,740
Stop!

98
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
Stop!

99
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,100
Stop!

100
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,680
Stop!

101
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:21,840
Stop!

102
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,800
Stop!

103
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't!

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,720
Stop!

105
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,100
Don't!

106
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,180
Stop!

107
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,320
Don't!

108
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,980
Stop!

109
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,100
Stop!

110
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,600
K creditor!

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,560
I can't believe it's a modified motorcycle!

112
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:45,700
Get it!

113
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:46,800
It's time!

114
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,680
Someone stop the motorcycle!

115
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,480
Honda!

116
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,280
Hey, you came here by motorcycle today, right?

117
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,180
Yes. I'm always on the same bike.

118
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,280
Okay, Honda, you go!

119
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,580
I'm scared. I'm a little...

120
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,840
Don't worry. Get on the motorcycle!

121
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,180
Why?

122
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,320
I can't do it without you.

123
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,520
You can't do it without Honda!

124
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,200
No! I can't!

125
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,460
Stop it!

126
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,580
Get on the motorcycle!

127
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,860
Stop it, Ryo!

128
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,460
I feel sorry for Honda.

129
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,920
You can't get on the motorcycle!

130
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,020
I knew it!

131
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,900
You can do it!

132
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,820
Okay, I'm going to get on the motorcycle today!

133
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,820
What's wrong with him?

134
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,220
I'm the great Honda!

135
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:07,540
It's great. The motorcycle technique is amazing.

136
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,380
Are you ready, Mr. Ryotsu?

137
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,120
Yes, go ahead!

138
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,320
What's wrong with him?

139
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,540
He looks like someone else.

140
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,340
Wait!

141
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,880
Hey!

142
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,160
I can't see anything.

143
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,380
What was that?

144
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,520
It looked like a white horse.

145
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,660
A capulet of observer silver.

146
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,520
Exosong that handler the soul.

147
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,400
His heart is always pressing out.

148
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,200
I'll push you to your loser hole!

149
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,240
Come on, we've got it!

150
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:50,940
Huh?

151
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,920
This is terrible!

152
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,840
Do you think you'll get away from this, stinking raccoons!

153
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,020
Uwaaahhh!

154
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,320
Uwaahhh!

155
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
Huh!?

156
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,000
What the heck is that?

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,020
What happened to you?

158
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,900
Are you two late?

159
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,720
Mr. Honda took out the whole scene.

160
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,060
I'm so cool!

161
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,960
W-what is this?

162
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,700
I-I can't believe Mr. Honda has...

163
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,900
Yes, that's right!

164
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,120
He's a former hound of the Honda gang.

165
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,100
He's a traffic patrol officer now.

166
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,340
But when he rides a motorcycle, his personality changes.

167
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,540
He's a man who's feared as a double-decker devil who cries a lot in the countryside.

168
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,120
Double-decker...

169
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,800
Devil?

170
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,780
The engine is getting warmer.

171
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,240
You two, let's go for another run!

172
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,780
Yeah! Let's go!

173
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,880
Double-decker devil...

174
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,820
No way...

175
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,480
What's going on?

176
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,360
Wasn't the traffic light red just now?

177
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,500
You know what?

178
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,060
If you can't find it, it's not a violation.

179
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,880
If you can't find it...

180
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,180
I found it!

181
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,020
The traffic light is on in front of Honda.

182
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,320
It's a fake one.

183
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,920
Hey, run, baby!

184
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,100
Can't you just stop for a moment?

185
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,600
I have to stop! I have to stop!

186
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,080
What are you going to do?

187
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,900
I'll shoot you!

188
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,920
Here's your license!

189
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,560
What are you doing?

190
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,660
I'm sure you don't mind me ignoring the signal.

191
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,920
I do.

192
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,760
They've come this far?

193
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Move the car in a hurry!

194
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,380
But, the engine...

195
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,400
What? Is it my fault?

196
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,560
No...

197
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,480
There's something wrong with you!

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,500
Move the car!

199
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,000
No way!

200
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,380
He destroyed 3 bikes, one passenger and caused a big traffic jam.

201
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,060
What kind of personality is this?

202
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,420
It's a big deal.

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,240
Well, well, well, Chief.

205
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,780
Honda is reflecting on itself and today was a big day.

206
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,300
You destroyed Honda, didn't you?

207
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,120
No, not at all.

208
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,220
I just wanted to take it.

209
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,540
I think Ryotsu-senpai told you to go.

210
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,520
I don't like it, Honda.

211
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,280
When did I do that?

212
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,480
Well, you're the one who died.

213
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,940
Well, well, well.

214
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,220
I don't care!

215
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,800
Ryotsu!

216
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll give you 100 books of traffic safety books!

217
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,040
I'm sorry.

218
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,680
Destroy all of them before the meeting!

219
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,200
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,520
Destroy all of them before the meeting!

221
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,360
Destroy all of them before the meeting!

222
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,860
It's complete.

223
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,920
With 1750 horsepower, two-speed, three-speed, and a low-break engine,

224
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,540
it was a masterpiece produced by Germany,

225
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,260
Junkers Jumo 2131.

226
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,840
The name is Tank 152.

227
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,080
Ryo, are you studying traffic safety?

228
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,060
If you don't study, you'll get in trouble again.

229
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,240
You don't inform me!

230
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,100
And you're not the one playing with that doll!

231
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,720
I'm not!

232
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,040
It was the chief's request.

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,420
I'll take it to tomorrow's meeting.

234
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,860
I'm going to hit a toy like Ryo that looks exactly like her and do traffic accidents.

235
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,360
A-a toy that looks exactly like me?

236
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,020
The one that looks exactly like me?

237
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,060
Stupid!

238
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,520
Don't let him do that!

239
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,060
That wretched chief is really trying something!

240
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,600
He's turning his grudge into a puppet!

241
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,480
Wretched who?

242
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,620
Wretched Chief, no.

243
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,340
It's Джirta's fault that he wanted to eat it.

244
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,200
He seems healthy and that's good.

245
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,500
Tomorrow's lecture is to read a hundred of theaszle+scripts, right?

246
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,440
Th-that's right.

247
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,920
He'll come tomorrow for sure.

248
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,220
Byouzu.

249
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,800
Of course. I'm looking forward to tomorrow. I'll sleep tonight.

250
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,060
I'm going to ask you to do a lot of things.

251
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,320
What's with that funny laugh?

252
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,280
Are you still here? I hope you didn't run away.

253
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,440
I'm not going to run away.

254
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,040
I'll be there.

255
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,360
I've been complaining for days.

256
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,360
But the chief can't go against me.

257
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,360
It's about him.

258
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,840
He's been walking around in a daze even after I've been late.

259
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,500
Maybe he skipped.

260
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,760
While I was saying hello, he was smiling at me.

261
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,340
No way.

262
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,840
I don't like the way he is.

263
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,880
Why are you so serious?

264
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,360
Sorry I'm late, chief!

265
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,540
What are you doing, Ryotsu?

266
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,940
What time do you think it is?

267
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,260
No, it's a water...

268
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:28,900
It's not my fault that the alarm suddenly stopped.

269
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,720
And the bike is punctured, and the bus never comes.

270
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,020
I ran all the way here by myself.

271
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,480
It's true!

272
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,800
You idiot!

273
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,760
Don't blame it on people!

274
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,420
Chief, the people are watching.

275
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,280
I see, it can't be helped.

276
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,420
The alarm broke and the bus was delayed.

277
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,060
You've studied the traffic law, haven't you, Ryotsu?

278
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,720
Of course!

279
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,680
From head to toe, the traffic is safe.

280
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,200
I'm getting it, I'm getting it.

281
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,380
Don't mess with me!

282
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,260
Chief, look at the people.

283
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,980
Well, it's a good idea to tell everyone about the difficult traffic rules by gags.

284
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,080
Well, you have your role.

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,260
You're up to something, Chief.

286
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,040
This is the first time I've seen you.

287
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,040
I'll help you.

288
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,520
It's scary.

289
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,900
It's going to be a week of traffic safety.

290
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,580
Will it be okay?

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,660
We work every day to protect the people of Kubin from traffic accidents and crimes.

292
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,780
However, the traffic safety is...

293
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,200
Did you fail the strategy that you thought would be over if you were late?

294
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,460
Shall we start the next strategy?

295
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,380
Hey, Honda!

296
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,480
Can you hear me?

297
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,340
Huh?

298
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,320
I can't do that.

299
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,120
Besides, I'm on patrol, so...

300
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,860
I'm a little lost.

301
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,760
What I'm saying is dangerous!

302
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,940
Okay, I'm going.

303
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,380
All right, all right.

304
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,680
I can't help it.

305
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,620
What?

306
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,680
What?

307
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,320
What?

308
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,560
What?

309
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,260
What?

310
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,660
What?

311
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,100
What?

312
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,560
What?

313
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,040
Uh, hold on, you two!

314
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:27,640
Wait for it, dear!

315
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,060
transp illegally

316
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,240
I don't know who you're talking to.

317
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,460
But it's not a karaoke, grandpa.

318
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,700
I didn't think you'd learn that.

319
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,340
What do you want?

320
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,560
Wh-what do you want?

321
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,360
Get in line, girls.

322
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,980
I'll give you a break.

323
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,300
Hehe!

324
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,580
Now what?

325
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,180
The End

326
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,620
The End

327
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,800
The End

328
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,900
Hello, kids.

329
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,480
You're all small, so it's hard to see from the driver's point of view.

330
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,340
So be careful.

331
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,440
Yes, sir!

332
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,820
Chief, you're so angry that you're going to make fun of me?

333
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,500
When crossing the Odan River, raise your hands and cross them.

334
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,940
Yes, sir!

335
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,460
Yes, sir!

336
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,660
Yes, sir!

337
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,860
Kaki-chan, you're in danger!

338
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,900
As you can see, cars don't know when to jump out.

339
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,020
So be careful.

340
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,740
You bastard!

341
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,380
Next is a bicycle accident that happens often among elementary school students.

342
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,100
A bicycle accident is often caused by a truck.

343
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,480
Let's try to reproduce that scene.

344
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,340
I want to see it!

345
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,640
I want to see it!

346
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,840
Damn it.

347
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,560
You idiot!

348
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,500
Why are you so sad that I have to dress like this?

349
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,120
Hey, don't call me "I" when you're an elementary school student.

350
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,700
Kankichi-kun!

351
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

352
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,400
All right, all right.

353
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,180
In the case of the accident,

354
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,960
please be especially careful of large trucks.

355
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,420
At such crossroads, when a large truck turns,

356
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,820
this boy and this boy will be hit by the inner wheel.

357
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,380
This boy and this boy will be hit by the inner wheel.

358
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,320
I have been hit with a large truck before.

359
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,680
Please take a look nicely.

360
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,160
Chief!

361
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,220
It is not a chief to hit otherwise.

362
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,600
The driver of the large truck.

363
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,280
laptops?

364
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,240
You are an elementary school student who plays hard!

365
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,580
It's all right, everyone.

366
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,680
Please pay attention to this one.

367
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,120
Then I will play it.

368
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,600
Car accidents occur when a car turns,

369
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,360
and the rear tire bends to the inside.

370
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,240
and the one that comes out from the other side,

371
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,040
in this case, I will definitely pull that boy out.

372
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,420
Go!

373
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,440
Damn it! I can't stand being stuck in the chief's trap!

374
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,260
Look! Here comes the Nailin-san, and the boy...

375
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,580
Ouch!

376
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,100
-Get out! -I don't know!

377
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,200
He dodged it on purpose, didn't he?

378
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,820
At this rate, my position...

379
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,020
-Return! -You two!

380
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,540
You're so tough!

381
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,440
Well, that was a good example of how to escape like this.

382
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,600
But I thought I'd be able to escape every time.

383
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,360
Next! Next is the main event.

384
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,380
Stay here, Ryotsu.

385
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,900
I won't let you get away this time.

386
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,240
This is the end of your play.

387
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,380
I'll escape as many times as you want!

388
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,540
I won't let you do as the chief wants!

389
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,080
Here I go!

390
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,960
When you're running parallel to the truck like this,

391
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,060
you need to be careful!

392
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,180
Hey!

393
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,660
Don't run faster than the truck!

394
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,180
I'm trying to survive the traffic war!

395
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,220
-You're going to die! -You're going to die!

396
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,420
You're going to die!

397
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,920
Like this,

398
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,600
you can't expect the truck to come and get close to you.

399
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,000
Everyone, be careful!

400
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,680
-You're going to die! -You're going to die!

401
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,960
Damn it!

402
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,740
The truck jumped, and it was spinning,

403
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and it came and got close to me!

404
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,220
Damn it!

405
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,280
Damn it!

406
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,020
It's like a child's fight.

407
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,020
I don't think it's a very safe negotiation.

408
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,200
You don't know what's going to happen.

409
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,580
You'll survive the traffic war by following the rules!

410
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,760
You don't know what's going to happen?

411
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,860
You're going to die.

412
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,440
I'll let you taste the meaning of that word, chief!

413
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,420
Next is an accident of a 50cc motorcycle that often happens to women.

414
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,640
It's a 50cc scooter, but it's quite fast,

415
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,260
so please be careful how you ride it.

416
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,480
Thank you for waiting.

417
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,520
-Huh? -Huh?

418
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,120
Chief, please show us the safety standards.

419
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,060
I got it.

420
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,220
I've been waiting for this moment.

421
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,720
Now, get in.

422
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,440
Get in.

423
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,420
You're planning something, aren't you?

424
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,860
First, you'll be riding with the stand on.

425
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,320
Of course, don't forget to wear a helmet.

426
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:05,280
And before you start the engine, make sure you check the surroundings...

427
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,640
What?

428
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,320
What?

429
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,760
What?

430
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,820
I started the engine on my own.

431
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,320
I can't even brake or handle the handle.

432
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,900
Everyone, this is a bad example of a scooter.

433
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,500
This scooter is modified to be able to control this Radiconder.

434
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,020
Please stop it!

435
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,200
What's wrong with this scooter?

436
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,560
Now, Honda!

437
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,420
Get in!

438
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,560
Roger!

439
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,620
Hey!

440
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,180
I'm a safe rider today, too!

441
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,020
What?

442
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,580
What's going on here?

443
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,340
Check the way!

444
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,040
Ryo, Ryo!

445
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,320
This is your fault.

446
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:46,980
No!

447
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,440
Hey, hey...

448
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,860
Please don't do this kind of driving.

449
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,460
So scary!

450
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,800
Nobody's been listening.

451
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,180
We're driving this Honda...

452
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,120
You idiot!

453
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,340
Honda, get your safety gear back, please!

454
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,640
Now, let's test the dangerous car with this ugly doll.

455
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,300
Damn it, chief.

456
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,700
You're going to make fun of me, aren't you?

457
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,700
This is awesome!

458
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,640
This is amazing!

459
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,600
As you can see, even though it's only 20 kilometers away,

460
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,780
it's still pretty damaged.

461
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,580
Now, let's speed up and see how much longer it can withstand.

462
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,300
Oh, my poor Ryo-chan doll.

463
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,660
It's like a real me is being tortured.

464
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,460
Mr. Ryo,

465
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,420
What?

466
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,840
Can you just keep quiet?

467
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,040
No, Ryo Tsukankichi is not a man who will be ashamed of his silence.

468
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,600
Next, let's test it at 60 kilometers per hour.

469
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
Let's see how much longer it can withstand.

470
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,440
Well, will that doll be able to withstand?

471
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,380
It's a doll, but I can feel it a little.

472
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,180
I don't mind.

473
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,840
Take this.

474
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,260
Wait a minute!

475
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,180
Hey, the motorcycle is coming from the sky!

476
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,640
You don't know what's going to happen.

477
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
It's a traffic war, chief.

478
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,200
Damn you!

479
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,420
You're going to get in the way of the meeting.

480
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,640
Go!

481
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,220
Nakagawa!

482
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,740
Yes, sir.

483
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:28,680
Go!

484
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,640
What are you doing?

485
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:37,960
Can't you catch up?

486
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,180
No, I can't.

487
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,280
If I keep going like this, the motorcycle will be more advantageous.

488
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,220
What are you doing?

489
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,100
Hurry up and go!

490
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,620
No, I can't.

491
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,860
The road is covered with oil.

492
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,440
I can't go forward or turn.

493
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,660
What?

494
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,140
Look at this.

495
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,160
It's scary to be in a traffic war.

496
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,320
Suddenly, there is oil on the road.

497
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,960
Damn you, Ryo-tsu!

498
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,420
All right, I'll put on my armor at once.

499
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,640
Are you sure, Mr. Ryo-tsu?

500
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,880
Why are you so scared?

501
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,680
If you're going to do it, do it thoroughly.

502
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,940
Okay, I'll do it.

503
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,460
Let's dance!

504
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,840
It's a double lock!

505
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,840
Let's do it!

506
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,460
OK!

507
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,460
It's a double lock!

508
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:33,860
What are they doing?

509
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,880
Mr. Ryo!

510
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,300
What's wrong with you?

511
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,520
I can't see anything.

512
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,800
Go!

513
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,700
It's cool!

514
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,000
It's effecting!

515
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,580
It's effecting!

516
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,460
All right!

517
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,760
It's a double lock!

518
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,380
Go!

519
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,640
Fantastic!

520
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,100
You see!

521
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,040
It fits you

522
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,120
this is the basics of this world

523
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,840
Not this world!!!

524
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,940
Noooooooooo!

525
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,360
Come here!

526
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,300
The meeting isn't over yet!

527
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,620
What the hell are you doing!

528
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,200
Please stop, Yamcha!

529
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,520
Everyone

530
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:17,760
What's this?

531
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,740
Everyone, thank you for your hard work in this long session.

532
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,540
Now, we'll do the final demonstration.

533
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,520
The two policemen are ready to die, and will be doing a car crash test.

534
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,120
Please don't imitate us.

535
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,660
Bye.

536
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,240
Do it, Nakano!

537
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,920
Get in the car and go all out!

538
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,380
Are you sure?

539
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,220
Carver, do it!

540
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,260
Manager!

541
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,780
Help me!

542
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,460
Manager, I'm sorry!

543
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,380
Stop it!

544
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,640
We're not dummy dolls!

545
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,360
We did it!

546
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,580
Tomorrow, we're having a party at Nakagawa's house!

547
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,520
It's the birthday party of the prince of the Hondara Kingdom!

548
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,340
It's about Nakagawa's house!

549
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,960
We'll have a feast like a feast in the mountains!

550
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,660
Alright!

551
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,260
Let's start today!

552
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,500
Let's make him hungry without eating anything from now!

553
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,760
