00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,620
Hikari

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,860
When you watch TV, make the room bright and look away!

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,420
Hikari

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,820
Hikari

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,040
Hikari

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,280
Hikari

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,740
Those who have no money, come to me!

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,920
I don't have any, but I'm worried.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,660
I'm worried.

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:36,120
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,100
I'll be able to do something about it.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,180
Hahahaha

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,420
Hikari

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:48,820
Hikari

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,280
Hikari

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,380
Hikari

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,760
Hikari

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,480
Hikari

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,300
Hikari

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,780
Hikari

22
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,260
Hikari

23
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:56,280
Hikari

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,300
Hikari

25
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,260
Those who have no work, come to me!

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,500
I don't have any, but I'm worried.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,140
Look at the red cloud burning.

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,100
I'll be able to do something about it.

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,480
I know, I know, I know.

30
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,720
If you understand, then shut up and follow me!

31
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,280
Ryo-san's Long Day

32
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,620
Ryo-san's Long Day

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:52,700
Ryo-san's Long Day

34
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:26,080
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,780
Idiot! Hurry up and give me the silver coin!

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,720
Uuughhhh! Aahhh! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

37
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,660
Idiot! Hurry up and give me the silver coin!

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,440
Shouldn't I apologize to you?

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,780
Huh?

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,460
Idiot! Hurry up and give me the silver coin!

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,060
There's a trick like this? Damn, I thought the chief was crazy about giving me a present.

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,440
Ugh, I guess I can't help it. I'm not going to wake up.

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,940
I didn't wake up because the chief woke me up. I woke up because I was too hungry.

44
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,420
I finished eating something.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,060
Hm? There it is, there it is. Rice balls and natto.

46
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,300
I don't remember when I bought them, but I'm sure I bought them at a convenience store.

47
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,160
What is this smell?

48
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,980
The expiration date is July 5, 1999.

49
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,420
It's impossible for rice balls from the 20th century to rot.

50
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,860
Natto is fine.

51
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,520
This is Showa.

52
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,540
But, but...

53
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,040
Wait, wait.

54
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,260
It's black!

55
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,340
It's natto fossils.

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,680
I can't eat this.

57
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Damn, I'm getting even more hungry when I realize I can't eat it.

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,140
I'm hungry and I don't even have a chance to eat.

59
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,100
Mochi, mochi!

60
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,740
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

61
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,120
Don't eat it!

62
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,940
You're a dog, but you're a canazuchi.

63
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,620
Oh, it's Omori-chan.

64
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,280
Hm?

65
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,300
Omori-san, help that dog!

66
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,180
Hm? I'm going to work from now on. I'm late...

67
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,960
Omori-san!

68
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,640
Hm? If I'm late, the boss will...

69
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,480
And I'll be hungry...

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,040
Ah, damn it!

71
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,760
Kids, get out of the way!

72
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,440
Ah!

73
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,560
Ah!

74
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,100
Ah!

75
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,700
Ah!

76
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,880
Ah!

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,480
Ah!

78
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,540
Bad dog!

79
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,760
My bad!

80
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:51,860
Ah, thank God!

81
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,220
Aren't we done for today?

82
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,460
See you again!

83
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,400
Wow, you lost so much.

84
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,100
We lost so much!

85
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,080
Hey, what are you doing?

86
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,340
I've done a good job, but I can't do it again.

87
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,080
I can't do it.

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,640
Hey, hey, you're following me, aren't you?

89
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,520
If you take the stray dog to the country, what will the chief say?

90
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,320
Hey, hey, stop it.

91
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,820
Please stop it.

92
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,100
Good morning, senior.

93
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,540
Chief Ohara, I gave you a alarm clock, but you were angry at me for being late.

94
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,000
I was angry.

95
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,440
Where is the chief?

96
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,080
I went to the chief's meeting.

97
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,820
Oh, I see.

98
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,920
I'm glad.

99
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,980
It's not good.

100
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,260
You're late for ten days in a row today.

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,920
I can't help it.

102
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,760
I'm on my way today.

103
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,500
Well, I'm here.

104
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,320
I saved this stray dog because it was drowning in the river.

105
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,120
So that's why you're so affectionate.

106
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,460
Well, yeah.

107
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
Isn't it a cute puppy?

108
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:13,980
Do you want to eat a biscuit?

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,720
Eat it.

110
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,480
Give it to me.

111
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,440
It's gone.

112
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,160
You were hungry.

113
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,220
I ate the whole box.

114
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,920
You're so strong.

115
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,240
I haven't eaten anything since this morning.

116
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,380
If I have breakfast, I'll go on a patrol.

117
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,080
So, can you lend me a thousand yen?

118
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,740
He he he.

119
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,240
I borrowed 1,000 yen from Reiko.

120
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,540
Now I have a beef bowl, rice bowl, miso soup, eggs and a butt.

121
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,600
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

122
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,160
I went too far.

123
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,660
I'm not careful.

124
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,020
Hey!

125
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
I borrowed 1,000 yen from Reiko!

126
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,420
I found it!

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,360
Hey, wait!

128
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
How far are you flying?

129
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,980
Fly and get it!

130
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,360
On top of the building.

131
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,780
Wait there.

132
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,040
I'll go get it now.

133
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,660
My precious rice bowl.

134
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,380
Catch it!

135
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,460
Are you licking it?

136
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,140
Wait!

137
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,540
I think I got it!

138
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,980
Damn it!

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,060
I'll let you get away!

140
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,180
Watch my threat!

141
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,180
I did it!

142
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,540
Damn it!

143
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,700
I'll catch anything and everything.

144
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,380
I'll put it in the cauldron!

145
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,720
I won't let you!

146
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,900
What is this?

147
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,020
You can see it.

148
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,160
It's 1,000 yen.

149
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,380
Oh, it's 1,000 yen.

150
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,280
Wow!

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,720
Then I'll get a beef bowl, rice bowl, miso soup and eggs and a butt.

152
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,020
Excuse me, could I have the meal ticket?

153
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,060
Ah, yes, of course.

154
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,740
I'll take care of it if you force it.

155
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,340
Damn it, I can't get in.

156
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,520
What?

157
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,180
Are you okay?

158
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,640
Bakco.

159
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,360
Hm?

160
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:36,980
What?

161
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
I'll borrow the police!

162
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,040
You're going to catch me by bicycle?

163
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,220
What?

164
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,620
You're a thousand years too early to run away from me!

165
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,420
Damn you!

166
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,040
But, wait!

167
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,940
Sorry!

168
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,540
No!

169
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,060
You're not getting away!

170
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,940
You're too slow!

171
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,340
Damn you!

172
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,040
Get out of here!

173
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,740
That was close!

174
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,200
I'm so hungry I can't get any strength in me.

175
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,620
But I think I can get away from this Ryotsu Kankichi!

176
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,220
Ouch!

177
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,460
Alright!

178
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,400
Damn you!

179
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,800
You're too slow!

180
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,140
Damn you!

181
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,100
I can't!

182
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm so hungry I can't move anymore!

183
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,380
You're really good at this, Senpai!

184
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,500
You're really good at this, Senpai!

185
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,400
You're really good at this, Senpai!

186
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,480
I think I can catch the criminal if I'm not hungry.

187
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,160
I found this before the park.

188
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,220
I need to eat something before the park.

189
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,980
I need to eat something before the park.

190
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,900
Senpai,

191
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,960
we have something to do at the library,

192
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,900
so please take us to the office.

193
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,600
Senpai, we have something to do at the library, so please take us to the office.

194
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,120
Yeah.

195
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,100
I can't move a single step.

196
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,340
I can't move a single step.

197
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,300
What?

198
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,660
You're still here?

199
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,440
Are you hungry?

200
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,580
I'm hungry first.

201
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,520
Go over there.

202
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,580
Shut up!

203
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,960
I'm hungry too!

204
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,920
Bite my shoes!

205
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,700
Bite my shoes!

206
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,080
Don't bite me!

207
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,460
What about you,でも,

208
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,080
Ouch.

209
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,300
Ouch.

210
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,320
Ouch.

211
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,660
My legs are on fire!

212
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:51,880
Ouch.

213
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,760
Ouch.

214
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,240
Ouch.

215
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,420
Ouch.

216
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,980
It's much faster than usual.

217
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,620
Didn't you say it was a big rush?

218
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,640
Even so, it's too fast.

219
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,160
Could it be that the customer left it?

220
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,540
It's not that, it's just freshly fried.

221
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,760
It's suspicious that it's not cooked.

222
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,100
Please forgive me.

223
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,340
Even so, it's very thin.

224
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,540
Is there meat in here?

225
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,940
It's in here.

226
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,020
It's a masterpiece when it comes this far.

227
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,480
It looks like it's transparent.

228
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,000
It always looks like this.

229
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,420
Ryo-san, don't tell me you put it on.

230
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,280
It's a bad blow.

231
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,120
If it's money, it's fine.

232
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,260
I don't need a fishing rod.

233
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,080
Take it.

234
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,320
Every time.

235
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,020
What is this?

236
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,580
It's a 1,000 yen bill.

237
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,660
It's a little dirty.

238
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,880
It's dirty?

239
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,040
Is this a bill or something?

240
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,980
Well, wash it clean.

241
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,700
There's no doubt.

242
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If it's not a bill, I won't admit it.

243
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,360
It's okay.

244
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,360
It's a 1,000 yen bill that's true.

245
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,680
Then I can finally eat...

246
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,460
You!

247
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,360
You bastard!

248
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,960
I know, I know, I...

249
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,280
Don't think you can escape alive!

250
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,600
Ryo- шооо.

251
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,320
No, never.

252
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,400
I'm hungry and my eyes are blurry.

253
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,800
Damn it.

254
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,060
If the chief sees this, I don't know what he's going to say.

255
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,860
I don't know what he's going to say.

256
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,620
There was a scene in a movie that I saw a long time ago where I ate shoes.

257
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,320
Maybe I can do it.

258
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,500
Shoes are like beef jerky.

259
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,580
I think if I cook it thoroughly, it will return to the original beef.

260
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,220
It's looking good.

261
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,160
It's starting to look like meat.

262
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,080
This is a roast beef.

263
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,540
I'll have it with soy sauce.

264
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,960
It smells good.

265
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
This looks delicious.

266
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,520
I'll eat.

267
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,280
It's a little hard to cut.

268
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,280
Well, how does it taste?

269
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,880
It's still hard.

270
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,100
It's a little chewy.

271
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,840
But the more I chew, the more it tastes.

272
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,440
It was a solid skin.

273
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,960
Damn it. I'm hungry.

274
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,720
I can't help it.

275
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,480
I'll clean it up to distract myself.

276
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,600
This is pretty good.

277
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,800
I'm hungry one by one.

278
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,440
Excuse me.

279
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,580
I'd like to hear what you have to say.

280
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,760
What is it, Tomichi?

281
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,800
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,640
No, I'll become angry if I'm too hungry.

283
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,280
I'm a normal person.

284
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,500
What a persistent guy.

285
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,780
Can I eat lunch here?

286
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,040
I wonder if I can eat it.

287
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,520
Oh, you're a businesswoman.

288
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,260
I'm busy.

289
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,560
Do it yourself.

290
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,540
Thank you.

291
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,220
I'm glad to eat under the roof.

292
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,660
That's good.

293
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,140
Hey, what are you doing?

294
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,900
I'm sure you can tell by looking at it.

295
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,100
It's Sukiyaki.

296
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,940
I'm carrying a heavy luggage.

297
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,520
I have to take care of it.

298
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,020
Don't do it in the exhaust.

299
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,700
Oh, are you hungry?

300
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,540
I haven't eaten anything since this morning.

301
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,460
But it looks delicious.

302
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,200
Do you like Sukiyaki?

303
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,220
I like Sukiyaki.

304
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,640
Then look at what you're eating.

305
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,760
What are you doing?

306
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,280
This is one serving.

307
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,760
I'm hungry.

308
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,360
I'm hungry.

309
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,500
I'm tired of it.

310
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,100
I'm tired of feeding the扇

311
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,580
of my chest being arant.

312
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:56,060
I got a bad stomachache.

313
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,060
You want to try a bite of this meat?

314
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,440
I have a bad stomachache again.

315
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,540
I'm going to eat meat.

316
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,740
How do I eat it?

317
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,920
How do I eat meat?

318
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,540
You bastard! I won't forgive you anymore!

319
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,780
Get out of the way!

320
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,860
It's all your fault for thinking like that!

321
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,600
Get out of the way!

322
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,980
What is it?

323
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,240
20 servings of jumbo omurice.

324
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,780
If you eat it in 20 minutes, you'll get a 5,000 yen reward!

325
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,840
You're so generous, Lago!

326
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,640
I can eat 20 servings of jumbo omurice in 5 minutes if I want!

327
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,080
Doesn't it look delicious?

328
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,400
If you eat it in 20 minutes, you'll get a 5,000 yen reward.

329
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,620
I don't care! I'll eat it in 5 minutes if you want!

330
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,300
You're kidding!

331
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,380
I don't care! Just let me eat it!

332
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,120
I understand.

333
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,260
Alright.

334
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,240
I'll eat it!

335
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:09,980
You're so mean!

336
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,700
Hey, you're not even starting yet?

337
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,700
You're not even getting there.

338
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm being mean, sir!

339
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,620
Now, at a time like this...

340
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,960
I got it! You just have to eat it!

341
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,680
Pick it up! The omurice!

342
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Which one is it?

343
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,220
Over there!

344
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,920
That's...

345
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,660
That's him again!

346
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,840
Wait!

347
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,500
It's that policeman again!

348
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
Darn it!

349
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,060
No, no, no, no!

350
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,020
My eyes are getting blurry!

351
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,760
What? What? Did you follow me?

352
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,320
Jumbo omurice!

353
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,220
Alright! Hold on tight so you don't get thrown away!

354
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,340
Hold on tight so you don't get thrown away!

355
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:05,780
Hold on tight so you don't get thrown away!

356
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,540
Is it just a fun livin up there?

357
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,500
Isn't this a pizza restaurant?

358
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,840
Hey, what's going on?

359
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,260
Hey, what's going on?

360
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,220
Jumbo Omurice!

361
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,780
Hey!

362
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,200
Pizzazo!

363
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,400
Where'd you get that!

364
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,840
I knew you were gonna get hit by a pizza!

365
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,580
command!

366
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,200
Commander Jumbo Omurice!

367
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,760
Commander Jumbo Mirage!

368
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,180
Damn it!

369
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,160
You bastard!

370
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,700
Get ready for this!

371
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,100
I can't do this. My stomach...

372
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,180
I can't get my strength back.

373
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,720
Omelette rice!

374
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,480
Omelette rice!

375
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,560
Omelette rice!

376
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,120
Dad, the problem is solved!

377
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,260
Let me eat omelette rice!

378
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,000
But, the customer's omelette rice is...

379
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,580
What?

380
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,360
Then, make it again!

381
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,080
But, the one he gave me is gone.

382
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,360
My omelette rice...

383
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,000
I can't do this. I can't do this anymore.

384
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,280
My strength is gone.

385
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:41,780
Oh!

386
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,260
Oh!

387
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,620
What's going on?

388
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,040
How much trouble do you have to cause trouble to people?

389
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,240
I'll make a house for the old lady at the business school!

390
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,100
I'll make a mess of the kitchen!

391
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,840
I'll bring the stray dogs into the kitchen!

392
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,380
It's really pathetic!

393
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,780
Chief Ohara!

394
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,740
Chief Ohara!

395
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,220
I know my place is a mess but I'll change it!

396
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,360
What?

397
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,060
Entertaining!

398
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,680
Not all dogs are happy in the world.

399
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:26,720
So, how about we work together?

400
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,300
I see.

401
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,260
What are you doing?

402
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,900
Does she know why you're here?

403
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,800
I don't know...

404
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,360
Braggart.

405
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:33,500
She's aware she's a drugľr!

406
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,440
What about it?

407
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,340
This smell is cake.

408
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,760
Eat.

409
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,940
Give it to me.

410
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,680
Give it to me.

411
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,840
Thank you for the meal.

412
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,740
Senior.

413
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,180
He's eating while crying.

414
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,900
It doesn't matter if the other adult doesn't cry because of the cake.

415
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,100
The boss doesn't understand my feelings.

416
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,940
This is my cake.

417
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,020
I'm not going to give you my strawberry cake.

418
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,040
You're eating the cake without telling me.

419
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,120
You're eating the cake without telling me.

420
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,660
You didn't eat anything because of me.

421
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,860
Give me that much.

422
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,380
Give me that much.

423
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,400
After this, Hard Boiled Deka came back.

424
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,240
Hard Boiled Deka

425
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,380
Hard Boiled Deka

426
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,140
It's Kamaro.

427
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,600
Is he in here?

428
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,420
It's Hoshi from the capital.

429
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,640
People call me Hard Boiled Deka.

430
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,320
You're Hoshi, of course.

431
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,840
All right, everyone.

432
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,340
Let's go to the scene.

433
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,360
It's Hard Boiled Deka.

434
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,500
What's this work?

435
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,880
This is like a daily comedy anime.

436
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,160
I can't show my Hard Boiled charm enough.

437
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,660
It started again.

438
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,000
This background is NG.

439
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,860
Change.

440
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,900
This is a background that suits Hard Boiled.

441
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,680
Next.

442
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,820
You guys have to be more realistic.

443
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,220
You have to be realistic.

444
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,460
Use the from here.

445
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:34,940
She becomes realistic.

446
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,180
This is not real.

447
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,120
Where is she?

448
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,760
It's real.

449
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,040
I've beenut they told me.

450
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,980
This is an amazing opportunity.

451
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,260
Hard Boiled Deka

452
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,440
This is How I look realistic.

453
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,860
My time is up.

454
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,020
Why don't you say something?

455
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,060
I'll show you what you're capable of.

456
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,160
It's too much.

457
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,180
We have a good opportunity to do this.

458
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,680
With the three of us.

459
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,520
Alright, then let's start the Hard Boiled Dekka scene, take 2.

460
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,960
Ready, start!

461
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:16,040
It's Kamalo!

462
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,820
Could it be that...

463
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,320
I'm Hoshida, from the main office.

464
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,520
People call me the Hard Boiled Dekka.

465
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,940
Why is it suddenly over?

466
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,440
It just started!

467
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,960
What's going on, Director Takamatsu?!

468
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,220
Sorry,

469
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,800
the broadcast time is...

470
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,260
I'm running out of time,

471
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,540
so I just asked you to come and adjust the time.

472
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,980
What?!

473
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,840
You can go home now.

474
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,980
No way...

475
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,460
What's going on?

476
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,560
My place to show up is...

477
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,640
Damn it!

478
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,040
I'm definitely going to show up again!

479
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:27,240
Hey, I can't do this anymore...

480
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,300
I need to help him, Hoshida-san.

481
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,460
Okay, I'll go and get him too.

482
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,400
The cast and crew are all here,

483
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,540
a new guest.

484
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:33,680
I can get away-

485
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,920
I can get away-

486
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,620
I'm not a bad person

487
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,980
Don't be so indifferent

488
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,760
Even if you lie and cheat a little

489
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,720
Sometimes you're helping someone

490
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,540
Baby do you know me?

491
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,460
I'm heading for tomorrow

492
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,820
Nice breath of my heart

493
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,540
Don't get sick

494
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,840
I'll do what I have to do

495
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,280
A cute breath of my heart

496
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,240
What's hard to understand

497
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,540
I want to show you

498
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,840
It's better than seeing it again

499
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:30,780
Good morning, Ryo-tsuku

500
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,900
Well, this time it's your mission

501
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,000
To find the police office

502
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,220
The model of this 50 tower ordered from the police

503
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,540
It will be completed by the deadline

504
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,180
This trailer will be automatically eliminated

505
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,660
Next time

506
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,640
The secret command

507
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,620
Mission in 50 towers

508
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,860
I wish you success

509
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,840
There is a turtle there

510
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,840
There must be a turtle

511
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,820
Everyone come to our town

512
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,880
Thank you
