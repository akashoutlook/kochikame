1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,160
"The Greatest"

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:03,700
"The Greatest"

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,760
"The Greatest"

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,240
"The Greatest"

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,820
"The Greatest"

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,340
"The Greatest"

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,720
"The Greatest"

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,320
"The Greatest"

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,440
"The Greatest"

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,020
"The Greatest"

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:28,760
"The Greatest"

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,420
"The Greatest"

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,240
"The Greatest"

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,040
"The Greatest"

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,960
"The Greatest"

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,080
"The Greatest"

17
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:37,680
"The Greatest"

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,520
"The Greatest"

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,360
"The Greatest"

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,640
"The Greatest"

21
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,620
"The Greatest"

22
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,440
"The Greatest"

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,580
"The Greatest"

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,020
From a bottle, to a Freedom Check

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,000
The sunset goes down

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,880
Tomorrow will also end some day

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,240
But I'm still so happy

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:20,080
I'm just me who gave up, and I realized

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,520
Huh?

30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,500
I can't drink anymore.

31
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,960
I want to work for you.

32
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,600
Don't make such a loud noise.

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,860
It's been a long time since I've had a bad day.

34
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,560
Me too.

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,540
Why am I sleeping here?

36
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,220
I don't know.

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,820
One more time.

38
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,420
Good.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,260
I remember the 5th Izakaya.

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,960
I don't remember the 3rd one.

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,620
Where is my senior?

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,080
Senior.

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,340
Excuse me.

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,800
What?

45
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,560
You're great.

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,600
Did you go to work already?

47
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,300
Ryo Hananoko.

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,000
What?

49
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,400
Do you like my face?

50
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,180
Yes.

51
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,960
It's funny.

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,300
I see.

53
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,720
What's wrong?

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,320
Oh, Mr. Maori.

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,100
Yes.

56
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,180
Yes.

57
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,280
That's right.

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,040
This is your job.

59
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you for your hard work.

60
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,660
Oh.

61
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,960
Everyone, say bye-bye to Mr. Maori.

62
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,120
Bye-bye.

63
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,640
Bye.

64
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,140
Bye.

65
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,980
Today seems to be a good day.

66
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,680
Yes.

67
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,380
Thank you.

68
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,260
Thank you.

69
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,500
Thank you.

70
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,400
Thank you.

71
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,100
Thank you.

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
Thank you.

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,160
Next time is kindergarten, to my grandparents, to his aunt and grandpa.

74
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,280
Ryo is very popular, it looks so great.

75
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,580
I guess saben…

76
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,980
What's on your mind?

77
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,900
Congratulations.

78
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,520
What are you doing?

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,220
Is this a punishment game?

80
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,020
Sometimes, our faces don't suit each other, that's great.

81
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,840
Hey.

82
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,780
Why are you yelling in here?

83
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,740
Well, I feel like...

84
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,260
I'm wondering what you are up to.

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,460
Yes.

86
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:51,820
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,540
What?

88
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm going to submit my final statement by the end of this afternoon.

89
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,840
I'll tell the chief, "Well, it's hot, so give me tea."

90
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,580
I think it's better to give him some water than tea.

91
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,160
I guess so.

92
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,320
Huh?

93
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,640
Wow, what a beautiful flower!

94
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,220
Ah!

95
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,380
It's cold!

96
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,760
What are you doing, Reiko?

97
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,440
Oh, no, it was Ryo-chan.

98
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,880
I can't see the top!

99
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,940
But, it's on Ryo-chan's head...

100
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:25,800
Head?

101
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,080
Hmm?

102
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:27,920
Huh?

103
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,400
Flower?

104
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,780
Hmm?

105
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,360
Huh?

106
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:33,900
Huh?

107
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,320
Huh?

108
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:34,560
Huh?

109
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,180
There's a flower on my head!

110
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,480
So he didn't notice.

111
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,260
Now then, at the Showa Memorial Park, the flowers of the cosmos are in full bloom.

112
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,760
If you take a look at these flowers...

113
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,680
I think the person who went wrong will laugh at me.

114
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,300
I think the person who went wrong will laugh at me.

115
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,720
This flower is firmly rooted in your head.

116
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,220
It's really rare.

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,060
Rather, I've never seen someone who has a real flower blooming in his head.

118
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,340
Ugh, my head is so dizzy!

119
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,760
What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

120
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,760
Why are you pulling it out?

121
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,440
You've been burning it for a long time, so you've got a flower on your head.

122
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,880
It's disgusting to see it outside!

123
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,460
Ah!

124
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,980
It's fine, right?

125
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,780
Even if you don't pull it out.

126
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,840
That's right.

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,120
It's so pretty, but it's a waste.

128
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,660
It's so pretty, but it's a waste.

129
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,540
It's so pretty, but it's a waste.

130
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,740
It's surprisingly good-looking, Ryo-san.

131
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,680
You're kidding me!

132
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,240
If a boy put a flower in his head, it's over!

133
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,760
Is that so?

134
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,200
What?

135
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,400
What's wrong with having flowers?

136
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,900
Isn't it cute?

137
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,540
Cute?

138
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,960
Can I ask a policeman like this for help?

139
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,620
The policeman with the flowers wants the citizens to help him!

140
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,940
I'll guide you.

141
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,300
Me too.

142
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,740
Me too.

143
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,520
So that's not what I mean.

144
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
So that's not what I mean.

145
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,420
But you don't usually guide people, do you?

146
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,140
Where is the post office?

147
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,360
The post office?

148
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,320
Ask the post office.

149
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,320
What?

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,080
Ryo-san!

151
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,980
Ryo-san!

152
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,920
So at this time, it doesn't matter how you guide people!

153
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,160
It doesn't matter!

154
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,620
That's right.

155
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,480
By the way, let me tell you this.

156
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,080
The main task of the police at the police station is to guide people, organize traffic, and...

157
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,480
That's nonsense!

158
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:17,860
That's nonsense!

159
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,240
I know it!

160
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,100
The theme of the day is, "What is my head flower in today's world?"

161
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,440
What kind of flower is this?

162
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,880
Reiko, do you know?

163
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,460
It's not a tulip, it's not a gable, and it's a flower you've never seen, right?

164
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,200
What kind of flower is it? I don't care.

165
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,140
But it smells really good.

166
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,040
It's true.

167
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,040
A memory.

168
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,980
Hey, don't just pass it by.

169
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm...

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,660
Can I take it?

171
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,860
Yes, cheese!

172
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,700
Hey, hey! If you want to take them, give me 100 yen each!

173
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,380
But why are there flowers on your head?

174
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,700
Don't you have any around here?

175
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,300
I don't have any!

176
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,740
Oh, by the way, I haven't taken a bath for two weeks.

177
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,560
Ryo-chan, you're here!

178
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,440
Maybe it was because of the blood.

179
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,700
This skin...

180
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,580
Ouch!

181
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,560
He really put his eyes on my head!

182
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,660
Damn, I almost passed out!

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,220
Look, this flower is already wilted.

184
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,020
It's because I couldn't get the nutrients from Ryo-san.

185
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,820
Poor thing.

186
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,480
Don't look at me with such an angry look!

187
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,140
Anyway, let's take a picture of this flower.

188
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,460
Let's try it.

189
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,520
I'll send it to the plant research facility in Nakagawa-Bussan and let it investigate.

190
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,980
Damn, thanks to that flower, I've passed the time I promised.

191
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,860
I wonder if he's angry.

192
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,300
Why are you all looking at me?

193
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,540
What's that?

194
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,200
No, it's like an idiot.

195
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,900
What?

196
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,060
No way!

197
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,680
I found it again!

198
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,060
What are you wearing, you primitive?

199
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,160
It's a little cute.

200
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,000
Where?

201
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,400
I just took it out, and now it's growing again. What the hell did I do?

202
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,160
I'm sure the deadline was today, Ryo-san.

203
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,140
Chief!

204
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,060
What are you up to?

205
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,340
I just came back from writing the deadline, Chief.

206
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,160
I was wondering what was that bamboo stick-like leaf on your head?

207
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,600
You're asking me what it is.

208
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,220
It means, I mean...

209
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,640
You're trying to make me lose my temper by writing the deadline, right?

210
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,800
No, I'm not, Chief!

211
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,240
Are you going toagus a case of Katsushika?

212
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,620
I grabbed it without permission to even smell it, and now it's solve with something like a bamboo stick!

213
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,040
I don't think so, you idiot!

214
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,600
How much are you going to make me angry, or are you gonna go mad?

215
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,980
No way, master, I'll just have to be disappear from your mind.

216
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,460
A flower!

217
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,460
What?

218
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
-The flower is blooming! -Ouch!

219
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,980
I told you! It's really growing! The flower is from its head!

220
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,560
-The flower is from its head? -And it won't come out! The flower is from its head!

221
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,800
-Amazing! -Amazing!

222
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,980
It's really growing. It's so weird.

223
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,820
-You idiot! -Why?

224
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,300
Because you're drooling, the flowers are blooming. Get a grip!

225
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,820
-You're so annoying! -Okay, do something about it by tomorrow.

226
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,700
Okay!

227
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,360
Let's go!

228
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,600
-Oh! -The needle doesn't work.

229
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,360
It came out easily this morning, but it's getting stronger and stronger.

230
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,660
-It's so weird. -Shut up!

231
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,320
It's because you left me behind that the flowers are blooming.

232
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,160
Take responsibility!

233
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,560
I'll take responsibility!

234
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:17,620
-I'm a little hurt. -It's okay. Do it.

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,460
Okay.

236
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,380
What's wrong?

237
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,040
Next, next!

238
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,020
-Arab? -Arab?

239
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,400
Yes!

240
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,580
-We got it! -We did it, confirmed.

241
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,800
Really? Did we?

242
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,300
Once again?

243
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,920
-It was fruit. -What?

244
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,900
Let's not give it a hard time after all!

245
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,520
All right.

246
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:03,840
Alright!

247
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,140
Let's go, Mr. Ryozu!

248
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,960
Alright, Honda! Do it with all your heart!

249
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,200
Support me with all you got!

250
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,060
Alright!

251
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,020
Ride on!

252
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:33,840
Let's go!

253
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,140
Take this!

254
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,480
Come on, come on!

255
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,140
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

256
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,020
Move, move, move!

257
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,140
I'll crush you!

258
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,100
Did you get through, Mr. Ryozu?

259
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,300
Just a little pain and I'm not going through!

260
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,360
I'll do it!

261
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,020
Let me go!

262
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,520
This is the flower that Mr. Nagagawa contacted me about this morning.

263
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,280
This is the ancient flower that was supposed to be extinct!

264
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,340
André the Giant Amigo Yamato!

265
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,340
Take a look.

266
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,280
It's the same Ryozu Kankichi as before.

267
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:59,700
Hmm, I guess I'll just have to live with this guy for a while.

268
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,820
Hmm?

269
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:01,600
Huh?

270
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:01,820
Ah!

271
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,880
It's a bee!

272
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,260
That's dangerous, that's dangerous!

273
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,960
Ah!

274
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,500
What's wrong?!

275
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,420
Damn it!

276
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,380
I got caught by the sweet scent of this flower!

277
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,580
Damn it!

278
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,700
You stubborn bee!

279
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,900
You're still chasing me!

280
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,520
If this happens...

281
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,600
Uwaaah!

282
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,860
Grrrrrrr--!

283
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:32,960
Huh?!

284
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,300
Huh?

285
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,380
Man!

286
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,540
What is it?!

287
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,280
Uwaaah!

288
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,200
Hwaah!

289
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,360
Hwaaaaaaa!

290
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,920
Hwaaaah!

291
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,500
What are you doing?!

292
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,920
Just like that, the bees blew away!

293
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,100
Hwaaaah!

294
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,200
What--what?!

295
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,120
W-what are you doing?

296
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,020
Hwaaaaah!

297
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,160
Oww!

298
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:53,460
What are you doing?!

299
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,660
Don't make yourself plastic!

300
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,400
Hey!

301
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,860
You've seen it before!

302
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,940
I've seen it, too!

303
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,860
Hwahhhh!

304
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,960
Dr. Serizawa

305
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,860
My name is Dr. Serizawa.

306
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,060
I have thoroughly investigated your body and head.

307
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,140
And the surprising fact has been revealed.

308
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,760
Ah! I remember!

309
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,460
The fake doctor who has investigated my body!

310
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,000
Fake?

311
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,420
That's enough.

312
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,180
It will be a problem if it is damaged by a precious flower.

313
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,060
Flower? Is this the flower you want?

314
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,400
Fine! I don't need it.

315
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,920
Please pull it out quickly!

316
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,780
I can't do that.

317
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,340
Why?

318
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,500
This is your skull and brain.

319
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,080
As you can see, the root of the flower is wrapped around.

320
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,120
I see.

321
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,640
Eh?

322
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,620
If you pull out the flower, the brain will surely be removed.

323
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,320
No, no, no! I don't want the brain!

324
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,480
Well, that's right. So I can't pull it out.

325
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,640
Why do I have such a bad eye?

326
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,940
That's the problem.

327
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,200
This is the fossil of the flower that was in use about 550,000 years ago and the fossil of the flower that was in use at that time.

328
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,520
Liar. There is such a solid fossil in such an old time.

329
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,200
Oops, there are still...

330
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,280
Sh*t!

331
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,020
Various of them, I guess.

332
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,040
This is a very accurate model that has been reproduced with detailed data of a small amount of fossil.

333
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,760
Huh? I am me?

334
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,380
Yes.

335
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,660
It has the ingredients of the flower

336
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,500
It's really a miracle.

337
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
There is nothing else to say.

338
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,680
It's just a disaster for me.

339
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,960
You have a duty to preserve the flowers, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

340
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,880
Wake up early, take a walk in the afternoon, eat light natural food, and don't drink alcohol?

341
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,400
What the hell is this?

342
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,900
From now on, you will be able to think about the health and safety of the flowers and take a thorough approach.

343
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,460
You will be able to think about the health and safety of the flowers and take a thorough approach.

344
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,520
I'm not kidding!

345
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,720
Why are you doing this for the sake of the flowers that I don't know?!

346
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,100
You have no right to choose.

347
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,620
This project is already a national project, Ryo-tsu.

348
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,180
So this is the flower that was here 550,000 years ago, Ohara-kun.

349
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,880
Yes, it seems so.

350
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,540
I'm glad I didn't have to pull it out.

351
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,000
Well then, from today on, you will be the guardian of this flower.

352
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,200
Hey, Chief, this one is stiffer than me, so you can leave it alone.

353
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,880
Ryo-tsu!

354
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,640
This is an order from the Minister of the Police, Jikijiki.

355
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,320
The Minister of the Police?

356
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,260
Please take care of it, Ohara-kun.

357
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:09,920
Yes!

358
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,640
Excuse me.

359
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,640
It's unfair.

360
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,020
I can't take care of it alone.

361
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,280
If you push it while I'm away, the Chiefs will get angry with me.

362
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,200
What did you say?

363
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,700
If this happens, we should get rid of it before it gets discovered.

364
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,800
Don't be silly.

365
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,660
I'm protecting this flower because I think that you've taken care of the important guest.

366
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,360
Don't say that!

367
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:39,420
Yes, I will give you a week's refreshment for the important guest.

368
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,700
If you go to Minami Island and give it to the important guest, I think you will be happy.

369
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,640
No.

370
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,440
Why?

371
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:47,800
Why?

372
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,180
If you let go, you won't do anything good.

373
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,160
You're just playing games and playing prams in your room,

374
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,580
and you're living a life of a slacker who's going to turn the tables.

375
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,300
It's more obvious than seeing the fire.

376
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,880
To live a regular life,

377
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,920
the best thing is to continue working as a police officer.

378
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,120
Instead of a vacation, you won't be off today.

379
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,540
Huh?

380
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,560
You're the worst.

381
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,240
It's okay, Ryo-chan.

382
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,100
You're still in a daze.

383
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,620
I'm hungry.

384
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,360
I'm hungry.

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,640
I've taken all your fun away.

386
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,640
I don't need your fun.

387
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,880
So let me eat.

388
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,200
A little pickled radish and miso soup.

389
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,160
It's hard for Ryo-san, who's always on a diet,

390
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,320
but vegetarianism is good for your health.

391
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,840
I'm hungry.

392
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:40,620
I'm starving.

393
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,020
I'm starving.

394
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,920
I'm starving.

395
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,320
I'm starving.

396
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,820
The flowers will rot too.

397
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,720
Is that okay, Ryo?

398
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,520
Ryo-chan may be disappointed,

399
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,640
but the flowers are in great condition.

400
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,040
You've done your job well, Senpai.

401
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,240
You're to blame.

402
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,520
You're the one to blame.

403
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,520
I'm living on rubble because of you.

404
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,040
I'm hungry.

405
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,740
I want to eat something rich.

406
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,960
I want to eat something fatty.

407
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,580
And give my stomach a massage.

408
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,780
Right in front of the park.

409
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,460
A Chinese restaurant in front of the station?

410
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,800
Chinese food?

411
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,820
Chinese food!

412
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:29,120
A car with a fine of 3 million yen!

413
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,820
Hurry up!

414
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,860
Hurry up!

415
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,740
Is it dangerous? Please step back!

416
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,340
If you don't want to get hurt, step back!

417
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:38,520
Wait!

418
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,960
What's the situation? Did you find out who the culprit is?

419
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,280
The culprit is a former employee of this restaurant.

420
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,940
All other employees and customers are evacuated.

421
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,560
Okay. We'll make sure the culprit doesn't notice us and dispatch an emergency.

422
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,400
Yes!

423
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,240
That's Ryo-tsu, isn't it, Ohara?

424
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,860
It's me, Ryo-tsu!

425
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,180
Ryo-tsu! Don't be hasty!

426
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,400
What happened to the bomb case?

427
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,940
What are you going to do if something happens to the weird flower?

428
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,860
It's not a Chinese dish, it's not a Chinese restaurant of the host!

429
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,800
I'm going to kill myself!

430
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,700
The chicken duck is calling for help!

431
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,800
Ryo-tsu! Ryo-tsu!

432
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,620
It's him!

433
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,060
If we don't hurry up, the host's life will be in danger!

434
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,020
Hurry up!

435
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,380
Help me!

436
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,340
The smell of the aroma is like a firework!

437
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,220
I'm going to die!

438
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,640
I'm going to die!

439
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,280
I'm going to die!

440
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,340
I'm going to die!

441
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,020
What? What?

442
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,120
What is it?

443
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,700
The flower moved! The flower over there just now...

444
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,300
Flower?

445
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,080
The flower is moving! The flower!

446
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,780
The flower?

447
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,520
That's strange...

448
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,260
Are you sleeping, you idiot?

449
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,420
The flower is dying and the energy is running out...

450
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,780
Senpai! Ryo-san!

451
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,740
It hurts!

452
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,760
See? It's moving after all!

453
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,360
Brother!

454
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:30,960
What?

455
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,900
Nothing is moving.

456
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,580
Are you okay?

457
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,480
What?

458
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,400
Hmm...

459
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,120
That's the smell of fire.

460
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,160
An iron-capped man?

461
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,040
There it is!

462
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,420
Wah! My Chinese food is...

463
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,240
See, Brother!

464
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,200
The flower's moving, after all!

465
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,000
Brother!

466
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,100
The flower is moving, after all!

467
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,820
Brother!

468
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,540
What if something happened to the flower?

469
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,240
Then what was you going to do?

470
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,580
When that time comes, I'll take responsibility.

471
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,700
The rest will be up to you, Ohara.

472
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:19,480
Son of a gun!

473
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,380
You're not getting no union!

474
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,940
If you do, Gyoza!

475
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,600
Come in!

476
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:25,720
Enter!

477
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
Ryosu!

478
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,420
Ryosu, where did you go?

479
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,840
My meat...

480
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,040
My shumai...

481
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,060
Left herring!

482
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,320
Rei!

483
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:15,240
I knew it!

484
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,560
You imbecile!

485
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,860
To Be Continued

486
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:31,000
Ryouto-san...

487
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,520
May I help you?

488
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,000
