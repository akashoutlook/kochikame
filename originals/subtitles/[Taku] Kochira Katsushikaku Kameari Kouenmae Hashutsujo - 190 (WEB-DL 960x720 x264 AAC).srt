ZUKI Creator

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,600
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,840
Light up the room and try to get away

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:25,220
It's after the rain like someone is calling

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,780
I walked back and forth

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,140
My mom pulled my hand

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,300
I felt a strange feeling at that time

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,920
So I walked through the red and black tiles

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,600
I saw

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,280
Everyone was a child once

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,340
But

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
Everyone has forgotten

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,240
Politicians with a big face

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,780
And a blue aunt above their eyes

15
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,460
Turn around and look

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,220
At that corner

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,800
You can meet everyone

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,080
There is a turtle

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,340
There must be a turtle

20
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,760
There must be a turtle

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone come to our town

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,680
Thank you!

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,400
"Ton Demo Body Jack"

24
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,520
How is it, Nakagawa?

25
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,860
Do you want to go home?

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,300
I'm sorry to bother you, but today I'm going to have a little...

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,860
What?

28
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,760
I have a dinner appointment with Cameron Roberts.

29
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,960
I'm going to come to the movie I made just now.

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,620
Oh, You mean Hollywood's most popular actress?

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,820
Yes

32
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,860
I envy you

33
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,260
I'm very worried about her

34
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,460
I was at her home party last year

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,680
She is very kind

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,240
I see

37
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,660
I'm talking about Reiko

38
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,880
It's amazing

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,740
You two

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,220
You know each other with a world-renowned person

41
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,840
I'll tell everyone when I get home!

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,200
I met her at her home party last year.

43
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,060
She's a very kind person.

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,060
Is that so?

45
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,680
Then I'll take care of Reiko-san.

46
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,020
That's amazing!

47
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,820
I'm so happy that you two are friends with a world-famous person!

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,640
What?

49
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,580
Don't mess with me, bastard!

50
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,180
I'll meet the famous Hollywood actress,

51
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,380
and the father of a grilled chicken restaurant.

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,420
Don't say that, Ryo-san.

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,240
They're born rich.

54
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,940
Their efforts have nothing to do with it.

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,400
There's no such thing as unfairness in the world!

56
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, well.

57
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,420
I'll change the head of the branch to me.

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,020
I'll go to the judge's meeting, the congressman's party,

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,760
and have a great dinner with famous people.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
My life will be different from the people's.

61
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,520
I'll get sick of it!

62
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,680
The lead actress, Cameron Roberts.

63
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,760
So this woman is Cameron Roberts.

64
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,780
Body Jack.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,960
Your body may belong to someone else.

66
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,680
Body Jack, huh?

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,620
I'd like to switch bodies with Nakagawa if I could.

68
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,540
I'll take care of my father.

69
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,140
Good night!

70
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,660
Ryo-san's brother, the 13th one!

71
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,900
Where did he climb from?

72
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,960
He couldn't get off.

73
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,500
Ryo-san, it's your turn.

74
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,520
Huh? What do you want me to do?

75
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,680
You can save him.

76
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,100
I'll do my best.

77
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,640
No matter what happens, I'll protect the cat's life.

78
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,360
I'll do my best.

79
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,240
Now, I have to make some sacrifices.

80
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,100
Sacrifices?

81
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,520
I'll sacrifice for Takaga's cat.

82
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,820
What do you mean?

83
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,160
Cats are more important than you!

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,300
That's right!

85
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,680
You guys are too much!

86
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,620
Calm down!

87
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,120
Calm down!

88
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,220
You're too much!

89
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,200
Captain Ryosu!

90
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,820
Yes, sir!

91
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,200
Yes, sir!

92
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,620
Go to the police station and get out of here!

93
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,460
Yes, sir!

94
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,440
Yes, sir!

95
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,540
Yes, sir!

96
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,040
Yes, sir!

97
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,620
Yes, sir!

98
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,020
Come on!

99
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,100
Yes, sir!

100
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,840
Don't overdo yourself!

101
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,700
Ouch!

102
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,560
Watch out!

103
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,420
Captain!

104
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,760
Takaga!

105
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,640
You can't move!

106
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,900
Someone get an ambulance!

107
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,640
Takaga!

108
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,440
An ambulance!

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,460
It'll be fine!

110
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,580
Yes, sir!

111
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,200
Why am I falling?

112
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,500
Huh?

113
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,100
Huh?

114
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,660
But I'm here.

115
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,340
What nonsense are you saying, Ryozu?

116
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,220
Ryozu?

117
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,720
That's right. Don't say anything weird.

118
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,540
Look at this carefully.

119
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,560
My face is on Senpai's face.

120
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,760
What are you kidding?

121
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,040
I'm not kidding. I'm Nagagawa.

122
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,760
I got shocked when I bumped into Senpai and my body changed.

123
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,740
No way!

124
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,280
That's...

125
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,400
I can't believe it.

126
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,980
But when I saw his behavior...

127
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,960
What's going on?

128
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,340
Do I become Senpai?

129
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,000
Senpai, please be strong.

130
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,640
I just called an ambulance.

131
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,900
The helicopter is faster.

132
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,820
It's me, Keiichi.

133
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,140
My voice is weird?

134
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,500
This is not the time to say that.

135
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,840
I need an ambulance.

136
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,520
Senpai, please be strong.

137
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,760
Chief.

138
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,120
I'm coming with you.

139
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,160
I'm counting on you.

140
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,200
Doesn't he look like a real Nakagawa?

141
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,200
I feel like I've really changed.

142
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,320
Ryozu can't do this.

143
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,520
I can't believe it, but that's Nakagawa.

144
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,520
He's not sick.

145
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,100
His brain wave is normal.

146
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,740
He's not in any trouble.

147
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,220
I didn't even have to tell him that.

148
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,640
But why are you living in a shelter?

149
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,180
Think about it.

150
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,840
He's in my figure.

151
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,220
But he's inside Ryozu Kakuchi's body.

152
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,920
It's Senpai.

153
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,040
If he gets up and finds out that I got my body,

154
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,580
he'll turn against me.

155
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,380
And he'll do something awful.

156
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,500
I see.

157
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,000
Ryozu is the worst.

158
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,060
So, I'm sorry,

159
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,100
but I can only stay here for a while.

160
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,300
Please keep it a secret.

161
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,640
Okay.

162
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,180
What? The president's body has been replaced?

163
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,120
Yes. He's called the "Soul's Evasion Factor" in a professional sense.

164
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,140
There are many witnesses on site.

165
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,480
Besides, he knows a lot about the president's private life.

166
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,700
Then, President, what's the schedule for today?

167
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,860
Ah, today we'll be watching the Heperovsky Palace,

168
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,360
the agricultural lecture and the traditional Japanese culture.

169
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,400
After that, there'll be a dance party at the embassy.

170
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,480
Ah, excuse me.

171
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,000
How can you say such a thing about a schedule that only the president knows?

172
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,760
I'm sure the president knows.

173
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,920
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

174
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,700
If you believe me, it's all right.

175
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,100
Hehehe, we did it! We're finally in Nakagawa!

176
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,780
I'm glad I replaced the electronic notebook in Nakagawa.

177
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,080
But we ran into each other at the right time.

178
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,080
We can't miss this chance.

179
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,700
We can finally live a luxurious life!

180
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,300
We can finally live a luxurious life!

181
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,780
After this...

182
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,540
You're going to do a report on the weekly Kamedasu, right?

183
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,380
Y-Yes.

184
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,580
Noriko-san, you're such a nice person.

185
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,840
No, you're in trouble.

186
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm Keiichi!

187
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,700
Get out of here!

188
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:56,440
I'll go out!

189
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,080
He's saying that again.

190
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,820
I'm saying that again.

191
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,000
Ryozu Kankichi is such a guy.

192
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,540
I'm saying that again.

193
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Hey, why are you locking me up in such a place?

194
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,480
I can't believe this.

195
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,240
Without any clear proof,

196
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,120
I can't accept that you're the president of the company.

197
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
I see...

198
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,320
What do you think, everyone?

199
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,480
I can't believe this.

200
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:16,820
You're so mean!

201
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,000
I can't believe this.

202
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,720
I can't believe this.

203
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,480
OK, I understand.

204
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,520
What do you think?

205
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,840
The professionals on the road will judge you.

206
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,440
The professionals on the road?

207
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,780
There are such people?

208
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:27,840
Yes.

209
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,800
I'm impressed.

210
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,700
I'm impressed.

211
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,280
I'm impressed.

212
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,560
I'm impressed.

213
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,520
Good morning.

214
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,440
Good morning.

215
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,060
You're early, Ryo-chan.

216
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,300
I mean, you're Kei-chan, right?

217
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,980
I don't like it, Reiko-san.

218
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,880
Don't get me wrong.

219
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,960
Oh, that's Ryo-chan's seat.

220
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:45,540
What?

221
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,200
Where have I always been?

222
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,360
You're always doing research there.

223
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,280
Well, I...

224
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,600
Oh, that was like this.

225
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Here, Kei-chan.

226
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,740
Coffee.

227
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,620
Coffee?

228
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,000
Isn't it Japanese tea?

229
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,240
Ryo-chan is the only one who drinks Japanese tea.

230
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:06,920
What?

231
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,580
Well, sometimes I think Japanese tea is good, but...

232
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,500
Good morning.

233
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,780
Good morning.

234
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
Oh, Ryo-chan.

235
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,440
Oh, no, it wasn't.

236
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Nakagawa, is your body all right?

237
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,800
Yes, it's all right.

238
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,960
How about Ryo-chan?

239
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,300
It seems that he had a bad heart.

240
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,180
He was hospitalized in our hospital for a while.

241
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,360
Then, can I visit him once?

242
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,700
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

243
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:36,900
I'm sorry.

244
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:37,980
Excuse me.

245
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,960
What's the matter?

246
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,300
President, I have a favor to ask you.

247
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,160
What is it?

248
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,260
I'd like you to take a test to see if he's the real President.

249
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, all right.

250
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,340
I'm sorry.

251
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,380
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,840
I'm sorry.

253
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,880
I'm sorry.

254
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:56,920
I'm sorry.

255
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,500
I'm sorry.

256
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,640
I'm sorry.

258
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,120
Please don't ask me this.

259
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,440
I'm the one who needs everybody from the north and south to the south.

260
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,880
This time, you'll have to take a test.

261
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,060
Then, Eizaki Korosuke, the genius scientist, will give us its invention!

262
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,300
With this lie detector, we'll know if your body really has a soul.

263
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,040
Oh-oh...

264
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,800
If you get caught by this Masai, you will know for sure if it is real or fake.

265
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,080
Well then, please.

266
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,560
Hm? Gorilla-kun, are you ready?

267
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,100
Um, I am Keiichi Nakagawa.

268
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,240
Just a joke! I am Indonesian joke to release your heart.

269
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,000
Well then, let's start right now!

270
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,260
Let's start right now!

271
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:07,760
Let's start right now!

272
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,820
All questions are answered in less than 2 seconds!

273
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,680
Well then, the first question!

274
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,020
Hm?

275
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,940
What is your favorite snack?

276
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Snack?

277
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,880
The answer is in less than 2 seconds!

278
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,620
What?

279
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,620
It's Monaca! Monaca!

280
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,900
You're so annoying.

281
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,560
Well then, the next question.

282
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,900
I wanted to make a bamboo stick with bamboo sticks, so I made it with bamboo sticks.

283
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:32,920
How is it?

284
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,240
Which one is easier, red-wrapped god, blue-wrapped god, or white-wrapped god?

285
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,580
What is that question?

286
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,900
You're out of 2 seconds.

287
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,780
Nyaa!

288
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:48,320
Red-wrapped god, red-wrapped god, blue-wrapped god, white-wrapped god, blue-wrapped god, red-wrapped god, white-wrapped god, white-wrapped god, white-wrapped god!

289
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:49,860
Hm?

290
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,820
This is a torture.

291
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,080
If you were a cat, where would you like to be?

292
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,580
Engawa!

293
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,220
Punch, perm, or claw? Which one is more manly?

294
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,000
Claw!

295
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,420
Which one do you like more, pro-wrestling or sumo?

296
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:02,900
Which one do you like more, pro-wrestling or sumo?

297
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,380
Claw!

298
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,240
Then, the last question.

299
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,100
Which one is more manly, a dog of Flanders or a dog of Flanders?

300
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,940
A dog of Flanders!

301
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,780
Time's up!

302
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,280
I have the answer.

303
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,840
This person is definitely Keiichi Nakagawa!

304
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,800
This person is definitely Keiichi Nakagawa!

305
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,960
This person is definitely Keiichi Nakagawa!

306
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,300
Why is that?

307
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,800
Many questions have their own answers.

308
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,560
The first question, for example.

309
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
What is your favorite fruit?

310
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,380
The answer is Monaka.

311
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,860
How do you learn this?

312
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,700
Monaka's inside.

313
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,460
Monaka's inside.

314
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,600
And the answer is "Cat"

315
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,780
The side of the circle is the side of the middle

316
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,260
And the favorite one is K1

317
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,600
In other words K1

318
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,920
In other words, he confessed who he was unconsciously

319
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,800
The last answer is the answer of the last question

320
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,660
Flanders dog's pun is Flanders dog

321
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,940
This hypersense is unique to Nakagawa who has lived abroad for a long time

322
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:31,220
Therefore, the contents of the "looking gorilla" in front of me is definitely Nakagawa Keiichi

323
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm impressed, professor

324
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,880
Now I can persuade the staff

325
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,560
Well, it's easy for me

326
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,600
I also thought it was Nakagawa

327
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,280
Me too

328
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,200
Right?

329
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,360
I'm saying Nakagawa Keiichi

330
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,060
He's persistent

331
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,600
I'll give up in the meantime

332
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,140
No, I'm glad I really found out about the president

333
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,020
It's a natural result

334
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,000
Thanks to the stupid professor

335
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,920
I was saved

336
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,020
On the contrary, it's like I got a real house

337
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,360
I want to avoid it

338
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,280
Because there are fivelio thorns in the middle

339
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,160
I have to come this far to get rid of it

340
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,300
I don't think I'll be able to do it

341
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,340
I'm sorry

342
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,300
I'm sorry

343
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,100
I'm sorry

344
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,700
I'm sorry

345
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,280
I can't do it

346
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,640
I'm sorry

347
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,000
I can't do it

348
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,540
I can't do it

349
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,340
The next episode

350
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,080
What did I do?

351
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,580
Why do I have to go through this?

352
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,580
It's finally quiet down.

353
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,400
Finally at ease.

354
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,060
Mr. Chairman...

355
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,760
What's up?

356
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,640
Here's a case that was Happening in Europe and America.

357
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,780
A case?

358
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,780
Yes.

359
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,520
I'm here to give the specific instructions as chairman of the Nakagawa Group...

360
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,360
Huh? Oh...

361
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,140
So it seems like this is the case...

362
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,420
Then keep going ahead and get to the bottom of it.

363
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,660
President! You must see the documents here!

364
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,100
Keep an eye on him.

365
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,800
President! What do you say to this case?

366
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,800
It's something we can discuss casually.

367
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,260
Shut up! If you want, let me be!

368
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:37,880
President!

369
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,820
Wh- what is it?

370
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,780
As you剛剛 said, this is the case.

371
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,840
The dollar and euro are in a big mess.

372
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,680
The world economy is in a mess like it was hit by a tsunami.

373
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,600
Is it something bad?

374
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,520
Of course!

375
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,600
It's a good opportunity, president.

376
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,640
I want to restore the messy life here to the previous form.

377
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,120
What is this?

378
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,740
You always call me in an hour.

379
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,080
Oh, I see.

380
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,160
From now on, I will do as scheduled.

381
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,900
I will do as scheduled.

382
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,420
At 10:00, a meeting in Ginza.

383
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,740
At 11:30, a computer-related inspection in Sendai.

384
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,080
At 1:00, the president of a company with 150 overseas companies will be in Kyoto.

385
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,220
Wait a minute, I want to go shopping.

386
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,860
Unfortunately, there is no time for a second.

387
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,320
Andri Noriette, a bearnaise sauce.

388
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,320
Andriou Yette, red wine flavor, anchovy.

389
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,340
The twilight of a scallop-like Marielle.

390
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,620
A lamb's brain miso.

391
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,660
I see.

392
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,320
I've had enough of your explanation.

393
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,280
Yes.

394
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,620
I want to eat the ramen of the common people once in a while.

395
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,700
That is not part of the schedule.

396
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,120
Please look at the documents carefully.

397
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,200
The market share will rise.

398
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,500
The market share will rise.

399
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:32,200
If I do such a thing, I will be in trouble.

400
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,480
I will be in trouble for a long time.

401
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,840
I want to do it.

402
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,320
I want to do it.

403
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,720
I don't want to do it.

404
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,900
I want to do it.

405
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,100
"It's not easy to do Nakagawa"

406
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,560
"Good morning. I'm Nakagawa"

407
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,320
"Please be careful"

408
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,360
"Please be careful"

409
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,360
"You're so rough"

410
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,020
"No, your body is too short to drive"

411
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,680
"Hey, that's Ryo's seat"

412
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,560
"No, I don't know why, but my body is too big for him"

413
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,600
"Oh, right, Ryo is coming to work today"

414
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,860
"What? Did he quit?"

415
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,760
"He?"

416
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,360
"No, he did"

417
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:32,840
"Yes"

418
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,400
"As Nakagawa said,

419
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,240
he's completely Ryo's"

420
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,900
"What's going on?"

421
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,680
"I stopped the second Kamehameha roll in 30 minutes"

422
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,760
"Are you Ryo?"

423
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,240
"What are you doing to your brother?"

424
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,260
"Sorry, sorry"

425
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,040
"Nakagawa, you've been so mean lately"

426
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,880
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry"

427
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,200
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry"

428
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:05,960
"I'll give you 100,000 yen for the deal"

429
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,140
"Nakagawa, please pay the 100,000 yen"

430
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,720
"Please don't give me money"

431
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,060
"No, I don't have any money"

432
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,120
"I'm not bringing the money"

433
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,340
"I'm sure you have a card"

434
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,060
"I'll lend you money for a few days"

435
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,780
"Hey, Ryo"

436
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,020
"Hey, Ryo?"

437
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,920
"He's there?"

438
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,960
"Please tell him if he's there"

439
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,260
"Damn it, we're only one step away"

440
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,640
"Huh?"

441
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,940
"You guys!"

442
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,780
What are you looking at?

443
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,140
You bastard!

444
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,480
You're so stubborn.

445
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,060
Hey, Ryo-ko! Tea!

446
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,020
Yes!

447
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,640
Today was a very important race.

448
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,160
It's totally me.

449
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,540
There are two of me.

450
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,620
Which means, where did Nakagawa go?

451
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Hey, Ryo-tsu.

452
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,580
Yes?

453
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,260
You're not Ryo-tsu!

454
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,940
I always made Nakagawa look so bad.

455
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,560
I didn't know he was so mean.

456
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,420
You cleaned up Ryo's room, Ryo-tsu.

457
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,580
Yes. I finally woke up.

458
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,140
I threw away all the plums and figures I had collected.

459
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,800
What?

460
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,660
Hey, that's a valuable asset.

461
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,060
It has nothing to do with you.

462
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,800
Shut up!

463
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,060
I'm sorry!

464
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,060
At this time, you should get rid of the video.

465
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,700
That's right.

466
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,740
Wait! Don't give me your advice!

467
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,680
Why are you coming out?

468
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,140
I'm telling you, Ryo-san.

469
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,660
That's why I think it's better not to throw it away.

470
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,820
Hey, Senpai.

471
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,940
It's a waste if you throw it away.

472
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,760
I'm tired of erotic videos.

473
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,140
If you throw it away, give it to me.

474
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,340
What?

475
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,340
Kei-chan?

476
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,820
You're kidding, aren't you?

477
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,760
What should I do?

478
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,340
I should throw it away.

479
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,840
No, Senpai.

480
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,400
Absolutely no!

481
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,780
I'll buy it.

482
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,840
It's a million yen per volume.

483
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,500
No!

484
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,420
I'm a pervert!

485
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,320
Hey, hey.

486
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,040
Please.

487
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,440
I'm asking you to throw it away.

488
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,320
Please, don't do anything to me.

489
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,740
It's really not a big deal.

490
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,240
Please, take it all.

491
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,260
If you can't do it, don't throw it away.

492
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,140
You should have thrown it away.

493
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,300
I thought that it was strange.

494
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,340
So they are fooling me.

495
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,980
Hello everybody.

496
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,060
Nice party.

497
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,460
Professor Ezaki.

498
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,720
Now what?

499
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,420
The new invention of genius scientist,

500
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,520
This is the personality changer.

501
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,300
It's the same shape and shape, but only the personality is changed.

502
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,740
In other words, Gorilla and Nakagawa can be returned to their original form.

503
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,100
I see.

504
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,200
If we can really be replaced with Nakagawa, we can do whatever we want.

505
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,160
That's great, Senpai.

506
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,600
We might be able to return to our original form.

507
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,200
That's right.

508
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,420
You're back, Senpai.

509
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:52,680
I'm a little scared.

510
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,300
It's okay.

511
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,560
Nakagawa! No! No!

512
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,060
I'm so happy.

513
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,440
Now we can go back to our original form.

514
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:02,820
Please, Professor.

515
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,600
Okay. Okay. Karaoke. Switch.

516
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,900
Get out of my way, you idiot!

517
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,640
What's this?

518
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Why am I dressed like this?

519
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,840
My body is there!

520
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,960
Why am I dressed like this?

521
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,160
Oh, it's Nakagawa.

522
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,220
Now he can be released from my cage.

523
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,760
Ryo-chan! It's all your fault!

524
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,140
Senpai, what's wrong with me?

525
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,860
Why are you doing this to me?

526
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,440
You can't be fooled by such a thing!

527
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,480
Professor, can't we do something about this?

528
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,320
No! Don't tell me!

529
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,420
I'm not going to!

530
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,320
Ezaki.

531
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,700
