Ryotsu...

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,100
Hey, Ryotsu!

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,180
Ohana-kun, what's this tea?

30
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,560
I put it back in!

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,220
Ryotsu!

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,700
Hurry up, Ohana-kun!

33
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,660
Ouch!

34
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,620
Who is this bastard?

35
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,840
It's me, idiot!

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,980
R-Retsu...

37
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,360
You look pretty good.

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,640
No, I mean, how about you, chief?

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,000
Idiot! Get back to work now!

40
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,480
I'm so bored.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,260
I should take a nap.

42
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,060
When you're bored, you're peaceful.

43
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,680
Look, the town is full of smiles.

44
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,060
No big deal.

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,240
It's just a normal town.

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,420
See? Even the chief is running well.

47
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,580
Huh?

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,180
What?

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,660
Chief!

50
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,100
Thief! Thief!

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,080
This is the last time!

52
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:54,960
Ahahaha!

53
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,980
What a nice weather!

54
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,360
Yeah.

55
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,940
Did something appear?

56
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,340
Yeah.

57
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,120
Why are there ostriches in the town?

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,760
They won't keep their signal, and they'll hit each other, won't they?

59
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,340
I was destroyed by a waterfall. What should I do?

60
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,600
Anyway, get me out of here now!

61
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,680
I'm sorry. I just gave the order to all the officers to leave the building, so they will be captured soon. Please wait for a while.

62
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,880
So, I order you to capture them as soon as you find the captain. All of you, leave the building.

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,580
Roger!

64
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,680
Here they are! Chase them!

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,000
Wait!

66
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,280
Wait!

67
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,520
Wait!

68
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,120
Damn! What a speed!

69
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,420
The captain runs at maximum speed of 70 km/h.

70
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,260
Tell me that first!

71
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,640
But why is he in such a place?

72
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,100
The captain is an African creature, isn't it?

73
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,880
That's right.

74
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,180
There is no message that the captain has escaped from the zoo or the zoo.

75
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,880
I never heard that a wild captain was in Japan.

76
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,920
What's wrong, Mr. Ryoichi?

77
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,920
Hey, Honda!

78
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,680
I'm in a good place.

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,500
Chase them!

80
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,300
What do you mean?

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,680
Just go!

82
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,900
I don't know what you mean, but let's go!

83
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,040
All right!

84
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,560
What?

85
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,080
Oh, that's...

86
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,880
I found them!

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,180
All right!

88
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,780
It's dangerous!

89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,660
I found them!

90
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,740
All right!

91
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,240
I found them!

92
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,200
I found them!

93
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,600
I found them!

94
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes, I found them!

95
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,980
Yes, I found them!

96
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,020
What?

97
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,100
What?

98
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,760
You did it!

99
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,640
What the hell are you doing?

100
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,320
If you're mad, you better catch me!

101
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,580
You don't have time to tell me!

102
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,540
This is a waste of effort!

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,360
You're being too cocky with the captain's order!

104
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,140
Well, sir, do you understand what the captain is saying?

105
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,420
If you ask me, I feel like I'm saying something like that.

106
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,000
Hey, wait up!

107
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,560
Sir!

108
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,660
You stole again, didn't you?

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,940
I was playing with a man who was as strong as you!

110
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,240
Hey!

111
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,420
Stop!

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,960
Stop!

113
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,660
Damn that bastard!

114
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,980
Where did he go?

115
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,520
That bastard? Is he a male?

116
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,180
Yeah, he said he was a male.

117
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,160
What?

118
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,000
You don't understand?

119
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,780
Yeah, well, that's...

120
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,700
You don't understand?

121
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,060
Yeah, well, that's...

122
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,840
Hey, what's going on here?

123
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,520
It's a secret!

124
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,800
Hey, wait!

125
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,320
I caught the captain!

126
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,000
You're a thief!

127
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,140
You're a thief!

128
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,020
You're a thief!

129
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,180
I'm a police officer!

130
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,660
I'm a police officer!

131
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,180
Damn it! He ran away!

132
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,500
Let's go back and think about our plan.

133
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,500
Get out of here!

134
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,220
Get out of here!

135
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,980
Get out of here!

136
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,020
He's gone too far.

137
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,140
Hey...

138
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,720
I'm asking you again.

139
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,020
It's just him and his body.

140
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,380
Shouldn't have done this.

141
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,840
He's going to take care of it!

142
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,960
Put him in the hospital and come back.

143
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,440
What are you doing?

144
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,900
That'd be necesary.

145
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,240
Hey looks familiar.

146
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,640
He also has an anal organ somewhere.

147
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,160
Yes.

148
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,360
It also contains two parts:

149
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,060
one for the body of a cow...

150
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,320
and one for the head of a pig!

151
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,160
I've never seen a cow before!

152
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,740
I thought he was talking about the head of a pig.

153
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,220
What the hell is this?

154
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,760
You can't tell by looking?

155
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,240
You were appointed as the head of the

156
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,660
"Dachou Strategy Department" in the Katsushika office.

157
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,820
So why me?

158
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,240
Well, when I heard you could speak the word "dachou",

159
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,800
I thought this "dachou" was something

160
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,400
you wouldn't think of.

161
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm looking forward to it.

162
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,700
No way.

163
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,840
You're trying to push me

164
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
into this, aren't you?

165
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,880
Zuboshika!

166
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,440
Anyway, from now on,

167
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,600
you'll be responsible for

168
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,880
taking over the "Dachou" in the future.

169
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,940
Yes.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
Damn it.

171
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,520
All of them are trying to push me into this.

172
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Why me?

173
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,880
I can't stand being called a fool.

174
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,560
Well,

175
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,540
I have a plan.

176
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,600
Do you have any plans?

177
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,560
No.

178
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,840
I don't even know how to catch a "dachou".

179
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,000
Well,

180
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,600
when can I go back to my job?

181
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,980
I see.

182
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,220
What's wrong?

183
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,640
I have an idea.

184
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,880
Senpai, what is this?

185
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,580
In this costume,

186
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,680
I'll catch it with my own hands.

187
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
Can I change the order?

188
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,700
It's huge!

189
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,180
Calm down.

190
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,780
We're sexy "Dachou" now.

191
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:57,980
"Dachou"?

192
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,460
Good boy.

193
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,400
Darling,

194
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,320
come here.

195
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,380
What?

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,520
We must make a proposal for a date.

197
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,360
Hey!

198
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,340
Makes you happy?

199
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,180
Yes, there is.

200
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,520
Yes, there is.

201
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,200
You're the real "Dachou" I.

202
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:20,960
That's right.

203
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,840
What's with the clut?

204
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,660
I meet you for the first time.

205
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:22,720
Good boy,

206
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,340
as good a man as I am,

207
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,000
I always like the girls.

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,160
You're my ideal type.

209
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,320
I only have one man,

210
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,580
someone else.

211
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,560
So,

212
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,860
only me.

213
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,620
And you?

214
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:29,920
Yes, you.

215
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,400
What are you doing running away?

216
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,380
What are you doing running away?

217
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,260
You're being proposed by a long time.

218
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,360
You're proposing to give me my eggs.

219
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,900
You're going to bury me!

220
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,780
Did you catch Ryotsu soon?

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,760
I hope so.

222
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,240
Ryotsu!

223
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,140
That's cool.

224
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,560
Ryotsu!

225
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:56,880
Chief!

226
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,360
Chief!

227
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,560
I'm scared...

228
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,160
You're a happy family.

229
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,960
Why do you want kids to be lucky enough to play soccer?

230
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,040
You're forcing your children to play soccer.

231
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,560
Don't come.

232
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,080
Ugh...

233
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,280
Huh?

234
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,680
Huh?

235
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,580
Huh?

236
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,320
Ahhhhhhh!

237
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,020
Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!

238
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,960
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

239
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,680
Senpai, are you okay?

240
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:56,800
Are you okay?

241
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,960
I'm saved!

242
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,280
I see.

243
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,800
I see. So that's what happened.

244
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,120
What are you talking about?

245
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,780
Apparently, this guy lived near Mizuboto Park.

246
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,780
The place where the egg returned was Mizuboto Park, so it means he was there all along.

247
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,680
Why would a ostrich egg live in such a place?

248
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,760
Not really.

249
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,300
Maybe...

250
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,340
Maybe someone dropped it while it was being brought to the zoo.

251
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,500
Or maybe someone threw it away.

252
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,100
I feel sorry for him.

253
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,580
In such a small town, with just one egg...

254
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,920
Ugh, you're making me cry.

255
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,700
Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!

256
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,780
What?!

257
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,200
Not just one egg?!

258
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,320
Nyah!

259
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,740
Huh?

260
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,860
Nyah!

261
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,880
Nyah!

262
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,500
Nyah!

263
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,340
Nyah!

264
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,140
Nyah!

265
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,020
Nyah-nyah!

266
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,420
Aqu romania!

267
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,180
Nyah!

268
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,440
Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!

269
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,460
Nyah!

270
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,660
Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!

271
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:15,720
Nyah!

272
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,260
Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!

273
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,740
Nyah!

274
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:23,580
Nyah!

275
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,800
I've got the ostrich!

276
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,100
You're not solving anything!

277
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,560
You need to take measures to stop other ostriches from bothering the town!

278
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,460
It's a mess!

279
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,040
What?

280
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,460
Don't say that!

281
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,700
What are you talking about?

282
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,760
Like, "Thank you for your life" or "I'll take care of you from now on."

283
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,880
Well, it seems everyone likes Ryo-chan.

284
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,300
I'm glad to hear that.

285
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,400
Well, I'll leave it to you, Director Tai-saku.

286
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,080
No way!

287
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,340
Okay.

288
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,600
Everyone, are you awake?

289
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,620
Well, let's have a good time today.

290
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:45,960
Don't eat yet!

291
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,660
You need to say hello properly!

292
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,980
Okay.

293
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,080
Well, let's eat!

294
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:04,120
Well, I'll announce today's work.

295
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:12,560
Dachounosuke and Dachouemon, Dachomiwa Takahaibi, Dachoujiro, Dachoubei, Dachoko, and Dachogoro are going to the shopping street.

296
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,440
You come with me.

297
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,580
The other people will clean the park.

298
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,980
You can stay here with special money.

299
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,620
But you have to earn your own living expenses.

300
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,520
We have one motto.

301
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,060
"Don't eat Dachou who doesn't work!"

302
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,580
Got it?

303
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,380
Yes!

304
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,920
Then, let's get to work!

305
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Be careful in the car!

306
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,860
Good morning!

307
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,000
Good morning!

308
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,700
Well, I'm going to the Dachou Special Police Division.

309
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,960
Yes!

310
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,040
I'm counting on you.

311
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,660
Okay, go!

312
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,100
Please deliver this as soon as possible.

313
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,180
I'm counting on you.

314
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,340
Why is it so crowded?

315
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,920
I can't make it in time.

316
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,180
I think we should go to Sharon.

317
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,400
It seems that there is no time.

318
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,600
But we have to hurry!

319
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,320
Since we have to help you.

320
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,000
We don't have enough money.

321
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,260
What do I do?

322
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,860
You want to work for our company, don't you?

323
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,280
We will do our best!

324
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,540
Well, we'll be there as soon as possible.

325
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,220
That's good.

326
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,480
It is such a good idea.

327
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:47,760
I want to do the same as you.

328
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:47,980
Perhaps we can go home?

329
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,780
Yes, of course.

330
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:48,840
Thank you!

331
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,280
Huh?

332
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,280
Excuse me! Is there a mother of this child among the audience?

333
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,160
Mother!

334
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,400
Mama!

335
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,000
Mother!

336
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,320
Mama!

337
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,460
Yuki-chan!

338
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,460
Mama!

339
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,660
Mama!

340
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,120
Yuki-chan!

341
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,420
Thank you very much! Thank you very much!

342
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,580
What? I just did what is natural as a captain!

343
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,780
Right?

344
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,840
Thief!

345
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:13,920
Thief!

346
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,040
Let's go!

347
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,800
I did it!

348
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,060
The

349
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,420
Don't underestimate the speed of the captain!

350
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,880
Stop the bike quietly!

351
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,900
It's not a joke! I can't hold it!

352
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,480
How's that? I can't get in if you do this!

353
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,940
I won't let you!

354
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,720
Captain's unit, start!

355
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,060
Look at you!

356
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,880
Damn! What's going on with you?

357
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,100
Shiro!

358
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,380
What's this?

359
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,840
I'll do it to you!

360
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,400
Get out of my way!

361
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,760
You rascal!

362
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,820
We'll arrest you for your every single move!

363
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,620
Huh, they were doing a great job.

364
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,900
Their teamwork was perfect. Thatド女ちゃん

365
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,340
you are now well-known in Kameari.

366
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,840
Who's this Baros, huh?

367
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,720
Of course, of course.

368
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,320
Please compliment him more!

369
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,300
They were amazing.

370
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,600
They're amazing, the dachos.

371
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,640
What?

372
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,980
They're working so hard in such a small town.

373
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,020
I respect them.

374
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,160
Hey, don't praise the dachos.

375
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,660
I'm the one who taught them.

376
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,940
But they didn't write anything about you.

377
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,800
What?

378
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,200
Well...

379
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,200
"They live a strong life without borrowing anyone's help.

380
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,000
They will receive a letter of gratitude from the Katsushika Shrine."

381
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,520
What? I didn't hear anything!

382
00:17:59,520 --> 00:17:59,660
I don't understand!

383
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,760
This time your work was excellent.

384
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Please keep up your good work for the people of this town.

385
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm counting on you, the people of the Dachou Corps!

386
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,040
Wait!

387
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,460
Chief! Chief!

388
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,780
Why are you all praising the Dachos?

389
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,140
It's my fault, it's my fault!

390
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,000
What are you talking about?

391
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,500
You're the Dachou Corps who took part in the fight.

392
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,240
I'm the Chief of the Dachou Patrol.

393
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,000
If they're just like that,

394
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,760
You're like a boss!

395
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,420
You idiot!

396
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,180
If you're a boss, you should be happy to be praised by your subordinates!

397
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,840
You're so annoying and you're so annoying that you're not praised!

398
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,460
Look at the captains!

399
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,920
This award is for everyone!

400
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,260
Everyone did their best for this award!

401
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,200
Don't you think it's embarrassing?

402
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,160
That's not what I mean!

403
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,560
There is a plan to build a new gym soon.

404
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,440
Please continue to support us.

405
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:00,820
Damn it!

406
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,440
I'll see what happens!

407
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,640
Well, well.

408
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,600
You always work hard.

409
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,520
Here you are.

410
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,240
Thank you.

411
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,820
Huh?

412
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,080
It's a little light, isn't it?

413
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,020
Hey, what's wrong with this?

414
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,320
You didn't eat it, did you?

415
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,520
No!

416
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,900
There's a bug in the drawer!

417
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,120
What's going on?

418
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,540
Did you think me as a human would help?

419
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,020
I thought you were a human being, but you're doing this at night!

420
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,880
So the ostriches are just wild animals after all?

421
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,160
Don't ever come back!

422
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,760
The ostrich army failed.

423
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,020
They were just wild animals after all.

424
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,700
Eating delivery pizza and throwing trash in the trash can is really bad.

425
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,280
It was popular in the past, but now it's gone.

426
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,740
The boom is so fleeting.

427
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,700
Don't worry about it.

428
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,660
I'll get the best out of it.

429
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,000
No, not in my face...

430
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,360
...I'll have to have a탐

431
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,660
Time to eat our lunch.

432
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,480
Okay!

433
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,600
Oh, it that the only thing that we're missing...

434
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,120
...we'll have to get the food.

435
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,940
This is what we would not want!

436
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,280
To think you're your boss.

437
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,360
I know it's Biram!

438
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,380
End of Part 4

439
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,640
I was wondering if they could get out?

440
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,400
Those guys are so naughty!

441
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:39,920
What the --?

442
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,460
That was strange.

443
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,300
What happened?

444
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,480
Wh-What?

445
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,540
Ahhhh! What!!?!

446
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,160
The chief is impotent, and the culprit is this guy!!

447
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,340
Wh-Why is this thing...

448
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,320
This is bad. This is really bad.

449
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,340
Before the chiefs find out, I'll have to escape somewhere.

450
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,160
You're too late.

451
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,440
Wait!

452
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,400
You're not going to apologize to the chiefs?

453
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:17,600
I don't think so.

454
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,320
There's a lot going on here.

455
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,920
That's right.

456
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,320
I did it because I wanted to cover up for the chiefs' mistakes.

457
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,060
Is what he said.

458
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,180
See? The chiefs are saying the same thing.

459
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,240
The chiefs are saying the same thing.

460
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:48,320
Don't make a stupid translation, idiot.

461
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,080
Shofu, don't hesitate and destroy it thoroughly.

462
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,520
I'm going to save the chiefs!

463
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,780
Stop it!

464
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,880
Stop it!

465
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,000
Okay, Mr. Dachonosuke, Mr. Dachoko, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

466
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,080
Oh, yes, yes.

467
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,940
Ms. Dacholina, here's some water.

468
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,440
I'll bring it right away.

469
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,860
Mr. Dachosaburo, your back hurts.

470
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,420
I'll massage it later.

471
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,160
Everyone, take care!

472
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
Please do your best today!

473
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,400
Please!

474
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,880
Why do I have to be treated like a ostrich?!

475
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,420

I really wanted to win the war, so I started practicing Shogi.

507
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,580
But I did not practice Shogi enough!

508
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,380
Alright! I will fight with all my might!

509
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,980
"Shogi! The New Sky, Tatsumaki-Okoshi, the Dragon's Branch!"

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,380
This is Shogi, isn't it?

Next time, "Explosive Battle Shogi!"

512
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,000
Thanks for watching!
