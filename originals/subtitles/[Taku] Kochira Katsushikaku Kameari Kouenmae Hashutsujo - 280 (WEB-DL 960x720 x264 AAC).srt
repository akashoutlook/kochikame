1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,680
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it to the next level."

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,000
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it to the next level."

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,100
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it to the next level."

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,420
When you watch TV, make the room bright and look away.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,560
Come to me, you poor thing!

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,880
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,980
I'm not sure if I'm going to make it to the next level.

9
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:57,900
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,840
Come to me, you poor thing!

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,480
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,960
Look at the red clouds burning.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,420
I'm not sure if I'm going to make it to the next level.

14
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,600
You get it, don't you?

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,260
You get it, don't you?

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,720
If you do, then be quiet and follow me.

17
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,900
If you do, then be quiet and follow me.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,320
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,920
To be continued

20
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,940
Where are we, Ophiuchus?

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,120
Huh?

22
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,420
Did Ryo-chan buy another phone?

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,440
Pe-he-he.

24
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,440
Ta-dah!

25
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,260
This one's got some videos on it.

26
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,740
Did Ryo-chan buy another phone?

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,000
Did you buy it?

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,200
I was filming earlier.

29
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,680
It's the latest model that can send video emails.

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,200
You can also shop with mine.

31
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,540
When you press the barcode reader,

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,220
the purchase loan will be automatically withdrawn from the account.

33
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,640
It becomes a credit card.

34
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,620
That's amazing.

35
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,600
Mine is the new model scheduled to be released this summer.

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,040
Since the screen is big, you can read newspaper articles like this.

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,100
You can also watch TV.

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,240
That's great.

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,200
I can only call my phone.

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,240
What?

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,480
You had a cell phone?

42
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,200
Yes.

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,180
I got it when I went to a nearby shopping street four years ago.

44
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,440
I don't use it often.

45
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,980
This is a very old model even four years ago.

46
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,180
You can't send emails.

47
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,180
I see.

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,160
But the watch function is on.

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,180
I don't have a cell phone that doesn't display time.

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,020
I don't have a cell phone that doesn't display time.

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,480
I've never heard of it.

52
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,380
I see.

53
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,420
Lately, the mobile phone has become popular,

54
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,940
so people don't use watches anymore.

55
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,280
Why don't you just paint the screen and just call?

56
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,820
No, stop it, Ryo-san.

57
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,740
It's a phone.

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,920
Me too.

59
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,820
Me too.

60
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,980
Hello, everyone.

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,620
It's an electric pole.

62
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,140
If you want a mobile phone,

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,940
please leave it to my super electron.

64
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,440
If you want a mobile phone, leave it to my super electron.

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,760
This is a telephone.

66
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,400
It's amazing.

67
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,040
But why are we talking about mobile phones?

68
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,200
What?

69
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,820
I've heard everything you've said.

70
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,900
We just need to go inside.

71
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,560
You just want to show off your cell phone to everyone, don't you?

72
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,100
You just want to show off your cell phone to everyone, don't you?

73
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,240
It's true that mobile phones have evolved rapidly.

74
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,580
But there's a flaw in it.

75
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,640
What kind of flaw?

76
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,300
For example,

77
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,620
the small-sized lightweight that was often used in mobile phone commercials.

78
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,100
But if the small-sized lightweight is too advanced,

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,500
the buttons become too small and it's hard to call.

80
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,600
When you put the speaker on your ear,

81
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,300
the microphone is too far away,

82
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,480
so your voice gets louder.

83
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:09,700
Hello?

84
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,100
Let's go again.

85
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,640
What are you talking about?

86
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,080
It's too light, so you don't notice even if you drop it.

87
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,800
It's true that it's still lost.

88
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,600
That's why you buy a cell phone so often.

89
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,160
This is what was developed there.

90
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,580
What's that?

91
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,320
It's an old black phone.

92
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,580
This is also a great cell phone.

93
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,020
It's a dial type, so you can turn it around without a mistake.

94
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,700
The size is the same as a home phone.

95
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,540
Hello? It's me.

96
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,200
You can talk calmly and openly.

97
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,820
If you put it in a special holster,

98
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,680
it has a cord, so there's no need to worry about losing it.

99
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,420
What do you think?

100
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,120
I'll make it half price now.

101
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,940
What?

102
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,460
Even if you say that suddenly ...

103
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,020
Hey Spark,

104
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,720
did you come to the cell phone business on purpose?

105
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,940
No, I'm running a test run of a new car.

106
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,360
This car has a automatic control function that is linked to the car navigation.

107
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,820
What?

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,380
Automatic control function?

109
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,080
Tell me the destination of the car navigation.

110
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,320
Well, then,

111
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,720
Nico Nico Ryo.

112
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,820
I have set the destination.

113
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,900
When you leave, put your hands on the steering wheel.

114
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,120
It's a safety measure.

115
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,600
If you hold the steering wheel tightly,

116
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,480
automatic control will be removed.

117
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,160
When you leave,

118
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,540
put your hands on the steering wheel.

119
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,240
What?

120
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,900
What is it?

121
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,540
It will return soon.

122
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,180
Hey, it's easy, easy.

123
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,620
Just put your hands on it,

124
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,420
you can run without permission.

125
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,920
Oh, it's a red light.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,780
It's okay.

127
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,660
It automatically detects red traffic lights

128
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,880
and the brakes start to brake.

129
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,960
Wow!

130
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:10,960
Wow!

131
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,000
Wow!

132
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,720
Is it right to keep the distance?

133
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,060
There is an impact-bearing sensor.

134
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,220
Is the route changing?

135
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,700
There is an Between-енти 것처럼 break-off across the road.

136
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,160
The route has been changed.

137
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,380
I see, that's what is it.

138
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,200
The function is connected to the traditional car navigation.

139
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,340
Until now,

140
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,220
it took a long time to send traffic information.

141
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,660
In order to do this,

142
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,260
can be reflected in the sky.

143
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,360
It's Saconji!

144
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,320
Hey, Saconji!

145
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,040
Ryotsu, what's wrong with this car?

146
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,500
It's testing the new automatic-powered vehicle.

147
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,940
According to the traffic law,

148
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,400
this place will stop for 5 minutes.

149
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,220
Wow!

150
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,440
This is a new product that I'm proud of!

151
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,680
This car navigation voice...

152
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,560
It's just like Saori...

153
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,020
What?

154
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,680
Is that so?

155
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,140
We have arrived at the destination.

156
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,620
Then let's go back to the exit.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,600
Huh?

158
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,180
Oh, Honda.

159
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,380
It's me. What's wrong, Honda?

160
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,800
I'm around Tamagawa right now.

161
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,640
I found a toy that looks a little interesting.

162
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,380
I found a toy that looks a little interesting.

163
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,560
Really?

164
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,380
Yeah.

165
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,420
It looks like Ryotsu's husband wants it.

166
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,480
It looks like he's sleeping on the ground.

167
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,520
I got it. I'm on my way.

168
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,180
Where is it?

169
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,800
Well, the road is a little rough,

170
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,160
so it's hard to find the place.

171
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,400
In that case,

172
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,300
put your phone in the cell phone holder there.

173
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,540
Take out information from the other side's notebook

174
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,760
and set the destination.

175
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,120
Honda, what is the name and location of the shop?

176
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,000
Takamatsu, a toy shop.

177
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,340
It's near Tamagawa Bridge.

178
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,620
It's a shopping mall.

179
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,800
Let's go there.

180
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,180
Okay, we're out.

181
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,720
Set a route.

182
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,440
Can I borrow this car for a while?

183
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,660
We're going on a business trip to the US on an evening flight.

184
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,800
We might have to contact Narita before then.

185
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,660
I'll contact the company.

186
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,700
We have enough time.

187
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,480
Okay, let's go.

188
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,940
Let's go.

189
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,440
*Burps*

190
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,440
Oh, I forgot to bring lunch.

191
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,380
I'll eat somewhere else.

192
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,140
I'll use the car navigation system at times like this.

193
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,880
Please stop by the fast food shop on the drive-thru.

194
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,100
Is this place okay?

195
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,920
Yeah.

196
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,680
I've changed my route.

197
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,680
Double cheeseburger set, with hot coffee.

198
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,120
How about you?

199
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,060
No, I'm fine.

200
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,560
I'll drive, so you can eat in the passenger seat.

201
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,800
Ah, I'm sorry.

202
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,880
No, you don't have to stand in the passenger seat.

203
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,480
Press this switch.

204
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,220
You can change the mode with one touch.

205
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,980
It's like a transformation robot.

206
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,140
Sometimes you feel sleepy while driving.

207
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,500
That's why.

208
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,480
It's useful when you're tired.

209
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,020
By the way, if you let go of the handle...

210
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,000
Please hold the handle.

211
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,080
If you can't hold it for 5 seconds, please stop.

212
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,520
Oh, well.

213
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,000
It automatically stops at this state.

214
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,920
Please resume driving.

215
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,920
Good.

216
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,300
Right.

217
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,960
Did you get the helmet it was wearing?

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,820
It's fine

219
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:11,920
Good room.

220
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,540
It's like a lot of things here.

221
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,340
Did you get the helmet it was wearing?

222
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,940
It's fine

223
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,480
It didn't feel good.

224
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,760
Good room.

225
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,120
TRANSMISSION

226
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,460
Even if you don't whatever it is, I consider you are a little similar to a human.

227
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,880
It's even better.

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,820
Good

229
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,000
Sedans

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:44,180
He's stupid, it was a car 57 00:04:21,470 -- 00:04:25,050 Who would ignore the traffic light?

231
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,860
Hey, this car ignored the traffic light,

232
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,020
I can't be hurt when you're little stupid

233
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,420
This car automatically stops when the red light is on

234
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,040
But it was red, you've seen it, haven't you?

235
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,760
Humans have their own way of looking at things.

236
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,060
Hey! This isn't a road!

237
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,260
I-I-I'm sure the carnavi decided that this is the shortcut.

238
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,900
What an idiot!

239
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,480
See? It went back to the normal road.

240
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,780
Yeah!

241
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,140
Why is it running in the middle of nowhere?

242
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,180
I'm sure there's a traffic jam somewhere.

243
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Furano? I heard that somewhere.

244
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,920
This isn't a northern country!

245
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,760
It's running in Hokkaido!

246
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,120
That's our new car!

247
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,040
It's going all the way to Hokkaido!

248
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,960
Don't be so serious!

249
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,480
The carnavi is broken!

250
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,740
See? It's in Tokyo!

251
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,520
To be continued

252
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,160
What a car!

253
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,340
Hey!

254
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,800
I-I'm saved!

255
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,360
We're going to have a big accident!

256
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,980
Get rid of the automatic control!

257
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,940
Actually, I've been doing it for a while...

258
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,620
I can't get rid of it!

259
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,300
What did you say?

260
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,540
Oh, right!

261
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,120
I can stop automatically if I let go!

262
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,440
Oh, I see!

263
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,840
I did it!

264
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,700
I can stop!

265
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,560
I can't stop!

266
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,960
Hey! Stop!

267
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,020
I can stop!

268
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,480
What's wrong with you?

269
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,960
I told you to stop!

270
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,520
He's going!

271
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,860
What's wrong with you?

272
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,400
He's going!

273
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,320
Is it our new car?

274
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,960
What're you gonna do to me?

275
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,080
It's my line!

276
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,640
I was very generous because of that car!

277
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,640
Seriously...

278
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,720
If this goes on, I'll have to contact Honda and get them to pick me up.

279
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,580
Hm?

280
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,500
Oh no! My phone is connected to a car navigation system!

281
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,000
Hey, give me back your phone!

282
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,200
Wait a minute! I have to get it picked up too!

283
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,940
My phone broke!

284
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,520
Don't make that loud noise!

285
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,240
What was that?

286
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,720
It was the email message!

287
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,560
No! I can't read it at all!

288
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,380
Calm down, Spark!

289
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,660
Maybe this guy just broke the LCD!

290
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,140
He might be able to call!

291
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,620
I-I see!

292
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,020
I'll call the telephone function...

293
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,780
No! It's not showing!

294
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,480
Calm down!

295
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,560
It's broken, so it can't be displayed!

296
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,000
The voice input is...

297
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,420
That's right!

298
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:25,880
It's broken!

299
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,640
The company!

300
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,040
Hm?

301
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,940
The voice input is broken too, it seems.

302
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,680
Haha! What's going on?

303
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,140
You can just press the phone number!

304
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,740
I don't remember that.

305
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,200
Damn it! You're not reliable!

306
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,240
Give it to me!

307
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:44,680
There's got to be someone at the station!

308
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,060
What was the number again?

309
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,240
You don't remember either!

310
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,700
I remember it from a long time ago!

311
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,780
I remember it from a long time ago!

312
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,740
What do you mean, "I remember it from a long time ago"?

313
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,380
I remember it from a long time ago!

314
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,080
"Yoroshiku" or "Ii-kuni" or something like that...

315
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,660
I can use my phone's name after it's been popularized!

316
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,040
No! I can't remember!

317
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,180
Don't you remember anything?

318
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,580
Like your house number?

319
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,900
I'm not bragging, but I don't remember anything!

320
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,780
Damn it! Someone tell me!

321
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,760
Oh, right! There's a number guide!

322
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,300
Oh, right! There's a number guide!

323
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,620
I see! You know...

324
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,220
How many numbers do you have?

325
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,840
I think it started with one, so it's three digits.

326
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,720
One, one...

327
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,540
Wasn't it nine?

328
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,040
Okay! One, one, nine!

329
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,360
Yes, this is the fire station.

330
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,200
What?

331
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,500
S-sorry! I've made a mistake!

332
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,340
119 is the fire station!

333
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,780
I-I see!

334
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,520
Um...

335
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,580
The number guide is...

336
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,520
Wasn't it 110?

337
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,400
That's the police's number 110!

338
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,400
It's your number!

339
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,460
I-I see.

340
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,660
Um...

341
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,480
The number...

342
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,300
The number...

343
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,040
That's right!

344
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,320
Your phone has a "re-dial" function!

345
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,020
I see! Re-dial!

346
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,900
I called the company when I put you on the phone earlier!

347
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,360
Yes, this is the fire station.

348
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,640
I'm in a emergency!

349
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,040
I-I'm sorry!

350
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,160
I just called the fire station!

351
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,320
If I had known earlier!

352
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,440
What should I have done?

353
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:29,840
Calm down!

354
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,380
We have to go in order!

355
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,420
Yes, this is the number guide.

356
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,500
Yay!

357
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,980
I see! 104!

358
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,580
I'm calling Tokyo's Super Electronics!

359
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,440
I've received your call.

360
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,880
Please wait a moment.

361
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,520
What is it?

362
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,620
It's a note paper.

363
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,240
Do you have anything to write on it?

364
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,820
Huh?

365
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,460
My cell phone has been replaced by a note book lately.

366
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,120
Do you have one too?

367
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,920
I have one too!

368
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,800
I used to use the memo function of my cell phone.

369
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,760
I left it to you.

370
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,720
I'll read out the number.

371
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,480
Ah! Wait a minute!

372
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,980
I have to find the note quickly!

373
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,000
I see!

374
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,760
Um...

375
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:13,600
Wait a minute.

376
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:13,860
What?

377
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,240
Super Electronics Co., Ltd.

378
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:17,960
Wait a minute!

379
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,180
Unstable!

380
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,440
Run!

381
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,840
This time it's broken perfectly.

382
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,820
Wow!

383
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,680
What?

384
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,700
Yeah!

385
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,240
Damn it!

386
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,820
Where's the last call?

387
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,260
It's because the number has been reduced recently.

388
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,040
Come to think of it.

389
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,260
Maybe we could use the phone's phone number function and call anyone, and get them to contact the company.

390
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,620
Don't say that after it's broken!

391
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,420
We can do that when it's broken next time!

392
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm sorry for that!

393
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,300
There it is!

394
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Look! I put the phone number here!

395
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Yay! Now we can call the company!

396
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,320
That's good!

397
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,040
What is it?

398
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,240
10 yen.

399
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,960
You just bought a new phone yesterday, so there's no waste of 1 yen.

400
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,920
Don't you have any money?

401
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
Unfortunately, everything I buy is a card.

402
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't have any cash!

403
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,120
Then what about your telephone?

404
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,780
I have a phone, but I don't have any telephone!

405
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,760
Then how do you call?

406
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,120
You don't know?

407
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,640
Oh, no!

408
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,380
I've made it to the phone number.

409
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,260
And if you think about it,

410
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,580
even if you can't get in touch with the company,

411
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,560
you won't get a ticket to the company if you don't know where you are!

412
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,680
Don't worry!

413
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,320
I have a GPS built into my phone, and I can...

414
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,860
That phone is broken, so you're in trouble!

415
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,300
So, we're lost in the middle of Tokyo!

416
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,740
What should we do?

417
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,080
Calm down, Spark!

418
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,760
Can we calm down in this situation?

419
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,480
We're going to sign a contract with Ooguchi for our next business trip!

420
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:12,900
What are we going to do?

421
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,000
If we mess up, we'll lose tens of billions!

422
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,000
Ah, by the way,

423
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,140
the email you just sent might have been some kind of important matter!

424
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,500
I'm curious about it!

425
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:23,960
Hey!

426
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,600
Stop it!

427
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,960
Come on!

428
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,260
I'm going to the company!

429
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,320
That's right!

430
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,460
If you take a step to one side of the wall like this,

431
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,060
you will get to the destination.

432
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,520
*clock 끝*

433
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,120
...?

434
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,880
We passed here before.

435
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,100
It's the same place we went before.

436
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,760
No way! Why did I get back here?

437
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,040
I think maybe it's because you lacked the way to get out the mail.

438
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,240
Haaaaa!

439
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,820
Oh, yeah! It's the Hokuto Shichisei!

440
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,960
Find "Hokkyoku" and you'll know which way you're coming from!

441
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,560
Let's go to the North Star!

442
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,640
There's no way you can see the constellation in the daytime!

443
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,520
That's right! The wristwatch!

444
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,700
The wristwatch's single axis is facing the sun!

445
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,760
The direction of the single axis and the direction of the dial at 12 o'clock should be exactly in the middle!

446
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,820
Now, the wristwatch!

447
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,660
Unfortunately, I can't carry a wristwatch.

448
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,560
My cell phone has a watch on it.

449
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,740
So, in the end, you can reach there.

450
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,100
Ah!

451
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,000
Why is it broken?

452
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,100
My cell phone!

453
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,380
Hey, calm down.

454
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:44,860
Spark!

455
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,880
Excuse me.

456
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,860
Yes?

457
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,940
If you're on the phone, I'd like to borrow it.

458
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,500
Ah, it's me.

459
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,280
I'm Spark, the president.

460
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,280
Please come to the address I'm going to tell you.

461
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,900
Well, it's been about 30 years since I borrowed a phone.

462
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,600
I used to hear that a lot.

463
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,740
That's right.

464
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,800
There used to be a lot of houses without phones.

465
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,620
I got a call.

466
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,940
I'll be right there.

467
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,320
Really?

468
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,440
Here you go.

469
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,760
Ah, no, I'm...

470
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,800
Don't hesitate.

471
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,420
It's a good deed.

472
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,960
Yes, I'll take it.

473
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,480
Mmm.

474
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,580
Is this what it used to be like?

475
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:37,760
A long time ago, there were many houses like this.

476
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,980
That's a big difference from your house.

477
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,420
Thank you for the extra benefits.

478
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,720
Do your grandparents have cell phones?

479
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,600
No way!

480
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,340
But when I wanted to call outside...

481
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,180
Well, that's part of it.

482
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,760
It's a no-brainer.

483
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,580
T-That's...

484
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,740
If you have to, just ask someone.

485
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,620
You too, right?

486
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,380
If you get lost, ask someone.

487
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,300
We can all help each other.

488
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,660
Maybe we were made to dance by the tools because we had so many useful tools.

489
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,660
Maybe we were made to dance by the tools because we had so many useful tools.

490
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,300
Made to dance by the tools...

491
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,360
You've done a great job.

492
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,340
I didn't do anything big.

493
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,600
When you're in trouble, you're both great.

494
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,580
Honda, I'm sorry, but can you lend me 10 yen?

495
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,500
No problem.

496
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,040
I borrowed your phone.

497
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,060
When you're in trouble, it's polite to do this.

498
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,480
Here.

499
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,680
Okay, okay, I got it. I'll be waiting.

500
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,760
Who was it from, senpai?

501
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,280
It was Super Electronics' Electrical Spark.

502
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,200
He's coming here soon.

503
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,020
It seems that the contract in the US went well too.

504
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,020
It's all thanks to that old couple.

505
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,640
It was the one who lent me the phone.

506
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,640
So, what's your business?

507
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,220
Yeah, he said he developed a new product.

508
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,700
Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.

509
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,320
You're here. What kind of product did you develop this time?

510
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,480
The word that you're being made to dance to a tool is ringing in my heart.

511
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,600
So instead of being made to dance to a tool,

512
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
I thought about a dancing tool!

513
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,460
I thought about a dancing tool!

514
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,440
How is it? Isn't it amazing?

515
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,740
You don't know anything!

516
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,500
What kind of dancing tool is it?

517
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,960
You idiot, take a break!

518
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,120
You're wasting the love of a person!

519
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,480
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

520
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,560
Ryo's why, why, why!

521
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:26,620
Ryo's eyebrows look like black hair. Why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

522
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:34,280
He wears sandals but he can run really fast. Why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

523
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,640
Ryo's always doing arm wrestling. Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

524
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:48,420
He's always being so flirty, yet he adores everyone. Why, why, why, why, why, why?

525
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,600
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

526
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,220
Even though it doesn't really matter,

527
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,560
the title of this anime is so long.

528
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,080
Katsushika, Kamen Rinko, Emae Hatsutsujo

529
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,020
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

530
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,740
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

531
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,300
Why? Why? Why?

532
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,000
Why? Why? Why?

533
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
Why? Why? Why?

534
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,400
Why? Why? Why?

535
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,240
Chief! What are you hiding?

536
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,560
Chief! You can't cheat!

537
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,620
Chief! I don't have any eyes!

538
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:36,940
This is not a trap!

539
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,020
Chief! You don't think that you can live for free by doing that, do you?

540
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,460
Next time: Chief Ohara gets addicted to games!

541
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,360
