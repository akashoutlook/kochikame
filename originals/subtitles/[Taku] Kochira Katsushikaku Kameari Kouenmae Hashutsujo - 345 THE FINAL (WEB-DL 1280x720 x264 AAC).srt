00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,060
Kochikame Special is brought to you by Bandai Namco Entertainment and the following sponsors.

2
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,080
This is too tight.

3
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,180
Good day!

4
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,860
You can go home now.

5
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,400
What's with that hand?

6
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,740
What's with him?

7
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,140
I thought I'd make a senbei.

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,980
Good morning, senpai.

9
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,520
Oh, it's you and Reiko.

10
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,120
What are you doing this early in the morning?

11
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,340
The death certificate?

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,780
This is it.

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,860
A propeller?

14
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,440
Yeah, a drone.

15
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,600
You're making a drone by hand?

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,260
I can't help it.

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,320
I was planning to buy it as a summer bonus, but it was taken away by the debtor.

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,520
Damn it!

19
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,960
If it wasn't for him...

20
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,880
It's clear.

21
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,940
I've been waiting for you, Ryo.

22
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,140
No.

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,440
I'm the son of a French person born in the United States.

24
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,500
What?

25
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,180
Ryo is so naive.

26
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,240
I can't run away from us with such a disguise.

27
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,460
I don't want to be in debt.

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,640
Let's have them pay for it!

29
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,480
Okay, I'll pay, so just you wait!

30
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,500
You're the one who's naive!

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,320
Just as planned.

32
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,200
It's a million years too early to steal a bonus from Ryotsu Kankichi!

33
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,320
Who's there?

34
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,540
Higurashi?

35
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,540
You only wake up once every four years at the Olympic Games!

36
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,940
Wait, this year's the Olympics, huh?

37
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,320
Once every four years?

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,000
I've been sleeping for eight years already!

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,900
Oh, come to think of it, you haven't been sleeping for a long time.

40
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,560
Shut up!

41
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,780
Because you didn't wake me up four years ago,

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,740
the members at the home team have changed.

43
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,140
The most popular one right now is...

44
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,200
AKB48!

45
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,500
AKB48!

46
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,640
You know I've been sleeping for a long time.

47
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Shut up!

48
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,600
While I was sleeping,

49
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,100
SKT, NMT,

50
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,220
HKT,

51
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
NGT,

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,460
and Nogizaka 46 were also formed!

53
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,740
Why is only Nogizaka 46?

54
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,480
Do you want to die?

55
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,680
Shut up!

56
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,180
I'll make you pay for leaving me here!

57
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,660
Ouch!

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,800
Stop!

59
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,180
Stop!

60
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,840
Hah!

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,440
We got this day!

62
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,380
Time for the show to end!

63
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,240
Mika, test your luck!

64
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,020
I'll give you a gift if you use a drone.

65
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,480
What?

66
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,580
Our group'sbattec studio will be producing and selling drones.

67
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,780
I have a prototype.

68
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,320
I have a new work of art, so I'll bring it to you.

69
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Nagagawa!

70
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,600
After all, what you should have is a celebrity friend!

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,900
Senpai, stop it!

72
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,640
Chief!

73
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,440
Please don't misunderstand, chief!

74
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,720
What are you playing at?

75
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,240
Ryo-tsu, let's go to the end of the day.

76
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:41,600
I'll go patrol!

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,300
Hey, Ryo-tsu!

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,620
What a hopeless guy.

79
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,360
We're at the end of the day!

80
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,340
Don't go to the end!

81
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,920
I kicked a pebble to jump into the air.

82
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,160
I was convinced by Jokingu, the head of a gym.

83
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,520
I stood up.

84
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,620
The sun is setting

85
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,840
Tomorrow, it will end like this

86
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,820
If I win, I lose happiness again

87
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,460
I realized it

88
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,680
Because I'm an idiot

89
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,260
Brave

90
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,140
Princess Sabrina of the Kingdom of the Warmth has arrived at Haneda International Airport today.

91
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,040
Your beauty has been the hot topic in the recent year's rare metal mining.

92
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,220
"I'm going to take a look at the princess of Atakaino."

93
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,700
"Many people are gathering in the yard."

94
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,820
"The Japanese government is also going to deepen their exchanges with Atakaino."

95
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,920
"We are going to give them national goods."

96
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,440
"Hmph. Rather than spending tax money for that kid, you're going to raise my salary and..."

97
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,120
"Hmm?"

98
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,200
"I'm wearing a disguise, but I'm sure it's Kanbei."

99
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,340
"Are you going to do something again?"

100
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,740
4 days before!

101
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:35,900
A word?

102
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,160
"Mountain."

103
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,380
"Water."

104
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,360
"Yes."

105
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,400
"I was after that place six months ago."

106
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,760
"What's that behind the glass?"

107
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,560
The antenna is like a mountain.

108
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,920
It's very suspicious.

109
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,100
The password is mountain.

110
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,020
River.

111
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,800
Good.

112
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,940
Who am I?

113
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,200
Kanbei!

114
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,560
Kanpichi.

115
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,760
Why did you find out this place?

116
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,260
I was scared because it looked so suspicious.

117
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,460
What is this high-tech facility?

118
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,180
You must be surprised.

119
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,440
We are addicted to American science director drama now.

120
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,620
We reproduced it exactly like the real thing.

121
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,080
Is it a drama joke?

122
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,560
Joke?

123
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,360
It's not, Kanpichi.

124
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,020
We succeeded in hacking the main computer of the capital.

125
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,060
It's a joke.

126
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,740
Agent Tomo.

127
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,080
Bring out the video of the security camera installed by the police in the capital.

128
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,400
Roger that.

129
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,300
It's too early to be surprised.

130
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,400
It's the secret file of all police officers in the capital.

131
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,220
It's true.

132
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,780
Your evil business is also in the Eiffel Tower.

133
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,280
The high-tech facility.

134
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,840
You broke the TV station many times.

135
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,480
The police chief left the ridiculous data.

136
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,060
The reason is that you are completely unaccessible.

137
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,820
All of us are arrested.

138
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,820
Don't say such a hard thing.

139
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,620
You can easily rewrite data.

140
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,760
Really?

141
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,780
Ryo.

142
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,100
I'll erase it.

143
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,500
Please.

144
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,400
Instead, keep our secret base in a secret place.

145
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,700
If you can erase it, then so be it.

146
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,760
Clear?

147
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,300
I didn't erase anything.

148
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,360
Hey...

149
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,420
The voice.

150
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,780
What is it?

151
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,380
Is that the one?

152
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,080
Yes.

153
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,260
This time, he cut that part.

154
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,080
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

155
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,940
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

156
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,980
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

157
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,740
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

158
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,040
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

159
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,400
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

160
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,160
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

161
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,420
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

162
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,560
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

163
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

164
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

165
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:26,400
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

166
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,840
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

167
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

168
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,340
I'm sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

169
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,180
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

170
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,640
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

171
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,020
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

172
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,140
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to the hospital.

173
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,740
DWARF

174
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,080
Hey, stop!

175
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,560
We're not ordering!

176
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,100
You stop now

177
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,120
Increase the speed!

178
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,300
Miyazubou!

179
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
2 Yeah

180
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,800
1

181
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,260
2

182
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,980
3

183
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,980
4

184
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,460
5

185
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,100
You better leave.

186
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,500
Oh, right, I leave it to them to support me.

187
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,780
Kanbei, a kidnapping has occurred on the crossroads in Kanda.

188
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,680
The suspect's car number is...

189
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,840
A wagon carriage was found.

190
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,700
I'll lead you, so you have to follow my orders.

191
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,800
- Wait. - Roger!

192
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,460
The tower is bent just like the one in the Kanda sushi restaurant.

193
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,120
Alright, let's go around!

194
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,480
It's him again!

195
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
- Hiromu, get him! - Yes!

196
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,020
- - Hey,

197
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,240
hang in there! Damn it!

198
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,280
Don't come

199
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,440
any closer! You're dead! You dirty bastard!

200
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,860
Now, raise your

201
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,160
hands and get out of my way! Alright! This is

202
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,460
Ichik

203
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,560
awa Chika. What is that?!

204
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,740
Well...

205
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,440
You!

206
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,260
You!

207
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,360
Excellent!

208
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,360
Huh?

209
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,720
Leader?

210
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,340
Damn it.

211
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,760
Ah!

212
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,440
Well done, Kankichi.

213
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,260
I'll call the police.

214
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,560
Got it.

215
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,500
Thanks.

216
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,020
Thanks for helping me.

217
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,880
You're welcome.

218
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,040
What?

219
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,700
Lemon!

220
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,400
Lemon?!

221
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,140
Lemon?!

222
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,400
Lemon?!

223
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,580
Lemon?!

224
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,540
Lemon?!

225
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,020
Lemon?!

226
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,100
But I can't go out anymore.

227
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,820
Then I delivered the special sushi.

228
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,120
That's good.

229
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,580
Daikin will be fired from Kakichi's part-time job.

230
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,760
He he he!

231
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,700
It's a demon!

232
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,700
But it looks like you very much.

233
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,180
Princess and lemon.

234
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,960
When I first saw Lemon, I thought I was myself in the mirror.

235
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,480
I thought so too.

236
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,000
There are two Uri except for the hairstyle.

237
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,400
Isn't it a way of talking about historical drama?

238
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,220
Do you know historical drama?

239
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,900
Yes.

240
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,780
Please call me Sabrina.

241
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,460
I was doing it on the news.

242
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,240
It seems that I mastered Japanese in dramas and movies.

243
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,420
That's great.

244
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,160
Sabrina.

245
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,580
If you like historical drama, there is a DVD in Lemon's room.

246
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,240
I wonder if we can watch it together.

247
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,100
Yes.

248
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,980
Hmm...

249
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,560
Would you like to take a part-time job?

250
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,020
Sure.

251
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,560
Over here.

252
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,480
I like sushi too.

253
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,680
Cool.

254
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,480
Lemon.

255
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,620
What is the spear that Princess uses?

256
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,720
It is Naginata.

257
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,360
Naginata?

258
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,540
Yes.

259
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,060
We also have Naginata.

260
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,420
Great!

261
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,720
I'd like to see it!

262
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,060
I won't use the real one, but I can use it for training.

263
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,380
How to hold it is like this!

264
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,080
Yes!

265
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,060
To!

266
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,080
To!

267
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:36,820
To!

268
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:43,900
Welcome!

269
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,280
We are not guests.

270
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,700
We came to pick you up because we heard that a pretty princess is here.

271
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,240
I'm glad you know this place.

272
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,680
I'm glad you know this place.

273
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,320
I taught you.

274
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,080
Chief!

275
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,700
I got a call from your grandfather.

276
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,180
He said he protected the princess from the kidnappers.

277
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,880
Well.

278
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,720
Then the princess's immediate relatives said they would like to ask you for the princess's protection during the next day.

279
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,880
It's a very honorable thing.

280
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,860
Don't take it back.

281
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,120
I'm not kidding!

282
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,160
They've been selling automatic guns!

283
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,500
I refuse!

284
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,920
Chief is also a temporary bonus.

285
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,120
I'm telling you to give me a bonus.

286
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,820
I'm telling you to give me a bonus.

287
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,560
A temporary bonus?

288
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,560
Bonus, bonus.

289
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,040
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,600
Don't take it back.

291
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,340
Leave it to me!

292
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,420
If it's for the princess, even if it's in the middle of the day or in the water.

293
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,520
So, where is the princess?

294
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,240
It's in the lemon room.

295
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,100
I'll bring it.

296
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,720
It's the first time for her.

297
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,640
It's a big deal.

298
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:52,900
It's a big deal.

299
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,880
She tried everything.

300
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,540
Thank you so much.

301
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:02,360
I wanted to go back in time, so I brought the

302
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:02,620
It's a nice view.

303
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,500
No, it's not.

304
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,280
I think she's done.

305
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,720
It's not.

306
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,960
He doesn't seem to go anywhere he likes.

307
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,980
Even if you say that...

308
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,800
That's right! I have a good idea!

309
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,780
Sabrina and Lemon are very similar.

310
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,080
How about we switch places for a day?

311
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,360
That's a good idea!

312
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,660
You idiot!

313
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,600
If you do that, Lemon may be kidnapped!

314
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,880
I will never forgive you!

315
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,140
Please!

316
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:43,960
Please!

317
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,720
I won't let you do it!

318
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,340
If you let me switch places, I'll give you this.

319
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,940
I don't want to get a pendant.

320
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,900
Look, Kankichi.

321
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,780
It's a sparkling diamond.

322
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,500
A diamond?

323
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,440
Cream, cream!

324
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,920
I want this!

325
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,840
No!

326
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,580
Oops.

327
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
I should've told you to find someone else so you won't fall for it.

328
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,920
handicap

329
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,300
I'm glad I got your help.

330
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,180
Okay.

331
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,960
I'll take care of Lemon's bodyguard,

332
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,180
just you and Rako.

333
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,840
I don't know that they're well-versed in the sea life.

334
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,860
I don't know that they're well-versed in the sea life.

335
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,100
He's just like a figure in the sea life.

336
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,340
I understand. Good bye.

337
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,200
Please come again to play!

338
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,600
... I see.

339
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:57,140
So far, Kochikame Special was brought to you by Bandai Namco Entertainment and the following sponsors.

340
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,440
This is a project sponsored by the Bandai Namco Entertainment.

341
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,400
It's the false world!

342
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,700
What is the reason why the kidnapping failed this time?

343
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,660
Hm?

344
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:07,920
Yes!

345
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,520
I believe the reason was that the leader was beaten by Sushiwake!

346
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,200
The leader's mistake is the mistake of your subordinates!

347
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,100
Did you understand?

348
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,220
Yes!

349
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,520
It's our mistake that the kidnapping failed!

350
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,760
That's fine!

351
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,640
Don't make a mistake tomorrow!

352
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,000
Uh... Yes.

353
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,800
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

354
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,040
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

355
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,120
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

356
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,340
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

357
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,860
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

358
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,660
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

359
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,120
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

360
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,300
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

361
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,720
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

362
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,340
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

363
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,480
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

364
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,340
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

365
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,540
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

366
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,120
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

367
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:57,740
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

368
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,340
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

369
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,200
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

370
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,240
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

371
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,160
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

372
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,780
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

373
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,620
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

374
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:15,700
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

375
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,720
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

376
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,420
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

377
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,920
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

378
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,220
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

379
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,320
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

380
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,900
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

381
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,100
"Long live the King of Saburina!"

382
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,000
- It's delicious! - Right?

383
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,900
Well, see you later!

384
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,160
Ryo-san, do you want to eat a fried doll?

385
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,820
See you later!

386
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,340
See you later!

387
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,440
It's popular, isn't it?

388
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,060
Now!

389
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,880
Ryo-san, pay the bill!

390
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,240
Shut up!

391
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,380
The city of the north is the best!

392
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,260
I see! That's good!

393
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,880
Sabrina, what are you going to have for lunch?

394
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,780
Monja!

395
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,000
As expected, you like the city of the north!

396
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,260
Oh, look!

397
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,280
That's the Sky Tree!

398
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,100
Wow! It's so high!

399
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,900
How high is it?

400
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,960
It's 634 meters!

401
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,420
It's the world's highest self-propelled radio tower!

402
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,080
Amazing!

403
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,140
As expected of a first-class hotel!

404
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,400
They carefully filter domestic ingredients and pour French truffles.

405
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,460
They carefully filter domestic ingredients and pour French truffles.

406
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:48,600
They carefully filter domestic ingredients and pour French truffles.

407
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,620
Which one tastes better?

408
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,340
Reiko-san! Nakagawa-san!

409
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,740
You can't drink!

410
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,100
Oh, no!

411
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,360
Nakagawa-san, wake up!

412
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,460
You have a sleeping pill in your mouth!

413
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,760
Lemon-chan...

414
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,260
Don't contact Kankichi!

415
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,920
Let go!

416
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,700
Ladies, let go!

417
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,320
Monja is a good one!

418
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,060
Monja is a good one!

419
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,160
Is that so?

420
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,160
Because Monja is end-class gourmet representative ofIIaka!

421
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,300
What?!

422
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,520
I can't believe it!

423
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,500
Where is Nakagawa-san?

424
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,080
Memon-chan...

425
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,760
I won't be kidnapped...

426
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,460
Nakagawa! Hey, Nakagawa!

427
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,780
What? Lemon?

428
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,080
There must be a car that left the Grand Hotel within five minutes!

429
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,700
Check it out immediately!

430
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,480
Understood.

431
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,920
If there's anything wrong with Lemon...

432
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,320
It's okay, Sabrina.

433
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,500
Lemon is a smart and strong girl!

434
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,860
Besides, I will definitely save her!

435
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,480
I can only see the car of the car owner who carries the seats from the back door, not the taxi or the hire!

436
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,080
That's suspicious.

437
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,220
Bingo!

438
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,140
The car was in the same car as yesterday, and it was repainted!

439
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,240
Use the video of the crime scene to catch that car!

440
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,800
Lemon, I'll do my best until I get there!

441
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,340
Understood.

442
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,580
I want to check the safety of the princess.

443
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,380
Listen to my voice!

444
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,700
Hey!

445
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,200
Hello?

446
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:30,880
Hello?

447
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,920
Where's the counterfeit money?

448
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,240
Commander, what did the criminals say?

449
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,900
They asked for one billion yen in cash.

450
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,180
One billion yen!

451
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,740
Commander, there's a message from a man named Ryotsu Kankichi.

452
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,100
Ryotsu?

453
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,300
He's my subordinate.

454
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,720
Switch to the monitor.

455
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,340
I've found the car used by the criminals.

456
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,040
I'll send you a video.

457
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,860
How did you know that?

458
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,680
I've been looking for a video of the crime around the hotel just after the crime happened.

459
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,820
Why?

460
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,820
Why can you do that?

461
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,000
I mean, where is it?

462
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,020
I don't care about that!

463
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,700
Anyway, find the car of the criminal and contact me if you find it!

464
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,440
Please contact the phone!

465
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,520
Then!

466
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,560
Ryo-tsu! Ryo-tsu!

467
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,500
Agent Kanbi!

468
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,840
I found you before the cherry blossoms that are stepping on the temple!

469
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,700
It's Osakusa Bridge!

470
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,480
It's huge!

471
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,060
Please follow me!

472
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,980
Kan-kichi, take this!

473
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,140
Oh! I'll be saved!

474
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,140
Hehehe!

475
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Lemon-chan?

476
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,420
Yes, yes, I understand!

477
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,960
I'm sorry, but today's training will be canceled.

478
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:00,940
I'm sorry, but today's training will be canceled.

479
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,200
I'm sorry, but today's training will be canceled.

480
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,080
Ah...

481
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,020
I'm sorry...

482
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,060
Let's go!

483
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,680
Ryo-tsu's boss!

484
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh!

485
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,840
Kanbi!

486
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,200
Hmm?

487
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,880
Ryo-ryo-ryo-ryo!

488
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,600
Ryo-ryo-ryo-ryo!

489
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,680
All right!

490
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,260
Hey, you're pretty fast!

491
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,100
I've been driving at 200km/h!

492
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,300
All right!

493
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,700
Ouch!

494
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,400
Huh?

495
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,760
I'll go, too!

496
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,860
No! It's too dangerous!

497
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,740
But...

498
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,260
Trust me!

499
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,420
No, no, no! I want to go, too!

500
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,080
Oh, no...

501
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,760
Oh...

502
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,500
Ryo-chan!

503
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,140
I'm sorry!

504
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,660
We were following you, but you kidnapped Lemon-chan!

505
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,260
It can't be helped!

506
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,540
They were the ones who were the top!

507
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,400
Anyway, you came to the right place!

508
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
I'm counting on Sabrina!

509
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,220
And you follow Kanbei's instructions inside!

510
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,000
All right!

511
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,720
Sabrina, wait for me!

512
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,660
I'll definitely bring Lemon home!

513
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,300
Really?

514
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,100
Yes!

515
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,340
Promise?

516
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,620
I promise!

517
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,860
All right! I promise!

518
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,800
I promise!

519
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,420
Let's go!

520
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,060
Ryo-ryo-ryo-ryo!

521
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,880
Ryo-ryo-ryo-ryo!

522
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,640
Move!

523
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,620
Kanbei, can you hear me?

524
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,340
Yes!

525
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,180
The Ryokai are heading for Ryogoku!

526
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,260
I got it!

527
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,880
Ryo-ryo-ryo-ryo!

528
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,360
Huh?

529
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,100
It's my turn!

530
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,020
All right!

531
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,360
Damn it! My body's all wet!

532
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,520
Ryo-ryo-ryo-ryo, over there!

533
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,680
Are you planning to escape to Tokyo Bay?

534
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,040
Don't think you can escape from me!

535
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,040
Don't think you can escape from me!

536
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,760
Damn it!

537
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,600
You're on a drone, aren't you?

538
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,300
I'm ready!

539
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,180
We're going to make sure you don't catch on!

540
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,960
If you come this far, you'll never catch on!

541
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,380
I'm sure Kanchi will come and save you.

542
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,540
I'm sure Kanchi will come and save you.

543
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,640
I believe you, Kanchi!

544
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,900
What the hell?

545
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:13,780
What the hell?

546
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,720
Oh?

547
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,860
Don't be a fool, it's not just a game of chess.

548
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,160
Love the sea and protect justice.

549
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
Who called you, Poseidon?

550
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,640
I'll put you in a tank, Tansunigon!

551
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,440
Special Detective, one of the Sandglass, Dolphindecker!

552
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,480
Kadoima Sword!

553
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,620
Hahaha! I was asked to bring Ryo and I came to get Lemon-chan back!

554
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,360
Well then, I'm going!

555
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,980
Senpai, please be careful.

556
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:03,260
I'll break through the wall with my gun!

557
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,140
Come, Dolphin!

558
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,380
Amazing!

559
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,800
I'll break through! I'll break through even more!

560
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,180
Good, good! I'll show you a more amazing move!

561
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,620
Bravo!

562
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,680
Did you see that divine move?

563
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,040
Hm?

564
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,420
Where did he go?

565
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,720
Oh no!

566
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,940
What the hell are you doing?

567
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,320
Kanaguchi!

568
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,760
Hey, what's up?

569
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,820
A large cruiser with unknown nationality is landing ahead of the kidnappers.

570
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,720
They're going to get on it.

571
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,020
If the cruiser runs away to the Pacific, it'll be a disaster!

572
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,180
Before that, we need to do something!

573
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,640
Huh?

574
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,500
Captain Burgliew, you're here!

575
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,940
The Ryukai are planning to take over the large cruiser in front of them and escape!

576
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,040
I see.

577
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,780
So we just need to get the hell out of here before that, right?

578
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,380
Yeah!

579
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,720
Leave it to me!

580
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,520
It's about time.

581
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,900
Yeah, it's going to be easy.

582
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,300
It'll get you on the money when you do it.

583
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:52,800
hopefully.

584
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,080
It won't be so easy!

585
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,360
No way!

586
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,320
Lock him up?

587
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,180
Fire!

588
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,700
Romeo!

589
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,080
What?

590
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:08,900
What's that?

591
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,200
D-don't you want to kill him more!?

592
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,600
Why is there even a truce between the Americans!?

593
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,040
This can't be the same debacle as Kanaguchi.

594
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,800
I'm not going to let you get away with this!

595
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:19,980
Romeo!

596
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,340
What's going on?

597
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:22,860
It's a U-turn!

598
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,260
Ryotsu, should we sink the motorboat?

599
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,800
You bastard! The lemon's on it!

600
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,220
Ha ha ha!

601
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,100
I knew it!

602
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,780
I'm praying for success!

603
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,840
Good luck!

604
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,440
Ugh...

605
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,220
Ugh...

606
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,320
Oh, Eder!

607
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,200
What's wrong?

608
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,860
It looks like a weirdo is following us!

609
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,280
The front helicopter is his job too!

610
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,260
I'll shoot him down!

611
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,960
Stop!

612
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,400
I don't have any weapons!

613
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,840
That way!

614
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,940
Yes!

615
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,060
Take this!

616
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,640
Now, this way!

617
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,960
This way!

618
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,580
Good job!

619
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,120
What is this?!

620
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,840
Aaaaah!

621
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,420
What's going on?

622
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,400
A strange man is...

623
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:23,820
Huh?

624
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,300
I'm not just talking about other things.

625
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,980
When an accident occurs on land,

626
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,060
I solve everything with a single pan!

627
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,300
One of the special detective, Sandbarglass...

628
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,860
...Kaipande!

629
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,240
I'm back!

630
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,160
Haaah...

631
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,220
He looks like a traitor!

632
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,020
I don't care!

633
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,000
I'll take care of him!

634
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:47,940
Roger!

635
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,720
Uwaaaah!

636
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,200
Hmph!

637
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:54,800
Hmph!

638
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,040
What's this guy doing on the floor?

639
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,160
A regular banana?

640
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,160
Hmph!

641
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,480
What? A gun?!

642
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,500
Ugh!

643
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,760
Ugh!

644
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,380
Hmph!

645
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,880
Hmph!

646
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,020
You let the enemy escape, but you're still acting cool!

647
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,360
You're too naive, Ryotsu.

648
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,760
Instead of a gun, you used a GPS transmitter.

649
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,440
Oh! I've reviewed Kaipande!

650
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,100
Huh?

651
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,100
Oh...

652
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,340
It's so embarrassing!

653
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,780
Ryotsu!

654
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,240
I've informed the kidnappers of the place where the 100 billion minoshiro money will be transferred.

655
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,880
What?! The Haneda Airport?!

656
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,400
I've told them to prepare the charter plane, so I'm going overseas.

657
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,440
I won't let you!

658
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,840
Thanks to Kaipande's transmitter,

659
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,380
we can trace the location of the kidnappers!

660
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,360
Then, lead me!

661
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,020
...

662
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,180
Get on the high speed!

663
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,440
Yes!

664
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:56,880
...

665
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,240
...

666
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,140
It can't be helped! Turn right there!

667
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,800
Yes!

668
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,540
...

669
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,860
What's that?!

670
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,960
Why is the plane stopped?!

671
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,520
...

672
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,600
It's not just a cool transformation!

673
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,260
Look at the moon's energy on its back!

674
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,040
Hey! Turn right there!

675
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,520
Yes!

676
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,080
...

677
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,180
Hey! The factory isn't finished yet!

678
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,360
...

679
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,660
...

680
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,400
...

681
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,560
...

682
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:34,660
...

683
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:34,780
...

684
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,580
...

685
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,880
...

686
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,380
...

687
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:41,960
...

688
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,620
...

689
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:44,680
...

690
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,500
...

691
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:45,520
...

692
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,540
...

693
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,740
...

694
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,940
...

695
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,740
Are you serious!?

696
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,140
Aaaaaah!

697
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,480
Eh, eh...?

698
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,540
Aaaaaah!

699
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:01,740
Ouch!

700
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,960
Aaaaaah!

701
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,040
Aaaaaah!

702
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,940
Aaaaaah!

703
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,360
Aaaaaah!

704
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,940
Aaaaaah!

705
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,320
The End

706
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,660
The following Kochikame Special is brought to you by the following sponsors.

707
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,720
The following Kochikame Special is brought to you by the following sponsors.

708
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,660
The following Kochikame Special is brought to you by the following sponsors.

709
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:38,340
Grandma! You're here again!

710
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,800
Leader! The cute girl is dirty!

711
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,240
Don't show her!

712
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,220
Get her out of here!

713
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,860
Let's go, Matai!

714
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,760
I'm coming!

715
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,560
Aaaaaah!

716
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,300
Aaaaaah!

717
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,880
Aaaaaah!

718
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,140
Aaaaaah!

719
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,500
Aaaaaaah!

720
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,360
Aaaaaah!

721
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,220
Aaaaaaah!

722
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,580
Damn you, Teru!

723
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:41,320
Remo-chan!

724
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:42,720
Damn you!

725
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,760
You can't run away anymore!

726
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,680
Throw your weapons and raise your hands!

727
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,140
Die!

728
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,460
Game over, huh?

729
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,040
Hmph!

730
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,160
How about that?

731
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,760
You even have bombs ready!

732
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,080
Get even closer!

733
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,300
Prince, you're the best!

734
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,140
As expected of the leader!

735
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:12,520
Stop fooling around!

736
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,380
Let go of that girl!

737
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,780
I'm the real Sabrina!

738
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,860
What?!

739
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,460
What are you talking about?!

740
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,040
I'm the real one!

741
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,500
But...

742
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,200
I can't let you get in the way of the danger anymore!

743
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,760
Ugh!

744
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,520
It doesn't matter if you're a princess or a fake!

745
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,420
When this bomb explodes,

746
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,460
the 500-meter radius will be covered with flames!

747
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,800
Now!

748
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,440
Leave one of the Padogas behind,

749
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,860
and all of you leave this place!

750
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,000
How's that?!

751
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,720
Stay where you are!

752
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,040
Urrgh!

753
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,320
Sheila!

754
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,460
What a shame!

755
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,400
Now!

756
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,320
Wah!

757
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,720
Nn?!

758
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,020
Grandma!

759
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,080
Wait up!

760
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,920
Are you alright, Lemon?!

761
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:03,680
Woah!

762
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,520
Lemon!

763
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,680
I'm so glad we met!

764
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,300
Sabrina!

765
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,240
Yes!

766
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,120
Lemon!

767
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,020
Sabrina!

768
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,400
Gakuchi!

769
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,060
I thought you would definitely help me out!

770
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,180
Thank you, Kankichi!

771
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,280
You two are safe and sound!

772
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,720
Senpai!

773
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,280
What's wrong, Honda?

774
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,940
I heard a strange sound coming from inside...

775
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:30,060
The dimensional device may have started to operate on the fallen cover.

776
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,340
What?!

777
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,820
Hey!

778
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,680
I knew it!

779
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:39,880
You're weird!

780
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:40,600
You're weird!

781
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,420
Everyone, let's run away!

782
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,560
I'm going to fly like a flying dragon!

783
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:00,660
Huh? Senpai?

784
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,440
Senpai?!

785
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,240
Kankichi, where are you going?!

786
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:08,860
Rats!

787
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,960
I won't be able to make it out of here if I use the Sky Tree Elevator!

788
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:25,640
What's that idiot going to do?!

789
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,000
Oh, Kankichi!

790
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,660
I see!

791
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,440
The Sky Tree is 634 meters high.

792
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:37,700
Did Senpai go up the Sky Tree because he heard that the explosion was 500 meters long?!

793
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,580
So that's what it was.

794
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,120
Trying to stop the damage from the explosion to the minimum.

795
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,060
Kankichi, you're so...

796
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,580
I'll do my best, Kankichi.

797
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,880
I'm counting on you!

798
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,400
Ryosu, there's no time left!

799
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,660
I'll do my best with this!

800
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,180
I can't do this anymore!

801
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,940
I have no choice but to get back up!

802
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:26,340
Now all we have to do is throw it far away!

803
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,520
This isn't the time to be being pushed by the wind!

804
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,000
That's right!

805
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,820
What?

806
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,060
What?!

807
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:08,700
Taito wants to help Kuro!

808
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,040
And I'm here for you!

809
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,760
Kankichi!

810
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,720
There is no way Kankichi will die!

811
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:46,760
Please help me, please help me!!

812
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,000
Kaakichi!!!!

813
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,420
I'm not going to die.

814
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,220
I'm going to die.

815
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,080
I'm going to die.

816
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,900
I'm going to die.

817
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,440
I'm going to die.

818
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,360
I'm going to die.

819
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,080
I'm going to die.

820
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,100
I'm going to die.

821
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,140
I'm going to die.

822
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,820
I'm going to die.

823
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,320
I'm going to die.

824
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:42,940
I'm going to die.

825
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,400
You saved the lives of many people who protected the underground city.

826
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,900
Of course, it's heaven.

827
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,400
You're an idiot.

828
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,580
There are more evil spirits in the Noenma Town.

829
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,460
So, are you going to hell?

830
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,720
Don't decide that on your own.

831
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,440
Those who don't want you to go to hell are so desperate.

832
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,060
So, are you going to heaven?

833
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,140
No, no, no, no, no, no.

834
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:06,660
No.

835
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,240
Heaven is also a human.

836
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,660
Where do you think you are walking around?

837
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:14,600
They drop their weapon.

838
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,000
I'm going to die.

839
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,600
There's nothing to be done.

840
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,660
I'm going to die.

841
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,000
Stay here.

842
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,980
I want to die.

843
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,480
I'm going to die.

844
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,720
*cries*

845
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,280
*cries*

846
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,800
*cries*

847
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,120
*cries*

848
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,560
*cries*

849
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,640
*cries*

850
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,220
What's all of you doing here?

851
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,380
Kankichi!

852
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,280
Kankichi! Ryo-chan!

853
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,340
Senpai! Senpai!

854
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,520
*cries*

855
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,900
*cries*

856
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,680
Kakuwa!

857
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,340
*cries*

858
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,080
*cries*

859
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,120
*cries*

860
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,180
*cries*

861
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,080
*cries*

862
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,060
*cries*

863
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,060
*cries*

864
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,180
*cries*

865
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:20,660
*cries*

866
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:27,600
*cries*

867
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:57,580
The power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the

power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of

869
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,400
Hey, Ryotsu! Don't you wait!

870
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,220
I won't pay even if I pay you back!

871
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,300
Hey, wait! Ryotsu!

872
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,420
I will never accept it!

873
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:38,680
I won't!

874
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:14,600
I felt a strange feeling at that time

875
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,260
So I walked on the black road of Akeidogai

876
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:23,160
I saw it

877
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,400
Everyone was a child once

878
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,820
But everyone forgets

879
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,100
It's a politician with a great face

880
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,960
And a blue aunt above her eyes

881
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,260
Turn around and look at that corner

882
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,960
You will meet everyone

883
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,900
Let's go!

884
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,180
There is a wall

885
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,700
There must be a wall

886
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,660
Everyone, let's go to our town

887
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,700
Thank you!

888
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,800
Thank you!

889
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,500
After this, we have a message from Akimoto-sensei!

890
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,680
Akimoto-sensei's message

891
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,540
Did you enjoy it?

892
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,980
Thank you for everything!

893
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,680
See you later!
