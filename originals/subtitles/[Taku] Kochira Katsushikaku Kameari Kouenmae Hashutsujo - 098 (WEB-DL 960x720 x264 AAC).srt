1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,800
Jaguar

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,320
When you watch TV

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,860
light up the room and try to get away

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:22,120
Looking at the sunset that floats on the inside

5
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,400
Even if I'm begging or begging the town will not at all change

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,400
They're all so gentle

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,460
From the water in the Tungari Forest

8
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,320
To the Taishakuten

9
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,480
Snow is falling

10
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,100
Falling

11
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,740
Tomorrow is already over

12
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,260
Katsushika Shibamata

13
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,400
I lost my happiness

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,760
I realized it

15
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,620
Because I'm stupid

16
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,500
It's a story that doesn't make sense

17
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,520
It's a story that doesn't make sense

18
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,960
Everyone, I bought some juice

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,140
Wow, it's bottle-filled juice

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,280
It's rare to find bottle-filled juice

21
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,780
Yeah, these days there are only cans and plastic bottles

22
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,500
You can't buy bottles

23
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,500
Right? I found it in a bar and bought it without thinking

24
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,600
That's right, Sen-Nuki, Sen-Nuki

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,260
If this happens, it's a strange guy

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,580
Oh no, there's no Sen-Nuki

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,220
I'm in trouble

28
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,480
Sen-Nuki is a little too much

29
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,920
I can't open it without Sen-Nuki

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,360
I don't use Sen-Nuki these days

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,660
I don't need Sen-Nuki

32
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,260
I'll take it out like this

33
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,740
I can't believe it

34
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,000
My teeth don't break

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,620
My teeth were strong since I was a child

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,180
It's not a big deal

37
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,840
I opened 6 cans of beer in the last minute

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,000
6 cans? 72 cans?

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,900
I bet with my brother at the bar

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,920
I bet with my brother at the bar

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,400
When money gets involved, Ryo-chan does everything

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
Well

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,880
Then I'll give you yours for free

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:58,760
You have to lend me your hand

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,260
What?

46
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,740
Horrible

47
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,520
The diamonds are cut in half

48
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,180
That's amazing

49
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,640
Humiliating skin

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,920
My teeth are not that strong.

51
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,200
I'm a phone.

52
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,260
Rocker.

53
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,740
Helmet.

54
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,360
Dog.

55
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,020
How is it?

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,820
Do you see how strong my teeth are?

57
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,980
Ryo, my forefinger.

58
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,520
What happened to your forefinger?

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,920
There's no forefinger.

60
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,000
That's amazing. What's going on?

61
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,400
Chief, my forefinger.

62
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,320
What? There's no forefinger.

63
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,120
It's gone.

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,980
That's the limit of teeth.

65
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,900
You've been doing this for a long time.

66
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,300
You're doing it on your own.

67
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,500
Ryo.

68
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,620
My forefinger.

69
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:08,900
It was here.

70
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,320
Damn it.

71
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,200
I'm not brave enough to take it off because of love.

72
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,120
You.

73
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,580
It's okay, senior.

74
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,840
You should go to the dentist soon.

75
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,100
I'm proud that I've never been to the dentist.

76
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,020
I can't be proud of that.

77
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,840
Go to the dentist now.

78
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,480
But the treatment cost may be high if you have a forefinger.

79
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,840
That's right.

80
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,500
If you use a ceramic tooth, you have to prepare for 100,000 yen.

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,760
What?

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,840
100,000 yen?

83
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,040
100,000 yen for a single tooth?

84
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm not kidding.

85
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
I'll fix it with instant adhesive.

86
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,740
Tooth is like plastic.

87
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,380
If you stick it to the teeth on both sides, it will return to the original state.

88
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,280
It's a great way to fix it.

89
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,780
It's like a plastic model.

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,020
Gently. Gently.

91
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,520
I got it on my teeth.

92
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,280
I got it on my teeth.

93
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,320
You idiot.

94
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,760
What did you do?

95
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,940
You should take your teeth off sooner than that.

96
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,860
Ryo.

97
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,160
I'll take it off for you.

98
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,900
Come here.

99
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,620
I'm counting on you.

100
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,800
It's hard.

101
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,680
It hurts.

102
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,620
I don't want to.

103
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,740
I got another tooth off with it.

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,160
What?

105
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,420
Ouch.

106
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,140
I'll fix it with a string.

107
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,200
I'll fix it again.

108
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,780
Yes.

109
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,060
This time.

110
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:46,220
I got it on a different place again.

111
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,060
Why do I get a lot of dents today?

112
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,660
I'll take it off this time.

113
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,420
I see.

114
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,100
Please.

115
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,920
I got four dents off.

116
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,500
Ryo.

117
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,920
Before it's irreversible,

118
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,580
why don't you go to the dentist?

119
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,480
Chief.

120
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,900
How much do you think it'll cost

121
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,820
Or will you pay for the treatment?

122
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,940
Why do I have to go that far?

123
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,280
If you have four teeth,

124
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,900
you can live long enough.

125
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
I don't know.

126
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,000
The remaining teeth might be gone.

127
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,200
I don't want to see someone who works too hard.

128
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,060
Hey, Reiko.

129
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,780
Don't scare me.

130
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,140
Ryo.

131
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,720
You've been doing well.

132
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,160
I'm glad you're doing well.

133
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,820
You didn't even brush your teeth.

134
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,180
No, I didn't.

135
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,160
I brush my teeth once a month.

136
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,040
Normally, I brush my teeth every day.

137
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,460
In your case,

138
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,560
the balance of nutrition is also very bad.

139
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
Maybe, maybe.

140
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,480
What is the balance of nutrition?

141
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,980
What makes your teeth strong?

142
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,960
It's a lot of calcium.

143
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Like, chrysanthemum, and other things.

144
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,860
If you're good at calcium, there's something.

145
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,320
Come to me.

146
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,760
I'm not late.

147
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,120
It doesn't taste good at all.

148
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,600
It's bad.

149
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,740
You drank it all at once.

150
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,100
More importantly,

151
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,460
it's important to brush your teeth.

152
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,720
That's right.

153
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,820
I can say that.

154
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,700
Oh, no.

155
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,660
I don't have a toothbrush.

156
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,940
Ryo hasn't had one since the beginning.

157
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,540
This is fine.

158
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,120
I don't have one.

159
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,580
Hey, you have no friends.

160
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,300
If you don't have any, this is fine.

161
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,400
What?

162
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
I thought it was a big toothbrush.

163
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,220
Ryo.

164
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,560
That...

165
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,460
That's a cleaning brush.

166
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,420
Why...

167
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,540
Why would you leave it here?

168
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,280
Fool.

169
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,240
Ryo.

170
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,660
Senpai.

171
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,440
I'll give it to you if you like.

172
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,940
Now!

173
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,600
You're late.

174
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,540
I'm fine.

175
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,340
I can polish my nails with Cresol.

176
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,860
You're too good to watch.

177
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,680
Ryo, don't die.

178
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,100
What's next?

179
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,720
I have to brush my teeth.

180
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,360
Ryo, you're so annoying.

181
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,460
You're like a old man in a lullaby.

182
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,680
You're like a old man in a lullaby.

183
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,820
You idiot!

184
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,180
You're going to die!

185
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,040
What are you doing?

186
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,580
I'm going to kill you!

187
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,840
Ryo, the car stopped.

188
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,660
You haven't made any mistakes.

189
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,040
Senior, are you still there?

190
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,600
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,280
Ryo!

192
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,760
Ryo, please hurry up!

193
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,700
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,760
Hurry up, Ryo!

195
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,800
Senior!

196
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,380
Ryo!

197
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,740
Ryo!

198
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,240
You did it, Ryo!

199
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,180
Ryo!

200
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,820
Senior!

201
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,640
Ryo!

202
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,580
It's finally over.

203
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,460
What's wrong?

204
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,960
Ryo, you're not talking.

205
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,500
What?

206
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,560
You put too much glue on it, and the upper and lower teeth are stuck together.

207
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,840
What?

208
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,240
Ryo!

209
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,140
Yes, Ryo!

210
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,660
Say hello, Mamoru.

211
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,280
What?

212
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,220
Can I say hello?

213
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,160
Is that okay?

214
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,100
Is that okay?

215
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,920
What?

216
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,620
What?

217
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:38,980
No!

218
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,920
Don't say such a stupid thing!

219
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,440
So, are you sure you don't want to go back to school?

221
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,780
I don't think so.

222
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,080
Yes!

223
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,120
Ryo!

224
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,480
Ryo!

225
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,140
Ryo!

226
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,660
Ryo!

227
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,160
Ryo!

228
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,040
Mr. Oda, are you all right?

229
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,820
N-no!

230
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,620
But, I do want to make it right this time!

231
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,420
Then, can I go home?

232
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,640
Yes!

233
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,260
Here's the slip!

234
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,720
My... My... My tooth...

235
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,820
You have no choice but to put it in the dentist's office.

236
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,060
No, the dentist's office is expensive.

237
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,340
If you want to spend 400,000 yen, you should make your own dentures.

238
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,560
Ryo.

239
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,580
What?

240
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,140
They say that when you get older, you become useless.

241
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,040
Even if you have a lot of strength, you're already an old man.

242
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,240
What?

243
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,640
Senior, I'll ask the dentist to make you a cheap denture.

244
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,480
I'll take good care of you on your old days.

245
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,280
Ryo.

246
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,220
What?

247
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,260
You don't need a denture anymore?

248
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,180
If you ask the dentist's office,

249
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,820
all the dentures you lost were all dentures.

250
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:15,780
What?

251
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,020
That's why you'll have a long-term denture from now on.

252
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,880
One, two, one, two...

253
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,720
Gently, gently.

254
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes, yes.

255
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,240
Normally, you would have a long-term denture from a denture when you were in elementary school.

256
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,660
When I asked the dentist, he said he had never lost a single tooth.

257
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,800
Then, Ryo, have you always lived with a denture?

258
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,680
That's what it means.

259
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,860
Oh, Chief. Ryo is cute.

260
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,020
Ryo.

261
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,360
Look! Look!

262
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,180
Wow!

263
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,060
This is...

264
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,520
It's pretty...

265
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,740
It's a cute denture.

266
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,060
It just grew this morning.

267
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,060
It's like a baby's tooth, and it's cute, right?

268
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,700
Seriously, you were a kid not only in your head, but also in your teeth.

269
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,540
If you have a tooth, I'll make you think about it.

270
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,080
I'll take good care of your teeth next time, Ryo.

271
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,440
See you!

272
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,000
See ya!

273
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,080
Ryo's Love

274
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,540
I don't know what this is, but I won the prize.

275
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,300
This is because I'm a good person.

276
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,500
Well, I think the address is somewhere around here.

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,120
Here it is.

278
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,920
I have a bad feeling about this.

279
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,760
I told you!

280
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,320
Let's go!

281
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,160
I knew it.

282
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,500
Russian tea tastes like Perestroika while doing Cossack dance.

283
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,740
I know the difference, Ezaki Korosuke!

284
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,420
It's you again, Professor Ezaki!

285
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,760
Long time no see, Gorilla-kun.

286
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,740
You came from England, France, and China.

287
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,440
Since when did you become a Russian?

288
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,860
I became a Russian-Kaburo!

289
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,880
I saw you on TV last week.

290
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,180
On TV?

291
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,820
Did you call me to show your bad dance?

292
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,320
No!

293
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,140
No, Gorilla-kun.

294
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,420
You'll go to the moon with me.

295
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,420
The moon?

296
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,040
What's this in the chimney of the bathhouse?

297
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,100
That's where you are, Gorilla-kun.

298
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,120
You used to be an astronaut

299
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,780
and you're now a pilot in an artificial satellite.

300
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,560
I want you to be brave enough to get on a plane in the Soviet Union.

301
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,200
Why are you putting a dog on it?

302
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,260
Why do I have to go to the moon

303
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,600
It's been kept a secret until now,

304
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,420
but there's a huge diamond on the moon.

305
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,320
What? A diamond?

306
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,300
The crater on the surface of the moon.

307
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,600
Do you know why it was made?

308
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,860
I don't know.

309
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,080
The crater on the moon was built in the old days.

310
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,680
But it was made by the collapse of a meteor.

311
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,500
And because of its enormous pressure,

312
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,160
a huge diamond is sleeping in the crater on the moon.

313
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,900
Let's do it, professor.

314
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,380
The universe is the love and romance of mankind.

315
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,260
No!

316
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,920
Sweep! Sweep!

317
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,320
Thank you, Gorilla-kun.

318
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,560
Now you're a Japanese who followed Mori-san, Mukai-san, and Wakata-san

319
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,420
and flew to the universe.

320
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,980
Ha ha ha ha ha.

321
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,340
Oops.

322
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,260
I forgot Gachapin and Akiyama-san.

323
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,880
When you decide, let's go!

324
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,060
Roger that.

325
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,040
I'll tell them to hurry up.

326
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:41,960
OK.

327
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,660
I'm ready.

328
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,260
OK. Let's go!

329
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,740
Hey, I'm not on the seat yet!

330
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,000
What a cheater.

331
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,960
Gorilla-kun, get on the seat!

332
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,020
It sounds dangerous being on the seat.

333
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,880
You're the one being dangerous!

334
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,140
The three swords are separated!

335
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,700
Why!

336
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,360
What was that?

337
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,400
Forget that.

338
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,260
Instead, let's spend a toast to all the nations over there.

339
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,780
He's interested.

340
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,260
But when it's in the tube, it's like a juice from a liquor store.

341
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,680
Cheers!

342
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,780
Is this a walker?

343
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,460
No, it's a different man.

344
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,060
You still can't drink, but you're drinking strong sake.

345
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,920
It's disgusting!

346
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,660
Don't spit in a place like this! It's weightlessness!

347
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:56,740
It's weightlessness!

348
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,660
We're here!

349
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,500
It's as fast as a cartoon.

350
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,600
We have to hurry up and get to work.

351
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,260
Take a picture of the earth in the bag.

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
We're not here for sightseeing.

353
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,680
I'll take it by myself.

354
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,840
Wait, I want to take it too.

355
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,200
Next, we'll take it before the landing.

356
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,020
I'll take it.

357
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,340
Now that we've taken a picture, it's about time.

358
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:31,800
I'm going home.

359
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,700
Are you kidding me?

360
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,860
I just came to the moon and took a picture of the moon.

361
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,380
I cut off the excess oxygen and fuel earlier, so I can't go home.

362
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,500
What?

363
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,380
That's right, that's right, that's right.

364
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,620
That's right, that's right, that's right.

365
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,640
That's right, that's right, that's right.

366
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,780
I came to the moon with my life.

367
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,360
I have to go home without achieving my goal.

368
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,720
That's right.

369
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,320
I took a commemorative photo at a precious time.

370
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,260
I don't have time to dig a diamond anymore.

371
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,520
5 minutes ago

372
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,940
What's that voice?

373
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,080
It's a computer.

374
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,140
It's manual when it comes, but it's automatic when it goes home.

375
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,820
What?

376
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,800
Damn it.

377
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,680
I can go home with a water-sweep.

378
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,040
Gorilla-kun!

379
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,680
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamond!

380
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,200
Gorilla-kun, there's no time left!

381
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,040
3 minutes left.

382
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,140
Hey, there's only 3 minutes left!

383
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:30,880
Shut up!

384
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,280
If I don't get a diamond, I'll bury you and go home!

385
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,600
What's wrong, Gorilla-kun?

386
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,360
There's some strange stone.

387
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,460
What?

388
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,280
This is...

389
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,020
It's a real diamond!

390
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,040
I did it!

391
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,160
The moon really had a diamond!

392
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,420
I knew my idea was correct.

393
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,740
I'll find more.

394
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,140
Damn it.

395
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,080
Is it time to go?

396
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,680
No, it's tea time.

397
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,120
Don't do anything weird!

398
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm a duck.

399
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,580
The Russian tea I drink while looking at the far earth is still special.

400
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
I remember the dawn of Moscow from the Siberian Railway.

401
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,180
I've only seen it on TV.

402
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,280
What?

403
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,560
What?

404
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,060
Is it time to have a snack at 3 o'clock?

405
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,060
No, Gorilla-kun.

406
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,700
It's time to go!

407
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,840
What?

408
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,280
Damn it!

409
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,160
You used the bell!

410
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,080
Hurry, Gorilla-kun!

411
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,220
There's a giant diamond here!

412
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,340
It's quite heavy even if it's 1/6 heavier than the earth.

413
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,940
It's time to go.

414
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,420
Engine, change.

415
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,580
Gorilla-kun!

416
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,680
Wait!

417
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,020
No!

418
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,780
It's automatic!

419
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,180
Hey, you!

420
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,580
Don't leave me!

421
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,520
You're late no matter how much you yell.

422
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,600
I'm weak.

423
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,200
How can I go home?

424
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,460
Well, I'll think about how to go home later.

425
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,100
He left his senior in the moon?

426
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,380
He was looking for a diamond and was late to the rocket.

427
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,160
But did he really go to the moon?

428
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,620
Of course.

429
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,160
See?

430
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,920
That's right.

431
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,920
He really took a photo.

432
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,380
That idiot.

433
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,660
Ryo-chan.

434
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm worried because he left it alone.

435
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,360
Don't worry.

436
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,780
Professor, Ryo-chan has a good life.

437
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,320
He can live anywhere.

438
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,560
I see.

439
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,000
I think I can do something about that Gorilla-kun.

440
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,740
Even if he's a senior, he has a partner.

441
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,800
I see.

442
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,180
Ryo-chan, are you okay?

443
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,120
Yes.

444
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,440
I'm tired of looking for a diamond.

445
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,820
I'm getting hungry.

446
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,840
I wonder if there's a convenience store.

447
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,540
What is that?

448
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,280
It's a moon car used in the Apollo project.

449
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,600
Did you leave it?

450
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,000
What a waste.

451
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,900
So, it's moving!

452
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,820
That's good.

453
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,780
But there is no food.

454
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,600
It's a spaceship.

455
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,720
Did anyone else left the moon other than Apollo?

456
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,080
This is classic again.

457
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,560
This is a oxygen retention device.

458
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,600
Yes.

459
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,600
It's an astronaut.

460
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,220
You touch the seed of a plant.

461
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,980
Water from the plants is also left.

462
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
This will help us to eat.

463
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,500
But it might be better to stay on the moon than to go far away.

464
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,360
In the 21st century, the general public will come to the moon.

465
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,780
I will own this moon as the first resident of the moon.

466
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,140
I decided.

467
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,200
I will go to war before the real estate agent comes.

468
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,260
It's too early.

469
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,400
First, I will build a space ship.

470
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,260
The city plan is the beginning.

471
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,320
This is the center of the moon.

472
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,760
The roads are all large 5-way roads.

473
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,760
There is no traffic jam until 100 years later.

474
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,760
If there is no grass, it will be a blizzard.

475
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,860
I will make a rock.

476
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,580
I will write the company's name.

477
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,660
It's not too far until the second power plant opens.

478
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,600
Here is the��Brain.

479
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,620
Is it the reflection of the moon?

480
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,560
It's a Dutch windmill.

481
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,500
There's a pyramid and a sphinx.

482
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,540
The Kremlin Palace.

483
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,540
Also the outside of Paris.

484
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,660
There's a goddess of freedom.

485
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,820
It's amazing.

486
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,500
We're on the moon.

487
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,340
There was no problem with the space rover pictures.

488
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,300
But who did this?

489
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,560
In the lazy.

490
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,120
What's the real estate agent scripture there?

491
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,480
Means?

492
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,100
What?

493
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,620
You're just entering people's homes!

494
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,880
It's been three months since then, but Senpai hasn't come back.

495
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,160
There's no way he'll come back so easily.

496
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,080
I don't know if he's alive or dead.

497
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,520
Everyone, we're doing the news about the moon.

498
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,320
What?

499
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,660
The moon's surface has transformed, so the investigation team went to the moon several times.

500
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,980
Every time, they were missing.

501
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,400
But the third investigation team sent us a picture to solve the mystery.

502
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,760
A picture to solve the mystery.

503
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,120
A mysterious creature is being shown to the camera of one of the investigation teams.

504
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,500
Please look to the upper left.

505
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,020
And the creature suddenly attacks the investigation team.

506
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,800
Two seconds later, the camera was broken and the image disappeared.

507
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,920
P-President, no way!

508
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,240
Now, I'd like to ask Professor Ezaki of the Space Center.

509
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,880
Oh, Professor Ezaki!

510
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,400
It looks like a creature very close to humanity.

511
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,380
But his intelligence is very weak.

512
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,380
It looks like a creature very close to humanity.

513
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,840
He looks very plain, but not very atrocious.

514
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:11,920
Good to know.

515
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,400
Thank you.

516
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,920
Other suspicious creatures are found.

517
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,400
The~The~Black~Hand~It +5

518
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,160
His analysis is being progressed rapidly.

519
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,580
That's the police # #!

520
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,340
Senpai is the "senpai".

521
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,220
Ryo...

522
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,800
That idiot...!

523
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,980
Everyone, welcome to the Earth!

524
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,980
Keep your voice down!

525
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,340
One more time!

526
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,200
Yes.

527
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,080
Everyone, welcome to the Earth!

528
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,360
Everyone, welcome to the Earth!

529
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,020
Welcome to Earth!

530
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,920
If you want to stay, go to Ryotsu Hotel.

531
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:50,240
If you need a car, go to Ryotsu Taxi.

532
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:56,120
If you want to buy something, go to Ryotsu Department Store.

533
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,520
Welcome to Ryotsu Planet!

534
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,060
The End

535
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,880
Boss, don't go so far away.

536
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,740
Come on, come on.

537
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,860
More, more.

538
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,800
No, stay away, stay away.

539
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,500
No, come on.

540
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,360
No, no, don't come close.

541
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,720
Stay away, come on.

542
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,640
Stop, step back.

543
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,260
Don't move.

544
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,120
Stop, help me, do something.

545
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,260
Next time, the ultimate explanation, the end, right?

546
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,760
Boss!

547
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:49,920
It was really it that made us strong, everyone.

548
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,880
Then it was not a small problem.

549
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,380
Nothing bad happened.

550
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:53,860
I'm sorry, but we'll go on to the next stage.

551
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,320
We'll get back to where we were.

552
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:54,360
Hmm.

553
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,000
If it's this, then we won't be able to come so far away from this job.

554
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,220
What?

555
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,500
