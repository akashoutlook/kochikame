1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,040
Unlucky

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,080
"When you watch TV, please light up your room and look away."

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,600
"The Unlucky

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:13,760
"The Unlucky

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,000
"The Unlucky

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,560
Come to me, the unlucky

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,140
I'm not here, but I'm worried

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,360
"Look at the blue sky and the white clouds."

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,800
"You'll manage somehow."

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:57,540
"Don't you have any work?"

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,960
Come to me!

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,460
I'm not here, but don't worry

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,900
Look! A red cloud is burning

14
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,540
It'll be all right somehow

15
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,560
You know it, right?

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,360
You know it, you know it!

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,660
If you know it, then keep quiet and follow me!

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,980
The Day of Electronics

19
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,420
The Day of Electronics?

20
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,140
Why is November 11 the Day of Electronics?

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,680
If you write November 11 in Kanji, it becomes plus, minus, plus, minus, right?

22
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,760
It's the day that was made to let you know the importance of electrical energy.

23
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,200
Hmm...

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,260
At Nakagawa Housing, we'll hold an event to commemorate that day.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,900
Will that event be awarded?

26
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,000
Awarded? Well, how do you say...

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,640
Nakagawa!

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,440
Yes?

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,880
Take me to that event venue!

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,100
I don't like it!

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,600
I get it!

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
I've been waiting for you, President.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:26,560
President!

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,140
This is Mr. Shoei, the owner of our Ecology Housing.

35
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,140
Hello, hello, hello.

36
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,540
I'm Shoei Netaro.

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,860
Nice to meet you.

38
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,620
Shoei Netaro now?

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,320
My father used to come here.

40
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,280
Please take care of the limited resources.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,380
That's my motto.

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,820
Please take a look.

43
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,740
This is our latest work, "Sun House: Sunflower".

44
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,640
It's an ordinary house, isn't it?

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,180
No, no. This house actually rotates towards the sun.

46
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,040
The house is rotating?

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,540
With this, the sun's light is always shining on the inside of the house.

48
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,640
It doesn't rotate?

49
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,200
It rotates once a day, so it hardly gets noticed.

50
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,240
But it's not shining as far from the house, right?

51
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,960
In that case...

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,700
The mirror opens!

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,320
What are you doing?

54
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,760
You're a robot that can transform.

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,500
He's a robot that can transform.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:33,820
He's a robot that can transform.

57
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,240
By adjusting the angle of the mirror,

58
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,200
I can get natural light to every corner of the room.

59
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,040
I can get natural light to every corner of the room.

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,500
This way, I can stay at home for a month.

61
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,840
This way, I can stay at home for a month.

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
You can go outside, right?

63
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,600
Some people don't like the way they work.

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,860
Some people don't like the way they work.

65
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,140
They are using natural light.

66
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,660
Recording and animation are often recorded underground.

67
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,000
Recording and animation are often recorded underground.

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,960
Why can't we do that?

69
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:57,760
Why can't we do that?

70
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,480
We can record anything we want

71
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:58,640
in the sun.

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,660
This is love.

73
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,600
It's like dreams,

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,620
working and tanning in summer.

75
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,060
It's like dreams, working and tanning in summer.

76
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,320
I don't like it in winter.

77
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,180
Is that so?

78
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,180
However,

79
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,040
This is our best idea, the ultimate energy-saving house

80
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,900
Self-electric power generation, "Energy-saving Jiro-kun"

81
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,300
The roof is made of solar panels

82
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,940
It also uses wind power to generate electricity

83
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,220
What if it's cloudy, rainy and the wind doesn't blow?

84
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,560
Don't worry

85
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,600
There's a bicycle in the house

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:46,960
Why?

87
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,300
What's this?

88
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,820
It's a charging system

89
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,980
When you can't use solar or wind power

90
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:04,260
You can easily generate electricity

91
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,560
So this house alone can save energy

92
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,580
We'll use this Jiro-kun to do the "Energy-saving house"

93
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,940
"Energy-saving house"

94
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,180
"Energy-saving house"

95
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,540
Look at this

96
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,260
"Energy-saving house"

97
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,260
"Energy-saving house"

98
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,400
"Energy-saving house"

99
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,360
"Energy-saving house"

100
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,500
We'll show you how to live in the energy-saving house for a week

101
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,620
The winning team will get

102
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,080
What?

103
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,720
That luxurious, golden "Shoyne House"

104
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,040
Wow!

105
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
It's a product you can't tell if it's "ecology" or "waste"

106
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,760
I'm good at saving

107
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,400
I won the prize

108
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,740
Why do we have to participate?

109
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,200
That's right

110
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,120
Nakagawa is the host, so we can't participate

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,640
And each team has to include a female member

112
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,440
We have to include a female member

113
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,420
What?

114
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,360
Why? Are you going to join us?

115
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
Sakonji, Borubo, Jody

116
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,360
Hi, long time no see

117
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,840
Sorry, but I'll get the prize

118
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,220
And we'll make that house the "Sweet Home of Me and Bobby"

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,720
We'll talk about that later

120
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,260
Where are you going, Bobby?

121
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,080
I wonder if we can live together there

122
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,380
But the tough one became a rival

123
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,700
Hey, Ryo, Kanchi

124
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,000
Komachi, Naoko, Maria, are you all going to join us?

125
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,520
Yes, we're going to be enemies with Reiko

126
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,640
I won't lose to you

127
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,900
What?

128
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,440
Ryo

129
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,660
Let's live together in that house, no matter who wins

130
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,740
Why do you say that?

131
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,400
It's useless

132
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,420
I guess I'm in the wrong place

133
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,200
Now you will have to live according to your schedule

134
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,960
First of all, each team will get 3,000 yen

135
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,160
Gas, water, and food items will be calculated and displayed on the roof

136
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,600
The electricity generated will also be added to the money

137
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,760
The team with the most money left will win the game

138
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,500
If you break the schedule, you will be disqualified.

139
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,620
Let's start the show!

140
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,500
The participants enter the house.

141
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,520
The first hour is free.

142
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,640
How will each team spend it?

143
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,700
Naoko, turn off all the lights in the room.

144
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,780
I got it.

145
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,600
Maria, open the curtain.

146
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,340
Yes.

147
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,920
The car must not use unnecessary electricity.

148
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,220
I turned off all the lights.

149
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,720
I opened the curtain.

150
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,900
Thank you.

151
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,560
No way!

152
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,220
Why?

153
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,640
The light is still on.

154
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,980
Check again if you forgot to turn it off.

155
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,280
I got it.

156
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,580
Everything is off.

157
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,280
I forgot to turn it off.

158
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,440
What?

159
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,540
Why?

160
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,580
What's going on?

161
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,060
This machine is broken.

162
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,260
You fools!

163
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,900
Most home appliances have a high-voltage power.

164
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,780
You don't have to use electricity.

165
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,200
I took out the power of the refrigerator, microwave and washing machine.

166
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,080
I also took out the power of the computer.

167
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,120
Good.

168
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,120
It's working.

169
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,040
That's how you save money.

170
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,160
What?

171
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,160
What?

172
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,140
What?

173
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,580
It's still working.

174
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,700
I'll pump electricity in no time.

175
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,560
Okay.

176
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,840
Oh, good job team.

177
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,940
The electricère remains increasing at an intense rate.

178
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,100
It looks like theост power went into the starts.

179
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm going to make the same mistake, Ren.

180
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,280
Are you ready?

181
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,940
Honda, hurry up.

182
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,540
Does that mean I'm going to start?

183
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
Of course.

184
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,720
Look, I made all the necessary modifications for you.

185
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,000
Am I a bike?

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
Get on the bike.

187
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,700
I understand.

188
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,800
I don't want to be in trouble.

189
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:41,100
You're doing great.

190
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't be lazy.

191
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,540
I got it.

192
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,220
Both teams haven't lost.

193
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,220
The other teams are doing their best.

194
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,460
I'm tired.

195
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,660
I'm tired.

196
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,020
I'm thirsty.

197
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,180
Wait!

198
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:00,800
What?

199
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,100
Look closely.

200
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm saving up one drop at a time.

201
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,960
Why one drop at a time?

202
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,680
The water meter doesn't work.

203
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,280
I can drink it for free.

204
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,840
But it takes time.

205
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,040
That's right.

206
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,200
One cup is cheap.

207
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,860
Too sweet!

208
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,320
That one cup is the source of the collapse.

209
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,020
It's the same as a diet.

210
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,500
Food and drink.

211
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,320
Everything.

212
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,660
I'll take care of it.

213
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:25,980
Great!

214
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm going to go and get some water.

215
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,820
He's serious.

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
It's going to be a hard life.

217
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,280
It's time for lunch.

218
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,500
Please buy what you need at the supermarket.

219
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,220
The money will be withdrawn from the electricity bill.

220
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,080
Oh!

221
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,580
The Terai team went shopping here.

222
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,020
There are so many children.

223
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,840
The time is too short.

224
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,540
I bought it.

225
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:52,640
My card is filled.

226
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,360
You're барbeque here.

227
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,880
Here.

228
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,080
Take everything.

229
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,800
All are yours.

230
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,980
You live in an uninhabited island.

231
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,980
Not saving.

232
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,520
More survival.

233
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,020
I'm thirsty.

234
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:16,760
I'm thirsty.

235
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,700
I'm hungry.

236
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,140
Is there enough water?

237
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,040
Not yet.

238
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:20,980
Thank you.

239
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,540
What are you going to do? I can't take it anymore.

240
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,520
Me too.

241
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,780
Don't worry about it.

242
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,020
I'm going to melt the river water.

243
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,880
Are you really going to drink that?

244
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,360
Well, just watch.

245
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:37,900
Here.

246
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,580
It looks like brown.

247
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,820
Don't worry. I drank it too, but it's nothing.

248
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,580
Don't do it with Ryo-chan's human-torn stomach.

249
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,080
Don't do it with Ryo-chan's stomach.

250
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,240
Senpai, please.

251
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,400
Please give me a glass of water.

252
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
I can't help it.

253
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,900
Just one glass.

254
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,560
Here, a glass of water.

255
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,900
It's night.

256
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,300
The meter is running to turn on the lights.

257
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,540
It's dark.

258
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,320
Just one light bulb is fine.

259
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,600
It's calmer when it's dark.

260
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,640
It's time for the bath.

261
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,280
Please get ready.

262
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,700
I put the water in a place with good sunlight.

263
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,980
As expected.

264
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,920
It won't take the electricity.

265
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,960
I don't like this kind of thing.

266
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,640
But it can't be helped.

267
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,480
It's only a small body.

268
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:53,700
That's right.

269
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,000
Do you know what?

270
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,180
"When could I find it?"

271
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,060
"I couldn't find it."

272
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,040
"Can it be vegetables?"

273
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:07,840
"Yes."

274
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,540
"What's with him?"

275
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,500
"I see him too."

276
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:10,840
"Walking".

277
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,260
I can't.

278
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm exhausted.

279
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,520
She's done, haven't she?

280
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,920
This is not a bath.

281
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,100
And it's almost water, so it'll get cold.

282
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,960
Be patient.

283
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,240
The heat is used the most by electricity.

284
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,300
If you don't get into the mold, you're out.

285
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,400
I'm about to get in.

286
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
See, it's in the mold.

287
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,460
But the temperature of the hot water is quite low.

288
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,140
But it's not like that.

289
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,320
He likes warm water.

290
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,460
What about me?

291
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,160
You like it, don't you?

292
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,260
Good.

293
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,940
Good, isn't it?

294
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,960
You don't have any complaints?

295
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
The top is Sakonji Team.

296
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,440
The second place is Ryoto Team.

297
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,840
The match is in the early stages.

298
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,380
I'm looking forward to the future.

299
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,320
I'm looking forward to the future.

300
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,740
Where did Ryo-chan go?

301
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,840
Oh.

302
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,240
There was a water bottle.

303
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,960
Where is it?

304
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,460
I hid it somewhere.

305
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,120
I said, "If it's just us, I can't stand it. I'll drink it."

306
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,020
You're right.

307
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,460
I bought some food.

308
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,340
I'm going to eat it today.

309
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,440
It's a fish sausage.

310
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,020
Is it just one?

311
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,180
I bought it for you.

312
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,200
Do you have any complaints?

313
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,400
No, I think I overdo it.

314
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,420
Look at them.

315
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,880
They have more electricity than us.

316
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,380
They don't turn on the lights at night.

317
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,420
They live in the dark.

318
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,540
And they get food by hunting.

319
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,860
So they don't have to pay for food.

320
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:12,780
They just do it.

321
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,680
What is the hunt?

322
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,880
What is the hunt?

323
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,780
But that doesn't mean we have to win.

324
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,060
I don't need to worry about it.

325
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,420
I'll read it tonight.

326
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,100
Calm down.

327
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:26,720
What?

328
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,100
I don't want to do it anymore.

329
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,560
Wait, Konji.

330
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,380
I don't want to eat that anymore.

331
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,660
One more night.

332
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,260
Be patient.

333
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,140
Let me play a TV game.

334
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,580
It's no good.

335
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,940
The TV is too hard.

336
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,840
It's too hard.

337
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,380
Now, un desperate.

338
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:40,920
After all,

339
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,160
I can handle both Volvo and Jodi.

340
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,860
But I can't handle Sakonji.

341
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,320
I'll surpass them.

342
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,420
I'll quiet them down.

343
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,280
Will you still do it?

344
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,780
Then you should let me take a shower.

345
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,880
The bath is boiling,

346
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,280
but you can't get in.

347
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:56,900
Come on,

348
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,460
You can't go to such a mud dumper's bath.

349
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,740
Why can't I get in?

350
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,000
Defeating someone can't kill a human.

351
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:03,860
I don't think so.

352
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,580
You are growing wealthier.

353
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,220
It's starting to get exciting.

354
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,740
The tournament has finally begun.

355
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,480
It's time for the event.

356
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,720
All representatives of each team, please come to the stage.

357
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,740
It's time for the event?

358
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,320
Please draw a card one by one.

359
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
Oh, what's this?

360
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,220
What?

361
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,480
What?

362
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,980
Komachi Team drew a card for the children to play.

363
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,720
What are you talking about?

364
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,520
Harui?

365
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,500
What's going on?

366
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,440
Show me the TV.

367
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,180
I think it's a game show.

368
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,420
If you do that, I'll turn on the light.

369
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,400
Stop it!

370
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,660
It's not fun to just play a game.

371
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,200
It's a game show.

372
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,160
I've added a little bit of fun to it.

373
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,080
It's like a life game.

374
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,520
Next team, please draw a card.

375
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,680
Huh?

376
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,300
Yeah.

377
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,580
What?

378
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,020
What's this?

379
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,260
Sakonji Team has drawn a check for the electricity store.

380
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,140
I'm sorry.

381
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,560
I came to check the electricity products.

382
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,460
Stop it!

383
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,160
Nothing is broken.

384
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,660
Katarin will check all the electrical products.

385
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,800
I'll check the electrical products.

386
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,100
I ate a lot of electricity.

387
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,460
In this event, the Sakonji team will drop the ranking at once.

388
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,060
If I can even find out what's in that card.

389
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,140
Huh?

390
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,000
What's wrong with that?

391
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,680
Is it a power cut?

392
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,440
Someone is looking for it.

393
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,880
...

394
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,960
Let's play it.

395
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
Hmm, I'll try it.

396
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,700
Damn it . . .

397
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,660
there is no work card . . .

398
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:12,940
Huh?

399
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,320
it's a lucky card?

400
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,380
I'm clout cheap.

401
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,360
I'll take this one.

402
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,700
Excuse us.

403
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,340
Then let's continue.

404
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,900
Let's continue. The card that Terai team drew is...

405
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,100
The card that the young group of Smobias is playing!

406
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,640
No, it's not!

407
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,640
It's a monster!

408
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,660
It's a monster!

409
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:52,180
They made a lot of food in a hurry. This is a big damage.

410
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,180
No way...

411
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,260
Then, the next team...

412
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,140
Wait!

413
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,740
I'm...

414
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,720
This!

415
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,560
Finally, this card came out!

416
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,020
The card that the Ryotsu team drew is...

417
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,120
The Unlucky Card!

418
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,800
This is bad luck!

419
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,520
What? Unlucky?

420
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,500
It's true.

421
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,460
This is the worst card.

422
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,340
The Ryotsu team will be reduced to 100 yen for electricity.

423
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,540
What?

424
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,260
It was no big deal!

425
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,200
The cards are now back at the last minute!

426
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,840
This gives me a lot of effort.

427
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,800
Well, here I go.

428
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,420
Now for number 9.

429
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,220
What's up?

430
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,020
What are you doing?

431
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,080
Why is the power so low?

432
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,900
The power cable is being bitten by the mouse.

433
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,600
It's dead.

434
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,220
No way, are you sure a mouse will come out?

435
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,760
This has never happened before.

436
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,620
Why are you all safe?

437
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,040
It's suspicious.

438
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,160
I'm sure the mouse will come out.

439
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,660
I've been taking care of it.

440
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,760
Besides, I'm not the only one who's safe.

441
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,780
That's...

442
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,920
Even so, the top team is all in damage.

443
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,640
What are you going to do, president?

444
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,100
There's no evidence that you did it.

445
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,120
I have no choice but to continue.

446
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,240
I see.

447
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,940
I'll turn it over to myself.

448
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,520
Each team entered the final chase.

449
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,900
However, there is still time left.

450
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,500
No, it's useless.

451
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,860
The winner is mine.

452
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,180
I got the Golden Shoei House.

453
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,640
I'm at my limit.

454
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,200
What's wrong, Reiko?

455
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,340
I'm going to take a bath.

456
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,080
What?

457
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,600
Wait, Reiko!

458
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,300
Open the door, Reiko!

459
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,280
Oh, it feels good.

460
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,180
Stop!

461
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,520
The most electrical energy you can use is the heat energy.

462
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,640
What are you doing, Reiko?

463
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,280
I feel refreshed.

464
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,640
This is human life.

465
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,500
The fourth team, the electricity suddenly began to decline.

466
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,040
What is happening in the house now?

467
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,360
Damn, Honda~~~

468
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,980
No way, I'll handle you guys though.

469
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,100
The last race!

470
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,220
Both teams are going down in rank and have the highest score so far!

471
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,960
Who's going to win?

472
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,280
Damn, I can't lose like thisò

473
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,920
Five more seconds!

474
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,800
Power...

475
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,360
God, give me the power...

476
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,100
Senior!

477
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,200
This is my victory!

478
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,360
It's my victory!

479
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,000
It's terrifying to be called to the thunder.

480
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,660
What a great obsession.

481
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,400
Now, I will announce the winning team of the first SHOEI NE HOUSE tournament.

482
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,040
The winner is...

483
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,480
The Terai Team!

484
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,540
That's impossible!

485
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,920
I can't believe it.

486
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,420
It's my victory. I saw it.

487
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,480
All the counters were turned.

488
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,900
It's not a momentary victory. It's a failure.

489
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,280
No way!

490
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,780
I was just living a normal life.

491
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,400
You're usually so sad.

492
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,360
Damn it! What was my effort?

493
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:18,040
I can't believe I lost so easily.

494
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
I almost became Mihiroku!

495
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,880
But I lost too easily.

496
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,160
I might lose aettihnt in this match.

497
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,420
I won't lose.

498
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,060
I won't lose.

499
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,820
I'm a dragon.

500
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,260
What's wrong?

501
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,920
I can't believe it.

502
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:37,960
You really want to lose?

503
00:24:37,960 --> 00:25:07,880
I walked through the dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark

504
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:36,620
dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark,

505
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,280
I'm sure this is a wrong way of living!

506
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,600
If I become a dog, I'll enjoy my life as a goblack pet!

507
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,740
Next time, Ryo-san's dog life!

508
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:46,880
Don't miss it!

509
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,740
There is a wall there

510
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,820
There must be a wall

511
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,780
Everyone, come to our town

512
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,820
Thank you!
