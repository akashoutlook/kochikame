1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,340
"I'd love to see you myレミィ indiru."

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,980
Turn on the room light and watch TV when watching TV!

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,200
If you don't have enough money for anything, come over here!

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,900
We don't have any money, but we're worried

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,920
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,860
It'll all be alright eventually

7
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,100
Come to me, you jobless one

8
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,460
I'm not here, but don't worry

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,440
Look, the red moon is burning

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,840
Look, the red moon is burning

11
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,620
It'll all be alright eventually

12
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,460
I know, I know, I know

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,700
If you know, then keep quiet and follow me

14
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,200
The face of the red-winged one

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,280
Dyed in red

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,100
Dyed in red

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,740
Dyed in red

18
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,240
Dyed in red

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Dyed in red

20
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,820
It's hot. I feel like I'm going to die.

21
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,900
This heat is really not good.

22
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,160
I'll take a break for a bit.

23
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,900
Here, 210 yen for two.

24
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,820
Wait a minute.

25
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,180
Where's the money?

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,980
Here you are.

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,420
Thanks.

28
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,560
Senpai!

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,160
What's wrong?

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,740
Shit! I bought ice cream!

31
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,700
That's probably one of the reasons.

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,680
Mirror building?

33
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,960
It's suddenly increased recently.

34
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,880
It reflects the sun's light and lights up the place where it usually shines, so the temperature doesn't go down.

35
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,540
Thanks to that, my room is also bright.

36
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,060
It's a terrible situation.

37
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,580
It's like a sauna.

38
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,340
It's so hot even though I'm closing the curtains.

39
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,340
This is the cause.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,880
There's a mirror building in front of us!

41
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,400
Yeah. Thanks to that, the sun is shining on dozens of people.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,940
It's like the sun is shining on the sun.

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,460
This is terrible.

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,200
I don't need a double-decker.

45
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,040
This is like a nuisance.

46
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,000
Senpai, my head is getting numb.

47
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,740
Ouch! It's a heat stroke!

48
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,740
It's dangerous to enter the room during the day.

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,240
Don't you have a cooler?

50
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,060
I don't have one.

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,900
It's just cheap for a chicken.

52
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,140
I don't have one that costs as much as a cooler.

53
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,680
Hey, Hojo.

54
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,880
It's the day off today.

55
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,900
Oh, yes.

56
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,740
I'm going to the library.

57
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,560
Let's go back to the office.

58
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,020
Yeah.

59
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,280
What's wrong?

60
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,440
Hojo's not sweating at all.

61
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,220
What?

62
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,400
By the way,

63
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,560
it's a great temperature inside here in the mirror building.

64
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,900
He shouldn't be sweating.

65
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,720
That bastard.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,220
Could it be...

67
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,220
Here you go, Hojo!

68
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,720
Seriously.

69
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,520
Wow.

70
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,400
Wow, it's so cool.

71
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,820
It's like heaven.

72
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,020
Oh, I'm sweating.

73
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,360
I knew it.

74
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,020
Hojo, you're hiding the cooler, aren't you?

75
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,940
What proof do you have?

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,420
This coolness is proof.

77
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,560
It's because I'm turning the fan.

78
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,720
Just turning the fan won't make you this cool.

79
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,960
Or is it because of the cooling function?

80
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,500
The fan has some function.

81
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,240
What's that?

82
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,280
And the hot pot.

83
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,340
In summer, the only place where you can eat hot pot is a house with a cooler.

84
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,460
What?

85
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,820
Find it thoroughly.

86
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,380
Yes, sir.

87
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,140
Yes, sir.

88
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,020
Yes, sir.

89
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,680
Yes, sir.

90
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,740
Yes, sir.

91
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,100
Yes, sir.

92
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,560
I found it.

93
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,100
It's a cooler.

94
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
The outdoor unit is being disguised as a orange box.

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,640
I see.

96
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,400
I see.

97
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,300
If it was a cooler, everyone would be in pain.

98
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,660
But that cooler is...

99
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,860
I... I sent it from the country.

100
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,040
I didn't need it at home.

101
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,800
Why is it set up secretly to avoid people's eyes?

102
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,960
When people find out there's a cooler,

103
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,940
everyone will go to the room and live a peaceful life.

104
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,140
That's what I thought!

105
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,500
Kikuri.

106
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,620
Are you still a policeman?

107
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,380
I thought you were a policeman.

108
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,620
What?

109
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,060
As a police officer, you must always think about public interest.

110
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,020
But you are prioritizing your own interests now.

111
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,060
You have no right to call yourself a police officer!

112
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,780
So,

113
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,700
we will use this room.

114
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:34,880
What?

115
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,180
Ouch!

116
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,040
Ouch!

117
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,100
You want to play another game?

118
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,440
Of course!

119
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,560
I can't sweat even if I move my body this much.

120
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,720
Cooler is so cool.

121
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,400
Cooler is so comfortable.

122
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,140
You can't live like this alone, Hojo.

123
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,720
What?

124
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,060
Ho...

125
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,960
Wow, it's so cool.

126
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,720
There's a cooler in Hojo's room.

127
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,360
Really?

128
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,620
There was a rumor that there was a cooler in Hojo's room.

129
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,420
Well...

130
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,040
Who are you?

131
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,520
Please give us some coolness.

132
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,120
Here! Here!

133
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,600
Is this the room with the cooler?

134
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,540
Hey!

135
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,320
Hey, wait a minute!

136
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,040
Don't come in so much!

137
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,640
Wait!

138
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,600
Hey, you're in the way!

139
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,160
Ah! So painful!

140
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,140
This is not a game.

141
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,000
It doesn't make sense if there are so many humans in the cooler.

142
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,280
But there's only this room with the cooler.

143
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,860
Can I have all of this air duct?

144
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,900
Eh? No problem.

145
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,600
What are you doing, man?

146
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,660
Hmm...

147
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,740
I'm sending the coolers to other rooms.

148
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,000
What?

149
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,360
Alright.

150
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,260
Switch it on.

151
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,360
Switch it on.

152
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,640
Switch it on.

153
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,080
Whoa, it's so cool in here!

154
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,800
I did it!

155
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,200
Yay!

156
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
You did it, man!

157
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,760
Really?

158
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,660
Oh, um...

159
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,660
What?

160
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,400
If you block that source,

161
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,980
there won't be any cold air in this room.

162
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,160
Your Majesty, the spirits of this place must be distributed fairly among the people of Ryo.

163
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,500
I see.

164
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,820
But you have already monopolized the spirits for several days.

165
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,860
So you don't have any for the rest of your life.

166
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,740
How long is the rest of my life?

167
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
It's about six months.

168
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,220
It's winter, isn't it?

169
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,160
It's your own choice, you idiot!

170
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,220
Take care of this remote control.

171
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,900
Don't play with the switch on your own.

172
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,700
Senpai, are you sure you're okay?

173
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,080
I'm fine. I'm fine.

174
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,280
It's better to feel a little hot for him.

175
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,180
It's hot.

176
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,620
It's cool.

177
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,780
It's very comfortable.

178
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,180
It's about time...

179
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,380
That bastard stopped the cooler!

180
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,080
Hey, what are you doing?

181
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,460
That's what...

182
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,520
He stopped it suddenly...

183
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,300
What's going on, senpai?

184
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,700
It's hot.

185
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,520
Be strong.

186
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,460
You're the only one who can rely on it.

187
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,900
You did it!

188
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,420
Oh!

189
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,380
The cooler...

190
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,500
Covering everything with just one cooler was reckless

191
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,380
Damn it

192
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,860
No good, it's not cool even in the shade

193
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,460
I need a cooler

194
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:32,180
What was that?

195
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,300
What?

196
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
Ryo-san

197
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,320
What's this cooler?

198
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,560
The customer bought a new cooler and took it away

199
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,520
It's a waste, we can still use it

200
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,160
Really?

201
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,880
Alright, I'll take all of them

202
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,600
All of them?

203
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,540
Ryo-san, you really got a lot of coolers?

204
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,880
Yeah

205
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,480
Wow

206
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:04,440
Wow

207
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,920
Wow

208
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,760
Please install it in my room too

209
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,440
Me too! Me too!

210
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,400
Of course, I'll install it

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,700
However, the installation fee is 10,000 yen per unit

212
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,380
Of course, we don't want to volunteer

213
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,920
If you don't like it, you have to put up with it

214
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,180
I don't like it

215
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,280
I'll pay you

216
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,560
Please understand

217
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:39,680
knew we were going to meet at the end

218
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,400
I knew it

219
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,780
Good for you

220
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,980
I think you'll be able to play games with confidence

221
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,640
Good for you

222
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,960
Wow

223
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,860
It's wonderful

224
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,040
It's cool!

225
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,720
Cool!

226
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,780
Well, it's different from having a cooler.

227
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,900
I also had a temporary income.

228
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,280
From today, I will be able to live comfortably.

229
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,260
Motion is still going.

230
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,900
What's wrong?

231
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,740
Grandma, what's wrong?

232
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,760
Is it a break-out?

233
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,120
It seems so.

234
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,780
Damn it.

235
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,460
Damn it.

236
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,620
The power cable broke.

237
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,220
Is it because everyone turned on the coolers?

238
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,300
The old coolers had a lot of electricity.

239
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,500
I don't know.

240
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,620
I'm going to call an electrician.

241
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,040
But it might take time to repair.

242
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,180
What?

243
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,820
Then, why don't you use a cooler?

244
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,340
Give me the money back.

245
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,140
I know.

246
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,700
I swear.

247
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,680
What?

248
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,760
What?

249
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,820
What?

250
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,460
What?

251
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,260
What?

252
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,520
What?

253
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,860
What?

254
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,120
What?

255
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,640
What?

256
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,260
What?

257
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,520
How much?

258
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,500
How much does it cost per case?

259
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,560
How much does it cost per case?

260
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,880
Purchase.

261
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,820
What?

262
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,020
It's still the same as before.

263
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,140
I have no idea.

264
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,060
I can't afford it.

265
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,380
It's more like water thaniplane.

266
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,060
Yes.

267
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,440
It seems to me that you've done something great.

268
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,740
It's like a sports toy.

269
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,400
A sports toy?

270
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,300
Yes.

271
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:45,620
I think I can remember things.

272
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,620
I see! So that's how it was!

273
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:48,820
What?

274
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,500
Hehehe...

275
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,440
I'll use you from now on, for the revenge you've put us through!

276
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:57,820
I'll make you pay for it!

277
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,440
At this company, we're currently studying solar panels used for solar power.

278
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,800
What's that?

279
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,080
A lot of nico-nico from Katsushika.

280
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,120
Wow, that's a lot of solar energy!

281
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,980
It's a perfect place for a solar panel test.

282
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,720
Right? Leave it to me!

283
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,480
I'll test your new products!

284
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,720
Power on!

285
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,500
Wow, the needles are working at once!

286
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,260
Amazing!

287
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,840
That's a lot of power!

288
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,780
Alright! Let's turn on the coolers in the room!

289
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,720
Yes!

290
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,060
Alright!

291
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,040
Next!

292
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,880
It's alright! We still have plenty of power!

293
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,180
I see!

294
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,640
Now we're done with the heat of summer!

295
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,280
Hahahahahahaha

296
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:38,200
Awww, that's aРelly nice.

297
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,000
It's cooler than my apartment.

298
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,060
Right?

299
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,420
In these cold temperatures, it's the coldest.

300
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,900
I don't sweat even when I work out.

301
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,380
Just a real...

302
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,780
But there's enough power in here.

303
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,380
So no need to force the cooler.

304
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,040
It's okay to make the cooler the strongest.

305
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,220
How about you move in?

306
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,720
Oh, I'll think about it.

307
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,260
He's still a tough guy.

308
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,760
I'm so sad that I have to go back to this fucking hot country.

309
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,720
Shit...

310
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,220
I have something prepared for you.

311
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
What is it?

312
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,500
It's a cooler suit made of the leftover cooler.

313
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,900
The cooling comes out of the back of the cooler,

314
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,200
and the hose is used to enter the suit and cool the body.

315
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,800
But it looks hot.

316
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,300
The machine on the back looks heavy.

317
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,580
It's true that this is heavy.

318
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,880
It's an old-fashioned cooler, so it can't be helped.

319
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,500
I'm sweating just standing up.

320
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,600
Wait.

321
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,180
I'll make it today.

322
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,440
Oh, I'm sweating for a moment.

323
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,200
No matter how much you move, you'll never sweat.

324
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
You look sick.

325
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,140
It's too heavy to load the battery, but it's long enough.

326
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,160
Take a walk over there.

327
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:18,180
Wow, it's so sunny, but it's not hot at all.

328
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,160
It's too cold.

329
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,240
I have to raise the temperature.

330
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,360
I can't do it.

331
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,080
I can't reach it.

332
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,120
It's cold.

333
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,540
What?

334
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,860
I'll be back in a hurry.

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,700
I'm dying of cold.

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,280
Please turn off the switch.

337
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,920
Let's go.

338
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,640
There was a problem with the position of the switch.

339
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,580
This time it will be fine.

340
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,720
Hmm?

341
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,040
Perfect.

342
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,820
Then I'll walk over there for a while.

343
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,440
What are you doing, Ryo?

344
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:54,840
What?

345
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,020
It's a little experiment.

346
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,080
Hmm?

347
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,040
Hmm.

348
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,880
This is pretty good.

349
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,680
The heat outside is like a lie.

350
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,280
Hmm?

351
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,340
It's getting a little hot.

352
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,860
Let's do it today.

353
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,140
Now I can sweat for a moment.

354
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,060
I'll pull it out in a moment.

355
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,540
I'll pull it out.

356
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,420
I can't do it.

357
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,120
What's going on?

358
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,860
Huh?

359
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,420
I'm back.

360
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,360
It's fluttering.

361
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,300
Did something happen?

362
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,660
I'm dying of heat.

363
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,680
What?

364
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,620
Oh, the cord.

365
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,640
I can't do it.

366
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,120
I can't do it.

367
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,300
Don't pull the cord out and pull it out.

368
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,760
Is that so?

369
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,460
Wait a minute.

370
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,560
I'll recover it now.

371
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,180
What?

372
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,120
It's rules.

373
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,620
I'll make you cry.

374
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,920
Are you all right, Bulba?

375
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,940
Hey.

376
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,540
It's hell.

377
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,620
I saw the nature.

378
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,520
It is dangerous to walk with the power cord.

379
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,500
It's too dangerous to walk with a cord.

380
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,000
It's better to have a battery.

381
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,340
The more we sell, the more electricity we have.

382
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,220
It's a waste if we don't use it.

383
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,080
Then how about we actually sell it?

384
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,560
What?

385
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,320
I think the power generated by solar power will be bought by the power company.

386
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,060
Really?

387
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:37,980
Yay!

388
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,200
It's from the power company.

389
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,420
Oh, there are 200,000 too.

390
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,180
That's a lot of money.

391
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,320
No, we can't let it go like this.

392
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,500
We need to give more power.

393
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,740
Give more power?

394
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,960
We used the power of that mirror building.

395
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,080
That's why we got this much power.

396
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,580
There's no way we can do anything else.

397
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,980
That's right.

398
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,720
There's a limit to the amount of solar power we can use.

399
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,240
Then we just have to collect the light.

400
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,500
What?

401
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,040
We need to collect the power of this place.

402
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,360
That's right.

403
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,720
We have to start the power of this place.

404
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,720
We need to start the power of this place.

405
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,620
It's that guy.

406
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,000
This angle, I think.

407
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,200
This angle, I think.

408
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,720
This angle, I think.

409
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,600
I saw it.

410
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,180
I saw it.

411
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,260
It's Does it work?

412
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,540
It's a success.

413
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,000
The power generated is rising.

414
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,640
Hojo, are you there?

415
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,740
What?

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,300
I saw you.

417
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,980
You're not reading a book.

418
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,940
Help me.

419
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,960
What?

420
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,600
What is it?

421
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,700
Gather the light!

422
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,260
Help everyone who is left in the dorm!

423
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,680
Huh?

424
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,580
Ah, it's hot.

425
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,160
Why are you even asking me?

426
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,000
Hey, Hatta.

427
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,800
Alright, alright.

428
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,920
No, it won't come out.

429
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,320
If we don't contact them quickly, it will be a big problem.

430
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,940
Today at 1:45 PM.

431
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,540
In other words, the light reflected on the mirror building around the dorm will be concentrated in the Nico Nico dorm,

432
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,820
and it will instantly become an incredible high temperature.

433
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,060
No one will come to Ryo's phone,

434
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,440
and if this happens, I have no choice but to fly directly to the site.

435
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,060
Prepare the helicopter immediately!

436
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:38,860
Yes!

437
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,040
Now the power generation is even better!

438
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,160
What is that?

439
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,800
This should be enough.

440
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,820
It's really hot.

441
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,160
I'll go back to my room.

442
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,780
This...

443
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,100
This is gathering the light!

444
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,320
How can it be?

445
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,960
If it's like this, it's ridiculous!

446
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,400
Stop it, Senpai!

447
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,300
This is the only place where the air is rising so much!

448
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,360
What is he doing?

449
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,660
The temperature is rising more and more!

450
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,860
There's not even a minute left!

451
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,820
Are you sure?

452
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,680
Senpai, please stop it already!

453
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,220
President, I can't do this!

454
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,820
I have no time!

455
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,040
No, this doesn't work!

456
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,600
He's getting more tired!!

457
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:05,700
It's going too fast!

458
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,120
You can't get out of bed until you return!

459
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,400
Don't go back!

460
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,840
We don't have much time left!

461
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,200
Senpai!

462
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,760
Senpai!

463
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,720
I can't do it anymore.

464
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,480
I'm leaving!

465
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,060
Too much light!

466
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,220
The amount of "nico-nico" has...

467
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,200
... melted!

468
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,220
Welcome!

469
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,180
Welcome!

470
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,240
Please come in!

471
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,780
Welcome!

472
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,180
Please come in!

473
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,800
Welcome!

474
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,080
Welcome!

475
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,380
Please come in!

476
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,580
Welcome!

477
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,820
Sorry!

478
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,220
Please come in!

479
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,780
I'm sorry!

480
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,760
I'm sorry!

481
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,800
I'm sorry!

482
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:28,560
Yes!

483
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,400
Would you like a California Maki?

484
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,860
No California Maki!

485
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,260
We're not in America!

486
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm sorry!

487
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,440
Well...

488
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,520
Um...

489
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,140
I'm sorry!

490
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,880
Welcome!

491
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,440
Then...

492
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,740
Kushi-age, Kaki-age, Katsu-age,

493
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,200
What is it?

494
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,980
Age-age?

495
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,360
What is it?

496
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,180
What do you recommend?

497
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,600
Be careful with Katsu-age!

498
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,680
Huh?

499
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,440
Is it a gag from my father?

500
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,360
Yes!

501
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,120
I'm sorry!

502
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,880
I don't get it.

503
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,080
Huh?

504
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,720
Huh?

505
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,140
Huh?

506
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,360
Huh?

507
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,240
Huh?

508
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,220
Really?

509
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:09,960
Welcome!

510
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,520
Welcome!

511
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,040
Welcome!

512
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:12,820
Welcome!

513
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,220
Welcome!

514
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,900
Welcome!

515
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,340
Welcome!

516
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,300
Welcome!

517
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,220
Welcome!

518
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:21,580
Welcome!

519
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,540
Welcome!

520
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,080
Welcome!

521
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,920
Welcome!

522
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,260
Welcome!

523
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:27,400
Welcome!

524
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,740
Welcome!

525
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,140
Summer vacation is coming to an end.

526
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,620
Why can't Lemon take me anywhere?

527
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,160
What? He'll take me to a different place?

528
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,120
And I'll meet a real ninja?

529
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,800
Yay! Lemon has always admired ninjas!

530
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,340
Next time, "Lemon will become a ninja of the 9-1-1!"

531
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,160
Don't miss it!

532
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,120
