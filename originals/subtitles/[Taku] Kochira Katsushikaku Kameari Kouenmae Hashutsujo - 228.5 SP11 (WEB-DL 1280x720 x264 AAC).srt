1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,460
"Summer Night"

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,680
"Summer Night"

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,540
"Summer Night"

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,660
"Summer Night"

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,080
Well, I'll put this in...

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,260
"Summer Night"

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,380
Eh? It's already this late? I have to hurry...

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:18,600
"Summer Night"

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,560
Ah, at a time like this...

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,520
Here! "Summer Night"

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,660
Hi, Reiko-chan!

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,660
Ah, Papa, I'm sorry, but I just...

13
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,400
Reiko-chan, what's up with your promise?

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,240
Promise?

15
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,400
I promised to get married this year.

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,320
Get married?

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,380
Didn't you say so at the New Year's party this year?

18
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,300
Did I say so?

19
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,840
You did! You did!

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,060
This year will soon be over!

21
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,820
Papa, I'm sorry. I don't have time right now.

22
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,580
I'm going to be late for the flight,

23
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,360
so I'll cut it.

24
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,060
Ah, wait! I'm nearby!

25
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,240
Look outside! Eh?

26
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:53,740
Ah!

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,160
"Summer Night"

28
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,860
Ta-da! I missed you, Reiko-chan!

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,340
Papa!

30
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm going over there now!

31
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,740
Oh, my!

32
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,140
"Summer Night"

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,240
"Summer Night"

34
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,220
"Summer Night"

35
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:15,880
"Summer Night"

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,860
Reiko-chan, you change your apartment every season.

37
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,780
I was looking for you.

38
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,500
Oh, Papa, you're...

39
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,460
The last word was "Summer Night's"

40
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,260
"Summer Night's"

41
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,820
"Summer Night's"

42
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:34,840
"Summer Night's"

43
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,180
"Summer Night's"

44
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,840
"Summer Night's"

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:36,980
"Summer Night's"

46
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,340
"Summer Night's"

47
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,760
"Summer Night's"

48
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,560
"Summer Night's"

49
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,740
"Summer Night's"

50
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,640
"Summer Night's"

51
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,500
"Summer Night's"

52
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,140
I've been looking for you.

53
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,020
Eh?

54
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,420
Are these all wedding photos?

55
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,500
Yeah.

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,160
I want to see the faces of the future of my group.

57
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,700
Come on, take a look.

58
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,900
Everyone is a child of the world.

59
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,040
Oh, even Kei's photo.

60
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,000
If you become a relative with Nakagawa Concern,

61
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,280
the Akihomoto Group will be a big hit.

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,880
You're a good-for-nothing.

63
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,800
It's not the time of war.

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't want to get married.

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,940
Reiko?

66
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,580
What kind of man do you want to marry?

67
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,640
It doesn't matter the family name or the money.

68
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,540
I want a strong and kind person who loves me from the bottom of his heart.

69
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,900
Then, if such a man appears, will you marry him?

70
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,080
If he appears, I have no choice but to think about it.

71
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,280
Thanks to my dad,

72
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,860
I couldn't make it in time.

73
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,780
That's right.

74
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,460
Send me to Narita by my dad's helicopter.

75
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,300
Huh?

76
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,500
Okay?

77
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,280
I got it. I got it.

78
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,460
Huh? Isn't that Reiko?

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,520
Wait, Kei.

80
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,360
I heard you like Matterhorn for the New Year's holiday.

81
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,600
But it's the same plane.

82
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,860
It's really a coincidence.

83
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,100
Reiko, were you in southern France and Italy?

84
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,620
Yes. If Kei is with me,

85
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,540
I don't think I'll be bored in the plane.

86
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,860
Then, the company's staff are coming to pick you up.

87
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,120
Thank you. Have a nice holiday.

88
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,600
Reiko, too.

89
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:37,820
Eh?

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,420
Eh?

91
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,040
What are you guys doing?

92
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,680
What?

93
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,060
Ah!

94
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,060
Ah!

95
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,320
Kei!

96
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,420
Ugh...

97
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,640
Ugh...

98
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,360
Ohhhhh...

99
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,520
So cold and cold...

100
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,440
All right then.

101
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,560
Ah...

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,300
Ah...

103
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,480
Ah...

104
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,440
Huk!

105
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,100
Huk!

106
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,220
Huk!

107
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,900
Yaaaaaay!

108
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,660
What are you laughing at?!

109
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,680
Don't you have any work to do?!

110
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,420
Huh?

111
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,520
When I'm so busy at the end of the year,

112
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,720
Nagagawa and Reiko are on long-term leave and going to Europe!

113
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,180
They're so ridiculous, they can't do any work at all!

114
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,760
Idiot!

115
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,120
Those two are taking a rest after the paid leave!

116
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,540
They're not like you, who uses up all the paid leave at the beginning of the year!

117
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,400
You're always on the stove!

118
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,040
Work!

119
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,360
Work!

120
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,700
You're so annoying!

121
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,520
Captain! This is bad!

122
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,080
What?

123
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,020
Reiko was kidnapped!

124
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,940
What?!

125
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,280
She was surrounded by a group of men in black, and she was hit in the head from behind.

126
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,460
Then, what do you think happened to the culprit?

127
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,380
No, nothing.

128
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,380
Reiko was kidnapped while she was with him?

129
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,780
What was Nakagawa doing?

130
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,120
Ryotsu, Nakagawa was injured, so it's the government who should be the one to blame.

131
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,960
Reiko, are you okay?

132
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,040
Are you okay?

133
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,040
Are you okay?

134
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,800
Next, we have the meeting of the father of Reiko Akimoto, who was kidnapped, and the chairman of the Akimoto Group, Akimoto Pyunpyunmaru.

135
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,700
We received an email from the kidnapper.

136
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,560
They want to exchange her daughter's life for 1 billion yen.

137
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,220
1 billion yen?!

138
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,920
It's cheaper than the precious life of Reiko.

139
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,120
1 billion is cheap?

140
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,240
You're the chairman of the Akimoto Group, aren't you?

141
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,700
But we can't allow such a terrible crime!

142
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,180
I, Akimoto Pyunpyunmaru, have decided to take back my daughter, Reiko!

143
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,080
What?!

144
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,420
I've already asked the German GSC9 and the American Green Beret for cooperation.

145
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,940
Captain Keppel and the Bakuryu Team?

146
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,340
Captain, we can't do this!

147
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,540
We'll re-organize the SS Team and head to Paris!

148
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,140
The SS Team, that's already...

149
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,120
Who's going to do it if we don't?

150
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,760
If you rescue Reiko, I think we can pay 1 billion yen!

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,920
What?! 1 billion?!

152
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,880
Captain!

153
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,280
We will rescue Reiko no matter what!

154
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,740
Oh, both sides are on fire...

155
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,260
I can see something beyond the flames...

156
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,020
I don't like this, Captain! It's all my fault!

157
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,980
More importantly, let's re-organize the SS Team and head to Paris!

158
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,780
All right. Let's ask the head of the SS Team.

159
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,680
The SS Team

160
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,480
To the Japanese police, you must take back Akimoto Reiko!

161
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,520
Roger!

162
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,160
Mr. Bolmo! You've worked in the Green Beret, so I'm counting on you!

163
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,780
Leave it to me!

164
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,860
Sakonji, Honza, and Maria, let's do this!

165
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,020
Yes, sir!

166
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,420
Captain, don't I have any words of encouragement?

167
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,440
No.

168
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,400
Oh, well, I have one, Ryotsu.

169
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,360
Yes! What is it?

170
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,600
Even if you go to Paris, don't destroy the SS Team...

171
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Then I pray for your success!

172
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,760
I'm not expecting anything at all...

173
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,780
Hey, are you going to go there on a private plane?

174
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,840
And you're saving money?

175
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,260
Huh?

176
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,920
What's wrong? You look pale.

177
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,600
I'm not good at flying.

178
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,480
Please protect me...

179
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,880
Sir, what's the matter?

180
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,200
Don't stand behind me!

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,960
No!

182
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,220
Hey! Be quiet!

183
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,220
Huh?

184
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,020
You're so noisy, you'll fall asleep!

185
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,960
Huh?

186
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,720
Mr. Honza!

187
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,540
You're Ryotsu!

188
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,960
F-Father? Why are you here?

189
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,420
What's with your outfit?

190
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,520
I'm going to save Ms. Reiko, who was kidnapped in Paris.

191
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,460
Just like me!

192
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,420
I'm going to save Ms. Reiko and bring Honza's name to the whole world!

193
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,860
O-s!

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,120
Huh?

195
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,260
You're saying something, but you're really aiming for one billion yen, aren't you?

196
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,420
You're so stubborn!

197
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,840
What did you say?

198
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,760
You're the one who's aiming for money, aren't you?

199
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,880
No, I just want to save Reiko!

200
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,900
See? I knew you were aiming for one billion yen!

201
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,780
You...

202
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,880
What are you doing?

203
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,260
You...

204
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,020
Ouch!

205
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,620
Stop it, you two!

206
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,740
Huh?

207
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,780
Gentlemen of the Economy Class,

208
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,820
what are you all doing?

209
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,760
Huh? You're Shiratori Reiji!

210
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,600
Another troublesome guy has appeared!

211
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,360
Ha ha ha!

212
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,160
If you think about it, it's the super-poor Ryotsu Kankichi!

213
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,040
You've done a great job!

214
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,020
Who is that guy?

215
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,760
Hmm...

216
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,200
Huh? You're coming?

217
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,640
Hmm...

218
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,120
What?

219
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,480
What?

220
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,240
Huh?

221
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,420
I'm surprised that you don't know me as a Japanese!

222
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm Shiratori Reiji, the super-poor!

223
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,900
Remember that!

224
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,500
Shiratori!

225
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,980
I can't believe you're also going to Paris

226
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,080
because you're so into big money!

227
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,240
Ch-ch-ch!

228
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,000
I, the super-poor, am not interested in money!

229
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,840
My goal is only one!

230
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,400
To help Reiko, my future wife!

231
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,100
My goal is only one!

232
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,380
You're a bad guy.

233
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,280
Ha! I don't care if you're Shiratori or Shiragedori!

234
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,660
I'm going to help Reiko!

235
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
No, I'm going to help you!

236
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,340
No, I'm going to help you!

237
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,100
Don't be stupid!

238
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,800
Reiko will be saved by our SS team!

239
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,660
What?

240
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,120
Ah, another terrible crowd has gathered.

241
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,560
What is going to happen next?

242
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,840
What is going to happen next?

243
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:07,920
What is going to happen next?

244
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,400
What is going to happen next?

245
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,740
I've been waiting for you, Senpai.

246
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,200
We'll talk about it later.

247
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,220
We have information that Captain Keppel and the others are heading to Paris.

248
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,200
What?

249
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,560
We have a helicopter ready.

250
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,440
Let's hurry!

251
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,500
Yes, sir!

252
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,200
The helicopter of the Nagagawa Consulate is heading to Paris.

253
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,080
We've heard everything.

254
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,480
We're going to Paris!

255
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,140
Yes, sir!

256
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,120
Yes, sir!

257
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,160
Yes, sir!

258
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,060
Yes, sir!

259
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,180
How about that?

260
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,520
All right, let's go chase that helicopter.

261
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,180
What?

262
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,520
Oh, no!

263
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,920
It's not an automatic vehicle!

264
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,720
I'll go search the helicopter.

265
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,280
All right.

266
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,300
OK, get in!

267
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,720
Get in!

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,040
Captain Keppel and his men have just entered the fourth lane of the Eurostar heading to London.

269
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,260
It is highly possible that Reiko-san is in the vehicle in the front and back.

270
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,680
The curtain of the second lane is closed, so we cannot see inside.

271
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,660
A cross-section?

272
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,520
There is no doubt that Reiko is in the second lane!

273
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,340
The train is starting to move!

274
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,880
Hey, it can't be!

275
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,100
Captain, we can't do this!

276
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
The secret of the Tenno is to never give up at any time!

277
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,100
As expected of Captain!

278
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,300
The second lane of the Eurostar heading to London

279
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:26,700
According to the report of the captain, a woman named Miss Reiko is in this second lane of the compartment.

280
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,980
Five men are in the first lane, four in the second lane, and eight in the third lane.

281
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,380
Each of them is in the position marked with an X.

282
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,400
The end of the operation is when we enter the next tunnel.

283
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,040
Roger that!

284
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,780
The next tunnel is located at the first lane.

285
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,400
The train is still in the first lane, but there is another one.

286
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Now that I think about it, the train is on the way.

287
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,720
But we have to follow the lead of Reiko's hand.

288
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,560
What?

289
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,340
What a person!

290
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,680
Queen, it's almost night!

291
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,760
It's too late!

292
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,980
What a man!

293
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,580
Rush!

294
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:06,700
Rush!

295
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,220
What?!

296
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,700
What?!

297
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,160
Ryokutsu!

298
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,660
You're being stoned with million yen!

299
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,060
Go away!

300
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,740
Senpai!

301
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,000
Thanks~

302
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,760
Hey! Get up from your back!

303
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,820
You're a mess.

304
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,040
Yeah...

305
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,000
He should've just fallen off like that.

306
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,120
A strong bad guy...

307
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,080
I won't die even if I get killed

308
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,260
There are 4 super cars in total

309
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,560
Hello, poor people

310
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,620
Shiratori Reiji, how did you know about this train?

311
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,640
Reiko said she would help me

312
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,180
I took a powerful help by giving pocket money

313
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,040
Help?

314
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,780
Let me introduce you

315
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,840
I didn't ask you to introduce me

316
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,560
I didn't

317
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,840
The former boxing heavyweight champion, Mike

318
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,980
What? Tyson?

319
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,060
Mike Nisekovic lives next to Tyson

320
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,920
I knew it

321
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,660
There are many more

322
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,300
Peter Arts from K-1

323
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,580
Andy Arts from Mataitoko

324
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,120
I'm getting tired of talking about it

325
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,420
And F1 from K-1

326
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,640
My Porsche

327
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,260
Michael Schumacher, who was driving me

328
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,240
I feel like I'm seeing something real

329
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,640
Michael Schumacher, who was driving me

330
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,460
Michael Schumacher, who was driving me

331
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:52,480
Michael Schumacher, who was driving me

332
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:52,840
Who's is it?

333
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,680
Igor Gorgo

334
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,900
I'm松本

335
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,640
Nice to meet you

336
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,060
Love you

337
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,240
What went wrong?

338
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,720
We are different from us

339
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,500
It's a real T.I.M.

340
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,880
I was called here just for this.

341
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,280
Make it more colorful!

342
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,120
Th-That guy was hard-working.

343
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,680
We are T.I.M. T.I.M. T.I.M. T.I.M.

344
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,960
Shut up! Stop it!

345
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,160
Their subordinates are strong assistants!

346
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,900
When I rented a supercar, I ran out of money.

347
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,140
You are a half-baked rich man.

348
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,720
Shut up! Anyway, I'll save Reiko!

349
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,360
Everyone, let's go around the waterfall!

350
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,240
What the hell is that guy?

351
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,400
They started moving.

352
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,180
It's a tunnel!

353
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,140
Ready to launch the tear gas bomb!

354
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,840
Fire!

355
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,340
Fire!

356
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,760
What the hell is going on?

357
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,440
Where is the third one?

358
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:20,740
Hey!

359
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,460
Cut off the connection between the second and the third one!

360
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,340
Roger that.

361
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,640
Reiko!

362
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,480
Let me go!

363
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,700
You're the only one who can save Reiko!

364
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,320
What?

365
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:34,840
What?

366
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,300
What?

367
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,180
It's a trap!

368
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:37,740
Oh no!

369
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,720
The connection has been cut off!

370
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,780
What the hell is going on?

371
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,380
You want to escape?

372
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,160
See you later!

373
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,220
You idiot!

374
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Stop it!

375
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,720
Let go of me!

376
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,200
No!

377
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:02,700
No!

378
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,300
Hey!

379
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,880
No!

380
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,160
No!

381
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:08,740
No!

382
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,620
You want to escape?

383
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,400
You're leaving!

384
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,460
Don't stop!

385
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,440
What's wrong?

386
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,040
Try and stop it!

387
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,980
Don't stop!

388
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,520
Stop it!

389
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:16,940
I can't!

390
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,380
Let's see what you've got?!

391
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,700
Let's see what you've got?!

392
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,880
Over 100,000,000 yen Supercar

393
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,220
Over 100,000,000 yen Supercar

394
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,660
More than 100,000,000 yen supercar is burning!

395
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,580
Hell get it!

396
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,760
Hell get it!

397
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,740
How idiotic.

398
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,640
This music is...

399
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,440
Colonel Buckley!

400
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,300
Hahaha, you're not doing anything like a kidnapper! I'll lend you a hand!

401
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:06,780
Hey! You're too much, Captain Buglue!

402
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,880
Hahaha! I'm the one who's been playing hard to get!

403
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,420
Anyway, we've created an entrance!

404
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,740
Reiko! Reiko!

405
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,600
Oh no! A dummy!

406
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,920
What the?!

407
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,140
Too bad!

408
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,420
Ryo!

409
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,360
Reiko!

410
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,400
Reiko!

411
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:43,540
Reiko!

412
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,940
Did you hide her inside the criminals?

413
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,740
Senpai!

414
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,100
Hey, you dummy!

415
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,080
Ryo!

416
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,920
Reiko! I will save your life!

417
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,540
Ryo...

418
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,980
You've done well, but that's enough!

419
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,580
Transform!

420
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,980
What?!

421
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,100
That's not fair!

422
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,780
I'm finished!!!

423
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,360
Farewell!

424
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,240
Ryo!

425
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,280
Reiko!

426
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,280
Ryo!

427
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,680
Amazing! Looks like it was a completely different show!

428
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,080
That whole car was one of a kind!

429
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,980
Let's follow!

430
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,960
I can't keep up!

431
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,040
Huh? There's something that looks like a paper!

432
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,540
I'm rolling something like a stone.

433
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,900
Damn it!

434
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,980
What's this?

435
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,540
It's not a Bergen announcement, is it?

436
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,120
If you want to save Reiko Akimoto, come to Scotland.

437
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,300
Mr. X?

438
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,180
Damn it! What's Mr. X?

439
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,100
You're kidding me!

440
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,980
Yonchan!

441
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,660
Wait, Reiko.

442
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,640
I'll save you no matter what happens to me.

443
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:16,180
Mr. X's father?

444
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,340
I was worried about him, but I couldn't find him.

445
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,160
I understand how you feel.

446
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,700
But how did you know that Reiko was taken to Scotland?

447
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,560
I had a new request from the people who kidnapped her.

448
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,600
They're from Minoshiroki.

449
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,480
I asked them to increase the number of people and bring her here to Hataborder Castle on the same date of tomorrow.

450
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,040
Damn, they're so mean.

451
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,700
I'm not going to forgive them!

452
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,740
So I decided to get her married to someone who saved her.

453
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,140
Married?

454
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,420
I think the one who will be rescued will take her life.

455
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,920
But only a man who can overcome this will be worthy of Reiko's baby.

456
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,440
As my successor, I will entrust the future of Akimoto Group to her.

457
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,700
I want to save Reiko, but marriage is...

458
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,160
You! What are you dissatisfied with?

459
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,300
Reiko is above beautiful,

460
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,140
95, 58, 90,

461
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,940
nice body.

462
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,160
Just being able to get married,

463
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,440
I'm super lucky.

464
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,440
And, I can become my own

465
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,720
2 trillion yen.

466
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,480
What? 2 trillion yen?

467
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,800
Yes! I finally got it.

468
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,740
Oh!

469
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,320
From today, I will call you my father!

470
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,460
Gyou-sama!

471
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,740
You swore a future with me, but you won't allow me to marry Reiko-san!

472
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,680
When did I swear a future?

473
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,420
First of all, you are a man.

474
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,520
Ah, senpai.

475
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,680
Nakagawa-kun,

476
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,340
I want you to save Reiko.

477
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,440
I'm looking forward to it.

478
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,100
Marriage is a different matter.

479
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,040
Reiko-san will definitely get out of here.

480
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,360
I see. I'm counting on you.

481
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,100
Hatter Border Castle

482
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,780
is a noble castle built in the 15th century.

483
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,740
It is said that

484
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,640
no one has ever fallen into the hands of the enemy

485
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:11,660
in many wars.

486
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,620
It is said to be a castle of difficulty.

487
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,900
Finally, we're here.

488
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,480
Oh, that's...

489
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,500
Oh, they're already here.

490
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,120
Hey!

491
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,760
Hey, you stupid Ban-chan!

492
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,420
What?

493
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,940
It's hard without a helicopter, right, old man?

494
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,700
It's a big star!

495
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,740
Well, you're going to have to work hard.

496
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,060
This music again?

497
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,660
A plan to attack Bakuryume.

498
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,320
Senpai, from here!

499
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:42,960
What?

500
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,360
It's Captain Keppel's G.S.G.9 helicopter.

501
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,640
What?

502
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:57,280
It's a bomb!

503
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,140
You idiot!

504
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,960
Come back to your brother's house!

505
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,500
Did you see that?

506
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,280
I will use the power of Hatter Border Castle

507
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,100
to shoot down those who come near me!

508
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,720
Damn it.

509
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,860
We have to change plans!

510
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,720
Retreat!

511
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,780
If this goes on,

512
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,200
the laser will become blind from the bottom of the cliff.

513
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,520
Who's that at a time like this?

514
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,280
It's me, dear.

515
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,840
Mom?

516
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,760
When are you going to fix Bakuryume's waterway?

517
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,620
No, I'm in the middle of a plan.

518
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,800
If you don't come back right now,

519
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,220
we'll get divorced.

520
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,580
Divorce!

521
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,340
The plan is over.

522
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,220
What?

523
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,340
Oh, no.

524
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,740
How could you let Captain Bakuryume,

525
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,220
who doesn't know his life, retreat?

526
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,700
You guys should also run away

527
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,520
before you get shot down, B!

528
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,560
Ugh...

529
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,640
You can't do that here!

530
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,820
Nakagawa, Chakurikura,

531
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,960
we're going to climb the cliff!

532
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,560
Understood!

533
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,820
we're going to climb the cliff!

534
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,760
Chakurikura, Chakurikura,

535
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,500
You can't escape from here.

536
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,560
Miss,

537
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,080
it's time for your meal.

538
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,040
Please excuse me.

539
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,640
*Sigh*

540
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,020
You even bring me food, and you're really nice to me.

541
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,000
Who are you all?

542
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,980
I can't tell you that, but I'll guarantee your lives, so don't worry.

543
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,400
Excuse me.

544
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,660
I'll take your leave.

545
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,840
This is strange.

546
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,220
She's too kind to be a kidnapper.

547
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,760
Let's go!

548
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,020
Hmph!

549
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,000
- Boss! - What?

550
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,400
Ryotsu and Kankitsu have started climbing the cliff!

551
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,360
What?!

552
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,820
You can't catch up with them!

553
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,620
Let's go!

554
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,100
Chairman, we've brought you some food.

555
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,720
Don't call me Chairman. I'm Mr. X.

556
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm sorry, Mr. X.

557
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,980
So, how's Reiko doing?

558
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,960
Yes.

559
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,680
She seems to be in a good mood, but she's not.

560
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,340
In a good mood?

561
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,360
Well, it can't be helped.

562
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,620
Mr. X, Captain Keppel's GSG-9 has started climbing the cliff.

563
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,640
Hmph.

564
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,860
What about Captain Bakuryu's Green Beret?

565
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,940
It seems to be completely withdrawn.

566
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,760
It wasn't as bad as I expected.

567
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,080
By the way, is there anyone who can match my glasses?

568
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,460
Yes.

569
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,380
I know the sound of the Nakagawa Concern.

570
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,040
Well...

571
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,360
What?

572
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,560
Is there a man in that

573
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,240
Miochiko-style Tojo Kendo school group who's sleepy?

574
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,000
The son of the president of the Yoshikawa Forestry Company, who is said to be the forest king in Hokkaido, Yoshikawa Mamoru.

575
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,700
I've met the president. He's a very valuable man.

576
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,120
Among the GSG-9, there is the second descendant of the Daimler Faction, Gelt Ebenbach.

577
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:35,820
Alright.

578
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,120
Leave the three of them, including Nakagawa-kun, and drop them.

579
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:40,900
Understood.

580
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:41,940
Yes, sir.

581
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,420
A lesson learned.

582
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,120
15 No. 17 Nozzle: Intensifying Water

583
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,140
What is it?

584
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,780
What is this building?

585
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,080
What is it?

586
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,140
What is this building?

587
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,840
I pick you up.

588
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,020
Hello?

589
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,260
Ah!

590
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,720
Legs!

591
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,000
What's wrong?

592
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,660
Thank you for paying.

593
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,220
Here!

594
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,900
What is this?

595
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,920
The mobile phone strap of the consummation prize.

596
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,700
What?

597
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,220
You can get each one!

598
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,880
Hey Yashica!

599
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,660
Why are you not getting wet?

600
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,760
I don't know, either.

601
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,000
Un!

602
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,660
Argh! What the hell is this!?

603
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,860
The Treasure of Tengu!

604
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,280
This is...

605
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:41,860
Monster!

606
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,840
Ahh! As expected of the Chieftain!

607
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,520
Good job!

608
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,520
Yeah, good job.

609
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:10,780
Here's your prize.

610
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:11,500
Huh?

611
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,740
Everyone!

612
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,800
Senpai!

613
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,280
You can't do this anymore!

614
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,220
Come on, Honda!

615
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,920
But don't push yourself too hard.

616
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,660
You can fall down.

617
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,560
But don't die!

618
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,040
It's difficult!

619
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,380
Nakagawa!

620
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,160
You won't get any water!

621
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,360
You can climb up without us!

622
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,600
Huh? But...

623
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,520
Idiot!

624
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,280
This strategy is important to save Reiko!

625
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,860
Senpai...

626
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,500
I understand!

627
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,520
All right!

628
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,200
Good job, Nakagawa!

629
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,660
Reiko...

630
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,380
Ryo, take this if you like.

631
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,420
Huh?

632
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,900
Take this.

633
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,880
You've been eating cup noodles all day.

634
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,780
When you're on a diet, you'll break your body.

635
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,380
Here, eat this.

636
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:09,920
Oh!

637
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,420
Bon appetit!

638
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,600
It's good!

639
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
I'm sorry.

640
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,780
Please, Reiko!

641
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
I don't have a single penny in advance.

642
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,560
I can't buy cup noodles.

643
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,660
I'll only need 10,000 yen...

644
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,460
No, 1,000 yen.

645
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,160
Please!

646
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,360
Lend me some!

647
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,180
I guess I have no choice.

648
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,640
I'll ask the manager.

649
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
It's a secret from the manager.

650
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,020
Here you go.

651
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,240
Reiko...

652
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,200
Is this it?

653
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,100
Huh?

654
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,940
Senpai!

655
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,620
Everyone!

656
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,000
Are you all right?

657
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,120
Oh!

658
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,180
Nakagawa!

659
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,160
You stopped the water!

660
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,020
Yes!

661
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,240
Hurry up and come up!

662
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,260
All right!

663
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,380
Let's all go rescue Reiko!

664
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,180
Yes!

665
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,780
Yeah!

666
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,780
As expected of the Japanese police team.

667
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,060
No losers.

668
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,840
But there are still a lot of unnecessary people left.

669
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,740
Let's try to get them back here.

670
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,460
What?

671
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,240
There are five paths!

672
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:29,900
Haha!

673
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
Everyone!

674
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,020
I'm glad you made it this far!

675
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,780
I'll praise you!

676
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,640
Wow!

677
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,840
Who are you?

678
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,440
I'm the boss of the Ryukai Gang, Mr. X!

679
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:40,820
What?

680
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,000
Damn it!

681
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,100
Where did Reiko go?

682
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,660
What?

683
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:44,960
Wow!

684
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:45,880
Ouch!

685
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:46,940
What?

686
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,320
Senpai!

687
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,600
It's a three-dimensional image!

688
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,840
What?

689
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,360
Damn it!

690
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,740
You're imitating me!

691
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,760
Hahaha!

692
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,940
Don't be so angry!

693
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,080
Everyone!

694
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,900
There's a big problem waiting for you.

695
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,100
First, you'll have to split into the pair that I choose.

696
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,480
Huh?

697
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,060
The bear pair.

698
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,120
The rabbit pair.

699
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,040
The panda pair.

700
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,080
The elephant pair.

701
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,800
The gorilla pair.

702
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,580
Why do I have to be a pair like this in kindergarten?

703
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,260
What?

704
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,420
Ah, senpai!

705
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,380
I won't take any questions.

706
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,640
Now, choose your favorite entrance.

707
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,580
There are two easy entrances.

708
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,240
The other three have difficulties, but the cowardly ones will never pass.

709
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,900
If you give up, you're out.

710
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,720
Then, I wish you good luck.

711
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,260
All right, Honda!

712
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,000
Here I go!

713
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:41,880
Yes!

714
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,060
Oh!

715
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,920
It's a shoe ball!

716
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,100
Huh?

717
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,160
I got it right?

718
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,280
Mr. Nakagawa!

719
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,620
You're a genius!

720
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:57,860
You're so lucky!

721
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:58,820
Yeah!

722
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,480
Yeah!

723
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,740
We won!

724
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,260
We won!

725
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,560
Yeah!

726
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:03,920
Yeah!

727
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,780
Huh?

728
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,980
He got it wrong?

729
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,320
What do you mean?

730
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,420
Ouch!

731
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,100
Ouch!

732
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,700
Good job!

733
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,120
It's the three-ixed type cell phone strap.

734
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:22,840
Huh?

735
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,620
Huh?

736
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,020
What's this challenge?

737
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:26,980
I see.

738
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,740
The two who drew the challenge!

739
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,760
Now, let's have the obstacles we've prepared challenge you!

740
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,660
What?

741
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,660
What are the obstacles?

742
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,200
Huh?

743
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,580
Now, if you want to advance, you have to fight those lions and defeat them!

744
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:54,600
серьёзな!

745
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,800
Ha! The coward won't survive!

746
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,340
How was it! Did it surprise you?

747
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:10,380
You're a lion!

748
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
�� moi

749
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,280
How was it? Were you surprised?

750
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,260
The video of the castle walls and the lions is...

751
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,140
The video of the castle walls and the lions is...

752
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,640
It's... It's gross!

753
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,900
You're using such a false recording—

754
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,880
I used a video recording up until the start of the game.

755
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,740
But it's all your fault.

756
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,320
Oh, crap!

757
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,400
-Jump! -Ahhhhh!

758
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,660
TVP Delta: What a challenge!

759
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,060
Huh?

760
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,500
Ah! A d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d!

761
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,600
It appears you've chosen the worst possible entrance.

762
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,440
I-I-I can't do this, right?

763
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,840
Heeeey, bring it on, I'll give up andlee-eeey!

764
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,700
Shut!

765
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,640
Shut up! I can't give up after coming all the way here!

766
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
But the dinosaurs! The dinosaurs!

767
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,400
This is a 3D image.

768
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,520
Huh? Is that so?

769
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,320
The one that I showed you earlier is the hint.

770
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,720
The more I get trapped in traps like this, the more I...

771
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,340
No, it was real!

772
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,360
I'm out of breath!

773
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,380
W-W-W-What should we do with Senpai?

774
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,620
Don't worry! I've brought something good!

775
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,600
Hm? What are you trying to do?

776
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,600
How's that?

777
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,960
It's a Pokéball!

778
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,560
Now, Honda! Get on!

779
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,480
Yes!

780
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,040
Hey, Ryōshin's husband! Don't you want to ride?

781
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,680
No!

782
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:07,900
Yeah!

783
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,800
Hold on tight!

784
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,600
You dinosaur!

785
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,700
Take this!

786
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,680
I did it!

787
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,840
How's that, Mister X?

788
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,680
You're pretty good.

789
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,060
But what about the next stage?

790
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,960
Huh? Senpai!

791
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,720
Yo!

792
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,660
Hey, you guys!

793
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,900
Lord Ryo! I'm glad you're all right!

794
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,620
Yeah! I had to bring Honda with me!

795
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,080
Oooh, I got scared!

796
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,220
By the way, what are you doing here?

797
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,820
So that was "Quiz," the quiz.

798
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,280
Quiz?!

799
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,540
We're going to run away!

800
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,960
It's Quiz-Grand Prix!

801
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,420
We have to have you still only throw your own flour!

802
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,320
The top two will be able to play the job!

803
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,920
Shut up!

804
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,380
Why is it "Quiz?"

805
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,020
Plus, it's too old!

806
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,760
You're not even qualified for the "Quiz Millionaire!"

807
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,560
Don't ask questions from me!

808
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,680
First, I need to play the game a little to see if I had time to call it!

809
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,740
History of The importance of Setosuna

810
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,740
" дети, You are遺憾"

811
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,520
"CEO of Setosuna"

812
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,180
"CCO of Setosuna"

813
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:14,940
"CCO and092 00001"

814
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,360
"A introductory discussion"

815
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:17,800
"I'm a newbie! Not impressed!"

816
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,280
"It's a cover here!"

817
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,220
"Ha! Stop it!"

818
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,040
"Ahhh!"

819
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,060
So...

820
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,540
I'm sorry.

821
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,380
Tanco Boki Baji!

822
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,880
Yay! Next up is,

823
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,700
Genou Ongaku no Sanju!

824
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,620
The first member of the Rika-chan Trio is...

825
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,620
Rika Izumi Wataru!

826
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,740
What is this problem?

827
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,420
I was told that it's a very difficult problem, so...

828
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,840
No! At this rate, the Leots will be left behind!

829
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,480
It's over!

830
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:04,560
It's over!

831
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,380
It's over!

832
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,120
Hey, hey! Don't end it so suddenly!

833
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,060
It's the last problem if the bell rings!

834
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,120
That's right.

835
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,180
You shut up!

836
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,160
Well, that's fine.

837
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,300
There's no more music that the Leots are good at.

838
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,580
Then, Nonsection's Sanju!

839
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,860
In other words, what is the real name of the pig gorilla?

840
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,560
It's a bear, Kaoru!

841
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,440
Yay! We won!

842
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,240
The Leots are left behind!

843
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,120
What is the pig gorilla?

844
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:34,780
What is it?

845
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,820
I told you to shut up!

846
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,000
The Ryomei of Nakagawa Ryotsu has won.

847
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,120
Yay!

848
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,840
As expected of Master Ryo!

849
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,240
Then, you may come to the next stage.

850
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,160
Yes! Senpai,

851
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:48,960
please do your best!

852
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,920
Leave it to me!

853
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,600
Hm? What is this place?

854
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,640
You two came all the way here,

855
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,320
I should praise you.

856
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,280
I, Akimoto Reiko,

857
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,360
will meet you if I climb up the stairs.

858
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,860
What?

859
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,400
Reiko!

860
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,240
Wait!

861
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,780
You!

862
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,240
You're not just a piece of junk.

863
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,980
When an incident occurs in the land,

864
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,740
a single pan will solve everything!

865
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,520
The leader of Special Police Officer Tambara Arasu,

866
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,140
Pan Deca!

867
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,740
He is here!

868
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,320
Why are you here?

869
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,340
As the last gate,

870
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:31,740
I will fight the special police officers

871
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,000
who will start the Pan Deca as the gatekeeper.

872
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,540
What?

873
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,700
That's right.

874
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:39,860
If you want to save your host,

875
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,700
you must defeat me first.

876
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,360
Why are you, the police officer,

877
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,340
on the criminal side?

878
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,600
I wanted to fight you, Kanegane,

879
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,220
and see which one of you has the best ability.

880
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,060
Is that the reason?

881
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,040
Senpai!

882
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,560
There seems to be something behind this.

883
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,600
Please let me do this.

884
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,760
I understand.

885
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,020
Let's start.

886
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,040
Wait, Nakagawa.

887
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,600
Did you forget the rules of my battle?

888
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:08,860
What?

889
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,720
It started again.

890
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,800
Nakagawa,

891
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,540
you should be naked, too.

892
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,360
What? Me, too?

893
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,180
Nakagawa, I will be naked.

894
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,220
No, I made a mistake

895
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,100
and Reiko was kidnapped.

896
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,780
I will do it!

897
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,240
Nakagawa!

898
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,860
What do you think?

899
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,540
You're so naive, Nakagawa.

900
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,660
If you were hiding something like this,

901
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,500
you wouldn't have won against me.

902
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,640
I understand!

903
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,380
That's right. That's what a man should do.

904
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,620
I'm the beast, Yasuda Kei!

905
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,360
What?

906
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,900
I'll do it!

907
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,100
I'll do it!

908
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,700
What?

909
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,260
Nakagawa!

910
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:03,740
What?

911
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,560
What?

912
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,540
Senpai...

913
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,720
I'm counting on you to save Reiko.

914
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,140
Hey, hey!

915
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,300
It's meaningless to defeat Nakagawa!

916
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,260
If Ryouzu Kankichi wins

917
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,500
and becomes Reiko's son-in-law,

918
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,800
my Akiyama group

919
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,380
will be finished!

920
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,840
That's what I meant.

921
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,780
I knew it, Papa!

922
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,080
How dare you do this!

923
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,060
Reiko!

924
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:32,800
Is it Reiko?

925
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,980
Ryou!

926
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,180
I'm sorry.

927
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,560
This is all my father's doing

928
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,400
to get me married.

929
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,060
What?

930
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,360
If there's someone who can protect me,

931
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,740
I can marry him.

932
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,220
But this stupid thing...

933
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,940
Stop fighting!

934
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,560
Stop fighting!

935
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,400
I won't!

936
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,680
Ryou...

937
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,120
Stop! Let me go!

938
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,540
What's wrong, Reiko?

939
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,460
I'm sorry, Reiko.

940
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,940
I can't get over it.

941
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:02,960
Papa!

942
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,800
Reiko!

943
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,420
Ryou!

944
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,600
Reiko!

945
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,940
I know I love you this time!

946
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,900
I'm going to defeat the Kaipandegas

947
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,980
and save you!

948
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,060
Ryou...

949
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,880
You're going to destroy my property!

950
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,220
Take me away!

951
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,500
Ryou!

952
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,760
That's what I'm talking about, Kaipandega!

953
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,260
This is a great game!

954
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,800
It's a game I've been waiting for.

955
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:38,740
Let's go!

956
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,980
Damn it!

957
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,620
Damn it.

958
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,020
Yeah, fighting is a professional sport.

959
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,720
I can beat you with this!

960
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,160
Ah, I closed it.

961
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,500
Not yet!

962
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,600
Huh?

963
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,320
Ah! No, no!

964
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,700
It's embarrassing! Give me my tie back!

965
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,600
Tie?

966
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,880
Well, you!

967
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:16,360
You're not embarrassed to wear a friton, but you're embarrassed to not wear a tie, right?

968
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,180
Yes, that's right.

969
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,800
What's wrong, Kaipande?

970
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,160
It seems that it is impossible to continue the fight.

971
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,300
This tie is the same as my pants for him!

972
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,020
Hey, if you admit defeat, I'll return this tie!

973
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,860
Ah, I understand. It's my loss.

974
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,860
This game is my victory!

975
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,720
I'll leave the tie here!

976
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,400
Goodbye!

977
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,920
Rai-go!

978
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,180
I'm coming!

979
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,820
I'm coming now!

980
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,460
What's wrong with this Hatch?

981
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,600
What's going on?

982
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,700
La-li-la-li-la-li-la-li-la!

983
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,200
I love the sea and protect justice.

984
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,240
Poseidon is the reader of this song.

985
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,000
It's the Kita expression of the word Morin.

986
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,100
La-li-la-li-la-li-la-li-la!

987
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,900
I'm the president of the Federal Police Agency.

988
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,220
He's the boss of the sea.

989
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,440
Here's Yatsuki Kato, your electric candle, heading to the trade bank.

990
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,020
Go for it, Dolphin!

991
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,260
He's been working at the factory for too long as usual.

992
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,560
Matthew!

993
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,580
I'm coming, so the games are over here!

994
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,140
You're going to surprising me with dolphin's song again, right?

995
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,580
Unfortunately, Dolphins are on leave.

996
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,700
Today, I'll be the one to do it!

997
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,880
Ha-ha!

998
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,340
I'll fire a thunderbolt!

999
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,640
What?!

1000
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,760
Ah, what a fool!

1001
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,500
Buh-huh!

1002
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,720
Buh-huh!

1003
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,780
Buh-huh!

1004
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:57,880
Ah!

1005
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,420
Ah!

1006
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,680
Ouch!

1007
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:04,740
Ah!

1008
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,220
-Ryo! -Step!

1009
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,540
Are you okay?

1010
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,480
Damn it! I can't believe Reiko's there!

1011
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,720
Huh?

1012
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:16,980
That's it!

1013
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:17,760
What?

1014
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,880
Lend me that!

1015
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,280
Reiko! I'm coming!

1016
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,800
-Stan! -You're so slow!

1017
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,920
Reiko!

1018
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,760
Huh? That's...

1019
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:44,360
Ah!

1020
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:44,880
Hahaha!

1021
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,560
I don't think you can just transform like that!

1022
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,460
Let's use the moon's energy and use it to create the stack of justice!

1023
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,040
If you want to get killed by the sky, you can count on me!

1024
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,900
Moon Knight of the Moon!

1025
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,000
Moon Knight!

1026
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,940
And also, Moon Knight of Venus!

1027
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,240
Moon Knight...

1028
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:02,980
Reiko!

1029
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,000
Ryo!

1030
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:05,860
Huh?

1031
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,340
Oh! If you keep going like this, you'll get climbed to the top!

1032
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,700
Moon Knight of Venus!

1033
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,500
Today, I'll destroy the transformation!

1034
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:13,880
Roger!

1035
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,020
I'll make you pay for this, Tokaioi!

1036
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,220
Tokaioi!

1037
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,900
Why is Saigo-san's statue here?!

1038
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,580
If we drop something like that, even Reiko-chan will be in danger!

1039
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:27,960
Stop it!

1040
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,120
Hey!

1041
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,540
Reiko-san, get ready!

1042
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,400
Yes!

1043
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,540
The moon is...

1044
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,400
Target locked on!

1045
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,100
Shoot it down! Laser, fire!

1046
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,540
Saigo-san, pass!

1047
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,020
Seagull and Reiko!

1048
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,040
Reiko!

1049
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,900
No more!

1050
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,600
Ryo-chan!

1051
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,120
You came to help us, didn't you?

1052
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,520
Yes, I promised!

1053
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,860
Ryo-chan...

1054
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:27,140
Get back!

1055
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,160
Yes!

1056
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:42,740
Hey!

1057
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,060
Seagull! Reiko-chan!

1058
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,480
Reiko-chan...

1059
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,220
It's your fault!

1060
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,200
What?

1061
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,080
Ryo-san!

1062
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,960
-Seagull! -Seagull-chan!

1063
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:02,860
Are you okay?

1064
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,280
Of course!

1065
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,860
I'm just losing my mind in shock!

1066
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,060
I'm so glad!

1067
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,440
I'm really so glad!

1068
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,560
Ryo-sama, too!

1069
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,440
You're safe!

1070
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:14,980
As promised,

1071
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,720
I'll get the 200 million yen and Reiko!

1072
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,240
That's right!

1073
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,420
Reiko's father!

1074
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,020
What did you say?

1075
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,860
Reiko!

1076
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,300
Are you awake?

1077
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,660
The real purpose was the 200 million yen.

1078
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,920
I was just following you!

1079
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,700
No, it's not!

1080
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,500
Ouch!

1081
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,640
I was the idiot who thought it was fine for me to be Ryo-chan's wife even for a moment!

1082
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,240
I was the idiot who thought it was fine for me to be Ryo-chan's wife even for a moment!

1083
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,080
No, it's not!

1084
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,440
You're mistaken!

1085
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,180
I'm really talking about you!

1086
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,180
That's right!

1087
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:46,500
That's right!

1088
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,040
Stop it!

1089
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,360
Stop it!

1090
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,080
You little...

1091
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,860
Papa!

1092
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:49,520
Yes!

1093
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,000
I'll talk to you later.

1094
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,100
Yes.

1095
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,020
Sorry.

1096
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,140
I'm a little tired.

1097
00:47:59,320 --> 00:47:59,760
Papa!

1098
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,860
I'm going back to Tokyo.

1099
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,660
I'm a little tired.

1100
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,040
OK!

1101
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,080
Hey!

1102
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,120
Put a cart in the cabin.

1103
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:06,920
Please put a cart in the cabin.

1104
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,400
Wait!

1105
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,100
I'm going to save Reiko!

1106
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,660
I'm going to save Reiko!

1107
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:10,880
As promised!

1108
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,300
Dismiss her with your money, immediately!

1109
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

1110
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,820
After all, Reiko-chan says she doesn't want to get married...

1111
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,560
that we needn't talk about her.

1112
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:18,940
Stop joking around!

Ryo-sama...

1114
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,400
I did all that for the money, so you've been spoiled!

1115
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,840
Oh, well, it's alright.

1116
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,540
Hey!

Take me with you!

It's a misunderstanding!

1122
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,720
Damn it!

1123
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,460
Why does it always end like this?!
