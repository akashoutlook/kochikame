I have a postcard for you.

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,480
It's for the delivery, right?

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,300
Give it to me.

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,260
It's not for the delivery.

33
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,180
It's for the deliveryman...

34
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,160
Yone Ryochi.

35
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,700
What?

36
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,100
Ryo, aren't you Yone and Fukuro?

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,420
Well, yeah.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,440
Ryo, what are you doing?

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,340
It's worse than a postcard for the delivery.

40
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,180
I'm going to the patrol.

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,820
"Kankichi, I'm fine."

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,380
"I can't reply to any postcards."

43
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,940
"I heard you don't have any letters."

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,480
"I've been feeling down for years."

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,580
"My father was sick last year."

46
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,940
"So he's very weak now."

47
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,060
"He's been sleeping all day."

48
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:49,940
"And he's not getting any sleep."

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,260
"Kankichi, don't get mad at me."

50
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,280
"Just show me your face at least once."

51
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,560
"Then I'll get better, too."

52
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,400
"I'll be right back, you know."

53
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,620
"I'll be back from the cold and the cold won't be so strong."

54
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,400
Ryo, wait!

55
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,580
What?

56
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,600
Why don't you go back home?

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,260
Shut up!

58
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,320
I hate word-of-mouth!

59
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm done!

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,320
Ryo-chan!

61
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,200
Don't do that.

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,700
You'll be in a bad mood if you talk about your family.

63
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,080
By the way, you've never talked about your family before, have you?

64
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,820
There's something I can't talk about.

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,040
Chief?

66
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,880
Chief, what's something you can't talk about?

67
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,980
I don't know much about it,

68
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,600
but since I left home after having a big fight with my father at the age of 18,

69
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,420
I haven't gone home once.

70
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,000
So you haven't been home for many years?

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,540
Yeah.

72
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,380
I used to go home to my family without thinking about it.

73
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,300
I thought you went back to Shibabata, but it was a waste.

74
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,900
You were always saying that you had a beautiful sister.

75
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,580
By the way, you said you didn't like the talk with Tsukudani.

76
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,520
I talk with her every year.

77
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,660
My family sent a lot of Tsukudani to my mother and father-in-law.

78
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,420
"Kankichi is taking care of you.

79
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,980
I'll be in your care from now on."

80
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,760
I wrote that letter.

81
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,020
Ryo-chan has such a wonderful family.

82
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,080
Oh, right.

83
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,180
Why don't you make Ryo-chan and your father get back together?

84
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,180
That's a great idea, isn't it?

85
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,660
What?

86
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,940
Then your mother won't have to write such a letter.

87
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,160
Don't do that.

88
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,640
If you get too involved in Ryo-chan's affairs,

89
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,620
it won't be good for you.

90
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:41,880
I'll kill you.

91
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,620
Damn it.

92
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,060
Someone sent me a letter.

93
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,560
What are you doing, dad?

94
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,680
I was feeling good today,

95
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,160
so I thought I'd give you a ride to Sensoji.

96
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,120
Wait a minute.

97
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,020
You don't need a sports newspaper.

98
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
This is...

99
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,240
You can't move while you're just lying down.

100
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,720
It's called the head exercise.

101
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,720
Bye.

102
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,280
Dad!

103
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,120
Oh my god.

104
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,760
I was so happy to get the Manba ticket that I was surprised.

105
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,700
Senpai, please come here for a moment.

106
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,440
There's something I want to show you.

107
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,460
Something you want to show?

108
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,400
What is it? Isn't it just a navigation system?

109
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,580
It's different from the navigation system over there.

110
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,420
It's a super navigation system made by the company in my line.

111
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,180
Of course, there's traffic jam information.

112
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,640
All the houses and buildings in Japan,

113
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,280
and even all the dates and food stalls are all in there.

114
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,760
Oh, so you've got such a detailed map.

115
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,760
So let's set the destination and turn on the navigation.

116
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,020
Is there anywhere you want to go?

117
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,860
Hey, I haven't been to Asakusa since I came to Tokyo.

118
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,280
Let's go to Asakusa.

119
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,120
Hey, don't go there. Let's go somewhere else.

120
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,920
Why?

121
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,320
It's just like that.

122
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,160
Anyway,

123
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:03,980
you should stop going to Asakusa.

124
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,400
I see.

125
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,740
I can't get out of Asakusa.

126
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,940
That's right.

127
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,920
There's no place to play in Asakusa.

128
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,380
It's just old people and old women.

129
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,620
That's right.

130
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,220
There's nothing to see.

131
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,800
Let's go to Shibuya or Roppongi.

132
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,940
You two.

133
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,700
You say Asakusa is lame?

134
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,940
Stop joking around.

135
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,260
What?

136
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,800
Asakusa has been the center of culture since the Edo period.

137
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,200
Compared to Asakusa,

138
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,740
Shibuya and Roppongi are the same.

139
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,980
But Ryo-chan...

140
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,720
Shut up!

141
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,940
There's nothing to see.

142
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,100
You're a jokester.

143
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,780
I'll show you what Asakusa is like.

144
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,060
Huh?

145
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,180
Huh?

146
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,100
Good morning.

147
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,200
Let's start the route guide.

148
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,220
What's this voice?

149
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,840
Isn't it Maya Katsuragi, the popular anime voice actor?

150
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,360
Ryo-chan,

151
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,580
please go to Asakusa with Maya.

152
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,420
I'll do it.

153
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,260
I'll do it.

154
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,760
I don't want to talk to the navigation.

155
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,640
If you input your name,

156
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,140
it will guide you to talk to the person.

157
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,220
By the way,

158
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,720
this is the popular voice actor version.

159
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,180
There are many other software.

160
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,340
Don't do that.

161
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,760
Be more relaxed.

162
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,320
What is this software?

163
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,420
Nakagawa.

164
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,280
It's quite good.

165
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,260
It's the AV actress version.

166
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,960
Change it to another one.

167
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,860
Oh, no.

168
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,600
He's going to control the intersection.

169
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,860
Why can't I turn left?

170
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,200
You idiot,

171
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,920
Kasu!

172
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,540
How dare you,

173
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,280
you bastard!

174
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,480
Ryo-chan,

175
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,100
calm down.

176
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,060
What are you going to do if you are attacked?

177
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,520
The Yakuza version doesn't seem to suit you,

178
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:46,800
Senpai.

179
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,600
Oh,

180
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,180
Kami-ись

181
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,900
Whoa, that's a lot of tourists!

182
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,960
A big boat!

183
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,780
Yo, what is this?

184
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,380
You don't know Kaminari-mon either, Tagu-mon?

185
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,700
He looks quite scary. What's this?

186
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,120
This is thunder.

187
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,500
And this is wind.

188
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,160
And at the end of the line is the war zone.

189
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,780
It's still early in the morning.

190
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,040
It's pretty busy.

191
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,020
It's not as busy as it used to be.

192
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,740
It's delicious fresh out of the oven.

193
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,100
Look, it's Ryo-chan.

194
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,880
I'm eating this one too.

195
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,960
Here, you can eat this one too.

196
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,540
It's Ryo-chan.

197
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,840
It's Kan-chan.

198
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,100
How are you, Grandma?

199
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,920
It's been a while.

200
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,400
Hey, Kan-chan is back.

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,180
Oh, Kanchika. Long time no see.

202
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,300
Hey, Dad.

203
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,600
I was drinking.

204
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,640
Why are you crying, God?

205
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,520
You're the one who's become a good policeman.

206
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,340
I thought I'd destroy the shop in three days.

207
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,960
I was looking forward to it.

208
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,160
What?

209
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,320
You're a little bit naughty.

210
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,540
It's been years since I've seen you.

211
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,020
Ryo-chan is popular.

212
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,000
For the seniors, this is like a garden.

213
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,220
Ryo-chan, who is in love with alcohol, worry about drinks.

214
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,440
I don't understand you and my family.

215
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,140
You're more and more, so...

216
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,680
Oh, this is nice.

217
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,500
Let's go to Disney World in the countryside.

218
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,600
Disney World in the countryside?

219
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,720
Wait for it.

220
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,880
Wow!

221
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,760
The roller coaster here is full of thrill.

222
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,700
I feel like I'm going to be in a private house.

223
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,680
Anyway, Ryo-chan's home is near here, right?

224
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,540
I'd like to see it.

225
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,220
Don't be afraid! We're working!

226
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,040
Let's go back!

227
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,340
I didn't know there was a word "working" in Ryo-chan's dictionary.

228
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,540
Shut up! I haven't been home for years.

229
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,540
I forgot where I was.

230
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,760
Then don't worry. There's a navigation system.

231
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,820
What?

232
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,020
I came all the way here.

233
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,900
It's like coming to Asakusa and having a party at Senzoji.

234
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,400
Is that so? You guys are crazy!

235
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Hey, let go of me!

236
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,600
Oh, that's Ryo-chan's house.

237
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,980
Well, you've seen it, so let's go inside.

238
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,760
What are you talking about?

239
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,940
We've come all the way here, so let's show our faces.

240
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,120
Hey, isn't that Ryo-chan's mom?

241
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,140
What?

242
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,720
Hey, Senpai!

243
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,480
You idiot!

244
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,660
Since I started fighting with my dad when I was 18,

245
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,560
I've decided not to go back to my parents' house!

246
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,960
But he's not sleeping soundly.

247
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,540
You should pay him a visit.

248
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,340
I'm so moved that I came all the way here!

249
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,380
I can't wait to go home!

250
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,920
I'm going home.

251
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,640
Ryo-chan! We've come all the way here!

252
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,120
Senpai, why don't you have lunch?

253
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,320
I'll feed you.

254
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,900
Oh, I see.

255
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,100
If you're going to treat me, then let's talk about something else.

256
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,140
Oh, it's delicious.

257
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,100
It's like a chomoro-guk.

258
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,320
It's not just good.

259
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,620
The price is also cheap.

260
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,520
It's true.

261
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,740
If it's this taste and volume, it's twice as good as Ginza.

262
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,780
How is it, Reiko? Have you seen Asakusa again?

263
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,120
Yes, yes.

264
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,180
I'm sorry to have made you wait.

265
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,600
Oh, I see, I see.

266
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,720
Asakusa is the best after all.

267
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,020
Asakusa is the best?

268
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,240
What a fool!

269
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,660
That's absolutely not it!

270
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,560
If such a dirty thing comes, Katsudoki will be surprised and open his eyes.

271
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,200
After all, this is the real world.

272
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,020
If this is Tokyo, it's Roppongi.

273
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,340
It's Roppongi!

274
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,260
Ryo-chan!

275
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,740
If you keep quiet, you'll get a good feeling!

276
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,460
Hey, old fart!

277
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,720
You said Asakusa was a shithole,

278
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,760
and even though Lord Kannon forgives you,

279
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,200
I won't forgive you!

280
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,820
If you get caught up in my expectations,

281
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,040
where the hell are you?

282
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,500
Huh?

283
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,700
Huh?

284
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,820
What?

285
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,040
What?

286
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:02,500
What?

287
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:02,520
What?

288
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,760
What?

289
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:03,880
What?

290
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:03,960
What?

291
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,440
What?

292
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,460
What?

293
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:04,740
What?

294
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,660
What?

295
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,400
What?

296
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:06,460
What?

297
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,680
What?

298
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,680
What?

299
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:18,980
What?

300
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,100
What?

301
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,040
What?

302
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,460
What?

303
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:27,780
What?

304
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,260
What?

305
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,500
What?

306
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:28,880
What?

307
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,440
What?

308
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:29,820
What?

309
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:29,900
What?

310
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,240
What?

311
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,520
What?

312
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:30,560
What?

313
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:30,600
What?

314
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:30,920
What?

315
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:30,980
What?

316
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,400
What?

317
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,620
Let's go.

318
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,060
Let's go.

319
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,460
That's why, the wife of that person,

320
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,900
who gave birth to me fifty years ago...

321
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,340
After all, it's your father!

322
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,360
Well, that's what people say in the world.

323
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,060
Kei-chan, you did it!

324
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,140
Come on, Ryo-chan, let's greet him.

325
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,180
Shhh, now's not the time.

326
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,840
Later, later...

327
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,180
Now's not the time, either!

328
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,520
That's right, senpai!

329
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,880
Come on, come on...

330
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,120
It's a bit noisy next to him.

331
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,760
Come on, come on!

332
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,920
Senpai, you're here!

333
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,880
Hello. Nice to meet you.

334
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,040
My name is Keiichi Nakagawa.

335
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,160
I'm always here to help you.

336
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,020
My name is Reiko Akimoto. Nice to meet you.

337
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,440
T-this is...

338
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,740
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

339
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,220
Are you alright?

340
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,440
Well, I'm fine.

341
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,260
What are you doing? You're his parent, aren't you?

342
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,020
At least greet him.

343
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,160
Ryo-chan!

344
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,160
Senpai!

345
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,040
I-I got it.

346
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,160
H-hello.

347
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,760
I'm your son, Ryotsu.

348
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,920
Do you remember me?

349
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,780
Oh, it's you.

350
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,160
I thought I saw you somewhere earlier.

351
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,260
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...

352
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,200
You're so nosy.

353
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,200
Are you really his parent?

354
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,040
I'm starting to lose my confidence, too.

355
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,320
I'm sorry to disturb you after a long time.

356
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,720
What?

357
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,260
Ryo-chan, I'll go now.

358
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,340
Oh, wait, there's more.

359
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,120
The main race is perfect for the end of the round.

360
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,140
Yes, yes. Take your time.

361
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,560
Thank you very much.

362
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,420
What?

363
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,780
Asakusa No. 1 was expecting a race?

364
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,000
I can't believe you.

365
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,160
Huh?

366
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,940
Ryo-chan, say something.

367
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,300
I haven't seen you in a long time.

368
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,960
Ah, ah, ah...

369
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,340
Um, is your wife making tsukudani?

370
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,680
Yes.

371
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,440
Oh, thank you.

372
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,840
Please speak more actively from your father.

373
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,840
Senpai is embarrassed.

374
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,360
Is that so?

375
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,080
Um, the police are talking about various things in the mass media lately.

376
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,860
I think it's quite a big deal.

377
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,680
I'm being taken up, but the house is also embarrassing.

378
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,180
It's hard.

379
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,480
No, no.

380
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,740
I'm already giving up on that method.

381
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,020
It's like a wedding seat.

382
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,220
I don't think it's a very parent-child conversation.

383
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,800
Hmm...

384
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,340
Hmm...

385
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,360
Hmm...

386
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,580
Hmm...

387
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,780
Hmm...

388
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,220
Hmm...

389
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,960
Hmm...

390
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,220
Hmm...

391
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,680
Hmm...

392
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:36,700
Hmm...

393
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,180
Hmm...

394
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,340
Hmm...

395
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,380
Hmm...

396
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:43,920
Hmm...

397
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,100
Hmm...

398
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,460
Hmm...

399
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:46,560
Hmm...

400
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:46,620
Hmm...

401
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,300
Hmm...

402
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,880
Hmm...

403
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:47,980
Hmm...

404
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,200
Hmm...

405
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,000
Hmm...

406
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,920
Hmm...

407
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:58,240
Hmm...

408
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,740
Don't talk nonsense.

409
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,040
If my father was quiet, I wouldn't have come here.

410
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,580
You're the one who's bad with Asakusa.

411
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,780
You said you would never come to Asakusa again and left.

412
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,020
I came here because Reiko wanted to come.

413
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,420
I don't care.

414
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,820
Well, both of you.

415
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,920
It's a nuisance to the customer here, so let's change the place.

416
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,360
I'm sorry.

417
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,520
How are you?

418
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:25,540
I'm fine.

419
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,800
What a good son.

420
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,520
I can't keep up with him.

421
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,880
Oh, I can't drink this because of the b-ball.

422
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,280
This is...

423
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,960
Ramune drinks by stopping the b-ball with this.

424
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,560
Is that so?

425
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,060
Well, that's why.

426
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,920
This guy is also...

427
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,660
Well, if you think about it now, I don't think I'm mature.

428
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,780
It's bad because my father only makes Tsukudani eat.

429
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,420
When I was in elementary school, I was nicknamed Tsukudani Taro.

430
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,340
So that's how you get big quickly by nourishing yourself.

431
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,480
Tsukudani will become a nutrition master every day.

432
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,000
Just kidding.

433
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,040
Did you tell your face?

434
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,500
What?

435
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,840
This rotten, rotten, rotten, rotten.

436
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:23,800
You.

437
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,880
What are you talking about?

438
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,860
I won't give up.

439
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,300
You.

440
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,580
Ouch.

441
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:34,640
It's a fire.

442
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,140
Fire.

443
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,000
It's a fire.

444
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,460
Out of my way.

445
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,340
Wait, Dad.

446
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,700
Let's go.

447
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,560
The fire is the father's nose.

448
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,360
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

449
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,540
Hurry up!

450
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,520
Looks like they're parents.

451
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,340
Let's go, Midori!

452
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,540
Let's go!

453
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,560
The firemen aren't here yet?

454
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,420
This is bad.

455
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,600
It looks like the old lady is still in her room.

456
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,860
Huh? Where is she?

457
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,480
On the first end of the second floor.

458
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,340
Over there?

459
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,420
Help!

460
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,700
Oh!

461
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,040
Kankichi!

462
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
I'm going to help the little girl.

463
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,740
You take care of her.

464
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,060
Why me?

465
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,160
Wait, Dad!

466
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,520
Why me?

467
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,300
Little girl.

468
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,580
Why me?

469
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,040
Little girl.

470
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,300
Grandma, are you okay?

471
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,140
Are you okay?

472
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,100
I cramped my legs.

473
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,000
Come on, little girl.

474
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,840
I'm sorry.

475
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,400
I can't take it anymore.

476
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,400
Let's go.

477
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,900
Let's go, little girl.

478
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,620
Here we go.

479
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,100
Dad, what are you doing?

480
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,600
Hurry up!

481
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:56,760
I'm sorry.

483
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,420
You're so important.

484
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,660
Little girl, grab my shoulder.

485
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,040
Yes, sir.

486
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,780
Dad, I'm coming to help you.

487
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,620
Wait for me.

488
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,440
Okay.

489
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,700
No, no.

490
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,320
Way to go!

491
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,460
Dad, I can't believe you guys are here.

492
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:26,860
Yes, sir.

493
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,740
Ryo!

494
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,300
Brother!

495
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,200
What are you...

496
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,640
Brother, what are you doing?

497
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,340
I don't have time for this.

498
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,840
You're dangerous.

499
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,740
Just leave this to us.

500
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,720
Shut up!

501
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,700
Stop it!

502
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,280
You said it's no good!

503
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,820
Let him go.

504
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,780
Dad's up there.

505
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,480
What?

506
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,360
No!

507
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,600
Senpai!

508
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,440
Damn it! What is that guy doing?

509
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,020
Damn it! I should've asked him to help me!

510
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,620
I should've asked him to help me!

511
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,920
Don't say that! You can't call this demon!

512
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,700
That bastard!

513
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,140
Kankichi!

514
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,660
Ryo!

515
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,240
Senpai!

516
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,960
No way...

517
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,860
You're gonna kill me!

518
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,320
Senpai!

519
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,720
I'm so worried!

520
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,700
It's not like I'm gonna die!

521
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,780
Reiko, please be kinder.

522
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,100
I'm sorry.

523
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,980
No need to apologize.

524
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm older than you.

525
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,820
Besides, you're so mean.

526
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,420
That's why you feel guilty.

527
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,380
I'm not that horny.

528
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,100
I didn't tell anybody.

529
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,220
What did you say?

530
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,460
I was a 'women's' up till the 3rd grade.

531
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,340
Stop it!

532
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,300
Who could've saved you!

533
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,000
Who said I could save you!?

534
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,800
I almost escaped...

535
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,120
Damn finish!

536
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,800
He did something to me!

537
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,780
We all know that!

538
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,680
Senpai!

539
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,280
I'm busy talking, but I've got to go back.

540
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,240
The chief's...

541
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,140
I see. He came out in silence.

542
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,260
That's why.

543
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:42,780
Take care, Dad.

544
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,140
Thank you for the meal.

545
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,420
It was really fun, Uncle.

546
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,780
That was good.

547
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,560
Excuse me.

548
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,700
Kankichi.

549
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,960
You're not going home?

550
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,840
Mom's worried about you.

551
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
No, not today.

552
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,220
Besides, the ship is on duty.

553
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,620
I'm going back to work now.

554
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,400
See you, Ryo.

555
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,400
See you.

556
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,120
You're not as good as your mom, Yagko.

557
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,360
You're still a young man.

558
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,300
You don't have to be so pitiful.

559
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,140
You're right.

560
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,080
You're a great officer now.

561
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,160
Don't worry about me.

562
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,180
I'm still a young man.

563
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,240
San, get me another one.

564
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,820
Yes, sir.

565
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,920
That hoodie...

566
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,480
Ryo's dad is a fun guy.

567
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,440
Yeah.

568
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,400
He's just like you.

569
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,720
See you later, Senpai.

00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,440
Once a year.

571
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,800
See you later.

572
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,260
See you later then.

573
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,980
See you later.

574
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,620
See you later, donner.

575
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,260
See you later.

576
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,640
Goodbye.

577
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,020
Good luck today.

578
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,620
See you tomorrow, today and tomorrow.

579
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:20,800
Good luck.

580
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,420
Bye.

581
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,020
Good luck.

582
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,440
See you.
