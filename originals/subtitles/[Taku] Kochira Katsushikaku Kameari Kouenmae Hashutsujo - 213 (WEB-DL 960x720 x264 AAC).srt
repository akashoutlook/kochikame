1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,740
John's

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,900
When you watch the television, make the room bright and look far away.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,360
Mari

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,940
Come to me if you're not rich.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,180
I'm not rich, but...

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,600
I'm worried about you

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,800
Look at the blue sky

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,880
White clouds

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,560
I wonder what will happen

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:54,680
To the blue sky

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,520
Come to my place

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,840
If you don't have a job

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,020
I'm not here

14
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,600
But don't worry

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,360
Look, it's burning

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,400
Red clouds

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,140
I wonder what will happen

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,540
To the blue sky

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,580
You know, right?

20
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,220
You know, you know

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,740
If you know, be quiet and follow me

22
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,060
Leiko's Summer Memories

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,120
A special express Azemichi train run in the fields as far as possible

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,500
The scenery reflected on the train carriage seems to bring the heart that modern people have forgotten back

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,880
The journey is really good, isn't it?

26
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,280
Right, Leiko?

27
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:08,920
Yes

28
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,860
What are you doing, the Night's

29
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,160
Soldier?

30
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,500
It's not easy to get drunk with a can of beer.

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,740
It's true.

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,180
And it's a special express train.

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,100
I've been on the train for a long time, so I've been bored.

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,880
It's not just a trip.

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,380
I'm going to find a memory of Reiko-san.

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,040
A trip to find memories is romantic.

37
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:38,880
It's a nostalgic view.

38
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,540
It's a place where you can see the old memories of Reiko-san.

39
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,880
It's nostalgic.

40
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,020
Senpai was born in Tokyo, right?

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,740
I've been in Asakusa all the time.

42
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,560
When you say hometown, you remember this view.

43
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,580
That's right.

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,740
I think this is the hometown of Japan.

45
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,360
Just looking at it, you can see the warmth of the sun and the smell of the grass.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,080
Ryo-chan, you're like a poet.

47
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,400
Which one?

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,900
I'm not like a poet.

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,640
I'm a poet.

50
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,260
What?

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,180
What's wrong?

52
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,520
I'm a poet.

53
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,280
I've seen this view when I was in elementary school.

54
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,760
Don't be stupid.

55
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,520
This is the landscape of Japan.

56
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,240
Reiko-san was born in France and grew up in Europe, right?

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,780
I don't think she was in Japan when I was in elementary school.

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,860
But it's true.

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,680
This is the landscape.

60
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,980
That's right.

61
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,780
I remembered.

62
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,220
When I was in elementary school, I came to Japan only once.

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,820
I saw it at that time.

64
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,120
Really?

65
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,280
Yes.

66
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,900
That is...

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,480
I came to Japan as a new generation ambassador to deliver paintings to elementary schools in Japan.

68
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,400
I was impressed by the landscape of Japan that I saw for the first time.

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,380
Is that here?

70
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,840
I wonder.

71
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,100
There are similar landscapes all over Japan.

72
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,060
It's definitely here.

73
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,500
There's no doubt.

74
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,040
But there's something more important.

75
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,480
What was it?

76
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,880
Hey, Ryo-chan.

77
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,620
Can you take me to this place?

78
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,860
Why me?

79
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,020
Summer vacation.

80
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,220
I told you that I haven't taken it yet.

81
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,800
I'm good at finding things like this, too.

82
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,400
So why do I have to do that?

83
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,800
During this time, a piece of the drink that the chief was cherishing came out of Ryo-chan's trash can.

84
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,340
What?

85
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,000
Who was it that said that he would make a fire in the back and burned the book?

86
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,420
Oh, I got it.

87
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,040
I'll go with you.

88
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,780
Yes.

89
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,160
Thank you, Ryo-chan.

90
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,640
I'm obsessed with the weakness of people.

91
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,840
But even if you say you're looking for it...

92
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,960
I'll ask the publisher.

93
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,100
I'll ask the publisher.

94
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,440
I'll ask the publisher.

95
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,780
It's a terrible countryside.

96
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,800
You can't go back to the day.

97
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,820
You can't go back to the day.

98
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,380
You can't go back to the day.

99
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,680
You have to ask for a strong assistant in the countryside.

100
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,300
You have to ask for a strong assistant in the countryside.

101
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,800
So I called the queen of the countryside, Miss Mammushi.

102
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,360
It's not Miss Mammushi.

103
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,580
It's Miss Kakashi.

104
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,680
It's the same thing.

105
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,520
No.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,860
What's more, it looks like you're taking me on a trip.

107
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,600
Oh, it's my own.

108
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,960
What a big, stupid train.

109
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,460
What's your age?

110
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:06,600
What's your age?

111
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,480
You're in quarantine right now.

112
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,000
Is this a mountain road?

113
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,320
Are you sure this is the right way?

114
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,460
What?

115
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,880
I can't hear you.

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,320
I can't hear anything because the cicadas are so loud.

117
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,780
Well.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,180
Leave the navigation to Komachi.

119
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,080
I went to the countryside on purpose.

120
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,400
I went to the countryside on purpose.

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,080
I caught the man who sells at a high price for this opportunity.

122
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,740
I caught the man who sells at a high price for this opportunity.

123
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,720
I'll make you pay for this. I'm stronger than I remember!

124
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,420
Hm?

125
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,500
What's up? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?

126
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,260
I knew it. I thought you wouldn't move if I was here.

127
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,680
Ryo-chan, you were talking too much.

128
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,000
We're in a big place.

129
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,880
Right? We're on the way to the countryside.

130
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,480
This is why we need to be careful.

131
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,880
As expected of the queen of the countryside.

132
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,240
She's grown up in the countryside, so she knows the way to the beast.

133
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,440
Shut up.

134
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,040
I've never heard so many cicadas.

135
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,100
Hey, Komachi. Why are the cicadas in the countryside so energetic?

136
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,660
I don't know.

137
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,060
Because the cicadas in the countryside fly from one forest to another for a long time and they move a lot.

138
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,840
I told you I don't know. You're so persistent.

139
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,980
Do you have a dialect for your crying voice?

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,860
Hey, Komachi.

141
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,660
Shut up!

142
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,380
Hey, Komachi.

143
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,900
Moscovite!

144
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,200
Hmm...

145
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,760
Wow, this is a long road.

146
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,220
That's enough.

147
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,480
An endless horizon.

148
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,400
I feel dizzy just thinking I keep walking this way.

149
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,100
I feel like my head is going to hurt if I keep walking down this road.

150
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,700
It's okay. The air is good and the car isn't running.

151
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,380
Sorry. There's no bus or taxi.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,060
We're all from the countryside.

153
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,440
We're used to seeing the horizon and it's nothing.

154
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,280
But in Tokyo, you don't see the horizon first.

155
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,780
We, the locals, are overwhelmed.

156
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,860
We don't want to be in the hands of primitive people who are wild.

157
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,300
Even if we have the strength, we're just stupid.

158
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,540
Stupid power has nothing to do with it.

159
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,240
It has a power to move, but it doesn't have the ability to move.

160
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,240
And we're bored with the same scenery.

161
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,220
That's not true.

162
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,520
We're surrounded by such a rich nature.

163
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,680
The dust and the red of the city are being washed away.

164
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,860
There's a problem with nature, too.

165
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,420
Ryo, that's how you think about it.

166
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,220
It causes environmental pollution and natural destruction.

167
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,400
Reiko, you're not saying anything.

168
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,900
This thing itself is an environmental pollution.

169
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,400
This thing?

170
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,340
You're a misnomer.

171
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,520
I don't want to hear that.

172
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,640
You're a misnomer.

173
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,620
I don't care.

174
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,160
I'm going home.

175
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,240
You can do whatever you want.

176
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,240
But the train station is 30 kilometers away.

177
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,160
You don't have the money, do you?

178
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,840
Only 100 yen.

179
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,500
If you can go home, go home.

180
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,980
Damn it.

181
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,640
It's a hell if I go home.

182
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,480
I can't see anything.

183
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,060
And it's so hot.

184
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,180
You're a fool.

185
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,560
I didn't go home.

186
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:43,420
I don't want to go home.

187
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,960
Seriously.

188
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:54,660
You're so crazy, when I say the name same.

189
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,280
This is an issue.

190
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,080
OK, I'll see you at 9 pm.

191
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,320
Bye-bye.

192
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,960
Oh no!

193
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,220
Let's leave him alone and go.

194
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,800
Yeah, we can do anything with Nojuku.

195
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,140
Wait, I'm kidding. I'm sorry about Nojuku, too.

196
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,520
You must be tired.

197
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,020
But the stars are so beautiful.

198
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,300
The sleep of insects is so romantic.

199
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,100
You're so moody.

200
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,940
He was only in one room, so I had to do it with him.

201
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:52,940
Let's be quiet for a while.

202
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,320
I'll be quiet for a while.

203
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,040
You'll be.

204
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,620
What? Where's Ryo?

205
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,940
He's sleeping well.

206
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
He was really tired.

207
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,260
Well, let's go to bed.

208
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,200
Yes!

209
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,800
I'm the big boss.

210
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,540
I'm the boss.

211
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,100
I'm the boss.

212
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,860
Money!

213
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,300
It's mine!

214
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,120
Let's take a break at this shrine for a while.

215
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,780
It's better to take a walk in the morning.

216
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,700
It's over 35 degrees again in the afternoon.

217
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,820
Is that true?

218
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,780
It was pretty cold last night.

219
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,600
After that day, it gets extremely hot.

220
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,220
I dragged him out on that cold night and caught a cold.

221
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,580
What?

222
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
The least about ourselves

223
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,800
The lost old man

224
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,000
The lost old man

225
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,880
The lost old man

226
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,200
It's here.

227
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,080
It's here.

228
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,280
It's here.

229
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,740
It's here.

230
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,400
Look, curious bird.

231
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,620
Come on, it's here.

232
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:01,800
Come on, it's here.

233
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,180
The head debt

234
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,100
The head debt

235
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,620
The head debt

236
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,240
What's about an unnamed bird?

237
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,920
Where does it live?

238
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,420
What about the bird?

239
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,500
Where does it live?

240
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,280
It's the place where the painting was drawn.

241
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,900
There's no doubt about it.

242
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,640
Yay!

243
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,920
While I was delivering the painting to elementary school,

244
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,220
the car went flat.

245
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,900
While I was fixing it, I was waiting here.

246
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,560
French?

247
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,840
What do you mean?

248
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,580
I don't know.

249
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,160
But I remember that a French woman was with me.

250
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,740
Isn't that Reiko's mother?

251
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,260
No, she's different from her mother.

252
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,360
She was someone else.

253
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,320
This is a new mystery.

254
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,560
Maybe if I go to elementary school where I delivered the painting,

255
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,420
I'll remember more details.

256
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,800
That's right.

257
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,960
We came all the way here, so let's go.

258
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,680
Yes.

259
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,300
Are you still going?

260
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,780
You know where we are, so it's okay.

261
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,900
There are more than that.

262
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,880
Don't complain.

263
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,840
We came to find Reiko's memories.

264
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,740
I remembered one more thing.

265
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,500
The person who drew that painting,

266
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,040
Mamia Shinzou.

267
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,200
What?

268
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,940
Is he famous?

269
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,520
We know him, too.

270
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,420
He's super famous.

271
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,980
Is he expensive?

272
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,220
He's a famous painter in Europe,

273
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,500
who's the result of the Ecole de Paris movement.

274
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,140
His new works, of course, and his old ones

275
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,940
are also traded at a considerable price.

276
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,080
A considerable price?

277
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,700
About 10 times.

278
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,460
10,000,000 yen?

279
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,660
Is this a elementary school?

280
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,840
You'll feel better when you hear about money.

281
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,840
It's not like I'll be mine.

282
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,600
There are three, but which one?

283
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,960
I don't remember the name,

284
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,160
but which one is this?

285
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,860
The direction is completely different,

286
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,400
and the distance is long.

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,420
It's a 1/3 chance.

288
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,900
What?

289
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,940
At a time like this,

290
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,140
the idea of growing up in the countryside of Miss Mammush is useful.

291
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,480
Come on, Komachi,

292
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,960
Choose one.

293
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,460
Um...

294
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,440
That one!

295
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,080
I'll take the one!

296
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,380
I'll take the one!

297
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,500
I'll take the one!

298
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,380
I'll take the one!

299
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,960
I'll take the one!

300
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,440
I'll take the one!

301
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,300
I'll take the one!

302
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,180
It's a 1/3 chance.

303
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,180
No, it's not like this.

304
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:31,340
It's a 1/3 chance.

305
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,080
It's a 1/3 chance.

306
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,640
I haven't walked for three hours,

307
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,740
and it's useless.

308
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,200
There was a big clock in the middle of the school.

309
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:40,960
There was a big clock in the middle of the school.

310
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,220
There was a big clock in the middle of the school.

311
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,400
A clock?

312
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,740
I hope someone is there for summer vacation.

313
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,480
Shall I ask?

314
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,880
What is it?

315
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,300
What is it?

316
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,680
What is it?

317
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,400
What is it?

318
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,880
Ah, that's Ipponsugi Elementary School.

319
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,380
Ah, that's Ipponsugi Elementary School.

320
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,000
Really, it's the opposite direction!

321
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,100
I can't guess the feeling of Komachi.

322
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,940
What?

323
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,600
I need to go there.

324
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,160
What's the matter?

325
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,220
It's fine.

326
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,020
Huh?

327
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,740
The school will be closed this spring.

328
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,100
The demolition work should start this afternoon.

329
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,060
Hurry up!

330
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,440
I'm so excited.

331
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,040
I'm suspicious.

332
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,320
The school will be closed.

333
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,660
It's a demolition project, so we don't need any pictures.

334
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,720
Yay!

335
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,420
I got 100 million yen!

336
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,600
I got it!

337
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,140
I got it!

338
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,020
The school will be closed.

339
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,340
It's going to be destroyed soon.

340
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:40,480
Damn it.

341
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,600
We have to stop it.

342
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,220
Go, Ryo-chan!

343
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,940
I came all the way here to get 100 million yen!

344
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,100
Hey! Wait for me!

345
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:52,980
Stop!

346
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,120
Ah...

347
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,200
We've been looking for you.

348
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,400
Shoku...

349
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm fine.

350
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,540
Don't worry.

351
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,620
Yeah.

352
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
We have to give up soon.

353
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,780
Ryo-chan!

354
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,900
Don't you think you could give up?

355
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,700
What?

356
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,620
If you don't give up, your memories will disappear.

357
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,040
Not just your memories, but French people too!

358
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,380
Ryo-chan!

359
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,360
Don't get mad.

360
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,880
How do you understand what I mean?

361
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,420
The one who finds the picture and makes his own is everyone else's.

362
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,280
Let me know!

363
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,580
Eat my stone!

364
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,940
I can't find anything.

365
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,320
It's okay, Ryo-chan. I'll give up.

366
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,120
Reiko.

367
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,260
Excuse me, but are you looking for something?

368
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:17,940
What?

369
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,980
I've been working as a mercenary here until this spring.

370
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,780
Hmm...

371
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,980
Ah, you're back to normal.

372
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,520
I remember that painting very well.

373
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,300
Oh, so you were the young lady from that time.

374
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,600
Yes, but I couldn't reunite with the painting of my memories.

375
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,780
No, if you're visiting that painting, you don't have to worry.

376
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,580
Huh?

377
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,200
Is that painting somewhere?

378
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,080
Yeah.

379
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,700
Ah!

380
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,360
Where is it?

381
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:51,960
Where on earth is it?

382
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,620
It's in the museum.

383
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,000
The previous principal donated it to the museum.

384
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,520
The museum?

385
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,120
100 million yen?

386
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,720
Ah, don't worry about it.

387
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,380
So, what is the museum?

388
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,040
Ah, it's about 3 hours away from here.

389
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,900
Are you walking again?

390
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,580
If you don't mind, I'll send you by car.

391
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,020
Really?

392
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,460
Why can't I just run?

393
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,620
It can't be helped.

394
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,680
It's a four-person ride.

395
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,260
Yes, it's a full-time job.

396
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,460
Idiot!

397
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:19,780
I'm sorry.

398
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,500
I'm sorry.

399
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,660
I'm sorry.

400
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,820
15 years ago, there was a museum in the prefecture, and they collected art pieces related to Gotouchi and exhibited them.

401
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,660
I'm glad.

402
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,720
With this, Reiko's memories will come back.

403
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,880
Uh-huh.

404
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,800
I'm sorry.

405
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,880
I'm sorry.

406
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:39,940
I'm sorry.

407
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,540
Shin, be quiet in the museum.

408
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,580
Even if you say that, I can't breathe.

409
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,340
This is that painting.

410
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:48,560
I'll tell you the name.

411
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,620
PK-4

412
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:57,680
-14

413
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:57,700
-8

414
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,440
-11

415
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,580
-3

416
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:08,620
-31

417
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:08,680
-39

418
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,320
-43

419
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,420
Huh?

420
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,080
It looks exactly like the pendant Reiko-san is wearing!

421
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,480
What?

422
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,940
The colors and shapes are exactly the same!

423
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,700
This is a piece of her grandma's work.

424
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,920
She cherished it so much.

425
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,040
That means, perhaps...

426
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,400
The model of this painting is Reiko's grandma?

427
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,260
Then, the girl is...

428
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,460
Reiko-san's mother?

429
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,460
Grandma...

430
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,380
So that's how it is.

431
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,180
This is Mamiya Shinzo.

432
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,360
Mamiya Gaha-kun!

433
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,120
One hundred million yen!

434
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,660
Idiot!

435
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,300
I drew this landscape decades ago.

436
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,480
I wanted to visit it again because I saw it on a travel magazine.

437
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,300
It's strange that I can meet you there.

438
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:25,600
I thought it would be a surprise when I passed by you, but now that I see it, it looks just like Madame Arbeil at that time.

439
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,280
Soon after the war, I decided to become a painter and went to Paris.

440
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,720
I thought that if I went to Paris, all my wishes would come true.

441
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,240
But the reality was more severe than I expected.

442
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,260
Sadly, I couldn't sell a single painting and I ran out of money.

443
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,840
I was kicked out of the apartment I lived in, and despair was wrapping around my chest.

444
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,300
...

445
00:19:59,220 --> 00:19:59,860
...

446
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,160
...

447
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,580
...

448
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,480
...

449
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,480
Her name is Arbeil.

450
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,680
She was a great artist like Fujita Gohaku, who was active in the war.

451
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,220
She was a great artist like Fujita Gohaku, who was active in the war.

452
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,900
She spoke one-word Japanese.

453
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,160
Her family raised me with kindness.

454
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,620
I felt at ease and thanked everyone, not even a word.

455
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,200
I couldn't thank anyone.

456
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,840
I wrote a painting with all my feelings of gratitude.

457
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,260
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ...

458
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,260
After that, I returned to Japan and was lucky enough to be recognized by the world for my work on Japanese scenery.

459
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,700
The one on that magazine is also like that.

460
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,840
So that painting led you and Reiko to this point.

461
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:05,860
Yes. After I finally started selling the painting, I left a letter to Arvel, but I came back without a clue.

462
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,480
Since then, I have never heard of her rumors.

463
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,600
I don't know much about your grandmother either.

464
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,600
According to her, when I was in elementary school, I was told that I would donate this painting to Japan.

465
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,500
I didn't know that this painting existed in Japan.

466
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,960
Probably because I was Japanese, that's what she said.

467
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,540
Yes.

468
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,820
If Arvel hadn't saved me at that time, I wouldn't be here today.

469
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,460
Thank you.

470
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,960
Thank you.

471
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,820
Thank you.

472
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,300
If you have any troubles with money, Arvel gave it to you to sell.

473
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,640
Yes.

474
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,300
But that's what I never left behind, no matter how hard it was.

475
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,840
It is yours.

476
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,700
Yes.

477
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,180
Thank you.

478
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,200
Thank you.

479
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,980
Thank you.

480
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,560
Thank you.

481
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,460
Thank you.

482
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,380
Thank you.

483
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,200
Thank you.

484
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,560
Thank you.

485
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:34,920
Thank you.

486
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,420
Thank you.

487
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:35,580
Thank you.

488
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:36,940
Thank you.

489
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,300
Thank you very much.

490
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,320
Thank you.

491
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:38,560
Thank you.

492
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:38,920
Thank you.

493
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,380
Thanks you.

494
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,820
I'm glad we came together.

495
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah.

496
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,720
That painter was probably alone.

497
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,620
That means, maybe he's been thinking about Reiko's grandmother all along.

498
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,880
Well, it's kind of romantic, isn't it?

499
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,920
It means that everyone has a heart-pounding memory.

500
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,260
What?

501
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,920
What do you mean?

502
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,200
I didn't get any money, but this trip was worth it.

503
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,660
He's smiling.

504
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,520
How creepy.

505
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh, the bus is here.

506
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,140
Everyone, get on.

507
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,920
Yeah.

508
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,500
This guy is so painful.

509
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,380
The bus is here!

510
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,160
Wait!

511
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,900
Ryo, the bus is here!

512
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,280
The bus is here!

513
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,640
The bus is here!

514
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,920
Ryo, the bus is here!

515
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,780
I'm relieved.

516
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:38,960
Wait!

517
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,440
The bus is here!

518
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,680
Where did he go?

519
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,720
Where am I?

520
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,200
Hey!

521
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,620
How am I supposed to get home?

522
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,940
I don't want to go to the subway anymore!

523
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,360
Let's drive!

524
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:06,400
"A"

525
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:06,460
"H"

526
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:06,620
"I

527
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:19,720
"W"

528
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,200
"U " "R"

529
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,840
I walked with a look back

530
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,660
I asked my mom

531
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,160
I felt it at that time

532
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,340
A strange feeling

533
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,440
So

534
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,360
I walked on the outside of the arcade

535
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,340
Only the black part

536
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,120
Everyone was a child once

537
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,680
But everyone forgets

538
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,080
A politician with a great face

539
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,560
A blue aunt above my eyes

540
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,980
Look up

541
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,940
That corner

542
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,660
Everyone, everyone can see

543
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,920
There is a wall

544
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,160
Ah, there must be a wall

545
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,300
Everyone, come to our town

546
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,420
Thank you!

547
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,020
Ghost?

548
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,700
Why are you attacking me?

549
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,380
Did you defeat the temple priest?

550
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,760
What? Find a lover?

551
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,960
What is the 12th floor?

552
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,880
Where is the 12th floor?
