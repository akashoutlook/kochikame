1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,380
Appearance of Kylo Ren

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,920
Hey, hey, when you watch TV

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:12,360
try to make your room bright and keep away from it

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,620
ONE HOUR LATER

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,220
When it rains, as if someone is calling

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,860
♪ After the rain, the place where it started to rain ♪

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,300

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,580
Thank you!

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,080
Hypercop!

24
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:44,040
Kanden Police Hypercop!

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,320
A criminal organization of evil

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,860
Hitakura!

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,560
A special police force created to fight against evil!

28
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,040
That's Hypercop!

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,560
To protect the peace of the earth,

30
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,720
the five members of the Hypercop continue to fight today!

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm going to release the toys of this program at my company!

32
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,100
Look at the poster!

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,220
The company's name is in it!

34
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,020
It's true!

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,180
That's good!

36
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,340
With this, your company will become a major!

37
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,220
When is the ceremony?

38
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,360
From next month!

39
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,460
Every Monday from 4 a.m. to 4:05 a.m.

40
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,920
Every day, from 4 a.m. to 5 a.m?

41
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,000
It's time for everyone to sleep!

42
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,300
Even so, my grandpa is still awake.

43
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,620
It's a child's play, rougan!

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,120
This is the toy기로 for the play.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,460
The Sports曲 "HyperArm"!

46
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:28,960
That is the masterpiece!

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,220
"Hurricane Punch"

48
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,460
What is a serious 8-year-old doing here?

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,320
With the computer,

50
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,880
it responds to the motion of the sound.

51
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,820
It can sound like a lot of things.

52
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,620
There are toys that look like before!

53
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,900
When you use the special move, you have to turn your arm like this.

54
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,120
Isn't that a trick?

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,400
What? Don't do that with me.

56
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,580
My special move is even more amazing.

57
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,160
First, turn around 35 times.

58
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,100
And then turn around 20 times.

59
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,820
Again, turn around 15 times.

60
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,340
And then turn around 7 and a half times.

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
Again, turn around 5 times.

62
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,520
It's like a safe.

63
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,060
It looks like it's going to be pretty tough.

64
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,580
Special Hurricane Punch!

65
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,860
What do you think? Isn't it a powerful sound?

66
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,220
Well...

67
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,820
You can use not only your arm but also your legs and your belt.

68
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,000
When you combine them all, you get a hypersuit.

69
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,860
And you can play a lot more.

70
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,880
Okay, I'll try it.

71
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,800
Automatic lock is on.

72
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,680
What is it?

73
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,800
When you wear a hypersuit, it locks automatically.

74
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,300
So that it doesn't come off easily.

75
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,720
I see. It's well made.

76
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,520
It's pretty cool.

77
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,160
The only problem is that it's a little heavy.

78
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,860
Because it has a powerful motor.

79
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,860
This is the instruction manual.

80
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,820
It's as thick as a phone book.

81
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,980
Okay, let's try this Hyper Claw first.

82
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,900
Hold your right hand at 75 degrees.

83
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,280
Turn around 365 times in front of you in 1.0.5 seconds.

84
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,000
You're going to do 365 times?

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,340
250th try, and now you're going to do 10 times with your right leg.

86
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,220
Yeah.

87
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,020
In addition, put your bar out on top of your head.

88
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,080
Stand on your toes and rotate your entire body 10 times.

89
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,020
Put two pencils on your nose.

90
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,240
Move forward with a gyaru.

91
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,500
Pull, pull, pull, pull.

92
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,840
Pull, pull, pull, pull.

93
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,660
I don't think it's a very heroic move.

94
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,140
Finally, push from the inside.

95
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,700
And hit.

96
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,080
Hit.

97
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,320
Hit.

98
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,360
See, it worked.

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,460
What's this?

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,760
That's why you're too poor.

101
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,640
You don't have any sound effects.

102
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,260
I think so.

103
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,120
I thought it was interesting.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,320
In the first place, there are too many times to say 365 times.

105
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,460
Children will get tired.

106
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,000
No, no, no, no, no.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,120
This product will never sell.

108
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,260
In fact, there is another function in Hyper Suice.

109
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Voice sensor function on the back.

110
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,000
What?

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,700
Voice sensor?

112
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,320
See, heroes have various決めポーズ.

113
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,720
Hyper Attack.

114
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,340
Hyper Fighting.

115
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,180
Hyper Carnival.

116
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,880
That makes it easy.

117
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,040
How?

118
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,540
When you shout out loud, this voice sensor catches that voice.

119
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,340
Hyper Fighting Pose.

120
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,180
I see.

121
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,000
You move with the spring of the whole body.

122
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,060
When you stand for 10 seconds, the pose will be automatically released.

123
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,620
Use this from the beginning.

124
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,840
Oh, that's right.

125
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,200
All right, let's try it.

126
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,600
Oh, are there five people doing it?

127
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,780
There are five Hyper Cop.

128
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,820
In fact, we have a test product for all.

129
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,740
All right, you guys can wear it.

130
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,620
Let's do this pose.

131
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,180
What?

132
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,620
Why are we?

133
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,400
We have to wear it.

134
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,940
That's right.

135
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,340
We are working, senior.

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,560
That's what you mean.

137
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,880
Listen, from now on, this company will be tied up with the TV station without knowing it.

138
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,600
When you try to go out of your way to sell toys.

139
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,440
I don't think you'll get a punishment if you monitor that product.

140
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,600
Isn't that a police officer loved by the citizens?

141
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,020
Hey, you can say something to him.

142
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,360
Can't you cooperate with us?

143
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,000
This product is a matter of our company's good fortune.

144
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,760
Please.

145
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,300
All right.

146
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,700
If that's the case.

147
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,700
I will cooperate.

148
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,980
What?

149
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,460
I'm fine.

150
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,740
It's a good feeling.

151
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,340
Ryo.

152
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,960
Ryo, there's one more left.

153
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,340
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

154
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,840
Hey, Ryo!

155
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,700
What do you want?

156
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,860
I've been waiting for you, Honda!

157
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,360
Wow!

158
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,540
Tokusatsu heroes usually ride bikes, right?

159
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,340
I've been longing for it since I was a kid.

160
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,420
Okay! Let's start with the basic pose!

161
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,740
Hyper Red!

162
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,240
Hyper Blue!

163
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,760
Hyper Pink!

164
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,580
Hyper Yellow!

165
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,760
Hyper Blue!

166
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,140
All five of us, the Hyperpops, are here!

167
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,660
It's all set, everyone!

168
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,640
It's like a TV show!

169
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,180
Okay! Next is the gathering pose!

170
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,300
Let's go!

171
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,200
Are we doing it here?

172
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,900
We should stop it for a bit.

173
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,720
I don't want to do it!

174
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:25,820
You're annoying!

175
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,020
You can't escape from the sensor function!

176
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,880
Hyper Pyramid!

177
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:30,900
No!

178
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,680
You're annoying!

179
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,580
Are you okay, Ryo?

180
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,340
I told you to stop it!

181
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,620
Hyper Pyramid is impossible in such a small place.

182
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,920
I hope it's here.

183
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,760
Here we go! Hyper Pyramid!

184
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,760
Ah, no!

185
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,560
This is my cup of tea.

186
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,040
Hyper confetti!

187
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,060
Oh, no!

188
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,580
You're not giving me a drinks!

189
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,080
You want to play a game or something?

190
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,860
Come on!

191
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,160
Hyperly!

192
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,980
How do I do?

193
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,660
Do it!

194
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,720
Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it!

195
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,080
This is not funny. I'll monitor it for a while, so you can leave it alone.

196
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,640
Really? That will help.

197
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,960
Then, please take care of it.

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,440
Leave it to me.

199
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,580
Well, what kind of pose should I take next?

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,700
Are you still going to do it, senior?

201
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,060
You've already done enough, haven't you?

202
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,980
I have to go back to work soon.

203
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,920
I'm going back to the exhaust pipe.

204
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,940
Hyper through!

205
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,860
Hey, Ryo, what are you going to do?

206
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,460
It's not like that. Hyper through is a pose of hyper pink, so I made it a little.

207
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,980
Oh, my God.

208
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,380
Hyper shift!

209
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,960
Ryo!

210
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,660
This is also a pose of pink, so I made it a little.

211
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,660
Give me that explanation.

212
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,660
Hyper bandai!

213
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,500
Hey, Ryo Tsukakichi!

214
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,000
Hey, hehehe!

215
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,080
Uo!

216
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,260
Kutukutuku!

217
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,640
Oh, no!

218
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,980
Ryo, stop it!

219
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:28,740
Hahaha!

220
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,420
Hey!

221
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,220
Hyper Komane!

222
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:34,820
Oh, no!

223
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,540
Hyper In!

224
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,980
Oh, it's embarrassing.

225
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,300
Hyper Chonwa! Chonwa!

226
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,900
Quick! Quick!

227
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,740
What?

228
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,360
Hyper Chikuribambo!

229
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:42,920
Eww!

230
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,100
No!

231
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,320
Oh, my God!

232
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
Hyper Emi!

233
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,480
Eww!

234
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,380
Hyper Sama!

235
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,840
Sama!

236
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,140
Hyper Sama!

237
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,700
Eww!

238
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,180
No!

239
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,160
No!

240
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:53,500
This is so much!

241
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,320
Hyper Gentai!

242
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:54,760
Stop it!

243
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,220
No!

244
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,860
Hyper Doona!

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,200
Hyper Chichiguribambo!

246
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,960
Chichiguribambo!

247
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,440
Gyu!

248
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,960
Hyper Komanechi!

249
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,540
Komanechi!

250
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:04,940
Ehi!

251
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,340
Hyper Chonwa!

252
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:06,760
Chonwa!

253
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,820
Oh, Bambi!

254
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,180
Enough!

255
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,760
Not funny!

256
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

257
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,140
Hahahaha!

258
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:19,960
Hahahaha!

259
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,260
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

260
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,500
Hahahaha!

261
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,620
Um...

262
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,840
But I really have to go back to work.

263
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,540
We can't just leave the station open forever.

264
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,140
This is automatic lock, right?

265
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,760
What should we do to get it off?

266
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,680
What's that?

267
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,400
You're a bad person to be with.

268
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,420
Huh?

269
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,620
What's that?

270
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,360
The automatic lock release method.

271
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,980
Release, release, release.

272
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,600
Found it!

273
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,540
Turn your right hand 300 times and do the moon 100 times with your left hand.

274
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:45,940
Huh?

275
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,640
And do the rabbit jump 150 times.

276
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,260
Next, do the vertical push-up 80 times.

277
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,160
And finally, do the Hindu squat 200 times.

278
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:54,780
Huh?

279
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,560
No way!

280
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,720
Is that the only way?

281
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,580
I think so.

282
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,020
This seems to be the only way.

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,960
No way!

284
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,620
This is fun.

285
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,840
Anyway, we have no choice but to do it.

286
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,520
I'm so tired.

287
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,100
My arms are sore.

288
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,040
You can do it, Honma!

289
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,660
No!

290
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:20,820
You can't.

291
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,400
That's too sudden.

292
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,740
You may have to start over.

293
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,300
Almost there.

294
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,100
Hang in there!

295
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,660
Hyper Fighting Pop!

296
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,160
Ups!

297
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,720
What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

298
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,660
Did I do something?

299
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,560
DON'T DO IT!

300
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,460
Almost there.

301
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,020
Hang in there, guys!

302
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,820
RYO-CHAN!

303
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:50,960
Ah, ah.

304
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,920
Hyper Fighting Punch!

305
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,620
Ryo!

306
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
Why did you get in my way?

307
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,560
Nothing.

308
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,820
This is a big deal, so stop being mean!

309
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,880
Hmph.

310
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,080
That's because you're weak.

311
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,360
I'd be easier.

312
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,740
Hmph.

313
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,240
Then show me the proof.

314
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,200
Alright. Watch me.

315
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,500
Hey, watch me. Watch me.

316
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,360
It's almost over.

317
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,260
Hmph.

318
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,100
Hyper Fighting Punch!

319
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,880
Hmph.

320
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,800
Hey, Reiko!

321
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,420
It's the money you gave me.

322
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,160
Damn it!

323
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,000
But it's not even that bad!

324
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,480
125, 126, 121, 128, 129,

325
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,280
75, 76, 77, 78,

326
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,360
197, 198, 199, 200!

327
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,360
How's that?

328
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,200
Oh!

329
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,260
You're the best, Senpai!

330
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,840
You're so strong you'll go crazy!

331
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,560
I guess I'll just have to break it and take it off.

332
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,100
You're the only one who can do that.

333
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,720
You're the only one who can do that.

334
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,720
By the way, where's Ryo-chan?

335
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,560
What are you doing, Senpai?

336
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,640
Powering up the Hyper Suit!

337
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,100
Strengthening the motors and springs in each part,

338
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,880
the battery uses five powerful lithium batteries.

339
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,680
It also increases the voice-reaction pose.

340
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,360
Is that okay?

341
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,000
You're modifying the product on your own?

342
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,740
It's an improvement.

343
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,380
It's better than before.

344
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,400
The auto-lock is on.

345
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,640
So that's how you get a golf club.

346
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,280
Hyper T-shirt!

347
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,740
You can swing in an ideal form.

348
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,240
I see.

349
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,760
And even in tennis,

350
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,680
Hyper Smash!

351
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,180
Hyper Homelike!

352
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,440
Hyper Ping-pong!

353
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,120
For pro-wrestling fans,

354
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,660
we've included the Mexican pro-wrestling Lucha.

355
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,540
Hyper Lucha!

356
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,100
Hyper Paw!

357
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,040
Hyper Kawaii!

358
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,580
Senpai, it hurts...

359
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,560
Let me go!

360
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,120
This will change every single person

361
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,760
to become a pro-wrestling athlete.

362
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
It will also sell to adults with lack of exercise.

363
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,280
As expected of you, Senpai.

364
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,240
What about some herb tea?

365
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,980
Great idea!

366
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,400
Herb tea?

367
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,000
It's about herb tea.

368
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,380
Consider it tea then.

369
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,800
You guys use side characters too much.

370
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,260
Hm?

371
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,840
Here! The herb tea!

372
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,040
Uwaaaah!

373
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,580
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

374
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,140
What's wrong, senpai?

375
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,100
Suits is doing the Hyper Lucha pose without permission!

376
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,700
Uwaaah!

377
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

378
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,940
Why is he suddenly doing that pose?

379
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,560
Reiko-san, what did you say when you were making the tea?

380
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,900
I think it was "Here! The herb tea."

381
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,780
Uwaaaah!

382
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,360
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

383
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:14,880
That's right!

384
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,120
Senpai's suit mistakenly recognized Reiko-san's "Here! The herb tea" as "Hyper Lucha!"

385
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,120
Uwaaah!

386
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,740
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

387
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,500
What the hell!

388
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,560
I'm sorry.

389
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,540
Oh, my voice sensor is too loud!

390
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,120
I'm Tsurukame Ken.

391
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,440
Oh, right, I was asking for a date.

392
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,120
Here, parkour mask.

393
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,340
Uwaaah!

394
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,280
What are you doing, senpai?

395
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:43,700
Uwaaah!

396
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,480
This is Hyper Gomen!

397
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:46,980
Let me explain.

398
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,340
Hyper Gomen is a terrible technique that makes you hit yourself until you feel like it when you make a mistake or make a mistake.

399
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,300
I see. So this time, you misheard Hyper Gomen as Hyper Gomen.

400
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,540
It's certainly similar.

401
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,080
Hyper Gomen and Hyper Gomen.

402
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,180
Hyper Gomen.

403
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,580
What a terrible technique!

404
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,560
Hey! Don't say Hyper Gomen again and again!

405
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,040
Uwaaah!

406
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,680
Uwaaah!

407
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,480
Senpai, you'd better take it off. It's dangerous!

408
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,100
Come to that!

409
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:33,600
Why is it not working?

410
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,460
The reaction has become dull.

411
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,040
I'll fix it.

412
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,960
Come on, do it again!

413
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,160
One more time!

414
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,800
200!

415
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,900
It won't come off.

416
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,020
It's not broken, is it?

417
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,720
200!

418
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,500
200!

419
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,460
What the hell?

420
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,460
It can't be helped. Let's disassemble it.

421
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,560
You should say that now!

422
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,720
I'll do it.

423
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,680
Hurry up.

424
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,800
What's going on?

425
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,720
It's broken because I modified it.

426
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,460
I don't have the strength.

427
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,680
I'll take it off.

428
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,000
What's going on?

429
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,220
It's broken.

430
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,140
This time, it's Double Hyper God Hand.

431
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,360
It's too narrow.

432
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,140
My head is crushed.

433
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,480
I can't do it.

434
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,740
Hyper Fighting Pose!

435
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,040
I was saved.

436
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,080
I see.

437
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,020
That's how it works.

438
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,800
As expected of Reiko.

439
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,220
This time, the Hyper God Hand Switch...

440
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
Hyper Fighting Pose!

441
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,660
I was saved.

442
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,480
If it gets dangerous, I have to take this pose.

443
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,680
Don't you want to fight?

444
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,320
No.

445
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,000
Captain!

446
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,060
Ryotsu.

447
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,200
What are you doing?

448
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,220
I don't want to fight, so I'm not posing like this.

449
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,580
What happened?

450
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,420
Captain.

451
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,960
The bank robber is running away with the cash.

452
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,140
Go after him immediately!

453
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,420
Roger that!

454
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,260
Ryotsu, you too.

455
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,080
Take off the toy quickly.

456
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,720
If it's easy, I won't have to work hard.

457
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,540
I'll take it off.

458
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,080
I'll take it off.

459
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,660
He's coming here.

460
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,460
Don't block the road.

461
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,380
Yes, sir.

462
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,160
What's going on?

463
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,280
Captain, I'm going to show you the power of this toy you made fun of!

464
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,860
Hyper Sprint!

465
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,300
I see!

466
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,320
Is this how you use it?

467
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,720
It's a real Hyper Cop!

468
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,100
He's run away!

469
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,360
What?

470
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,500
You can't run away!

471
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,740
Hyper Choke!

472
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,540
You too!

473
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,060
Hyper Kick!

474
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:53,000
You won't get away!

475
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,500
Hyper Sprint!

476
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,580
It's a big horror!

477
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,680
Oh no!

478
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,820
The Hyper T-Shot switch is working!

479
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,480
Hyper Fighting Force!

480
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,300
Hyper Sprint!

481
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,700
This is bad!

482
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Oh no!

483
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,400
The Hyper Home Run switch is working!

484
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,960
Hyper Fighting Force!

485
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,860
Hyper Sprint!

486
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,200
The Home Run Show!

487
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,960
That officer is shouting something.

488
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,340
Hyper Tackle Kick!

489
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,380
You're taking your time.

490
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm going to shoot you!

491
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,700
Hyper Fighting Force!

492
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,560
What?

493
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,920
I knew it!

494
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,940
You're starting to take that pose when you scream.

495
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,680
You!

496
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,880
Hyper Fighting Force!

497
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,140
Hyper Fighting Force!

498
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,520
Hyper Fighting Force!

499
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,140
You always do that!

500
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,460
Bello! Bello!

501
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,060
Oh no!

502
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,800
Hyper Sprint!

503
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,380
Oh no!

504
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,200
The pose is fixed!

505
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,700
What?

506
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,120
What?

507
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,760
What?

508
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,840
Mr. Nick, wait!

509
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,120
Hyper Sprint!

510
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,300
No!

511
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,880
This is Hyper Sprint!

512
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,040
The most important specification.

513
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,140
Hyper Sprint is the most powerful enemy,

514
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,860
hit by jet radiation,

515
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,260
and self-destruct,

516
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,820
a super-imoto move.

517
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,340
I can't believe this really can self-destruct!

518
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,260
.

519
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,700
.

520
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,160
.

521
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,800
.

522
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,760
.

523
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:03,900
.

524
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,060
.

525
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,120
.

526
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,260
.

527
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,600
.

528
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,120
.

529
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,140
.

530
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,160
.

531
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,180
.

532
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,320
.

533
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,460
It seems like it's a big hit.

534
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,360
What do you mean a big hit?

535
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,940
They even put a self-destruct device on the toy, geez.

536
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,920
Anyway, it's good that the president of the toy company became a major.

537
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,020
There's too much trouble with safety.

538
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,900
Hey, Ryo-san, are you okay?

539
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,300
Hey! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

540
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,720
Thanks to you, I got hurt.

541
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,800
No, it's bad, it's bad.

542
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,920
But thanks to you, Hypercop has a high ratings.

543
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,640
And I even decided on a part two.

544
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,460
So, as the second episode of the Hyper Suit series,

545
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,120
I made a thing called Hyper Suit DX.

546
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,380
Hyper Suit DX?

547
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,080
Try it again, Ryo-san.

548
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,620
Don't be silly. I'm definitely not going to do it.

549
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,340
Ryo-san!

550
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,660
Hyper Suit is no longer a toy.

551
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,420
It's a Gori Gori!

552
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,560
It's a Gori Gori!

553
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,320
It's a Gori Gori!

554
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,540
It's a Gori Gori!

555
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,480
It's a Gori Gori!

556
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:36,880
It's a Gori Gori!

557
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,640
It's a Gori Gori!

558
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,320
It's a Gori Gori!

559
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,480
It's a Gori Gori!

560
