1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,080
The

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,460
Man

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:06,520
who

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:06,580
burns

5
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,880
fire

6
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,220
men

7
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,500
who

8
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:08,940
lit

9
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,900
The

10
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,040
chance

11
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,420
is

12
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:10,600
a

13
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:10,820
bonus

14
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,160
a

15
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,880
.

16
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,160
However

17
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,340
,

18
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,660
it is said that it is impossible to get it from that man.

19
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,260
This is

20
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,060
the story of men who risked their lives in the bonus battle.

21
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,280
When you watch TV,

22
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,800
make your room bright and

23
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,460
look away.

24
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,280
I

25
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,920
don't

26
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
have money

27
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:43,700
.

28
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,100
Come

29
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,360
to

30
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,520
I

31
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,040
don't

32
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,080
have

33
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,880
.

34
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,240
But

35
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,300
I

36
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:47,460
worry

37
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,600
.

38
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,020
Look

39
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,680
at

40
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:50,860
the

41
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,580
blue

42
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,760
sky

43
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,240
, the

44
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,000
white

45
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,080
clouds

46
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,520
, they

47
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,060
will

48
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll manage somehow

49
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:19,380
If you have no job, come to my place

50
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,560
I don't have one, but don't worry

51
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:32,000
Look, the red cloud is burning

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,720
I'll manage somehow

53
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:43,500
I know, I know, I know

54
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,740
If you know, shut up and follow me

55
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,340
I know, I know, I know

56
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,980
Let go!

57
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,980
Who are you?

58
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,860
I'm from the University Wrestling Club

59
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,260
You can't escape so easily

60
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,520
You're disgusting, you bastard

61
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,600
Say whatever you want

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,780
My salary!

63
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,520
Give it back! Give it back!

64
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,360
Please give it back!

65
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,460
I said give it back!

66
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,240
Ouch!

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,820
It's okay, it's okay

68
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,540
Turn on the light and hurry up

69
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,940
Okay, okay, okay

70
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,440
Okay, okay, okay

71
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,060
You're running away from your wife again?

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,660
I told you I wouldn't go back until I get my money back

73
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,760
You're always like that

74
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,740
It's like a winter windfall

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,860
Now, let's start the 31st Ryo-tsu Kankichi Bonus Battle

76
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,560
This is the video I showed seven years ago

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,340
when I miraculously managed to get Ryo-san's salary

78
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,720
I was able to get his salary back

79
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,280
Back then, you had plenty of time to hire a student for part-time jobs

80
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,900
Ryo-san was being careless

81
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,460
It was a normal payday

82
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,120
That day, I gave my wife and my wife a blessing

83
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,980
But Ryo-san was wary of this

84
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,920
and he couldn't take the bonus

85
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,860
For the past few years, we have been working hard to plan various strategies

86
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,580
We made new weapons with a small budget

87
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,200
and we tried to get Ryo-san's bonus with all our might

88
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,700
But we failed at all of them

89
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,220
That's why I came up with this idea after looking at the previous video many times

90
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,640
I thought that a simple strategy would be more effective for Ryo-san

91
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,280
Oh!

92
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:13,920
Oh!

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,520
You're right

94
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,360
You were overthinking it

95
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,980
I see

96
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,460
I always say that

97
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,660
Now, I'll announce the strategy of this year

98
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,540
The winning strategy is "Gatchari"

99
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,180
Gatchari?

100
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,600
The winning strategy is "Gatchari"

101
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,920
No! No! No! No!

102
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,180
I will never accept it!

103
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,640
A day is just enough

104
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,020
No!

105
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,000
Damn...

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,420
Mr. Chairman's stone head

107
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,640
I knew it. It was you, Ryo-san

108
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,400
I couldn't help but jump out because I heard your voice

109
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,640
Maria, was it?

110
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,820
What did the president want?

111
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,240
I thought I'd get a bonus as soon as possible, but he refused.

112
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,640
Why?

113
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,280
When it's time for a bonus, the debt collectors will push me.

114
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,360
I thought I'd write the back of it.

115
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,420
You should get your debt back as soon as possible.

116
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,520
What is this computer?

117
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,720
They say they bought a new computer, so they throw away the old ones.

118
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,420
It's a waste.

119
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,180
Is there anyone who can use it?

120
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,740
No, there's no one who can sell it.

121
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,460
No, they're all too old.

122
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,480
They're all the same, but they don't sell.

123
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,340
Huh?

124
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,040
This is the first time I've seen a computer like this.

125
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,060
This is a computer for salary management.

126
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,820
What?

127
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,700
Oh, the data is in there.

128
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,980
It's useless.

129
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,160
It's useless.

130
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,160
How much money does a computer get?

131
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,980
I'll check it out for you.

132
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,920
Here it is, on the right.

133
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,760
That's the bonus.

134
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,680
It's quite low compared to the same machine.

135
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,760
It's not funny.

136
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,280
1, 10, 100, 11, 10 million!

137
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,160
Ryo!

138
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,540
It's just a computer, and you don't have to buy it.

139
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,580
That's true.

140
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,240
I'd take $ 2 million if you want.

141
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,300
You're so reluctant.

142
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:37,980
Hehe...

143
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,300
How about this?

144
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,540
Thank you very much!

145
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,660
Oh, right. Let's change the bonus for the other one too.

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Ah, a monk.

147
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,840
Ryo!

148
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,620
He has a loan at home, and he goes to work every day.

149
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,620
Poor thing, so let's do about 10 million.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,460
As expected of you, Ryo-sama. You're so kind.

151
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,780
Next up is...

152
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,920
Oh, the director.

153
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,400
The director refused my request earlier, so I'll lower it by 2 digits.

154
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,360
Hehe...

155
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,300
30,025 yen. That should be enough.

156
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,200
Next is Reiko.

157
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,060
Reiko, 5 yen, so that you can have a good 5 yen.

158
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,300
5 yen.

159
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,100
Nice!

160
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,520
Next is Keiichi Nakagawa.

161
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,640
Nakagawa likes number 1 in everything.

162
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,220
Hehe...

163
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,340
1 yen.

164
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,120
Hehe...

165
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,000
Hehe...

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,060
I'll lower the rest of the bonus.

167
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,360
Hehe...

168
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,000
Sugimura, 30 yen.

169
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,600
Peppo, 100 yen.

170
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,880
Ah, 10 yen is enough.

171
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,520
Wakana, 15 yen.

172
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,200
Oh?

173
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,620
The director.

174
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,660
That's right.

175
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,780
Everyone says the director is a police officer's mirror.

176
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,780
110 yen.

177
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,700
As expected of you, Ohara-buchou.

178
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,980
The bonus is also a good number for a police officer.

179
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,720
What's wrong with my bonus?

180
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:00,840
What's wrong with the bonus?

181
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,220
Fugitive...

182
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,360
B...Buchou!

183
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,300
Ah, Buchou! It's such a coincidence to meet you here!

184
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,100
What is a coincidence? You're still on duty!

185
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,340
What are you doing here, trying to get the oil?

186
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,460
I was just about to go back.

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,500
Then, Ryosama, see you later.

188
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,980
Then, I'll use this, too. Buchou!

189
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,700
You're an escape room, aren't you?

190
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,480
Ouch! I got it, so let me go!

191
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,200
Then, I'll take it.

192
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,260
Thank you!

193
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,120
Ah! Wait a minute!

194
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,760
I still need to use this!

195
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,960
Who left it here?

196
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,340
Hey! Put this in here!

197
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,900
Yes!

198
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,000
Send the bonus data to the bank.

199
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,240
Yes.

200
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,000
The delivery is complete.

201
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Thank you for your hard work.

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,440
What? If it's a bonus, it's not over yet!

203
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:11,900
I know that.

204
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,420
Then why?

205
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,940
What are you doing, Pramo?

206
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,180
I'm taking out the debt from you.

207
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm going to pay you back.

208
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,660
I told you that the bonus didn't come out!

209
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,440
So, I'm going to act with you like this until the bonus comes out.

210
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,720
What?

211
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,080
It was easy when I thought about it.

212
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,340
I can escape because I'm going to catch the bonus on the day of the delivery.

213
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,900
Then you should catch it before that!

214
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,820
This is the "Self-Defense" strategy!

215
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,480
What? I don't think this is allowed!

216
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,980
I have the permission of Chief Ohara.

217
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,660
I'll get it.

218
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,780
Until the bonus comes out, you and I will be on the same side.

219
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,540
What?

220
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,140
What?

221
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,320
I'll get it.

222
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,420
I'll get it.

223
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,960
I'll get it.

224
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,220
I can't escape!

225
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,760
Thank you for your hard work.

226
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,940
You did a great job.

227
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,520
Mr. Pramo.

228
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,240
You really did a great job.

229
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,340
You really are a man!

230
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,300
You cry when you get the bonus.

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,140
Okay, let's go to the bank.

232
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,340
Okay, let's go to the bank.

233
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,100
Let's go to the bank.

234
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,180
Let's go to the bank.

235
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,480
Make sure the bonus is properly invested.

236
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,380
Okay.

237
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,840
Don't worry about the bonus.

238
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,880
It's the same as every year.

239
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,180
What?

240
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:48,980
What?

241
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,160
10 million.

242
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,120
What?

243
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,300
It's the same as every year.

244
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,640
What?

245
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,160
100 million.

246
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,640
What?

247
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,040
What?

248
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,240
10 million.

249
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,660
1 million.

250
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,380
Gyo-san! What did you do?

251
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,080
What is this money?

252
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,300
I don't know!

253
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,180
I don't even know!

254
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,060
By the way, I read it in a newspaper.

255
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,700
It was the story about a man who became the world's largest dollar maker just as soon as the bank made a mistake.

256
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,980
Then, it's the bank's mistake, as well.

257
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,720
Or…

258
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,700
I'll pay you all the money before the bank notices.

259
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,140
What?

260
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,220
This machine can only pay you 1 million yen.

261
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,840
But what if it's a bank mistake?

262
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,560
It's better to make a mistake.

263
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,120
The money that goes into my account is mine.

264
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,820
Ryotsu-sama.

265
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,940
Yes.

266
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,680
Sorry to keep you waiting.

267
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,720
Is this 1 million yen?

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,380
It's not as big as I thought it would be.

269
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,260
What?

270
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,920
Change it all to 2,000 yen bills.

271
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:46,940
Yes.

272
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,980
Here you go.

273
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,600
I finally feel like I have the money.

274
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,720
Is this 1 million yen?

275
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,260
I've never seen this kind of money before.

276
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,540
That's why you shouldn't trust machines.

277
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,820
I agree.

278
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,460
I think so.

279
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,940
But is it really okay to change it into your own?

280
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,080
I don't mind at all.

281
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,080
It's the money that was in my account.

282
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,520
That's why I'm using it.

283
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,240
That's all.

284
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,460
Now, let's see what you have.

285
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,240
I'll pay you back with a lot of interest.

286
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,560
That's it?

287
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,960
It's a lot of money in front of 100 million yen.

288
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,640
By the way, this is 200,000 yen.

289
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,160
100 bills for 2,000 yen.

290
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,840
You don't have to keep wearing this, do you?

291
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,560
I told you I'll pay for this.

292
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,920
But...

293
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,320
Now, do you think I can settle for this with this cash?

294
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,980
I don't think so.

295
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,320
Hey, aunt.

296
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:57,720
The key.

297
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,520
Here you go.

298
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,700
You were so quiet.

299
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,360
It must have been hard to stay in touch with tram homes.

300
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,880
I feel the same, though.

301
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,880
Well, you need to come first.

302
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,040
Yes.

303
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,060
Uh...

304
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,140
What are you doing?

305
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,500
I don't need the fishing rod. Take it!

306
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:13,740
Take it!

307
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:41,020
Ryo-san.

308
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,440
What's wrong?

309
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,260
No, I can't let go of the fishing rod.

310
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,100
Maybe...

311
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,780
Every year at this time, Ryo-san has been living a life of running away from the debt.

312
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,240
This battle that is beyond imagination,

313
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,180
without knowing it,

314
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,340
has planted a self-defense instinct that tries to protect Ryo-san's body from the bonus.

315
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,120
For that reason, the body has refused to pay us.

316
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,340
Ryo-san is now in a body that can't pay the debt.

317
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,700
Everyone!

318
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,260
Take back your own debt!

319
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,700
Hurry!

320
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,380
Huh?

321
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,360
The body is doing it on its own!

322
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,900
Don't give up!

323
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,620
Let's do it together!

324
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,980
Then, I'll pay the debt with the next bonus!

325
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,760
Wait!

326
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,840
What is this?

327
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,800
Why is the bonus only 5 yen?

328
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,840
I have 1 yen!

329
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,700
110 yen?

330
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,240
What kind of joke is this?

331
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,120
How much did you pay?

332
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,020
Is it a joke?

333
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,440
That's...

334
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,000
I paid 10 million yen...

335
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,940
Ryo-sama!

336
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:03,880
Maria-chan.

337
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,040
I think Ryo-san went to the bank with the people at the store.

338
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,880
Then, it's too late.

339
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,200
What's wrong?

340
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,260
Mr. Nakagawa.

341
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,940
Mr. Nakagawa's bonus is not 1 yen.

342
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,560
Yes.

343
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
Reiko-san's bonus is 5 yen.

344
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
How do you know that?

345
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,800
And the manager of Ohara is 110 yen.

346
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,260
That's right.

347
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,900
But why is that?

348
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,420
The computer that Ryo-sama left in the hallway,

349
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,520
I entered it as a joke.

350
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,460
110 yen!

351
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,800
Oh, at that time.

352
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,440
It seems that data was sent to the bank by mistake.

353
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,940
What?

354
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,980
I contacted the bank as soon as I noticed it.

355
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,260
No, I will come out.

356
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,060
Yes, Koenmaiha's exit.

357
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:04,840
It's me.

358
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,040
How was it?

359
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,720
General!

360
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,600
It was late.

361
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,100
Ryo-san had already withdrawn the whole bonus.

362
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,300
How much did you get?

363
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,960
100 million.

364
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,480
100 million?

365
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,420
That idiot.

366
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,120
He lowered that amount at once.

367
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,840
The bonus amount is decided by the entire Kazushika book.

368
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,120
Therefore, unless we get the bonus from Ryo-san,

369
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,940
We will not be able to get the bonus of the century.

370
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,800
Oh, I see.

371
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,860
No matter what happens, we must get Ryo-san.

372
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,540
I'm sorry.

373
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,740
Okay, Don't worry about it.

374
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,620
Good

375
00:16:49,620 --> 00:17:05,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

376
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640
Junta-City police is weaning over there!

377
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,180
Repeat.

378
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,480
Yosu-Junta-City police are marching through with a bonus.

379
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,680
If you find them, look for them!

380
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,340
Wait!

381
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,820
Darn!

382
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,200
Damn! The bill is too heavy!

383
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,420
I shouldn't have taken the 2,000 yen bill!

384
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,460
I'm saved!

385
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,560
Hey, Balbo! Sagonji!

386
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,840
Give me back my money!

387
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,420
You don't have any debt, do you?

388
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,460
Sagonji!

389
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,120
Why are you chasing them?

390
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,320
It's dangerous, sir!

391
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,920
Give me back my money!

392
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,640
I don't care where you are!

393
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,020
Give me back my money!

394
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,060
Yes, sir!

395
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,460
This is Balbo. I've found Ryotsu.

396
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,260
He's running away using a taxi to Ueno.

397
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,620
I'm calling all officers.

398
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,020
Captain Ryotsu Kankichi is heading for Ueno.

399
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,880
All officers, hurry up to Ueno!

400
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,540
Bramoya!

401
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,600
Where are you going?

402
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,120
If it's your way of doing things, leave it to me!

403
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm going to make a detour!

404
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,580
Thank you!

405
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,320
All right! I'm going to take the train!

406
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,400
That's it!

407
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,560
You're going to take the train until the sun sets?

408
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,580
I've seen all of your ways of doing things.

409
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,000
Now, get back to work, Ryotsu.

410
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,540
That's what I'd like!

411
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,980
That's right, you idiot!

412
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,280
Here's my money, sir!

413
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,460
What?

414
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,080
I'm going for the boss, Ryotsu!

415
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
He's still our leader!

416
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,060
You're이�e the boss is gone!

417
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:25,940
What?

418
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,660
Take this!

419
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,500
The special train will be……

420
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,640
Well, this is it!

421
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,460
Oh, excuse me!

422
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,580
This is a wedding train,

423
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,860
except for your relatives and friends...

424
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,040
From now on, we're friends!

425
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,860
It's a treaty! Take it!

426
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,120
Take it!

427
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,260
Next station!

428
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,140
The police are chasing Ryo-san in the middle of the night.

429
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,780
That money was really dangerous, wasn't it?

430
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,840
That money was really dangerous, wasn't it?

431
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,540
It doesn't matter what it is.

432
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,120
We will take back our debt.

433
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,280
That's all we need.

434
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,620
Here it comes!

435
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,100
Damn it! You got me!

436
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,900
Here!

437
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,700
Here!

438
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,020
Here!

439
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,500
Here!

440
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,520
What?

441
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,900
Where is it?

442
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,980
There!

443
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,820
There!

444
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,900
I can't get the money!

445
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,200
Why the hell are they chasing us?!

446
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,920
Ryo-san!

447
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,840
Here!

448
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,900
Damn it!

449
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,460
Take it, everyone!

450
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,080
Take this!

451
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,640
What the hell?

452
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,120
Police! Move!

453
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,200
Eiji!

454
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,980
I wonder if I'll get it.

455
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,500
If you're gonna do this, pay me back!

456
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,280
This is our money!

457
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:27,800
Ouch!

458
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,660
Get out of here!

459
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,640
I got it!

460
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,980
Speed up!

461
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,820
Today's the day!

462
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,040
Let me ride it!

463
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,140
Put the money in!

464
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,740
Easy peasy.

465
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,960
Good work.

466
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,920
What's this?

467
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,180
Hey!

468
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,120
This is enough!

469
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,140
What?

470
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,460
But...

471
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,900
Then how about this?

472
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,760
I have to avoid it...

473
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,560
Then how about this?

474
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,220
I'm sure this is enough!

475
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,860
Get out of here!

476
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,300
Roger!

477
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,640
It's dangerous!

478
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,340
Eiji!

479
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,420
Shut up!

480
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,920
Get out of here!

481
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,120
Ahh!

482
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,780
You, buster!

483
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,540
How dare you!

484
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,840
You're mine!

485
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,080
I'm yours!

486
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,080
Ouch!

487
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,240
- comigo! - Yui!

488
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:02,540
Chiba!

489
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:04,580
You!

490
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,040
Why?

491
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,980
Don't tell me you used up everything you had to escape?

492
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,800
I can't think of anything else.

493
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,540
This is bad.

494
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,960
Even this...

495
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,740
This is mine!

496
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,720
-This is mine! -Give it back!

497
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,660
This is mine!

498
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,200
Senior, can you hear me?

499
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,500
Senior, you have a bonus for all the Katsushika members!

500
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,100
We have to pay you back!

501
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,280
This is bad!

502
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,400
What?

503
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,540
But I'm not the one to blame!

504
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,720
Do you think that excuse will work on all of us?

505
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,100
If you pay me back now, I'll forgive you!

506
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,200
Look behind you!

507
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,260
Here we go!

508
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,280
Bonus payback!

509
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,280
What?

510
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,440
Why does this always happen?

511
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,740
Bonus for the dead!

512
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,920
Bonus for the dead!

513
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,300
Bonus for the dead!

514
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,980
Bonus for the dead!

515
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,740
Give me back my power!

516
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,160
-We have to pay you back! -We have to pay you back!

517
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,080
Bonus for the dead!

518
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,360
We have to pay you back!

519
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,340
Bonus for the dead!

520
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,300
We will pay you back!

521
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,420
I had a strange feeling

522
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:38,860
So I walked the Ake-do-gai tile

523
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,480
Just the black part

524
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,200
Everyone was a child once

525
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,580
But everyone forgets

526
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,900
A politician with a great face

527
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,800
A blue lady with blue eyes

528
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:06,160
Look up at that corner

529
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,720
You can meet everyone

530
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,000
There is a turtle

531
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,440
There must be a turtle

532
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,060
Everyone come to our town

533
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,500
Thank you!

534
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,820
Everyone come to our town

535
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,960
Thank you!
