1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
Thank you for listening!

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,260
I gazed at the rising sun

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,680
that swivels over Inakakawa

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,800
When the love stone was kicked out

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,660
it flew away to the shoes

6
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,380
From the water tank in the Tungari-boshi

7
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,340
To the sea of Kai-shaku

8
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,940
The sun sets

9
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,480
Tomorrow, it'll be over already

10
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,600
Katsushika, Shibamata, and happiness

11
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,740
I lost them and realized

12
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:51,720
I'm such an idiot

13
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm such an idiot

14
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,600
I'm such an idiot

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,780
I'm such an idiot

16
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,860
I'm such an idiot

17
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,400
Shut up!

18
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,700
You're in the way of my work!

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,560
Sorry, I slipped

20
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,960
You can't be satisfied with just one cup of tea

21
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,280
You can't go to your wife's house

22
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,980
Look around you

23
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,620
Hiromi, Keiko, Kaoru

24
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,680
They all went to their wives' houses

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,720
That's why

26
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,060
You'll end up with just one cup of tea

27
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,540
If you notice that

28
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,100
You'll end up with just one cup of tea

29
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,680
What?

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,800
You're so stubborn

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,920
I tried to make you some tea

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,800
You're trying to fix it

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,180
You can't go to your wife's house

34
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,060
You can't go

35
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,040
You can't write a death note

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,260
You can't write a death note

37
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,980
What?

38
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,300
You...

39
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,860
Shut up!

40
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,420
Shut up!

41
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,440
You're such an idiot

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,800
You're such an idiot

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,340
You're such an idiot

44
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,400
You're such an idiot

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,200
Seriously, what the hell is it?

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,420
Oh my goodness

47
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:18,960
Reiko!

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,280
You must be kidding me.

50
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,280
Yes!

51
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,360
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

52
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,420
Hey, is he alright?

53
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,560
Ouch, he hit me hard.

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,340
What should I do?

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,760
Papa, you're...

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:35,860
Papa?

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,320
It's Reiko's papa.

58
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,260
I can't believe you're the president of such a big company.

59
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,140
Ouch!

60
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,160
Papa, you alright?

61
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,500
Are you okay?

62
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,380
Oh, Reiko.

63
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,920
What's up?

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,300
I was on the phone, but I was always off, so I was on the way to the office.

65
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,580
The office is a mess.

66
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't work in this situation.

67
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,040
It's your fault that it's messed up.

68
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,120
If I were the manager, I would have made it a great office.

69
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,380
If the police are civilized, please buy the office.

70
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,300
Is this Reiko's desk?

71
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,640
Yes.

72
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,240
It's a cheap desk.

73
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,160
It's terrible.

74
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,640
I can't stand it.

75
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,140
The chair is the worst.

76
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,380
Oh, what a poor kitchen.

77
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,520
What an unhygienic bathroom.

78
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,920
It's not a place where humans can work.

79
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,340
I didn't expect Reiko to be beaten so badly.

80
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,000
Did you come all the way from Kobe to complain?

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,080
Yes.

82
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,800
Hey, Takeshita.

83
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,780
Yes.

84
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,180
Operation 189, start.

85
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,980
What's going on?

86
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,300
Hey.

87
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:50,920
Come on.

88
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,020
Hey, wait.

89
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,260
Hey.

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,960
Hey, Dad.

91
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,280
I'm on my way to the office, so please go on patrol.

92
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,760
Dad, open the door.

93
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,040
Hey, open the door.

94
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,440
Oh, my God.

95
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,060
I don't understand, Dad.

96
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,340
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,980
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,640
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,100
Huh?

100
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,460
Hello?

101
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,260
Hey, what's with the hideout?

102
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,260
What's the purpose of the hideout?

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,760
Well, I can't handle it.

104
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,040
It's always like that.

105
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,700
Oh, it stinks.

106
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,860
Oh, my God.

107
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,280
I wish I had been a teacher.

108
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,260
Ms. Seiji and the others both intend to stop the call.

109
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,280
I hope it's not about that.

110
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,680
Oh, please, don't stop.

111
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,860
It's an emergency.

112
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,680
We have a new defense device.

113
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
It's so fancy.

114
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,040
This is the old one.

115
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,020
This is a new one.

116
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,900
It's a new type.

117
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,940
It's warm.

118
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,260
It's a system kitchen from West Germany.

119
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,220
Wow.

120
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,640
Hey, Reiko.

121
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,320
What's this?

122
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,020
My daughter always takes care of me.

123
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,500
I'm Akimoto Pyunpyunmaru, Reiko's father.

124
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,360
Oh, thank you.

125
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,620
Wow, it's very powerful.

126
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,020
Very good.

127
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,900
I can build a cup noodle house in a second.

128
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,660
I can build a cup noodle house in a second.

129
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,940
Reiko, how did you like it?

130
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,580
Reiko has been rehabilitated to make it easier for her to work.

131
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,220
Please, make everything as it was.

132
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,060
Make everything as it was.

133
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,240
You made it easy for Reiko,

134
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,500
but you're going to make everything as it was?

135
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,000
Of course.

136
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,080
What did you come here for?

137
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,780
Oh, that's right.

138
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,080
There are so many pictures here.

139
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,080
I got them from the bank and the bank account.

140
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,900
I got them from the bank and the bank account.

141
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,640
You can just look through them.

142
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,760
There are so many.

143
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,500
It's going to take days just to look through them.

144
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:42,940
It's going to take days just to look through them.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,040
Hey, Reiko.

146
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
How about this?

147
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,460
You can see Reiko at a party.

148
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,040
Sorry, but please don't do that.

149
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,320
I don't want to get married yet.

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,560
What?

151
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,720
Oh, I see.

153
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,540
I see.

154
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,900
I brought the pictures just because you asked me to.

155
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,660
I brought the pictures just because you asked me to.

156
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,500
The life of Reiko is deciding who you choose.

157
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,540
I believe in you.

158
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,180
Papa.

159
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,900
Hey, clean up.

160
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,240
Thank you.

161
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,260
I'm just a father that knows what I'm talking about.

162
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,240
That's right.

163
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,000
That's right.

164
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,720
I've got some things to do at the bank.

165
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,220
I've got some things to do at the bank.

166
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,720
I can't refuse without saying no.

167
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,760
Please be with me.

168
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,160
But...

169
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,980
President, it's about time for the meeting.

170
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,540
Oh, I see.

171
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,320
Papa!

172
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,420
I'm counting on you!

173
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,880
Oh, Papa, you're such a...

174
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,560
A 32-year-old son of a real estate agent,

175
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,940
and a house of 2,000 square feet?

176
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,740
He's like a cucumber.

177
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,380
A 700 billion-year-old company.

178
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,840
I can't help it.

179
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,940
I'll just refuse him.

180
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,960
You'll refuse him?

181
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,260
That's a waste of 7 billion.

182
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
It's not about the money.

183
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,840
But if the other person really likes you,

184
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,420
I think it's even worse to refuse him.

185
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,320
Yeah, it might be rude.

186
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,660
Huh?

187
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,680
What should we do?

188
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,420
I'm worried.

189
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,120
Don't worry.

190
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,400
If Reiko goes out with him,

191
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,660
she'll be afraid and refuse him.

192
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,920
Ryo, what do you mean?

193
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,260
You have to stop it.

194
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,100
I'll kill you, Ryo.

195
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,540
If you make this stupid Reiko angry,

196
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,300
I'll fold you and throw you into the river.

197
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,900
Come on, Ryo.

198
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,720
Come on, Ryo.

199
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,040
When did I ever do that?

200
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:40,820
What?

201
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,180
That's it!

202
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:42,980
What?

203
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,620
Reiko...

204
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:48,980
Reiko...

205
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,840
You're late, Akimoto-sama.

206
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,800
Yeah, you're right.

207
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,180
It's already been an hour.

208
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,380
I just want to pee.

209
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,500
Wait, Katsuo.

210
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,120
Anyway, I know.

211
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,220
There are so many things I have to do.

212
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,740
The Akimoto family is different from us.

213
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,700
Maybe you'll inherit that wealth,

214
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,900
you might end up becoming your own one, you know?

215
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,840
Good!

216
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,660
Even if you have a bad personality or have some shortcomings,

217
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,840
you should keep an eye on it.

218
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,560
I understand, Mama.

219
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,300
Oh, sorry for being late.

220
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,200
Hello, hello.

221
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,900
You're here.

222
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,760
Reiko's father caught a cold,

223
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,060
so I, the uncle, came to take care of him.

224
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,780
Nice to meet you.

225
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,960
It's Reiko. Nice to meet you.

226
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,340
"The

227
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,460
"The

228
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,620
"The picture is completely different from the picture.

229
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:53,680
"The

230
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,360
"This is definitely a firecracker."

231
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,960
If we succeed, we'll be able to conquer Tsurukabe Prefecture.

232
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,680
So, is that Reiko?

233
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,020
Yes, it's Reiko. Do you have a question?

234
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,280
Well, it seems that the picture you're looking at is a little different.

235
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,420
Oh, it's often said that I'm bad at taking pictures.

236
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,280
Reiko is quite...

237
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,140
You're talking about a lot of firecrackers, aren't you?

238
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,360
Yes. 500 cigarettes a day.

239
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,400
I've been drinking too much shochu and beer,

240
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,680
and now I'm talking like this at karaoke.

241
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,580
Oh, oh, oh.

242
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,580
Oh, Reiko, you have many hobbies, right?

243
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,000
I love horses, especially horses.

244
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,040
And then, I like carpentry, mahjong, pachinko, fencing,

245
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,040
karate, boxing, and I like fighting.

246
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,920
Even if I'm in a fight, it's the best.

247
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,920
Everyone is full of blood and...

248
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,520
No, Reiko-san is good at jokes.

249
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,460
Oh, you're serious?

250
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,560
Then let's show him how it's done.

251
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,260
Hey, later you won't get hurt by Reiko-kun's criticism, so be careful.

252
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,000
The purpose is to make him refuse to meet her.

253
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,180
I have to be careful.

254
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,880
You're quite a lively young lady.

255
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,800
Hahaha, I'm raised in freedom.

256
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,520
Mama, Reiko-san is scary.

257
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,180
I told you, you should close your eyes when you see a little problem.

258
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,920
A little?

259
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,600
I had so much fun with my little partner the other day.

260
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,720
Ryo-chan...

261
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,740
Oh no!

262
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,240
Oh, my throat is dry.

263
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,220
Wow, you're a great drinker, aren't you, Kazuha-san?

264
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,460
Y-Yes, I am.

265
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,560
I'm glad you like it.

266
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,420
Damn it.

267
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,360
Then...

268
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,200
It looks delicious!

269
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,400
It's delicious!

270
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,700
Reiko, I'm so happy!

271
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,860
I can't stand it anymore!

272
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,220
Reiko, you can't!

273
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,680
I'm so full.

274
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,340
You're eating so vividly, aren't you, Kazuha-san?

275
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:08,840
Yes.

276
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,020
You're eating so vividly.

277
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,700
Health is the most important thing, after all.

278
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,540
I like it even more.

279
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,160
This is tougher than I thought.

280
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,180
It's like this.

281
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,240
Hmm, I can't help it.

282
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,420
Well, it's about time.

283
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,740
Leave the rest to the two young people.

284
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,140
What?

285
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,800
Kazuha-san, let's go.

286
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,300
Mama, I'm scared.

287
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,900
Come on, you bastard.

288
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,300
Then, I'll go there.

289
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,100
Enjoy it.

290
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,000
Mama!

291
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,400
Good luck, Kazuha-san!

292
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,040
Mama!

293
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,140
Well, I'll play with you a lot.

294
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,660
Mama is gone.

295
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,660
Just me and Kazuha-san.

296
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,300
When will you return?

297
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,520
You bear it,rade.

298
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,660
I miss you so much.

299
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,740
I miss you, too.

300
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,480
I'll leave.

301
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,520
I'm leaving.

302
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,100
I will come back with you.

303
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,640
But I'll never begin.

304
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll return with you.

305
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,300
But I'll leave with you.

306
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Come on, nervous.

307
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,200
Come on, nervous.

308
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,640
What's this?

309
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,380
It's something like an air-conditioning çaque made in a long time ago.

310
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,880
That is a whip.

311
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,280
I can't believe it.

312
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,080
Wait, hey.

313
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
I'd rather have a gorilla.

314
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,640
Who's a jerk?

315
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,620
You don't deserve to be called that!

316
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,760
You're a big bastard!

317
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,440
I'm sorry!

318
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,040
Sorry to keep you waiting.

319
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,160
No, I mean...

320
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,380
Reiko-san is a very aggressive person.

321
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,380
I wonder.

322
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,820
I always get angry when someone says something bad about me.

323
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,580
I'm sorry.

324
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,160
Oh, right.

325
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,680
I have a request for a classical concert from my mother.

326
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,520
Classical?

327
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Andre Heilrichten, Johann Autobahn,

328
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,320
Humboldt, The Undelgern Concert, No. 348,

329
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,380
"The Song of the Forest"

330
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,200
It's six hours long.

331
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,800
I'm sorry, but I hate classical music.

332
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,400
I'll play it again next time.

333
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,060
I don't think you like it.

334
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,720
What should I do?

335
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,540
If you don't like it,

336
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,680
you can just say no to the concert.

337
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,540
Really?

338
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,700
Don't worry about it.

339
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,120
I'll give up because I thought there was no chance.

340
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,140
Then, I'm sorry, but...

341
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,440
Yeah?

342
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,660
About this...

343
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,300
Yeah, yeah.

344
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,160
Oh, excuse me.

345
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,120
Yes, Mom.

346
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,240
Oh, Kazuo-san.

347
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,500
You're doing your best at the concert.

348
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,960
You're going to make it work no matter what.

349
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,920
I know, Mom.

350
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,340
I'm getting along with Kazuo-san, so don't worry.

351
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,040
Don't worry about me.

352
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,880
Hello? Hello?

353
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

354
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,860
I slipped.

355
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,460
Hello? Hello, Kazuo-san?

356
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,180
So?

357
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:15,800
What?

358
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,760
You said you would say no to the concert.

359
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,900
No, it's ridiculous.

360
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,620
Oh, really?

361
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,900
It's not a cheap woman's strategy.

362
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,880
If this happens, it's the next step.

363
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,880
I have something I want.

364
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,480
Can you buy it for me?

365
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Of course.

366
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,100
480,000 yen?

367
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,360
Well, it's a nice bag.

368
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,140
This one?

369
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,300
Yes.

370
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,800
I'm scared.

371
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,960
No, I want it. I want it, Kazuo-san.

372
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,360
You have a good sense.

373
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,480
I understand.

374
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,380
Hey!

375
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,800
He's got the wrong number.

376
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,800
It's 480,000.

377
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,040
Here you go, Rekou-san.

378
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,520
Here you go.

379
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,580
Thank you.

380
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,780
He paid 480,000 for this.

381
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,880
I'm glad I can see it now.

382
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,640
I want a jewel, Rekou.

383
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,840
A jewel?

384
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,440
I want it. I want it.

385
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,040
Ishikoro Takaga is so scary.

386
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,800
I don't know what to buy.

387
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,900
Please choose whatever you like.

388
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,440
Choose whatever you like.

389
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Here it is.

390
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,880
This big one.

391
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,560
1, 1.2 million yen.

392
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:34,980
Here you go.

393
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,300
Damn it.

394
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,420
Look at this.

395
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,380
I'll buy it to the point where I can't pay for it.

396
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,720
This red one.

397
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,360
The green one next to it.

398
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,640
This big one.

399
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,760
I'm sorry.

400
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,080
No, you can't.

401
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,380
This one and this one.

402
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,200
Sir.

403
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,480
No matter how beautiful a person is,

404
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,840
it would be a waste if he was so cold to me in the first meeting.

405
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,140
Well, it was a success.

406
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,560
Can I have all of this?

407
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,980
All of it?

408
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,880
Yes, all of it.

409
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,200
It's 158 million yen in total.

410
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,260
One million?

411
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,860
One million?

412
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,440
One million?

413
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,480
One million?

414
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,200
One million?

415
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,800
One million?

416
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
It's 58 million yen.

417
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,220
One million?

418
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,080
What?

419
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,680
Excuse me.

420
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,560
Yes.

421
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,580
Can I have a little?

422
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,760
Why do you have so much money?

423
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,760
My father gave me a company last year.

424
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,200
I'm the president there.

425
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,420
Is that so?

426
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,900
I don't have the courage or the strength,

427
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,620
but I have more money than anyone else.

428
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,240
So don't worry, Reiko.

429
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,860
I'm just doing this for a cup of katsudon.

430
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,680
Damn it.

431
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,540
Next strategy.

432
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,920
It's a failure.

433
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,340
I can't believe it.

434
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,680
It's our turn.

435
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,280
Do you have anything you want?

436
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,260
No, I'm fine.

437
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,100
What's wrong with that woman?

438
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,320
She's a man, too.

439
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,480
But it's a miracle that a man is here.

440
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,800
Oh, really?

441
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,260
Hello, Reiko.

442
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,920
How nice to meet you.

443
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,820
Oh, it's you, Kei.

444
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,120
Huh?

445
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,200
I'll give you some money to work with later.

446
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,420
Um, Reiko, are you a friend?

447
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,060
She's my ex-boyfriend.

448
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,360
She's cool, isn't she?

449
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,000
What?

450
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,960
Reiko's always been charming.

451
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,220
No way.

452
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:46,940
I can't stand her.

453
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm so worried about the fire.

454
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,400
Hey, Reiko. I missed you.

455
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,440
No, it's Honda-kun from before.

456
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:58,880
Before?

457
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,180
Reiko, in my car...

458
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,160
I'm doing this for you.

459
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,440
But...

460
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,620
Can you fly me to Haneda in my car?

461
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,420
No, I'm flying you to Yokohama in my car.

462
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:17,920
Sorry.

463
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,760
I'm at a wedding, so I'll see you later.

464
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,380
See you later, Reiko.

465
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,020
I love you, Reiko.

466
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,120
Bye-bye.

467
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,400
I can't believe it.

468
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,420
I'm so worried.

469
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,600
I'm so fat and I'm so skinny.

470
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,440
I'm so sick of it.

471
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,600
You're so pretty.

472
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,780
You're so kind because you've been living abroad for so long.

473
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,280
What?

474
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,880
You're a perfect match for the president's wife.

475
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,440
I have few friends, so I envy you, Reiko.

476
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,500
It was so hard.

477
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,220
The plan "Go, go, cheating girl" failed.

478
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,280
What?

479
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,340
It's the final plan.

480
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,660
Do your best, Terai-senpai.

481
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,520
I can't believe it.

482
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,640
Soon, my seniors will come here.

483
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,640
And then...

484
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,380
Hey, brother.

485
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,240
Help me.

486
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,720
I don't like people who don't trust me.

487
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,820
Goodbye.

488
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,680
Now you can refuse.

489
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,200
I'm sorry for him, but he's going to refuse this time, so I'm sure.

490
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,420
This way.

491
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,500
Where are you going, Reiko?

492
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,460
It's a good place.

493
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,880
It's strange.

494
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,400
I'm sure they're standing around here.

495
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,620
It's too late, Ryo-chan.

496
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,720
Where did they go?

497
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,880
This is the first time I've walked in a place like this.

498
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,580
Hey, brother.

499
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,160
Where are you looking at?

500
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,180
What? Are you there, Terai...

501
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,000
Who do you think we are?

502
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,980
That's real.

503
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,660
Help me, Reiko.

504
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,680
Help me.

505
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,960
I'm scared.

506
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,620
I can't do it.

507
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,280
It's not what I planned, but I can refuse this time, so I'm fine.

508
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,540
I can't believe you're asking for help.

509
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,300
You're a fool.

510
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,560
You're a fool.

511
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,840
You're a fool.

512
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,820
You're a fool.

513
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,180
Hey, brother.

514
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,340
You don't have to apologize.

515
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,680
You guys, stop it.

516
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,860
What's wrong with you?

517
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,220
You're a fool.

518
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,480
Who are you?

519
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,460
You're a fool.

520
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,200
You're a fool.

521
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,620
You're a fool.

522
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,300
You're a fool.

523
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,700
You're a fool.

524
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,360
You're a fool.

525
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,020
You're a fool.

526
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,700
You're a fool.

527
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,580
You're a fool.

528
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,780
You're a fool.

529
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:49,940
You're a fool.

530
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,480
You and I are fools.

531
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:50,840
You and I are fools.

532
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,940
You and I are fools.

533
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,580
You and I are fools.

534
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,840
You and I are fools.

535
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,900
I had a good day today.

536
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,860
But I'm a mean, rich, manly man.

537
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,820
I'm not your wife.

538
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,860
Don't worry about it.

539
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,160
I'll say no without hesitation.

540
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,000
Reiko.

541
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,340
Yes?

542
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,080
Please marry me.

543
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,720
What?

544
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,380
Reiko is my ideal woman.

545
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,360
What?

546
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,820
At first, I was a little scared.

547
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,720
But I'm strong and reliable.

548
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,040
I'm good at everything, and you're perfect.

549
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,300
I can't think of any other woman but you.

550
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,060
Wait, wait, wait.

551
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:37,980
Reiko!

552
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,400
Did your father say anything after that?

553
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,820
No, nothing.

554
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,740
So the wedding was a success.

555
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,540
I feel like it's a waste.

556
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,960
Thanks to everyone's cooperation.

557
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,140
Especially Ryo-chan.

558
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,780
Thank you.

559
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,860
No...

560
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,180
I'm sorry, Reiko.

561
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,640
Congratulations, Reiko.

562
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,060
You're engaged to Kazuo-kun, aren't you?

563
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:08,720
What?

564
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,180
What?

565
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,400
Reiko!

566
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,020
No way!

567
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,220
What's going on?

568
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,320
Ryo-san!

569
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,000
Ryo-san!

570
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,640
Kazuo-san!

571
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,120
Reiko!

572
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:18,840
What?

573
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:19,960
What?

574
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,040
Reiko-san!

575
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,840
Reiko-san!

576
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,300
Reiko-san!

577
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:23,880
Reiko-san!

578
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,780
Reiko-san!

579
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,900
Let's go buy a second-rate helicopter today.

580
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,820
I'm so happy.

581
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,640
Reiko will be able to fly the Atlantic!

582
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,740
I want an Italian high-end metal helicopter called the Atlantic.

583
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,400
Kazuo-san, buy it for me.

584
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:36,880
What?

585
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,940
What are you thinking?

586
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,880
I don't think this kind of lie will last long.

587
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,420
What is this?

588
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,780
Reiko will marry Kazuo-san and live happily ever after.

589
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,320
Let's go, Kazuo-san.

590
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,540
Yes, Reiko-san.

591
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,320
Hey, Reiko.

592
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,360
I have other things I want.

593
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,220
Anything is fine.

594
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,020
I'm so happy.

595
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,140
You fool!

596
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm so happy!

597
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,460
Humph!

598
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,760
pacifist.

599
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,340
No, please!

600
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,280
It's like a

601
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,120
I'm getting off for taking a light meal.

602
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:20,920
I'm sorry.

603
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,280
Thank you on the plane.

604
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,960
Good morning.

605
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,600
I'm ready.

606
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,840
I'm rumored to be a woman who can't do anything

607
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,000
But there are so many things I want to do

608
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,420
I want to ride on a bike through the vast desert

609
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,140
I want to be free more than a bird

610
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,880
I want to be free more than a bird

611
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:07,520
A lady's dream that changes at the speed of light

612
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:15,300
I'm sorry, I'm losing my love

613
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:23,220
I'm going to dive into the future of the panorama

614
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,580
You understand, don't you?

615
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,180
I'm sorry, I'm losing my love
