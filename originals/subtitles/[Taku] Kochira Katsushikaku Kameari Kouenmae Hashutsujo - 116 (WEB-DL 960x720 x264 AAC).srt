1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:13,100
"When you watch TV, make the room bright and look away!"

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,100
"When you watch TV, make the room bright and look away!"

3
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,860
"When you kick a stone, fly to the shoe."

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,620
"I wonder if I'm going to the gym that I used to work out."

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,860
"I laughed at the fact that I was still a baby."

6
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,260
"Even if I try to cheer up, I only have a fever and a cold."

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,340
"I have a cold."

8
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:56,940
"I have a cold."

9
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,640
"It's drawn silence at night."

10
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,860
"It's drawn silence at night."

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:13,980
"I have a cold. But it stays at night."

12
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,920
"Would you like something to eat?"

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,080
"You've been drinking too much, Kenji."

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,000
I realized I lost happiness again

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,720
Because I'm such an idiot

16
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,600
Oh, Reiko-chan!

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,980
Oh, good morning, Grandpa!

18
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,920
Good morning, Grandpa!

19
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,960
You look cute today, Reiko-chan.

20
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,820
Especially that mini-clothes.

21
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,800
It suits you, doesn't it?

22
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,660
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,940
Thank you, Grandpa.

24
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,960
See you later!

25
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,420
That's nice.

26
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,580
Reiko-chan.

27
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,520
You're always trying to impress me, aren't you?

28
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,740
Every time I see that thigh, I feel like I get younger little by little.

29
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,820
Oh, thank you, thank you.

30
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,960
Oh, is that so?

31
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,200
Then I'll give you a hug.

32
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,560
Oh, how many? How many?

33
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,260
Three, two, one.

34
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,160
Run! Reiko's Great Whip

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,480
Me and Gaisten

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,900
Ryo-san, look at that.

37
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,180
Hmm, if ya waste it, it'll fall apart.

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,220
You gotta do something about it, Ryo-san.

39
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:49,840
Yup.

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,340
It might reach you in just a solid gear.

41
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,300
I might be able to get there by car.

42
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,160
Reiko, get in the back.

43
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,340
Why would I get in the back?

44
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,080
Because you're lighter.

45
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,740
No, Ryo-chan, you get in the back.

46
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,800
You're the one who's in the back.

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,840
Are you alright?

48
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,200
I'm fine.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,700
I'm heavy.

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,840
Hey, Ryo-chan.

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,580
Don't mess up my hair.

52
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,160
I've done my hair for a long time.

53
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,060
Sorry, sorry.

54
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,560
Then, give it to me.

55
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,880
It's not going up at all.

56
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,400
Wait a minute.

57
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,340
It's going up a little.

58
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,120
Ouch, my hair is stuck.

59
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,480
You're a noisy person.

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,600
Good luck, Reiko.

61
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,380
It's for the children.

62
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,020
It's really heavy.

63
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,920
Hey, stop it.

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:44,820
What?

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,880
Don't push your chest against my legs.

66
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,440
I'm giving you too much service.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,600
sufficiently

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,180
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,240
Ryo-chan, are you okay?

70
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,640
I thought your ribs would break.

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,200
What can I do?

72
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,300
I'll take a ride.

73
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,620
I told you to do so at first.

74
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,160
Be careful.

75
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,180
Don't raise your head too much.

76
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,700
My skirt will get up.

77
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,640
Minnie is wearing something.

78
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,880
Ryo, a little further.

79
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,080
A little more to the right.

80
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,520
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

81
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,480
You're too close to the ground.

82
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,460
I got it, Ryo-chan!

83
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,020
Yay!

84
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,660
I got it!

85
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,760
Ryo-chan?

86
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,800
Yay!

87
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,800
Thank you!

88
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,420
Thank you!

89
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,760
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

90
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,000
Hang in there.

91
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,060
It's Ryo-chan!

92
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,260
Are you trying to kill me?

93
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,260
You just got too strong.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,480
It's a neck breaker.

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,940
If you were 10 seconds late, you'd have died.

96
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,020
I told you I'm sorry.

97
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,000
No, I almost died.

98
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,200
You should keep your legs long.

99
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,980
You shouldn't wear a mini skirt.

100
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,560
No, I'm wearing it because it's easy to move.

101
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,640
How is it?

102
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,040
Senpai, Reiko-san is a great athlete.

103
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,140
I'm wearing a mini skirt because it's easy to move.

104
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,220
Don't be ridiculous.

105
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,580
A short skirt is useless if you make a man feel bad.

106
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,880
What?

107
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,440
I don't want to hear that from a Ryo-chan who doesn't know fashion.

108
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,740
I'm not a little girl.

109
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,440
If you're not polite, be polite.

110
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,240
This is bad, Senpai.

111
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,920
Yes, Reiko-san was really angry.

112
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,160
What?

113
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,800
Shut up.

114
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,780
Good morning.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,880
Oh, Reiko-san isn't here.

116
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,480
Reiko?

117
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,020
I don't know.

118
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,940
What's wrong, Ryo-san?

119
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,880
Well...

120
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,120
Good morning.

121
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,520
Reiko, did you quit mini?

122
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,200
Yes, because an old man from somewhere said it's not good for mini.

123
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,660
Maria, I got this from someone.

124
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,000
You got it?

125
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,040
I'm glad.

126
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,140
What's that?

127
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,020
I was asked for shampoo.

128
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,600
It doesn't fit me well.

129
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,560
I use it in a salon in Paris.

130
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,780
Did you get it from Paris even though it's shampoo?

131
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,780
I always use soap.

132
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,700
Hair is the life of a woman.

133
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,300
Don't be so naughty.

134
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,900
Don't be so naughty.

135
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,700
Don't you dare say such things.

136
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,960
By the way, I have something for you, Ryo-chan.

137
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,900
I can do it if it's shampoo.

138
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,400
Who gives you shampoo?

139
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,780
Look inside.

140
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,200
What's this?

141
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,240
I don't go to the salon every year.

142
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,880
So I got it from the office.

143
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,040
I don't need it.

144
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,600
I don't need it.

145
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,360
I was told to dress like a rich man.

146
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,180
I have to dress like a rich man for Ryo-chan.

147
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm fine with this.

148
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,660
Why are you fine with it?

149
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,780
No cap.

150
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,100
Wrapped in sleeves.

151
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,100
Toilet sandals.

152
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,320
Which is the rich man?

153
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
Shut up.

154
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,700
This is my trademark.

155
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,020
Because of this, everyone knows me.

156
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,160
For example?

157
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,720
It's a trap!

158
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,760
Run!

159
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,540
Hurry up!

160
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,020
Wait!

161
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,040
Oh no! Ryo-chan is in a coma!

162
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,880
I can't win.

163
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,820
Run away!

164
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,600
I thought I could escape!

165
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,420
Thank you, Mr. Ryo-chan.

166
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,640
You're fine now.

167
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,420
But,

168
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,080
If I try to dress like a rich man,

169
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,100
The criminal will know I'm the one.

170
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,980
It's a trap!

171
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,760
Run!

172
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,920
Hurry up!

173
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,420
Wait!

174
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,620
I'm not running.

175
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,640
Just a warning?

176
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,680
Shoot him.

177
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,360
Yes.

178
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,540
I'm not going to do it.

179
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,260
I'm not going to do it.

180
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,300
I don't need this.

181
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:33,480
I don't need this.

182
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,460
This is a trick.

183
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,320
You can wear it even if you don't want to.

184
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,360
What the hell is this scary atmosphere?

185
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:49,800
Stop!

186
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,420
Stop, Reiko!

187
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,100
I can't beat Reiko, even with a tank.

188
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,220
But, it's fine to be a police officer.

189
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,480
Right, Maria?

190
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,360
Yes, I'm very happy.

191
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,840
That's right.

192
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,420
Senpai, you're cool.

193
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,440
Right?

194
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,820
You're saying whatever you want.

195
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,000
Good morning.

196
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,440
I'm sorry, I think I got the wrong exit.

197
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,940
Kameari Park exit.

198
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,960
I think I got it right.

199
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,500
John, stop your stupid jokes.

200
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,540
Oh, it's you, Ryo!

201
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,340
I thought you were someone else.

202
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,300
I see.

203
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,820
It's a shame that Reiko died in a miniskirt.

204
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,400
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

205
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,780
You're dressed like a police officer.

206
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,620
You've been a policeman for 30 years.

207
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,580
I'm so happy for you, Daijirou Ohara.

208
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,580
You don't have to cry.

209
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,120
Shut up!

210
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,760
Do you know how I feel about you being my subordinate?

211
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,160
Anyway, here.

212
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,320
What's this?

213
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,180
You haven't written a single letter since last month.

214
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,620
Oh, well...

215
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,180
Write a two-month letter today.

216
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:22,540
Sure.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,260
I'll write you a letter.

218
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,200
Here.

219
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,640
"I, Kankichi Ryotsu, will write a death letter."

220
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,500
Good.

221
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,840
Well then, Ryotsu.

222
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,460
If you write a death letter, I'll bring it to you.

223
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,740
I'm going back soon.

224
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,240
Well then, Ryosama, good luck.

225
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm going on patrol.

226
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,280
Senpai, Reiko, take care.

227
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,400
Have a good trip.

228
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,100
Oh, dear.

229
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,860
I can't walk with my shoes on.

230
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,280
Hey, Reiko.

231
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,140
Give me some tea.

232
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,820
If you want some tea, you can drink it yourself.

233
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,740
What?

234
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,000
It's fine if you give it to me.

235
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,240
I can't get used to this skirt, so it's hard to move.

236
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,380
I wish I had a mini skirt.

237
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,860
So, I'll be doing my own thing from today.

238
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,720
Then don't wear that skirt.

239
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,740
What are you talking about?

240
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,620
Ryo-chan told me not to wear a mini skirt.

241
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,500
I know.

242
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,620
I'll do it myself.

243
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,640
I'll do it myself.

244
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,980
Hey, Reiko.

245
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,700
Where's the bathroom?

246
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,640
It's over there, right?

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,520
Yeah.

248
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,160
Oh, it's there.

249
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,620
Where's the tea pot?

250
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
You're so annoying.

251
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm in the living room.

252
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,680
I said I'd do it myself, so don't ask me.

253
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,780
I know.

254
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,780
I'm the one who's annoying.

255
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,380
Oh, dear.

256
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,160
This is so annoying.

257
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,160
Sorry, I'm all answered.

258
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,620
It's okay.

259
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,940
You don't have to worry.

260
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,400
We're sure you'll be fine.

261
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,880
Listen up, ah?

262
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,340
Come on.

263
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,760
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,320
You're in a bad place right now.

265
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,280
It's not me who I've been doing this for.

266
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,480
Don't worry.

267
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,480
I'll do it, Ryo.

268
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:18,900
What's wrong with you?

269
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,080
What the hell?

270
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,560
It's over!

271
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,420
It took me all day to rewrite the draft.

272
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,100
This uniform and hat are a little too big.

273
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,940
Reiko, you brought a bigger size than me on purpose.

274
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,520
Why do I have to wear this?

275
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,900
It's hard to move because of this uniform.

276
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,620
I can't do this.

277
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,840
Are you giving up already?

278
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,680
Shut up! I was just resting.

279
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,820
You're more difficult to walk than me.

280
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,620
It's not like that. I like it because I can walk well.

281
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,240
How long will you keep this uniform?

282
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,960
Oh, I'll keep it like this from now on.

283
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,020
I wonder how long you'll keep that uniform.

284
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,260
I like it too.

285
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,380
It makes my spine feel tight and tight.

286
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,720
I see. That's good.

287
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,220
See you.

288
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,540
You can't keep your feelings tight.

289
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,060
Huh?

290
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,780
I forgot to tell you.

291
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,920
What? You still have something to complain about?

292
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,880
The chief said to bring the draft to the office as soon as possible.

293
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,220
I told you properly.

294
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,280
Yeah, I got it.

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
It's time to get out of the office.

296
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,040
Taito, you're so hard to walk.

297
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,540
Oh, hi, grandpa.

298
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,120
What's wrong, Reiko?

299
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,280
You're in such a long skirt.

300
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,260
I was looking forward to seeing your thighs.

301
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,140
Oh, come on, grandpa.

302
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,720
Yeah, right.

303
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:36,900
That's right.

304
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,540
When I see those fat thighs that don't get ripped,

305
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,740
I get the feeling that they're alive.

306
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,620
Everyone in our old age group is a fan of Reiko's thighs.

307
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,780
No way.

308
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,960
If you make a skirt out of that,

309
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,460
there may be an old man who will be shocked and get a cramp.

310
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,740
That's too much.

311
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,820
No, it's not too much.

312
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,300
We can't take away the lives of the old people.

313
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,780
We should return them to Minnie.

314
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,180
That's a good idea.

315
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,100
Why are you following us?

316
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,120
It's the closest to the library, so we have no choice.

317
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,240
Keiko, are you the newbie?

318
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,520
Huh?

319
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,280
What are you looking at, old man?

320
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,560
It's me, Ryo-tsu.

321
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,840
It's really you, Ryo-san.

322
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,060
What happened to this outfit?

323
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,580
I'm wearing shoes too.

324
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,340
Are you going to a cosplay contest?

325
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,560
Shut up!

326
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,520
Why are you going to a cosplay contest

327
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:32,540
when the police is wearing police uniforms?

328
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,240
I'm going to arrest you!

329
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,880
Don't push yourself, Ryo-chan.

330
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,320
Why don't you wear your usual outfit?

331
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,660
Hmph.

332
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,380
Thank you very much.

333
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,420
It's the principal!

334
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,240
Huh?

335
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,760
Reiko!

336
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,220
Yes!

337
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,120
Stop!

338
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,360
Oh no, it's the police!

339
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,600
I can't run well in this skirt.

340
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,360
Damn it.

341
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,820
My legs hurt so I can't run.

342
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,720
What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

343
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,520
You're going to run away!

344
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,240
You're the one who's running!

345
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,180
That was dangerous!

346
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,740
You're not the one who's running!

347
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,340
Huh? Ryo-san?

348
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,260
I'm borrowing a bike.

349
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,260
This is the only thing I can do.

350
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,440
It's my problem!

351
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,480
Hey, Ryo-san!

352
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,400
You're still on the way out!

353
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,060
I'm sorry!

354
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,320
Ouch!

355
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,820
I thought I could run away from you, Ryo-tsu.

356
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,720
My shoes...

357
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,200
I was told I was a steel man,

358
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,600
but now my shoes are like shoes.

359
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,480
Damn it.

360
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,480
Ugh!

361
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
And the handle...

362
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,060
I can't see forward!

363
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,040
What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

364
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,500
Where's the culprit?

365
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,940
Over there...

366
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,560
You're a loser!

367
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,180
Damn it!

368
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,840
Look at this!

369
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,400
Do you know what you're doing?

370
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,860
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

371
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,700
Huh?

372
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,460
Oh, this is the police!

373
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,900
Agency have forgotten all this.

374
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,060
Anyhow, I have to fight them with this!

375
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,140
Wait up!

376
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,520
I'm still going to follow you!

377
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,340
What a fast woman!

378
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,500
Oh, no!

379
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:40,600
Oh, no!

380
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,620
Oh, no!

381
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,140
Oh, no!

382
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,420
What?

383
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,780
I can't afford to get lost in a place like that!

384
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,440
Reiko!

385
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,280
Ouch!

386
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,020
I won't let you get away!

387
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,900
Okay, me too!

388
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,440
I-I'm sorry...

389
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,800
Idiot! Where are you looking at and running?!

390
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,000
Because you came down from the sky!

391
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,720
Shut up!

392
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,320
I lost sight of you because of the ghost!

393
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,100
Hello?

394
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,060
Ryo-chan?

395
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,200
Yeah, Reiko!

396
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,900
Contact the police immediately!

397
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,360
I'll keep following you and let you know where you are!

398
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,620
Keep your phone on!

399
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,640
Okay! I'll contact you!

400
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,360
You be careful too!

401
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,060
Yeah!

402
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,480
This is Ryochi from Kameari Park!

403
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,560
I'm currently at a convenience store outside Shosen.

404
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,340
I'm chasing a gang of robbers who attacked a convenience store outside Shosen!

405
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,640
Please give me support!

406
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,920
Roger!

407
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,760
Please tell me where you are!

408
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,180
Damn it! They're still following me!

409
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,100
What? They're women!

410
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,520
I-If this is the case, they should follow me!

411
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,840
I'm going up from the ceiling!

412
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,420
I can't climb with this skirt on!

413
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,960
I don't care anymore!

414
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,940
Don't worry, I'll handle it!

415
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,400
How can you be so bl 충분ing?

416
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,920
Aren't you going to let us go?

417
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,380
I can't believe you! I'll go up!

418
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,100
What are you doing! Hurry up and follow them!!!!

419
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,740
Ryo-chan!

420
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,180
The ring processing bank is running away to the south direction!

421
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,560
I'm running away!

422
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Okay, the south side of the bridge.

423
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,020
Hey, turn left at the next corner!

424
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,660
Yes sir!

425
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,140
She's still following me!

426
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,040
What a woman!

427
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,180
It's a woman!

428
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,700
I'm saying goodbye to Fukuya-san here!

429
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,100
You're no match for her!

430
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,920
Those two jumped down!

431
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,800
They're wearing skirts, but...

432
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,160
I don't care anymore!

433
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,700
Ouch!

434
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
My legs are so sore today!

435
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,280
From that height...

436
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,740
Amazing!

437
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,920
Now, to the east side!

438
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,940
Running away from the things women are not good at...

439
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,960
That's the worst!

440
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,920
I won't lose!

441
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,400
I will never forgive...

442
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:52,840
...a man like that!

443
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,560
Argh!

444
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,060
I really got the chance to try and dive for an hour an...

445
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,340
Where's the other one?

446
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,760
Wait!

447
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,320
No wonder, Dekiru.

448
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,980
That thing like...

449
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,500
Where does that gross-looking body have all that power?

450
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,960
You were caught, Goto-san!

451
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,440
Now, get a hold of yourself and get arrested!

452
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,780
You...

453
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,100
I thought you were a woman, so I'll lick you!

454
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,400
Too bad, Mr. Innocent.

455
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,240
I thought something like this would happen, so I split you in two.

456
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,360
It's painful...

457
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,740
Hey, how long are you going to sleep?

458
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,940
I heard you, sister Nakano Girl.

459
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,260
Let me give you a lot of thanks.

460
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,100
What?

461
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,900
Ryo!

462
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,180
You did a good job!

463
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,000
You did a good job!

464
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,920
Reiko, are you okay?

465
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,340
Yeah, I think I got in a little trouble.

466
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,200
Hey, get in the car now!

467
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,020
Shut up!

468
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,720
Damn it! If Mr. Innocent wasn't here...

469
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,240
You did it, Reiko! It's a good deed!

470
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,460
Here, a towel!

471
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,340
Thanks!

472
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,980
Ryo-chan was a nice follower!

473
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,320
Huh?

474
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,400
Hey, Reiko, you!

475
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,500
Huh?

476
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,080
Look at your clothes!

477
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,600
My clothes?

478
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,740
Aren't they the same as your previous clothes?

479
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,440
Oh, but...

480
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,260
Ryo-chan is like that, too.

481
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,200
Huh? What's this?

482
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,640
What the hell?

483
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,660
I guess Reiko looks better in mini clothes.

484
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,360
Ryo-chan, you don't have to wear that kind of outfit.

485
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,780
I don't know what you're talking about!

486
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,780
I don't know what you're talking about!

487
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,920
I don't know what you're talking about!

488
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,660
I'm gonna go change my clothes.

489
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,880
Oh, Reiko-chan!

490
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,820
Good morning, old man!

491
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,860
You're back in the same uniform as before!

492
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,120
I knew it! You look really nice in one of these mini skirts.

493
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,640
True. You're a tough chilly guy.

494
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,120
He sure is, old man.

495
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,880
Goodbye then!

496
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,520
Hey!

Why are you using a candle to light a candle?
