2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,160
I'm looking at the sunset floating in the river.

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,840
When I kick the stone, it'll fly to my shoes.

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,520
I wonder if it's worth it to save money.

5
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,800
I laughed at it as it was.

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,240
I don't care how I feel.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,640
Even if I lose my temper, I'm just a little bit of a mess.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,900
The cityscape that doesn't change even a single grumbling is weirdly gentle.

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,820
I'm looking at the sunset floating in the river. I'm looking at the sunset floating in the river. I'm looking at the sunset floating in the river.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm looking at the sunset floating in the river. I'm looking at the sunset floating in the river.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,380
From the stream of the Tungari-boshi,

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,960
I'm going to Taishakuten.

13
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,240
The sunset is falling.

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,600
Tomorrow will end like this.

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,920
I realized that I was not happy with the Katsushika and Shibamata.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,520
I realized that I was not happy with the Katsushika and Shibamata.

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,240
Because I'm an idiot.

18
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,780
I realized that I was not happy with the Katsushika and Shibamata.

Honda's Last Kiss

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,400
Happy Birthday to You

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,940
Happy Birthday to You

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,100
Happy Birthday Dear Honda-chan

23
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,280
Happy Birthday Dear Honda-chan

24
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,320
Happy Birthday To You

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,260
Happy Birthday To You

26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,720
Happy Birthday Dear Honda-chan

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,280
Happy Birthday To You

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,800
Happy Birthday To You

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,460
Happy Birthday To You

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:08,640
Happy Birthday To You

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,160
Happy Birthday To You

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,920
Happy Birthday To You

33
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,840
Happy Birthday To You

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,600
Happy Birthday To You

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,580
Happy Birthday To You

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,880
Happy Birthday To You

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,480
You don't have to cry.

38
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,560
It's embarrassing to see you so moved.

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Your birthday is the 183th anniversary of our relationship.

40
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,900
Well, it's not impossible.

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,900
Mr. Honda, I feel sorry for you.

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
Who was the woman this time?

43
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,640
The lady from the convenience store.

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,980
It's about this morning.

45
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,080
You're late in one minute.

46
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,120
Mr. Honda, hurry up!

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
I understand.

48
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,640
I'm going to see Mr. Honda.

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,780
Ouch!

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,980
What's wrong?

51
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,580
Can I get one of these?

52
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,860
Don't worry, Midori.

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,580
Love rings are common sense.

54
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,280
I'm so happy.

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,220
Thank you.

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,580
I can't believe you're...

57
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,820
Midori, you idiot!

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,620
Mr. Honda, I really feel sorry for you.

59
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,900
You're so nice.

60
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,400
Why do I get dumped so much?

61
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,420
It's to get into the Guinness World Records!

62
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,660
No way!

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,900
Hey!

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,700
I can't.

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,620
It's okay.

66
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,880
I don't care what happens.

67
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,960
Senpai, stop joking around.

68
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm not joking.

69
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,640
Mr. Honda, this is a birthday gift from Kei and I.

70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,180
Please cheer up.

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,200
Okay?

72
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,460
It's a new model.

73
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,020
I'm so happy.

74
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,260
I'm glad.

75
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,240
Thank you.

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,080
Thank you.

77
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,420
I'm glad you're happy, Reiko.

78
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,360
Yeah.

79
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,340
Let's blow out the "dating" thing.

80
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,540
Dating?

81
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,220
Dating...

82
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,440
You idiot!

83
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,380
I almost forgot about it!

84
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,840
I'm sorry, Mr. Honda.

85
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,000
What I wanted to say was that I want you to find a new girlfriend.

86
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,620
Okay.

87
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,680
That's right.

88
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,020
There are so many women out there.

89
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,960
If you wear this and talk to them, you'll be Midori.

90
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,620
Midori?

91
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,920
Midori.

92
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:42,680
Midori?

93
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:42,900
Hey, you idiot!

94
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,860
Your new girlfriend is called Midori.

95
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,240
U-Um...

96
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,180
Mr. Ryo, what is this gift from all of us?

97
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,920
Oh, right.

98
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,420
We don't have as much money as you, so this won't be a big deal.

99
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,500
Is this a geisha card?

100
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,620
Our wish was for you to have a good girlfriend like this.

101
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,760
It sounds good.

102
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,520
I can see you're disappointed.

103
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,820
I know.

104
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,360
Senpai, Maria-san, thank you so much.

105
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,900
I'll put it on my bike and my helmet.

106
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,320
Thank goodness.

107
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,740
Ryo-sama, it was worth praying to God for us.

108
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,740
Yeah.

109
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,300
I also prayed to God that we could become lovers.

110
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,680
Love, love.

111
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,940
Honda, don't be depressed.

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,220
I'm the one who wants to be depressed.

113
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,720
Maria is a man.

114
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,940
I don't care if she's a man.

115
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,840
I want a cute girlfriend like Maria.

116
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,180
Look at yourself.

117
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,080
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,740
I'll introduce you to someone who will suit you.

119
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,160
I'll find a cute girl from Nakagawa Group.

120
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
Really?

121
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,940
Yes.

122
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,940
Please.

123
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,040
Please.

124
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,400
Please.

125
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,440
Please.

126
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,360
Please.

127
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,160
I'm coming, boss.

128
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,520
Honda!

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,740
You're so mean!

130
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,780
Ryo-chan, you're in a good mood.

131
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,600
Shut up.

132
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,500
You're like cloking on a person.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,240
If you change your life when you're not on the bike, even your lover can be happy.

134
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,540
Change my life?

135
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,340
Look at this apartment.

136
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,460
This, that, and that.

137
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,160
Are these men's apartments?

138
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,040
They do look like girls' apartments.

139
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,140
It's like a horror.

140
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,980
The books lined up in bookshelves are all girl's manga.

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,760
I don't think they're afraid of the devil's bookshelf.

142
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,360
Right? So first of all...

143
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,240
What are you doing, senpai?

144
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,860
Everyone throws things like this away.

145
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,400
Please stop.

146
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,020
My treasure, Aino Miko sensei's...

147
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,900
Shut up. If you say you're going to throw it away, throw it away.

148
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,680
Stop it!

149
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,460
I'm so glad.

150
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,580
Honda!

151
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,120
You did it, Honda!

152
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,660
No, senpai, it's a misunderstanding.

153
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,840
I won't listen to excuses.

154
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,060
Hey, Ryo!

155
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,960
The cake! The cake!

156
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,120
Ryo!

157
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,360
The birthday party was ruined.

158
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,560
I'm sorry, Ryo.

159
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,340
I said something unnecessary.

160
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,700
Don't apologize, Maria.

161
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,980
It's Ryo's fault.

162
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,260
Shut up!

163
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,480
You two are so mean!

164
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,940
Senpai, I'm sorry about yesterday.

165
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,100
You!

166
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,160
Father!

167
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,180
Honda, I got a list of the most suspicious people in the prefecture.

168
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,340
Do you want to see it?

169
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,940
No, I'm fine.

170
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,320
Honda, maybe your favorite girl...

171
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,380
No, I don't want to.

172
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,620
She's so sharp.

173
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,040
What a mess!

174
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,940
Have you already recovered?

175
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,300
I told you, right?

176
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,280
She gets depressed but recovers faster.

177
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,160
Now, where's the big sister?

178
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,660
I live near the prefectural university.

179
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,560
A super cute new member came into the fourth mobile unit.

180
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,640
Is it a new member, Olive?

181
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,900
Do you know her?

182
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,320
Olive?

183
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,100
She's only 35 kg.

184
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,220
It's as thin as a tree, and everyone calls it "Olive".

185
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,580
Olive, huh?

186
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,080
Yes.

187
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,660
All right, let's go!

188
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,260
Hey, Senpai!

189
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,480
You have to confess your love to Olive-chan.

190
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,520
What? Now?

191
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,160
You should put on a black and white shirt when your wound is shallow.

192
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,240
N-No way!

193
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,300
Ryo-chan is so hardworking.

194
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,940
That's how much he cares about his friends.

195
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,380
I don't want to be crushed!

196
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,980
Come with me, Hoya!

197
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,700
Wait, Senpai!

198
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,220
Olive-chan, my name is Nana Otohime.

199
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,080
You're 21 years old now?

200
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm almost 10 years old.

201
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,760
You're so thin. You look like glass.

202
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,700
That's why people call me Olive-chan.

203
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,360
Hey, you!

204
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,220
Are you talking about me?

205
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,640
You're talking so much like an anime voice.

206
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,280
You say that so often. I'm sorry.

207
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,540
You don't have to apologize.

208
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,040
I know I'm cute.

209
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,720
But I want to date you.

210
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,560
I've been thinking about the best way to date you.

211
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,200
Oh, Mr. Honda?

212
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,860
Mr. Honda from the school.

213
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
You're so handsome, Olive-chan.

214
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,260
But Mr. Honda...

215
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,120
He's the one who yells at you when you're afraid.

216
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,600
Yeah, he is.

217
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,720
You!

218
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,240
Steer the bike!

219
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,360
Do you know what I'm doing?

220
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,180
I'm going to kick your ass!

221
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,100
I'm the one who's doing it.

222
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,880
But your face...

223
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
You're usually quiet, but you change when you ride a bike.

224
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,560
Really?

225
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:56,760
Really?

226
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,580
You can't beat me with one punch.

227
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,760
He really is that instructor.

228
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,560
Think of him as Jekyll and Hyde.

229
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,120
I hope you understand.

230
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:18,940
Yes.

231
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,380
Hey, Olive.

232
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,000
Go out with him.

233
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,960
With the instructor?

234
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,280
Senior, I don't think that's good.

235
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,800
Really?

236
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,540
Olive, are you dating anyone?

237
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,540
Wait a minute...

238
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,340
No, I'm not.

239
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,280
You're perfect.

240
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,240
Go out with Honda.

241
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,240
Senior...

242
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,840
Yes.

243
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,120
Thank you.

244
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,780
Great!

245
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,440
It's a big success!

246
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,540
Senior...

247
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,500
It's not a dream, is it?

248
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,560
Can you give me a hug?

249
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,220
Good!

250
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,840
Good for you, Honda!

251
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,000
I...

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm so lucky!

253
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,360
Honda Hayato!

254
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,940
Tell me, how many times have I got to tell you this?

255
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,760
I'm not going to let you do what you did to me!

256
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,040
"Honda"

257
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,760
Oh no! It's the Honda of the late era!

258
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,420
What?

259
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,240
That's the Honda of the demon!

260
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,340
Slow down, Hayasu!

261
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,520
Mr. Honda! Chouas!

262
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,280
What are you guys doing?

263
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,160
Huh?

264
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,080
If you're a Housou, you should run faster!

265
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,620
Huh?

266
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,360
Is that okay?

267
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,920
I'll forgive you.

268
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,060
Now, run, you guys!

269
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,660
This is the time of youth!

270
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,980
Take the wind!

271
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,020
Make love!

272
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,620
Love is good!

273
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,400
Dream Shot!

274
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,120
What's going on?

275
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,360
Isn't it super bad?

276
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,280
Isn't there an earthquake?

277
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,600
What are you doing, Honda?

278
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,740
Oh, Senior.

279
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,520
I was going to throw away the comic...

280
00:12:59,420 --> 00:12:59,860
I see.

281
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,480
So, the power of love has finally changed your life.

282
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,340
As I thought, the love of girls manga is more real than the love of real love.

283
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,220
You're such a fool.

284
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,740
Okay, I'll help you, too.

285
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,000
Ah, that's not good!

286
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,860
Why?

287
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,460
The love of Miko-sensei has been a large fan since the time of Dede,

288
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,260
I want to leave it.

289
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,320
Well, that's enough.

290
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,940
That's the proof that Mr. Honda is doing well with Olive.

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,700
You're getting drunk every day.

292
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,200
Nakagawa, let's take a look inside.

293
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,020
Yeah, sure.

294
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,780
Please help me, instructor!

295
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,940
What's wrong? What are you doing here?

296
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,760
The tire got stuck in the groove and it can't move.

297
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,420
Are you a police officer?

298
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,100
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
In this case, use a suspension.

300
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,960
It's dangerous, so take a bike.

301
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,900
Yes, sir.

302
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,620
Sink the front suspension.

303
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,920
Yes, sir.

304
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,000
Use the handbrake to pull it out.

305
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,860
Yes, sir.

306
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,580
It's out.

307
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,720
If you let go, it'll break.

308
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,540
You're so beautiful, Nakagawa.

309
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,620
Sink the front suspension and pull it out.

310
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,360
You're a good couple, aren't you?

311
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:25,720
Yes, sir.

312
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,960
Finally, spring has come to Honda.

313
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,100
Turn the steering wheel and turn the steering wheel in the direction.

314
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,680
Yes, sir.

315
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,820
Thank you so much for today, instructor.

316
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,420
Thank you for your hard work.

317
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,360
You've improved a lot, Olive.

318
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,340
I'm sure it's because you're good at teaching me.

319
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,700
I like you when you're on a bike, but I also like you when you're on a bike.

320
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,240
No, it's not that.

321
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,520
Excuse me.

322
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,600
Olive!

323
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,460
Yes, sir.

324
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,480
I wonder if we can go to the movies together next Sunday.

325
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,900
Is it Sunday?

326
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,160
No, I'm fine if you have time, but I don't know.

327
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,400
I'm sorry.

328
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,140
What?

329
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,740
I'm sorry to have you invited.

330
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,660
It's okay.

331
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,640
You don't have to worry about it.

332
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,260
See you.

333
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,720
I'm sorry.

334
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,220
I'm sorry for not listening to you.

335
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,300
Thank you.

336
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,400
Chico.

337
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,340
I was supposed to see you with Olive.

338
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,020
Be quiet.

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,600
I'm sorry.

340
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,120
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:56,880
I'm sorry.

342
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,920
That's good.

343
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,800
It was pretty good.

344
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,220
Eh?

345
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,080
Senpai, you were asleep the whole time.

346
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,680
That's why it was good.

347
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,160
Ah, I feel refreshed.

348
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,380
This is it.

349
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,520
What's wrong?

350
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,760
Huh?

351
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,540
Ah...

352
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,220
Hey, that's Olive-chan.

353
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,960
No way...

354
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,060
It's common. She's your superior.

355
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,680
There's no superior as cool as her.

356
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,800
Ah, Olive-chan looks so happy.

357
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,580
Well, well, calm down.

358
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,340
It's too early to make a conclusion.

359
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,000
You can think of her as a brother.

360
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,540
She's the only child.

361
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,280
Then, maybe her father.

362
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,420
Don't mess with me.

363
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,780
Ah, ah, ah, ah, senpai.

364
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,620
We went into her house together.

365
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,700
That's common.

366
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,180
You should drink tea.

367
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,300
Common?

368
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,840
A girl...

369
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,300
Senpai, I can't see anything at all.

370
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,040
It's not tea.

371
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,460
Then, let's eat parce de nuit.

372
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,520
No way!

373
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,080
There's no trouble with early lunch.

374
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,300
Okay, okay, Senpai.

375
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,820
Senpai.

376
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,280
Eh?

377
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Ah? What time is it?

378
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,660
It's 4 a.m.

379
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,280
4 a.m.?!

380
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,000
Hahaha!

381
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,900
Thank you.

382
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,260
That was great.

383
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,500
Hehe...

384
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,320
Oh, Ryu-san won't let me sleep.

385
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,480
Hahaha, sorry, sorry.

386
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,160
See you later.

387
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,180
Be careful!

388
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,360
Sen... Senpai...

389
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,320
Is this a common thing?

390
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,260
It's common!

391
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,700
It's no wonder, isn't it?

392
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,860
I did it...

393
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,300
What?

394
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,940
Hey, Honda!

395
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,480
Hey, Honda!

396
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,200
Don't leave me behind!

397
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,320
Hey, Honda!

398
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,540
You're still young!

399
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,560
Shut up!

400
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,020
You're not a woman!

401
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,300
You're not a child!

402
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,100
You don't deserve to be a man!

403
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Shut up!

404
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,880
Get back here!

405
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,960
Get back here!

406
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,980
How dare you..

407
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,580
Shut up!

408
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,260
You!

409
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,740
W-What's wrong?

410
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,020
What's wrong?

411
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,020
You don't look like one of them.

412
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,920
It must be a misunderstanding.

413
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,920
Not like the last time...

414
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,840
That's what I wanted to say!

415
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,820
Fng!

416
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,680
H-Honda!

417
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,620
Pull yourself together!

418
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,340
Senpai...

419
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,220
I can't do this anymore.

420
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,400
I can't get my energy back on the bike.

421
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,920
What are you talking about?

422
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,520
This is just the 184th time you've been dumped!

423
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm going to get a serious injury this time.

424
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,720
I can't get better.

425
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,420
Honda-san, you're not completely dumped yet, are you?

426
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,160
That's right. It's still too early to give up.

427
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,640
Ryo-chan, I think it's better to ask him yourself

428
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:42,860
than to be in a hurry here.

429
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,740
Yeah, that's right.

430
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,260
Alright, let's go!

431
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,900
No, no, no, no, no!

432
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,780
What?

433
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,320
Did you see where he went home this morning?

434
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm sorry to interrupt your private life,

435
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,180
but I really want to hear it from him.

436
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,460
Senpai, you're talking too much.

437
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,440
Shut up!

438
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,740
He's...

439
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,020
He's...

440
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,000
He's very important to me.

441
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,040
Since when...

442
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,820
Since when did you meet him?

443
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,820
Since I was in junior high school.

444
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,000
What?

445
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,240
Since junior high school?

446
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,460
That's a little too early, isn't it?

447
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,940
It's normal.

448
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,580
Everyone's been doing it since junior high school or high school.

449
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,780
Th-That's too early for a kid like you.

450
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,320
I've been dating three people,

451
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,720
but I can't forget the first one.

452
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,280
Don't make such a cute face.

453
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,820
Have you been with him ever since?

454
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,140
I met him once.

455
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,960
That's right.

456
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
Honda...

457
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,060
I don't think I've ever seen a girl like you.

458
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,240
That was brilliant.

459
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,080
Let's have a drink tonight.

460
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,320
Y-Yes...

461
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,180
Thank you for the great memories.

462
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,900
I'm sorry to get you involved.

463
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,080
Goodbye.

464
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:09,940
What?

465
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,080
That's not...

466
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,600
Please wait!

467
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,440
That's enough!

468
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,800
Stop it! It's not fair to say something so kind!

469
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,260
B-but, I really like you, Honda-san.

470
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,760
Are you trying to get your ass kicked?

471
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,020
Senpai!

472
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,780
What are you talking about?

473
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,020
This is what a woman is!

474
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,500
Ryo, that's enough.

475
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,060
Come on, let's go.

476
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,580
Wait! I'll tell you the truth!

477
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,740
Is there still something you want to say?

478
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,260
I'm sorry.

479
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,440
I'm actually a manga artist!

480
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,480
What?

481
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,500
A manga artist?

482
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,260
Yes. My pen name is Aino Miko.

483
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,180
Aino Miko? I've heard that name somewhere.

484
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,360
A famous girl manga artist!

485
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:00,860
Oh!

486
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,200
So you're a huge manga fan!

487
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,360
W-well, then...

488
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,380
Olive-chan?

489
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,360
Yes, Honda-san!

490
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,920
Olive-chan!

491
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,640
Are you really Aino-sensei?

492
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,020
I thought you were older!

493
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,960
I've been drawing since I was in junior high school.

494
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,060
W-was that what you were saying earlier?

495
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,360
Yes. I made my professional debut in junior high school.

496
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,040
Then,

497
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,420
I met a first-time manga artist.

498
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,040
I'm a manga artist.

499
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,960
I'm a manga artist who's been in charge of my debut for a long time.

500
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,780
I'm a manga artist who's been in charge of my debut for a long time.

501
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,120
That beautiful man is not your lover, but the editor in charge, isn't he?

502
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,460
Yes. He's always locked in his room during work.

503
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,060
So he takes me to various places to broaden my horizons.

504
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,560
You said you wouldn't let me sleep last night.

505
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,720
That's...

506
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,920
That's because I sent you my name, and the manuscript is about to fall.

507
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,020
That's because I sent you my name, and the manuscript is about to fall.

508
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,580
That's because I sent you my name, and the manuscript is about to fall.

509
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,520
I'm sorry.

510
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:04,640
What's with that?

511
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,540
We seem to have made a big mistake!

512
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,960
I'm so glad, Honda!

513
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:09,960
I'm so glad, Honda!

514
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,540
But you should have told me from the start!

515
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,460
This is the first time I've ever been to a studio.

516
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,540
If you tell me, you'll be fired.

517
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,540
It's okay! I'll keep it a secret.

518
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,020
It's okay! I'll keep it a secret.

519
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,320
Excuse me.

520
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,280
Um, would you like to come to my studio?

521
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:27,820
Um, would you like to come to my studio?

522
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,500
W-what?

523
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,300
W-what?

524
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,500
Go ahead, Honda!

525
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,520
W-what?

526
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,800
What about the others?

527
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,460
I'm not sure.

528
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,400
We're not that stupid.

529
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,200
Well, we've gone!

530
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,500
Well, we've gone!

531
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,940
Well, we've gone!

532
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,340
I'm so glad, Ryo-sama.

533
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:44,780
I'm so glad, Ryo-sama.

534
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,980
Well, we should go and have a fish-suit.

535
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,660
Well, we should go and have a fish-suit.

536
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,180
Well, we should go and have a fish-suit.

537
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,860
Let's go! Let's go!

538
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,600
Let's go! Let's go!

539
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,160
Boss, why can't I get a bonus on Sakonji?

540
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,900
Boss, why can't I get a bonus on Sakonji?

541
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,200
I did give Sakonji anFun

542
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,900
I don't have anything to do with him!

543
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,200
On next episode: "A Doll's Princess"

544
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,020
Please look forward to it!

545
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,960
It's rumored that I'm a woman who can't fall in love

546
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,080
But I have a lot of things I want to do

547
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:49,440
I want to run across the vast desert on a motorcycle

548
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,840
I want to be free more than a bird

549
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,980
I want to run across the vast desert on a motorcycle

550
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:12,820
I want to be free more than a bird

551
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,660
I want to be free more than a bird

552
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,440
I want to be free more than a bird

553
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,160
I want to be free more than a bird
