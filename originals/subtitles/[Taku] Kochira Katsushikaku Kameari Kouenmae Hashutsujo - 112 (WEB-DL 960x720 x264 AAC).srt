and drink!

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,260
That's it for today!

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,640
Is Keisha hanging out with us?

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,460

Phew, I'm glad the wedding is over.

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,960
Yes, this is Nakagawa.

37
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,260
Yes, this is Keiichi.

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,340
Eh? Nakagawa group emergency meeting?

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,260
Keiichi, what is this about?

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,960
I don't know either.

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,640
But my father, who was supposed to return in 10 years, is coming back.

42
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,940
Something serious may have happened.

43
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,440
It's about time. Is President Ryuichiro really coming?

44
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,600
Oh!

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,240
Father!

46
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,580
Oh!

47
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,860
It's just as planned.

48
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,800
President, it's been a while!

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,080
You're wasting your time!

50
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,600
I told you to stop greeting me!

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,300
But there's another reason why I was invited today.

52
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,340
Actually...

53
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,000
What's the point of ringing your phone during a meeting?

54
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,080
Turn off the power within 3 seconds!

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,860
Good.

56
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,080
Huh?

57
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,820
Who is it? Who hasn't turned off the power yet?

58
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,640
It's me. It's time to refill the nutrition drink.

59
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,480
Wait 15 seconds.

60
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,650
Wait 15 seconds.

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,220
It's here!

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,800
It's here!

63
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:07,100
Well, actually, yesterday,

64
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,980
a large project was submitted by the Japanese-American Commission in New York,

65
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,060
but

66
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,480
Nakagawa Group, who had never lost a single time before,

67
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,740
lost to Ibishi Group, its rival.

68
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,500
Moreover, the difference in the import and sales amount with Ibishi Group is $1,000.

69
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,320
It's a $100,000-dollar super-big business,

70
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,640
and the difference is only $1,000.

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,560
Do you understand what this means?

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,280
I-I can't believe our import and sales amount is being transferred to Ibishi Group!

73
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,300
That's right.

74
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,300
The ones in charge of the import and sales are the ones gathered here.

75
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,460
In other words, our job in Ibishi Group is to

76
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,960
transfer the information to the Japanese-American Commission.

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,340
You have to find the traitor!

78
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,100
N-No, I'm not!

79
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,660
You're suspicious because you're an Akashi!

80
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,420
We're the ones who have taken advantage of him!

81
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,140
A-Everyone, please calm down!

82
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,940
Shut up!

83
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,240
Now that a crack has entered the Ichimaiwa Nakagawa Group,

84
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,440
I'm going to find the traitor thoroughly!

85
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,200
That's all I'm going to do until I stay in Japan!

86
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,400
Father...

87
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,140
Good morning.

88
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,080
Good morning, Mr. President!

89
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,160
Nakagawa.

90
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,460
Ah, yes. What's wrong, President?

91
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,040
Huh? Mr. Nakagawa, your face doesn't look good.

92
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,760
Well, Ryozu messed up yesterday's wedding.

93
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,320
Oh, no, no! The senior took care of the wedding well, and it was very exciting!

94
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,820
Oh, I can't believe it!

95
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,060
It was hard to get drunk in the end, though.

96
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,820
I thought so.

97
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,260
Good morning, everyone!

98
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,080
Good morning, Mr. Ryo!

99
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,100
You can't help it if you make a rumor.

100
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,440
Well, yesterday's wedding was very exciting.

101
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,040
Y-Yes, Senior.

102
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,420
Well, you can't call me "Senior" for the sake of others.

103
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,360
That's right! Mr. Ryo became a good friend with Ms. Nakagawa!

104
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,140
Oh!

105
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:05,800
Oh!

106
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:13,780
The wife of my brother Kinjirou is my younger aunt's younger cousin's unmarried wife's second young man's younger brother's daughter's daughter's wife's younger brother's young man's second young lady's younger brother's daughter's younger brother's younger mom's younger daughter's younger brother's younger brother's younger brother's younger brother's younger brother's older wife's younger sister's younger brother's younger brother's younger brother's younger brother's younger daughter's younger brother's younger brother's younger brother's younger brother's younger brother's younger daughter's younger brother's younger.

107
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,520
Ah...

108
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,560
That means Nakagawa and I are gia Arbeit.

109
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,340
In other words, we're going to be family in marriage.

110
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,540
You can't explain the distance yourself.

111
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm not far away from your family.

112
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:31,620
Well, Kao, from here, I'm going to call you Kei-chan.

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,080
What?!

114
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,860
Kei-chan, call me Nii-san from now on.

115
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh...

116
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,280
Ryotsu, you're not Nakagawa's brother, so you should call me Nii-san.

117
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,600
Chief, don't talk about your family.

118
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,660
Then let's do this. Call me Mr. Neighbor.

119
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,140
Mr. Neighbor?

120
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,400
Kei-chan, if you have any problems or problems, you can talk to me.

121
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,240
Hahaha!

122
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,940
Nakagawa seems to have a problem with his family.

123
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,060
Yes.

124
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,980
What's that?

125
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,280
It's a book about Nakagawa Group.

126
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,480
What's wrong?

127
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,400
We need to know more about Nakagawa Group, as a relative.

128
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,520
So as a relative, I put together the main points of the group.

129
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,440
That's...

130
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,600
He's really good at this.

131
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,540
Because he's Ryo-sama.

132
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,560
Railways, drugs, cars, and communications are growing well, but the problem is that 163 subsidiaries of real estate and securities, etc.

133
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,860
This is bad.

134
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,600
The business profit is down last year.

135
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,600
I don't know that either.

136
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,460
You can't just leave this as a relative.

137
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,500
No, I don't mind leaving it.

138
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,900
I'll get into the company and put in the money.

139
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:50,820
What?

140
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,560
I've saved several companies in the north town. Leave it to me.

141
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,460
But...

142
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,180
If I go to the company suddenly...

143
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,180
Don't worry.

144
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,020
I've made a name for it.

145
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,000
A relative?

146
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,420
You can tell by looking at this.

147
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,060
Even this?

148
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,080
Ryo-sama is amazing!

149
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,760
Right?

150
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,260
Nakagawa, wait.

151
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:12,980
Yes?

152
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,260
If you don't stimulate him, you'll have to destroy the company.

153
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,440
You should do as he says.

154
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,520
But...

155
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,760
You have to trick him into giving you a job that he can't do.

156
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,320
I see.

157
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,340
That's safer, isn't it?

158
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,700
Senpai, I've found a job I want you to do.

159
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,820
What company is it?

160
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,820
It's a company in Kachidoki.

161
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,740
Kachidoki?

162
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,680
I'm good at waiting.

163
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,940
Nakagawa, I'll do my best.

164
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,760
As a relative.

165
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,840
Y-yes.

166
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,220
You're Ryo-tsu Kankitsu, aren't you?

167
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,200
I heard from Keiichi-bocchan.

168
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,720
I'm the president, Kurokawa.

169
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,200
Nice to meet you.

170
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,120
Me too.

171
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,040
And my job is...

172
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,540
I can't do anything without you.

173
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,200
Yes, I'm a Superguard Storekeeper.

174
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,700
Superguard Storekeeper?

175
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,960
That sounds like a cool job.

176
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,460
Damn it!

177
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,960
What do you mean by Superguard Storekeeper?

178
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,920
Isn't it just a joke?

179
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,900
Nakagawa, you're trying to trick me.

180
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,360
If you want to do it, I have a plan.

181
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,120
What? You want to do business?

182
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,860
But...

183
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,210
Look at this.

184
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,720
A relative?

185
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,300
A relative of Nakagawa Group?

186
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,120
Keiichi-bocchan's just a senior.

187
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
I'm Nakagawa's great relative.

188
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,320
I want to rebuild this Akaji Company,

189
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,900
which is said to be in Nakagawa Group's luggage.

190
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,620
As a relative.

191
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,540
But Keiichi-bocchan...

192
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,000
Shut up! Are you still the president?

193
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,240
Please give me some strength.

194
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,000
I want to make this company the first company of Nakagawa Group.

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,420
I want to make this company the first company of Nakagawa Group.

196
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,120
Will you help me?

197
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,120
Yes.

198
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,280
All right.

199
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,240
If you do, I'll start with improving the luggage department.

200
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,040
First, I'll change the company name.

201
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,120
What?

202
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Nakagawa Wing's Luggage Storage is a lame name.

203
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,440
Oh, right.

204
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,540
Let's make it a luggage container with a connecting eyebrow.

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,560
Hehehe.

206
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,520
All right, Kurokawa.

207
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,220
Let's get started.

208
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,200
Where is it?

209
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,300
Huh?

210
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,920
A relative of Nakagawa Group?

211
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,600
That's right.

212
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,980
Let me show you the evidence.

213
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,380
Kurokawa.

214
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,340
Yes.

215
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,220
Hmm?

216
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,940
Here! Here!

217
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,720
It must have a name, right?

218
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,900
I-I got it. I got it.

219
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,700
So, what kind of a relative do you want?

220
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,300
Hmm.

221
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,880
The president doesn't know the power of his relatives.

222
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,160
Hmm?

223
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,880
A farmer's company can't be run by the president alone.

224
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,300
The relatives are against it, and sometimes they can't make a decision.

225
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,860
I'm the one who takes care of all the relatives.

226
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,220
In other words, I'm the best in the shadows.

227
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,320
If I say I'm Kuro, the relatives will always be Kuro.

228
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,520
In other words, if you make me angry...

229
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,720
If you make me angry...

230
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,320
I'm scared.

231
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,040
Huh?

232
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,600
Huh?

233
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,260
Really?

234
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,300
Yes.

235
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,200
What are you hiding?

236
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,120
I'm having a meal with President Ryuichiro Nakagawa when he comes back.

237
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,860
You're kidding, right?

238
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,340
I've never had a meal with President Ryuichiro.

239
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,900
It's not a lie.

240
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,700
When President Ryuichiro came back half a year ago,

241
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,880
we ate standing soba for 15 minutes side by side.

242
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh.

243
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,340
President Ryuichiro is certainly busy, but he's very busy in Japan.

244
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,440
I heard he can't eat.

245
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,980
And he's been with me for 15 minutes.

246
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,040
That's how much I'm trusted by President Ryuichiro.

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,320
In other words, I want you to listen to me as President Ryuichiro.

248
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,660
I understand.

249
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,320
Please don't hesitate to say anything.

250
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,640
My relative's uncle.

251
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,320
Ah, I see.

252
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,380
Then, I will consult you about the delivery of the delivery ticket.

253
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,620
By all means.

254
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:18,860
Yes.

255
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,740
I think I can use this idiot.

256
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,180
Eh?

257
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,040
The profit of Nakagawa Omuyu Delivery Warehouse is rising?

258
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,420
Yes.

259
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,720
After changing the name of the delivery ticket of Tsunagari Mayuge,

260
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,240
we increased the turnover of the delivery service.

261
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,820
Finally, we reached 300,000 places and became the top of the industry.

262
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,120
It's my senior's doing.

263
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,620
You imported 100 million tons of grain from overseas?

264
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,780
Yes.

265
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,480
It seems that we have all the profits.

266
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,700
The L2 phenomenon is also declining.

267
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,500
It is dangerous to get into the grain from now on.

268
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,380
You may be President Kurokawa, but I wonder what your senior will say.

269
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,800
The warehouse is full of 100 million tons of wheat.

270
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:17,940
I'm sorry to say this, but the president is not in charge of our company, but the president.

271
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,020
The president?

272
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,820
Yes.

273
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,340
He is Ryotsu, a relative of the Nakagawa Group.

274
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:23,840
Eh?

275
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,360
The senior is the president?

276
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,820
Mr. Kurokawa.

277
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,360
Oh, this is the president.

278
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,560
Oh, I see that you're here too.

279
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,740
Perfect.

280
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,240
Look at this.

281
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,040
The price of wheat and corn is rising rapidly between Europe and Russia!

282
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,180
It's skyrocketing to the double price I bought.

283
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,260
Even if you look closely, it's a profit of 30 billion yen.

284
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:45,980
Hahaha.

285
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,380
Hahaha.

286
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,880
Damn it.

287
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,380
I was going to give Nakagawa Group a big blow.

288
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,700
Well, that's how it goes.

289
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,440
I was really surprised by the strength of your bad luck.

290
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,840
But I thought Kurokawa was an unbeatable man even if he hit the stone bridge, so I made him the president of the freight company.

291
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,960
He has changed, too.

292
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Everyone is doing it for the sake of the senior.

293
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,000
It's all because of President Kurokawa.

294
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,020
Then...

295
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,320
Keiichi, I'm going to leave the company for a while.

296
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,880
Eh?

297
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,380
I'll leave the rest to you.

298
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,640
Ah...

299
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,800
Hm?

300
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,120
Oh, it's time to refill the nutrition drink.

301
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,000
Hm?

302
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,720
Hm?

303
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,620
Ah, no.

304
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,700
I've got the usual habit.

305
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,260
This way.

306
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:44,600
Ah!

307
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,060
Hey!

308
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,840
Ah!

309
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,600
I-it's over.

310
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,680
What?

311
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,200
You're quite an overbearing guy.

312
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,500
Nakayama-kun has been working for me since today.

313
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,760
Y-yes.

314
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,800
Nakayama, huh?

315
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,980
I feel like I've met him before.

316
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,920
I-it's our first time meeting.

317
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,640
I see.

318
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,240
You look like someone.

319
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,240
I remember.

320
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,500
Uh...

321
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,640
Yes.

322
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,460
Damn it!

323
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:12,940
He found out!

324
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,660
That mustache is cool.

325
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,040
I look like I'm going to grow fast.

326
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,800
Mustache?

327
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,820
Kurokawa, go buy some at Kappa Pashi tomorrow.

328
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,700
Yes, sir.

329
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,760
Ah, this sound...

330
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,040
Oh, it's time to refill the nutrition drink.

331
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:26,760
Eh?

332
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,820
Ah...

333
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,160
Ah...

334
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,740
Ah...

335
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:38,960
Ah...

336
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,600
Ah...

337
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,540
Ah...

338
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:40,680
Ah...

339
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,020
Ah...

340
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,200
Ah...

341
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,460
Ah...

342
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,520
Ah...

343
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,480
Ah...

344
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,060
E3

345
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,740
P4

346
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,440
Y3

347
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:46,840
Y3

348
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,620
Ah

349
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,940
Y3

350
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,780
There went J10.

351
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,260
What wrong with that face?

352
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:54,880
Huh?

353
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,680
Is it often in conflict of affection?

354
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,080
I-It's not!

355
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,880
As expected of a chairman,

356
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,540
everyone thinks you are different.

357
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,060
I see.

358
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:03,960
I see.

359
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,600
You're a pretty good guy.

360
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,440
It's a waste of time to leave you as garbage.

361
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,860
No, no.

362
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,900
I liked it.

363
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,920
Nakayama!

364
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,040
You do my driver.

365
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,240
Eh?

366
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:13,780
Yes.

367
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,160
Yes.

368
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,880
This is a good opportunity.

369
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,780
President Ryozu.

370
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,660
What?

371
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,560
The president has earned 3 billion yen with wheat.

372
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,600
How about investing it in a stock market?

373
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,260
Sounds good. I'm in the best position right now.

374
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,760
Do you have any good stocks?

375
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,360
How about a tilt policy?

376
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,580
Right now, I'm not sure, but I'm sure it will go up.

377
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,760
I have information that it will go up.

378
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,480
The tilt policy is a company that is about to go bankrupt.

379
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,240
What do you intend to do, Kurokawa?

380
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,300
All right. I'll buy all of the shares with 3 billion.

381
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,740
What are you doing?

382
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
I'm sorry.

383
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,620
But I don't know how to invest all 3 billion.

384
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,560
Do you want to talk to the president?

385
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,040
Yes.

386
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,100
I understand, president.

387
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,140
I will contact the stock market company immediately.

388
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,800
I'll buy all the shares with 3 billion.

389
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,060
I'm counting on you.

390
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,260
This time, I'm going to close the company.

391
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:16,960
What?

392
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,280
The tilt policy is developing a special drug for water?

393
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,300
I can't stop laughing.

394
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,640
This is all thanks to Kurokawa's advice.

395
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,100
Kurokawa seems to have completely missed the target.

396
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,700
But Ryozu's bad luck is also considerable.

397
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,280
What?

398
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,460
Ryozu earned more than 10 billion yen in stock.

399
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,760
That's a terrible bad luck.

400
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,680
He made Nakagawa Group, the top profit company, grow in just one month and a half.

401
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,860
That's amazing.

402
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,980
Ryo is amazing.

403
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,500
No. This is the usual pattern of Ryozu.

404
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,860
At first, everything will go well.

405
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,780
But at the end, there will be a big loss.

406
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,680
Nakagawa, you should do it quickly.

407
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:07,760
Yes.

408
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,520
I thought so too, but it's too late.

409
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,260
I've already earned 10 billion yen and went to the United States for a talk.

410
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,600
But I can't get through the translation.

411
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,380
I have to make more and more contracts and import everything from the United States.

412
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,360
He can't speak English, can he?

413
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,840
He seems to be making a contract without saying "yes" or "no".

414
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,300
If it's Ryozu's determination, he seems to be able to make a contract with aliens.

415
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,360
It's not that much of a determination.

416
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,680
Thanks to him, the company's warehouse is full of junk.

417
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,980
He's stuck in the process of processing junk that can't be put in.

418
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,800
Finally, the white ant has begun to bite the pillar.

419
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,800
Drive for an hour.

420
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,220
Yes.

421
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,620
Ryozu will return from the United States tomorrow.

422
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,540
What does he want to do in Narita?

423
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,380
What does he want to do in Narita?

424
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,000
That's...

425
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,740
Isn't he the president of Ibishi物産?

426
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,680
The black ant finally has its tail.

427
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,720
President Ryozu, you should be back tomorrow.

428
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,300
Get your work done quickly.

429
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,640
What are you doing in a place like this?

430
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,460
No, nothing.

431
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,160
That's a camera, right?

432
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,640
Yes. I like photography.

433
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,260
I like photography, so I took a chance.

434
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,460
That's right. Then take me.

435
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,780
I wanted a portrait to hang in the president's room.

436
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,080
That's right, President. That's convenient.

437
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,100
No, it's a good idea.

438
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:47,960
Then here.

439
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:48,780
Here, here.

440
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,260
Yes, President. It's cool.

441
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,200
President, a little more to the right.

442
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:55,920
Like this?

443
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,320
Yes, it's okay.

444
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,020
It's perfect, President.

445
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,360
President, is that so?

446
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,600
It's perfect, isn't it?

447
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,760
After the 100,000 American cars, there's a tea mushroom in Nata and Coco.

448
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,840
Senior, you should stop investing in dangerous things.

449
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,300
What are you talking about?

450
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,440
The world is turning its axis around me.

451
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,760
But...

452
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,480
What? I'll double the Nakagawa Group.

453
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,620
I'll be a power.

454
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,180
As a relative.

455
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,780
To get a big blow to the Nakagawa Group.

456
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,620
To get a big blow to the Nakagawa Group.

457
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,880
To get a big blow to the Nakagawa Group.

458
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,300
And then...

459
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,580
President!

460
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,400
I-I knew it was dangerous to sell dangerous things.

461
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,380
Idiot!

462
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,520
There are advantages because no one else does it.

463
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,960
24 hours of business without working all year round...

464
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,300
What are you saying?

465
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,700
That's why I'm installing full automation equipment.

466
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,060
The advantage of the machine is that it works without rest.

467
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,080
But there's no time for maintenance.

468
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,240
If something happens to the machine, it'll be a big deal.

469
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,660
Don't worry. I'll take a good look at it.

470
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,080
I brought a fire.

471
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,920
It'll be a big deal if there's a fire.

472
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,840
Turn off the fire quickly.

473
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,320
It's too late, President.

474
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,120
Let's run away.

475
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:24,680
What?

476
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,620
I've earned 100 billion yen.

477
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,180
I've earned 100 billion yen.

478
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,560
I've earned 100 billion yen.

479
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,560
I've earned 100 billion yen.

480
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:42,760
You did it again.

481
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,780
What's going to happen to Ryo?

482
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,480
It's such a big loss.

483
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,640
Of course, the Nakagawa Group will be released.

484
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,360
It's a serious cause of injury.

485
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,420
Stop it.

486
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,420
Stop it.

487
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,940
Hey, Kanzaki!

488
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,780
Shou, just sit down.

489
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,360
I'll wait until you get to the president's desk.

490
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,500
But regarding this case, the blame doesn't matter.

491
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,400
But the накagawa group's name...

492
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,000
More importantly, a traitor found out thanks to you.

493
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,340
What?

494
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,840
Who are you?

495
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,960
The traitor is...

496
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,440
him!

497
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,780
It's him!

498
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,160
Huh?

499
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,700
Satsuo, stop making bad jokes!

500
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,720
What's the basis for that?

501
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,200
Here's the basis!

502
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,160
Huh? What's that?

503
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,900
Kurokawa went back to the Ibishi group

504
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,300
and organized the next major incident.

505
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,260
It's a mess!

506
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,500
Are you still going to cut the shira!?

507
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,600
Hey! Driver!

508
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,560
Damn it...

509
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:51,700
What?

510
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,700
Kurokawa!

511
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,120
The headquarters and the special dispatch are both here!

512
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,540
The cannon is being sent out.

513
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,780
Do you want to come with us?

514
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,880
This is a piece of cake!

515
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,380
Wow, you saved me, Ryu-chan!

516
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,680
Ryu-chan?

517
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,980
I look forward to working with you as my relative.

518
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,300
Relative?

519
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,360
I've never heard of that.

520
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,020
Huh? You weren't his relative?

521
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,240
What did you say?

522
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,340
No, I mean,

523
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,420
my brother's...

524
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,320
My brother's wife is the son of the sister of the old woman in Nakagawa's...

525
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,440
Huh? Time's up.

526
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:26,720
Ah!

527
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,940
Well then, we'll meet again in ten years!

528
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,000
Farewell!

529
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,140
Dad!

530
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,800
Take care!

531
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,800
Kei-chan.

532
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,260
Hm?

533
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,420
As your relative, would you introduce me to someone?

534
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,360
As long as my father doesn't recognize me as a relative, that's a little...

535
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,840
Kei-chan!

536
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,520
That's a sure thing to do...

537
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,500
Hey, wait.

538
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,880
Don't run away, everyone!

539
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,360
You're my relative, aren't you?!

540
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,880
I know you're cold, but as a relative, you're econesic...!

541
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,200
In Ag cottage

542
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:11,280
In Ak cottage

543
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,440
Woah...

544
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,240
Surprised.

545
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:16,740
No.

546
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,440
