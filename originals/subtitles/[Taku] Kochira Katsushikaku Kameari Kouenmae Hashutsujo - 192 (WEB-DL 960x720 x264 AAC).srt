1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,080
Excuse me.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,220
Yes.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,580
Excuse me, where is Kameari station?

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,240
Ah, go straight on this road to the left and you will get to the station.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,280
Is that so? Thank you very much.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,140
Excuse me, I have a question. Could it be Tendou Yoshimi?

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,460
No, it's not. I've heard that we look a lot alike.

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,720
Ah, is that so?

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:40,500
When you watch TV, make your room bright and look away.

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,620
Come to me, you poor thing.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,440
I don't have money, but I'll buy you a drink.

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,840
I'm worried about you.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,820
Look at the blue sky.

14
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,980
White clouds.

15
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,080
I'm sure things will be alright.

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,380
Ahahahaha!

Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

39
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,480
So, we begin!

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,080

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,820
What the?

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,600
Why did they come to my house?

62
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,800
The judge of the Ryotsukanchichi Police Department has decided to take the seat of the ginseng office!

63
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,260
Oh my god! Oh my god! Ohara-kun!

64
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,020
It's like a dream, Chief!

65
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,280
Me too, Ohara-kun!

66
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,640
C-Chief!

67
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,200
Ohara-kun!

68
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:05,820
Chief!

69
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,480
Huh? Ryo-chan is the one who's transferred?

70
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,020
That's right.

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,360
He's the best police officer in the country.

72
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,340
The number of death sentences is astronomical, and the Katsushika office has always been left to us.

73
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,120
The decision was made this time because it was decided that only the Katsushika office would be held responsible for that.

74
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,300
Even so, the president of the ginseng office has accepted the senior's acceptance.

75
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,360
He's got the courage.

76
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,720
Well, that's...

77
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,900
How should I put it?

78
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,420
Well, I don't mind the small things.

79
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,740
Anyway, I'm happy.

80
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,200
If I think about it, I'll become his superior and go soon.

81
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,760
Blood pressure rises, my heart weakens, and I become an evil demon.

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,140
I've been through all the hardships of life.

83
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,460
I won't be exhausted today.

84
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,920
The long winter for me is over, and spring is coming at last.

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,940
The president is also very happy.

86
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,180
He's going to give all the employees a special bonus to celebrate the release of Ryo-chan.

87
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,880
Ryo-chan is so pitiful.

88
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,940
If you talk about it, Ryo-chan will come.

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,880
What's with Ryo-chan's outfit?

90
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,720
It's terrible.

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,320
Ryo-chan was kicked out, too.

92
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,380
It's terrible.

93
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,800
Where does he live?

94
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,160
It seems that he will stay in the guesthouse of the post office for the time being.

95
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,020
Oh?

96
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,220
Oh, isn't that Mr. Ryo-chan?

97
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,680
Mr. Ryo-chan?

98
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,620
From today on, you are neither my secretary nor my subordinate.

99
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,940
Of course, it's polite to call me by my last name.

100
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,340
Oh, and Mr. Ryo-chan.

101
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,740
Don't call me even if you happen to be in town.

102
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,380
I understand.

103
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,000
You look happy.

104
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,780
I will not be scolded by you anymore.

105
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,820
What?

106
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,520
I don't want to be scolded.

107
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,220
It's not that.

108
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,320
It's because you are the one who is bad.

109
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,820
What will happen again?

110
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,380
Generally, the leader is like this.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,220
That's why I'm not a superior anymore.

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,100
I'm no longer with you.

113
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,560
I have a guest.

114
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,040
If you need anything, consult a new superior.

115
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,040
Goodbye.

116
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,060
Senpai.

117
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,780
Ryo-chan.

118
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Nakagawa.

119
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,500
Reiko.

120
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,500
Live in a taxi.

121
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,820
No.

122
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,440
Senpai.

123
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,100
How are you?

124
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,740
Show me your face sometimes, Ryo-chan.

125
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,740
Damn it.

126
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,960
If I don't leave the station before the park,

127
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,180
this show will have to change the title.

128
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,300
Do you understand?

129
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,640
He left without a word.

130
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,900
Senpai.

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,720
Did you come here to say something?

132
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,380
By the way, Ryo-chan.

133
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,320
Where will you be assigned to the station in Ginza?

134
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,600
I think it's the station in front of Kabukiza in East Ginza.

135
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,380
There is Ginza.

136
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,480
Ginza is surely there.

137
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,140
A new place is approaching.

138
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:08,860
Bus stop.

139
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,100
Welcome to our city.

140
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,060
You're doing well.

141
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,180
You rushed from a down town to downtown Tokyo.

142
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,100
Geez, they look different.

143
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,860
Besides, enemy at Kabukiza is your grandma.

144
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,200
Ouch!

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,760
Sorry.

146
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,080
Who are you?

147
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,140
What is it?

148
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,960
The Tachibana family has been lost somewhere.

149
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,120
The Tachibana family?

150
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,940
Oh, you came to see the Kabukiza.

151
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,640
You said you lost everyone.

152
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,580
You must have been lost.

153
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,360
It doesn't matter.

154
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,780
Look for them.

155
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:52,880
Okay.

156
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,400
I got it.

157
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,040
No matter how close you are to the Kabukiza,

158
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,460
you always see the same old woman on the right or left.

159
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,680
Don't you remember what kind of old woman you were with?

160
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,140
I don't remember at all.

161
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,120
The Tachibana family, the Tachibana family, the Tachibana family...

162
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,040
Oh, my.

163
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:21,780
What?

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,300
The old woman is gone.

165
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,920
Hey, where is the old woman now?

166
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,320
Damn it.

167
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,380
Everyone looks the same.

168
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,020
Hey, where are you?

169
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,600
Oh, there she is.

170
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,420
Hey, don't get lost again.

171
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,200
There are too many people.

172
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,900
I'm dizzy.

173
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,580
This is faster.

174
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,180
Hey, everyone.

175
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,580
I don't know this old woman.

176
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,780
Tachibana Kaido.

177
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,240
I'm the old woman.

178
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,960
Oh, there she is.

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,520
It's Kante.

180
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,960
This way.

181
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,380
Thank you, Mr. Monster.

182
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,340
You saved me.

183
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,760
It's okay.

184
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,720
Don't get lost anymore.

185
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,380
Oh, no.

186
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,380
I was swallowed by the old woman's waves.

187
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,080
The old woman's power is tremendous.

188
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,400
I'm going to live a long life.

189
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,920
Excuse me.

190
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,600
Oh.

191
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:20,820
What?

192
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,560
I got the old woman.

193
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,280
This time she's a foreigner.

194
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,880
Would you tell me where the department store is?

195
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,180
No way.

196
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,300
You don't understand English at all.

197
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,060
If you come to Japan, you'll be able to speak Japanese.

198
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,000
What's wrong?

199
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,340
I'm sick of it.

200
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,100
I'm getting sick of it.

201
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,780
You're just talking about things you don't understand.

202
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,620
May I help you?

203
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,700
I want to go to the department store.

204
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,240
Yes.

205
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,320
Keep going straight.

206
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,060
You can find the right side.

207
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,720
Thank you.

208
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,340
Yamashita, you're so good at English.

209
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm learning it after work every day.

210
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,440
This is the plan of the class president.

211
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,040
What?

212
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,180
You're here at an unexpected place.

213
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,240
Ryotsu!

214
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,280
Yes, class president!

215
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,560
The Showa Street traffic light in the 7th street of Ginza has broken.

216
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,720
Please go and organize the traffic immediately.

217
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,900
Yes, sir.

218
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,100
I've never done this before.

219
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,580
Well, this is how...

220
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,500
This is how it was.

221
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,000
No, no, no.

222
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,180
Well, this is how...

223
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,000
Idiot! What are you doing?

224
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:40,860
What?

225
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,680
You're the one who did it.

226
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,300
You're the one who did it.

227
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,860
Then my life is in danger.

228
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,700
Wait a minute.

229
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,740
I'll call for backup.

230
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,880
It's finally noon.

231
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,300
I feel three times longer than usual.

232
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,780
I'm hungry.

233
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,080
Welcome.

234
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,400
Ten-don.

235
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,540
Yes, sir.

236
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:10,920
Ten-don!

237
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,920
I can eat whenever I want.

238
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,700
I'll call for backup.

239
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,940
Yes, I will.

240
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,640
I'll start the meeting.

241
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,480
Please come back to the exit immediately.

242
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,520
But I can't finish it yet.

243
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,200
I don't have time.

244
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,800
Come here!

245
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,540
Yes, sir.

246
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,340
I'm sorry.

247
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,440
I'm sorry.

249
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,420
I'm sorry.

250
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,660
I'm sorry.

251
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,360
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:38,880
I'm sorry.

253
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,240
I'm sorry.

254
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,500
I'm sorry.

255
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,300
I'm sorry.

256
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,360
I'm sorry.

257
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm sorry.

258
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:46,900
I'm sorry.

259
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,060
I'm sorry.

260
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm sorry.

261
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,440
I was right.

262
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,520
Benz and six-point didn't get off board.

263
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,420
I can't get off the bus with a car.

264
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,120
Oh, yeah, anyway, we're in the same boat.

265
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,320
I'll start after work.

266
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,480
Wait a minute.

267
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:04,580
Hello?

268
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,180
Hello?

269
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,060
Hello?

270
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,520
Hello?

271
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,500
I was asked the way by a lot of people on the way.

272
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,240
You must have lost your way.

273
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,780
I just asked if you were really my officer.

274
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,220
Oh, I didn't know.

275
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,400
In other words, this hub is a past-competition type.

276
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
No matter how much you say it,

277
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,980
Chief Ohara is still better.

278
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,300
It seems that Ryotsu hasn't caused any problems since then.

279
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,980
Even if he is a Ryō,

280
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,920
it hasn't been a week since he was transferred.

281
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,920
I don't know. It's about him.

282
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,320
Every morning, every time I read the newspaper,

283
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,700
I'm worried that he might be causing some problems.

284
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,100
What? Is there no Ryō-san?

285
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,500
It's no good without Ryō-san.

286
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,700
But Senpai is...

287
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,480
What?

288
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,940
Even if it's not Ryōtsu, you can talk to us about anything.

289
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,140
That's why it's no good without Ryō-san.

290
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,340
This...

291
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,220
I have to move.

292
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
I thought you would fix it.

293
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,680
A radio controller?

294
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,140
Hmm...

295
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,580
We can't get this.

296
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,660
Is there any Ryō-san?

297
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,580
Oh, there's no Ryōtsu.

298
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,260
But please tell us anything that can be of help.

299
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
It's no good without Ryō-san.

300
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,640
Can you fix a pot with a hole?

301
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,360
Oh, that's a little...

302
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,640
Without Ryō-chan, this is a disaster.

303
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,720
Oh...

304
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,460
Thank you very much.

305
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,900
I see, the escape port to Kabukizama.

306
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,540
That's why there are so many people.

307
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,400
Is he able to go to work with us from here?

308
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,000
I see.

309
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,420
That's the escape port.

310
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,220
All right.

311
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,980
Um...

312
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,120
This is the first street.

313
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,260
The road doesn't have any...

314
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,620
Oh, I'm tired.

315
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,360
You still can't remember the map?

316
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,140
Idiot!

317
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:24,820
I'm good at memorizing, but I'm not good at studying after school.

318
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,780
I'm not good at memorizing, but I'm not good at studying after school.

319
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,700
You're not good at it, but you'll get it in your head.

320
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,220
You're calling me an idiot!

321
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,280
No, I'm not!

322
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,260
Wait!

323
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,580
I'm not!

324
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,500
But you used to guide the way to the station where you lived before, right?

325
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,780
I used to live in the city of Shita.

326
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,840
I was born in Shita, so I could remember the map right away.

327
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,100
I've only been to Ginza about three times since I was born.

328
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,600
You're extreme.

329
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,000
Why did you quit the station where you lived before?

330
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,560
If I were to tell you, it's because I don't have the same personality as the chief.

331
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,940
You don't have the same personality.

332
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,560
I'd like to ask you about the way.

333
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,540
What?

334
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,760
Where is the Enbu Shrine in Shinbashi?

335
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,260
The Enbu Shrine in Shinbashi...

336
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,740
Hey, Yamashita! Where is it?

337
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,960
It's a good opportunity. Let's look it up ourselves.

338
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,860
Damn it. You're talking like a teacher at school.

339
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,100
Please wait a moment.

340
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,520
I don't understand.

341
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,720
I don't know.

342
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,180
I remember!

343
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,200
I think I broke it.

344
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,460
It was a long time ago with the Japanese Army.

345
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,460
I'm sorry.

346
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,520
I'm sorry, old man.

347
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,240
Ryozu, stop it.

348
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,340
It must be there.

349
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,960
I got it.

350
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,520
Here you go.

351
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,280
Thank you.

352
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,540
He's a thoughtful clerk.

353
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,940
But Ryozu...

354
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,900
What's wrong with your personality?

355
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,900
Oh, that's it.

356
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,460
The chief is called Ohara.

357
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,960
He's a stubborn, stubborn, and stubborn guy.

358
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,660
He's always angry all year round.

359
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,140
But he's a bad guy.

360
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,380
You know what he's like?

361
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,700
Hey, Ryozu.

362
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,920
You're a fool.

363
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,720
He's like an idiot.

364
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,220
Every day, every day.

365
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,360
He's really annoying.

366
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,980
He's like a fool.

367
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,000
Isn't that why you're angry?

368
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:26,940
What?

369
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,860
Why is the old man angry?

370
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,400
No, it's just...

371
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,080
My opinion as a third party.

372
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,520
Your opinion as a third party.

373
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,820
I'm sure your boss has a bad subordinate.

374
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,400
It's not a joke.

375
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,640
I'm a serious guy.

376
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm not serious.

377
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,340
The boss is hysterical.

378
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,560
nitpicking

379
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,240
That's why I only look forward to scolding the subordinate.

380
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,800
These guys are so little.

381
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
It's me.

382
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,940
It's not.

383
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,370
I'm not a letter writer.

384
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,380
It's someone else.

385
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,400
I told you I'm not your boss

386
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,720
or your subordinate.

387
00:15:59,720 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm not crying!

388
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,000
You're not!

389
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,160
I'm going to add to your life as a human being!

390
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,700
That's cheating!

391
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,980
Shut up, Ryozu!

392
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,800
Wait!

393
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,160
Hey, don't cry!

394
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,360
No, you were crying from the beginning.

395
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,300
What's wrong?

396
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,320
I'm sorry, Kago-san.

397
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
I can't do this anymore.

398
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,200
What are you saying?

399
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,380
I don't understand.

400
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,880
Anyway, let's take her to the emergency room.

401
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,700
Where do you come from?

402
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,060
I'm having a bad sleep right now.

403
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,840
No, you can't.

404
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,380
You can't speak English, Chinese, or Mongolian.

405
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,820
What did you say?

406
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,720
I'm sorry.

407
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,400
Don't cry!

408
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,240
Ryozu, do something!

409
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,200
You're good at fighting children.

410
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,320
Yes, I know.

411
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,780
Hey!

412
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,100
It's Godzilla!

413
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,280
A Japanese famous monster!

414
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,680
What? You don't know?

415
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,440
Then what is it?

416
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,880
It's Gamera!

417
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,420
A Mothra's larva.

418
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,180
I don't know Girala, but it's a small town.

419
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,540
Hey, Ryozu, get away from the monster!

420
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,580
Kids like monsters.

421
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,160
I'll make something foreign children can understand.

422
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,780
What about this?

423
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,880
It's a horse!

424
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,260
Wow!

425
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,320
You finally understand.

426
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,580
Suho! Suho!

427
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,320
What? A horse is called Suho?

428
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,280
Suho!

429
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,760
No way! No way!

430
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,400
What?

431
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,640
Suho!

432
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,520
Yes, I'm Ryozu.

433
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,680
Ryo-tsu.

434
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,000
Ryo-tsu.

435
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,180
That's right, Ryo-tsu.

436
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,920
What about you?

437
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,720
Pao!

438
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,580
Ryo-tsu.

439
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,840
Pao.

440
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,380
Apparently, it's called Pao.

441
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,200
Pao?

442
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,040
Ryo-tsu, try to guess where it came from.

443
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,700
Wait a minute.

444
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,140
Ryo-tsu. Japan.

445
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,160
Japanese.

446
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,540
What about Pao?

447
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,880
Pao came to Japan by plane, didn't he?

448
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,300
Yes, he did!

449
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,740
Where did he come from?

450
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,900
Pao!

451
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,600
U-ke!

452
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,500
Ryo-tsu!

453
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,160
U-ja-ra-ge?

454
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,160
U-ja-ra-ge!

455
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,060
M-e-a-s-ri-n-p-u-a-u-n-ja-ra-ge!

456
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,320
What?

457
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,820
Gra-fu-bu-a-u-n-ja-ra-ge!

458
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,300
I got it.

459
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,460
He came from a country called U-n-ja-ra-ge.

460
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,940
Chief, I understand.

461
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,000
You're a big boy, Ryo-tsu.

462
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,720
I've never heard of a country called U-n-ja-ra-ge, but...

463
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,220
The world is bigger than you think.

464
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,940
So you came to see Kabuki and got separated from your parents.

465
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,700
Kabuki is boring for kids.

466
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,300
An accident?

467
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,720
What's this?

468
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,260
It's a horse!

469
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,460
I'll handle the accident!

470
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,600
Ryo-tsu will take care of the traffic!

471
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,640
Okay!

472
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,640
Hey, watch out!

473
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,540
Hey!

474
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:28,780
Ryo-tsu!

475
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,260
Ryo-tsu!

476
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,520
Catch him!

477
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,600
I know!

478
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,580
Don't!

479
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,600
Don't come any closer!

480
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,720
This is terrible.

481
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,620
The call!

482
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,340
Hey, wait!

483
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,440
Are you crazy?

484
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,340
Suho! Suho! I've noticed you, Suho!

485
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,760
Why'd you come all the way to Gintagundari and have to get on a horse?!

486
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,560
Hey, calm down, you!

487
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,160
Stop!

488
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,940
Ryotsu!

489
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,880
What was that?!

490
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,400
Pao?!

491
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Ryotsu, stop!

492
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,740
I don't need to hear it!

493
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,900
Pao, watch out!

494
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,220
This isn't just about you and me!

495
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,700
Pao!

496
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,340
Pao!

497
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,960
Raaaah!

498
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,300
De puh recid?

499
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,760
Vuohh!

500
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,500
Whoa!

501
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,340
Roar!

502
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,700
It hurt me!

503
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,700
A horse is rampaging near Ginza's 4th:"chomeする"

504
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,600
Please give me support!

505
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,860
Uwaaah!

506
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,920
Aaaahhh!

507
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,540
Raah!

508
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,460
Gyaahhh, he came flying!

509
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,640
Ryo-tsu!

510
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,100
Where is Ryo-tsu?

511
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,280
Over there!

512
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,380
Ryo-tsu?

513
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,600
Ryo-tsu!

514
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,460
Ryo-tsu!

515
00:21:59,460 --> 00:21:59,520
Ryo-tsu!

516
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,480
How are you going to take responsibility for this?

517
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,180
Even if you say I'm responsible, I'm...

518
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,420
An excuse is an excuse!

519
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,440
You're putting mud on my face!

520
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,120
You're putting mud on my face!

521
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,920
I'll ask the president to kill you!

522
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,240
Wait a minute.

523
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,020
Ryo-tsu is here to help this kid.

524
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,800
You are?

525
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,520
Ryo-tsu's former boss, Ohara.

526
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,620
Chief!

527
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,760
Ohara!

528
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,620
You're the former boss?

529
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,180
So it's your responsibility that this kid isn't educated.

530
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,800
It's your responsibility that this kid isn't educated.

531
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,540
He's a fool who can't do anything.

532
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,540
He can't speak foreign languages like you.

533
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,140
He can't speak foreign languages like you.

534
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,980
But this kid and I understand each other.

535
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,500
But this kid and I understand each other.

536
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,540
I think it's more useful than just a tip of the tongue.

537
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,680
I think it's more useful than just a tip of the tongue.

538
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,720
Pao!

539
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,880
Maro!

540
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,360
Pao!

541
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,780
Pao!

542
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,920
Good, good.

543
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,760
Chief!

544
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,980
This is Prince Pao of the Unjara Kingdom.

545
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,760
Prince Pao?

546
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,480
He came to Kabuki Kenbutsu with Kokou-gu with the Shinobi.

547
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,940
He came to Kabuki Kenbutsu with Kokou-gu with the Shinobi.

548
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,420
He came to Kabuki Kenbutsu with Kokou-gu with the Shinobi.

549
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,220
If anything happened to the prince, there would be a big trouble.

550
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,080
If anything happened to the prince, there would be a big trouble.

551
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,360
Is that so?

552
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,080
So you're saying that's good.

553
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,880
Well, yeah.

554
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,660
Ryo-tsu!

555
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,560
Yes?

556
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:21,760
Yes.

557
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,280
After hearing about Prince Pao,

558
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,700
you're a wonderful police officer.

559
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,160
I hope you come to my country.

560
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,920
What?

561
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,480
Could that be...

562
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,220
Could that be...

563
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,840
Could that be...

564
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,260
I'm going! I'm going!

565
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,900
I'm going! I'm going!

566
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,240
Ryo-tsu! You!

567
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,900
Well then, Chief!

568
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,620
Everyone, I'm going to the Unjara Kingdom,

569
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,960
not the Ha-nem-ae, but the Unjara Kingdom.

570
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,040
In case there's something wrong,

571
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,120
I'm just going to say,

572
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,140
"Ah, that's the Unjara Kingdom."

573
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,840
"Ah, that's the Unjara Kingdom."

574
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,800
"Ah, that's the Unjara Kingdom."

575
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,940
"Come on, everyone, come to our land."

576
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,120
Hey, hey! Did you call me a policeman?!

577
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,660
Our story is different!

578
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,860

579

581
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:27,080
誰かが呼んでるような 雨上がりのとこ 振り返りながら歩いた ガージャに手を引かれ

582
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:45,260
あの時感じた 不思議な気持ち だから あけどがりのタイルを 黒いとこだけ歩いてみたよ

583
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,560
誰でも一度は子供だったけど みんな忘れてる

584
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,000
偉そうな顔したセリフ

585
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:11,640
何時かや 目の上ブルーなおばさんを 曲がってごらんよ あの角を みんなにみんなに会えるよ

586
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:24,780

590
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,880
また出やがったな とんでも教授

591
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,240
なんだと わしの頭の中の 左脳が眠ってる?

592
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,740
それを働かせれば わしは秀才になれるってのか?

593
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,220
そうかそうか わしには秘められた力があったってことだな

594
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,560
次回 目覚めよ まじめ人間 リョウツ
