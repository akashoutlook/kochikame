1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,800
Want to see the program?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,220
There! There!

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,360
When you watch TV

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,980
Make light of the room

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,300
And try to get away

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,560
A light rises over the river

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,800
In the direction of the sunset

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,880
I looked at the stone

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,400
I kicked the stone

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,840
and it flew to my shoes

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,760
I thought I would go

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,220
to the gym

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,800
but I was laughed at

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,280
as if I was a kid

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,720
Even if I try to cheer up

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm only good at playing

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,820
and my yawns are the same

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,260
The cityscape is strangely gentle

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,760
From the water tank in Tongari-boshi

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,320
to Taishakuten

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,240
the sun sets

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
Tomorrow

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,700
I will be

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,800
a free bird

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,780
If you win

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,540
or lose

27
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,700
don't worry

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,400
I can do it

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:45,960
What is this?

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,540
A baseball bat

31
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,060
I used to play it when I was a child

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,320
I used it when I was in high school.

33
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,880
How do you play?

34
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,340
What? Don't you know?

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,700
The rule is the same as baseball.

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,840
Pull this lever.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,380
When you let go, the pitcher throws the ball.

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,420
Hit it.

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,940
If you get into this hole, you're hit.

40
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,820
It's very simple.

41
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,000
Anyone can do it.

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,880
Right?

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,000
How about losing a game and having lunch?

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
Sounds fun.

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,100
Let's do it, senpai.

46
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,260
Good luck, Kei.

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
The game is a tie.

48
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,680
It's all about luck.

49
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,520
But, Gitchon.

50
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,300
The baseball is very deep.

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,320
Let's start the game.

52
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,440
I'll go first.

53
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:31,860
Sure.

54
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,440
There are other levers.

55
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,300
It's just a decoration.

56
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,500
Let's get started.

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,120
Okay.

58
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,380
Home run!

59
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,380
It's on.

60
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,600
Okay.

61
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,680
It's on.

62
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,360
It's a change.

63
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,800
It's a two-point behind.

64
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,240
It's okay.

65
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,080
You can turn it over.

66
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,860
I'll do my best.

67
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,440
It's easy to turn it over.

68
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,320
Let's go.

69
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,380
The ball is bent.

70
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,320
What's going on?

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,880
Lucky.

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
It's just luck.

73
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,680
It's on again.

74
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,240
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,640
I'm back.

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,880
Good job, Mr. Terai.

77
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,000
It's a baseball version.

78
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,040
I remember it.

79
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,880
I used to play a lot.

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,720
Terai!

81
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,220
Ryo, be quiet.

82
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,680
What's going on?

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,620
It's a change.

84
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,440
The ball is iron.

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,700
You need to move a magnet under the game board with a lever and throw a curve or a shot.

86
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,680
Senpai!

87
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,080
Ryo.

88
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,760
Ah, I just remembered!

89
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,980
Yeah, yeah, I was thrown the change ball too.

90
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,640
That's so funny.

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,300
You were cheating, weren't you?

92
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,660
Well, well, that's true.

93
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,460
Then you can use the change ball too.

94
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,340
Damn it, that Terai.

95
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,460
It's unnecessary.

96
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,040
But I still have a way.

97
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,220
Then, here we go.

98
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,160
Try moving the magnet again.

99
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,320
Ah! It's a magnet.

100
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,240
Now, move it while looking at Ryo-san's eyes.

101
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,760
He's reading my hand with the magnet.

102
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,260
It's a classic trick of cowardly.

103
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:20,900
I see.

104
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,960
What should I do?

105
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,180
Do as I say.

106
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,680
What's wrong?

107
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,700
You're still two out.

108
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,140
Ah, yes.

109
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,080
Sorry for the wait.

110
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,980
Here we go.

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,980
It's a curve, isn't it?

112
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,340
Damn it!

113
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,840
Yay!

114
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,700
It's a change!

115
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,300
Ryo-san, this is the right side.

116
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,300
I think he didn't notice that I was looking at the magnet.

117
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,220
Yes.

118
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,160
This time, I'll use it in reverse.

119
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:46,960
What?

120
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,820
I still have a lot of lead.

121
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,780
You're going to shoot it?

122
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,160
Here we go.

123
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:52,740
Yes.

124
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,460
There.

125
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:55,940
Yay!

126
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,160
Wow!

127
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,980
It's a home run.

128
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,220
Damn it.

129
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
You hit me by accident.

130
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,540
This time, it's a curve.

131
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,460
Take this!

132
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,560
There.

133
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,480
This time, it's a three-way.

134
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,100
Ah!

135
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,920
Why?

136
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,620
Wow!

137
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,220
I'm almost there.

138
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,900
And it's a reverse.

139
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,440
Goodbye.

140
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,360
What's going on?

141
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,240
Hey, Terai!

142
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,860
You've become strange since you came here.

143
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,000
What did you teach Nakagawa?

144
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,340
I just taught him a trick that a coward does.

145
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,040
What?

146
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,200
You did something unnecessary even though you were on a lunch break.

147
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,680
Ryo-chan, stop it.

148
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,900
It's the fault of the senpai who cheated.

149
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,560
Let's continue.

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,240
Damn it.

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,020
I'll be defeated in the ring.

152
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,920
How could I not have...

153
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,420
No, no.

154
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,080
I'm too excited and my baseball bat has been broken.

155
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,820
Well, let's make a lunch break for the draw.

156
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,880
I can't accept it.

157
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,000
That's right.

158
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,880
If we continue like this, Kei-chan will win.

159
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,360
It can't be helped.

160
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,120
It was broken.

161
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,660
I broke it purposely, but...

162
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,220
I didn't do it purposely.

163
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,420
I understand.

164
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,820
I understand. Then let's settle this with the Super Real Simulation Baseball.

165
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,860
Oh, it was a game where you became the owner of a professional baseball team and raised the best baseball team in Japan.

166
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,200
Let's transfer it to the big screen of our theater.

167
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,560
Sounds fun. Let me join you.

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,160
Actually, I'm also into it now. It's good to pile it up.

169
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm not that kind of game.

170
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,160
Are you running away?

171
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,200
What? You're going to the master of the game, aren't you?

172
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,780
Okay, I'll stand up for you.

173
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,260
Let's start the game.

174
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,160
Mr. Terai is still...

175
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,940
Apparently, he's lost in the garden.

176
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,260
The security helicopter is searching for him.

177
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,200
Oh, dear.

178
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,700
Sorry, sorry! I thought you were going to talk to me!

179
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,740
Wow! You're going to transfer it to this screen, right?

180
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,140
Yes. It's very nice.

181
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,900
It's also very realistic and powerful.

182
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,080
Well, I can't win any game.

183
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,800
What should I do first?

184
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,700
In the controller, you can set the owner registration, name of the team, and uniform.

185
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,320
I scanned your photos beforehand and took them.

186
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,120
Next, you can set the name of the team.

187
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
This is a serious game.

188
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, the name of the team is...

189
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,980
Ryotsu Zenyaris.

190
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,120
Next, the uniform is...

191
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,500
This!

192
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,320
The team's management fund is 100 million yen.

193
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,160
Based on that, players, directors, and coaches are collected.

194
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,240
Okay.

195
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,740
The pitcher is Higashiguchi from last year's Sawa-mura Show.

196
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,960
And the great magician from the mountains, Sasahara Nito.

197
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,820
The catcher is Hachiryo Yashiba, a former MVP.

198
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,260
Ryo, if you collect players with such high annual salaries, you'll be disqualified.

199
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,820
If you're disqualified, you'll lose.

200
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,720
I see.

201
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,400
At first, the players with high annual salaries are divided into two.

202
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,520
Then, the new players and players with low annual salaries are gathered and raised.

203
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,660
At first, there are only three pitchers.

204
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,140
It's troublesome.

205
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,560
When the team is completed, the game begins.

206
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,440
Well, today Nakagawa Concerns...

207
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,140
Oh, it's a pretty good atmosphere.

208
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,480
Ryotsu Zenyaris' traditional match will begin.

209
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,720
Play ball!

210
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,000
Why is Nakagawa in the game?

211
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,900
The owner should register himself as a director.

212
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,520
If he registers himself as a director, he can participate in the game.

213
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,320
If that's the case, go ahead.

214
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,300
I'll be the owner's director.

215
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,180
Now, the pitcher turns around and throws it.

216
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,520
Hit!

217
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Oh, a home run.

218
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,120
Another home run.

219
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,420
Oh, again.

220
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,560
If it goes like this, the pitcher will be disqualified.

221
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,480
Eh? Again?

222
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,300
Shut up!

223
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,460
What are you doing?

224
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,560
There's no pitcher to disqualify.

225
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,480
At first, you said up to three people.

226
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,160
Eh? Then the pitcher is...

227
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,200
The pitcher is Yamada of the right.

228
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,660
Eh? There's no way to use it like that.

229
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,680
Shut up! You're doing a great job.

230
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,100
Pull this hamster back in.

231
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,940
It's suddenly going really well.

232
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,000
Really?

233
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,780
Now, the game is resumed.

234
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,480
The pitcher throws and hits!

235
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,560
Hit!

236
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,340
The pitcher is disqualified.

237
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,720
The catcher is Furuki.

238
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,960
After seven games, it's 38 to 0.

239
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,240
It seems that there was a match.

240
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:27,920
Eh?

241
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,660
What should we do, senpai?

242
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,780
I'd rather give up the game.

243
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,160
No, not now.

244
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,040
Ah!

245
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,500
Senpai!

246
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,520
Ryo-chan, you're dirty.

247
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,860
It's my first time, so it's okay.

248
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,440
Kei-chan, freeze the reset button so you won't be beaten again.

249
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,560
Roger that.

250
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,440
Ryo-chan, it's a big deal to make the catcher a pitcher.

251
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,540
Don't do it anymore.

252
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,620
I have to raise more pitchers, senpai.

253
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,940
Eh, I'm frustrated, but it's a good thing.

254
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,840
I don't like to do it.

255
00:09:59,540 --> 00:09:59,940
I don't like to do it.

256
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,120
It's troublesome to raise humans.

257
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,060
I got it.

258
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,380
I'll go to the pitcher to raise the pitcher.

259
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,400
Nakagawa-kun and Reiko-san, will you play a match?

260
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,560
I got it.

261
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,360
Kei-chan, let's do it.

262
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,100
Eh?

263
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,460
Now, Ryo-san.

264
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,240
It's basic to raise the player who won the draft.

265
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,160
I got it.

266
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,340
Anyway, I'll reinforce the pitcher and train hard.

267
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,520
It's a poor ground.

268
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,540
I can't spend money on it.

269
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,800
Hey, don't miss it.

270
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,760
It's too hard to practice, so I can't keep up.

271
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,660
What? You're against the coach.

272
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,960
You two are in trouble.

273
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,000
Ryo-san, if you do that, the pitcher will disappear.

274
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,880
Oh, I see.

275
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,760
It's reset.

276
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,020
This...

277
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,620
Nakagawa-kun did unnecessary things.

278
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,480
Terai, how can I get a pitcher?

279
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,260
You have to get it again with money.

280
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,540
How much money do you have left?

281
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,660
Only 5 million.

282
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,140
Then, it's very...

283
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,700
No, there must be some hidden tricks.

284
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,600
The owner can do a side job.

285
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,960
Oh, it's a field.

286
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,660
I have prepared a method for myself.

287
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,140
But there is a possibility that you will be an obstacle.

288
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,640
Who do you think I am?

289
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,780
I'll make 5 million a hundred times...

290
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,660
No, a thousand times.

291
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,500
After the 9th round, the score is 3:2.

292
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,280
Akimoto Beauty is the leader.

293
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,700
But Nakagawa Consolence is also behind the 9th round.

294
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,340
Two out and two runners.

295
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,060
Alright, a hit and a tie.

296
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,300
If it's a home run, it's a comeback.

297
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,840
I can't do that.

298
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,280
Kei-chan, it's a game.

299
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,400
I'll throw the pitcher and...

300
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,700
I can throw it.

301
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,120
I can throw it.

302
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
I'll throw it.

303
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,860
The pitch is growing.

304
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,160
Yes, it's a comeback.

305
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Goodbye, home run.

306
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,040
I did it!

307
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,240
What?

308
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,020
Ryou-chan, you are cruel.

309
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,060
I also lost a comeback.

310
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,800
Don't misunderstand.

311
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,620
I got 10 billion yen.

312
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,640
10 billion yen?

313
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,200
Now I can change a good pitcher from the big league.

314
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,320
It's time for another play!!

315
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,540
4. To beat a nouvelleboss

316
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,520
Take 1 billion and jump right away.

317
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,480
Look.

318
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,560
Look at this. It's so green.

319
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,820
5. This game is really cool

320
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,880
I'd like you to play it in Japan.

321
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,600
If 100 billion is the penalty, I'd be glad to think about it.

322
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,820
It's too high.

323
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,220
What do you think you're doing?

324
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,500
Don't be stupid.

325
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,360
Don't say that! Japanese people are always rich!

326
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,700
What a great negotiation!

327
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,240
It's like he's threatening us!

328
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,760
I beat him to a pulp!

329
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,440
Look! I have 10 pitchers and 10 batters!

330
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,300
It's the strongest squad!

331
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,940
Even if you bring them that much,

332
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,160
the foreign team is only up to three people.

333
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,920
What? I will change that rule!

334
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,420
What?

335
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,120
I will give you as much money as you want!

336
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,440
I will be the commissioner, so you should retire!

337
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,340
No!

338
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,820
Hey! Even this!

339
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,340
I don't want to!

340
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,860
Of course!

341
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,080
You can't change the rule of the commissioner!

342
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,080
Then I will attack you!

343
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,960
Go! Go! Go!

344
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,040
Go! Go! Go!

345
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,880
I will change the rule of the commissioner.

346
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,140
All right!

347
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,720
Now the foreign team is out!

348
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,620
He's using a great trick!

349
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,120
It's Ryo!

350
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,100
Now it's time for Ryo and Zenialis!

351
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,820
Who is the opponent?

352
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,060
It's a three-way battle with Terai!

353
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,800
What?

354
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,880
It's kind of scary.

355
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,020
Play ball!

356
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,360
All right! Let's attack!

357
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,100
Now, the first ball!

358
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,780
It's hit!

359
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,140
It's a home run!

360
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,300
I did it!

361
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,560
Did you see that?

362
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,480
You can buy your abilities with money!

363
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,960
The world is full of money!

364
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,840
What are you doing, Terai?

365
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,660
Throw it!

366
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,520
Wait a minute.

367
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,660
I'm taking notes of the foreign players.

368
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,220
You're imitating the bad-eared guys.

369
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,700
It's useless!

370
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,120
When the data is gathered,

371
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,800
I will change it to a new foreign player.

372
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,100
No way!

373
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,840
Well, your son-in-law's name is a life-saving band.

374
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,060
I believe you can live with it.

375
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,700
There's no way.

376
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,100
Go with that attitude.

377
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,360
Together!

378
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,460
Gakun!

379
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,200
In that respect, I'm a home run man in life.

380
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,760
I don't imitate the band or the squeeze.

381
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,640
Sign is a home run!

382
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:40,800
I am a home run man!

383
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,920
All right!

384
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,840
Game set!

385
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,460
79 to 0.

386
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,500
You won a match!

387
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,580
Hahaha!

388
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,760
You're determined to play the second round, aren't you?

389
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,840
I think it's a waste of time, but...

390
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,120
We will play it.

391
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,720
In the first game,

392
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,920
Noran Reiner is also tired.

393
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,840
Do you use the same pitcher again?

394
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,020
That's right.

395
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,980
We have to take a break on the fourth or the fifth day.

396
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,080
He has over 500 million.

397
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,700
I'm not going to let you rest for a day.

398
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,800
There are some soldiers who can be crushed by a chain.

399
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,060
Ryo-chan only thinks about herself.

400
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,380
Play ball!

401
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,360
All right, here we go.

402
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,620
Now, the first ball.

403
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,640
Take it!

404
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,600
Ah! I was hit!

405
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,940
You bastard!

406
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,400
What are you doing?

407
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,260
My shoulder hurts, I can't get up.

408
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,540
Let me rest.

409
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,920
What? Don't be so careless!

410
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,320
Throw it so hard that your arm breaks!

411
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,220
That's the right way!

412
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,560
I threw a pitcher of that kind!

413
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,780
Ah! It's a home run!

414
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,200
That bastard!

415
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,480
You're fired!

416
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,020
There are so many pitchers in the world!

417
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,780
It's Gonzales!

418
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,840
Gonzales has returned from his wife's business.

419
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,380
What? Then it's Thomas!

420
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,600
Thomas suddenly has business too.

421
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,140
What?

422
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,180
That's why I said it.

423
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,260
He uses it so badly.

424
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,480
He's a big man.

425
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:06,740
He's so good at that!

426
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,060
Terai Chimichis has scored 4 points and still has one out.

427
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,040
He threw a pitcher!

428
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,240
It's a quiz!

429
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,540
Oh my!

430
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,660
Tasty!

431
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,760
One point more!

432
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,940
Terai!

433
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,800
Don't give points to the real band!

434
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,260
Life is a band of gifts!

435
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,060
Well…

436
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,420
OK! It's a change!

437
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,680
I'll get the points back!

438
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
It's a home run.

439
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,420
Go, go!

440
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,880
I can't believe he really did it.

441
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,320
I can't believe I'm losing.

442
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,020
-Slide! -Out again!

443
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,060
Damn, Gaijin is in a bad shape.

444
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,500
No, Senpai.

445
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,080
It's because Terai has been taking data from Gaijin.

446
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,280
He's reading the course that he's not good at.

447
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,380
What? Terai!

448
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,320
I can't spend money like Ryo, so I have to fight in strategy.

449
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,040
He's using his little strength to make good use of teamwork and strategy.

450
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,120
That's right. It's natural that he's strong if he uses hundreds of millions.

451
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,160
Terai is taking care of the players one by one.

452
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,700
And Senpai is...

453
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,580
Hey, don't make any mistakes.

454
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,700
Oh, I'm usually a good player.

455
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,720
I'm not good at defense.

456
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,780
Shut up! There are as many substitutes as you want!

457
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,060
You're a nut!

458
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,560
Hey, throw it already!

459
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,120
If I throw any more, my shoulder will break.

460
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,540
Please answer me.

461
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,100
Idiot! You're a nut!

462
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,320
I'm using 300 million for my head.

463
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,380
I'll throw it until I get the base!

464
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,540
Senpai is a one-sided attack.

465
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,740
He doesn't think about the players' posture,

466
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,160
and he's going to make them throw good investments and destroy them.

467
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,060
It's a big deal.

468
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,380
If you're happy now, that's all you can do.

469
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,120
That's right.

470
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,460
If the players don't like it, they'll collect it with money again, right?

471
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,200
Shut up!

472
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,020
You're a big help.

473
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,660
If you think you can reflect on that opinion, you're wrong.

474
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,940
If you say no, I'll do it back with 100 times the power.

475
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,700
That's my idea.

476
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,460
Next time, I'll use the money again.

477
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,040
First, we'll do a money trade with the players from the team in Nakagawa.

478
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,680
What?

479
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,420
I'll pull out the ace.

480
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,860
I don't think it's possible.

481
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,120
Please come to my house for a trade.

482
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,360
I refuse.

483
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,040
I see.

484
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,740
I see. How about this?

485
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,280
Take it, you idiot.

486
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,300
It's 1 billion yen.

487
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,440
I'll make a contract.

488
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,420
Look.

489
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,820
If you pull the other person's cheek with a killer in the world,

490
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:29,820
I'll give you a lot of money.

491
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,740
It's all my idea.

492
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,420
I'll get a star athlete.

493
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,120
Sorry, but it's not a player who can move with money.

494
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,200
Then there's another way.

495
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,640
I'll get you a lot of money at the CF as well as the annual bonus that you give to me.

496
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,020
That's not all.

497
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,960
You can have a time with a beautiful announcer.

498
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,000
What?

499
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,040
I'll make a contract with him.

500
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,420
No way.

501
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,560
I've been looking for your interest in sports.

502
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,640
You don't collect baseball data.

503
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,340
I'm not going to collect the data.

504
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,180
That's what you call a woman's mouth.

505
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,400
From the big league, you call things and choose something.

506
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,660
It's a renewal of one billion.

507
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,800
There are 20 pitchers alone.

508
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,360
I'll cook you a quick meal of 160 kilos.

509
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,000
Why did you get hit?

510
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,460
That was a good course by the batter.

511
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,040
There's no mistake in the home run.

512
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,460
How about that?

513
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,940
What?

514
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,900
No way.

515
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,000
I thought this could happen.

516
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,200
I paid 5 billion yen and renovated the stadium.

517
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,400
You're cheating, Rai.

518
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,480
Be a referee.

519
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,620
That was a foul.

520
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,860
Do it again.

521
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,480
No, I can't.

522
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,160
Because I'm the star.

523
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm not just the star.

524
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm the star of the team.

525
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,700
What?

526
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,720
When did you...

527
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,520
All the judges are disqualified and I'm registered.

528
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,940
Ryo.

529
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,220
Money is the world.

530
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,140
No matter what you do, I win.

531
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,280
I don't need to lose.

532
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:10,940
Right.

533
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,340
Let's stop because you're the winner.

534
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,180
Then I have to win.

535
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,500
Please wait.

536
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,100
I earned 20 billion yen from a stock exchange.

537
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,380
What?

538
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,820
I'm going to take down the senior commissioner.

539
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,860
I don't want to be taken down.

540
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,540
I can't take this anymore.

541
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Money! Money!

542
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,420
Nakagawa, you're the commissioner!

543
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,760
You're so weak in the game.

544
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,120
Now I'm the commissioner.

545
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,700
I'm not going to run the stadium anymore.

546
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,740
And I'm going to take down the other judges too.

547
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,300
What?

548
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,520
I'm the last one.

549
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,620
Good, now we can fight to the end.

550
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,940
Ryo, let's continue.

551
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,300
Wait a minute.

552
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,900
We still have 5 billion left.

553
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,600
I'll call a team of Terai-san to help us.

554
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,880
These are the Brains who won the World Series last year.

555
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,280
Now, Terai-san.

556
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,220
Break the senior who uses dirty hands with this.

557
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,040
We have the data.

558
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,220
We can win this game.

559
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,700
Oh, no.

560
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,240
If we keep this up, we'll lose.

561
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,240
There's no way to win.

562
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,020
Ryo.

563
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,220
Hey, time's up.

564
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,840
Every game has its ultimate trick.

565
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,080
This game has its own trick.

566
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,220
Let's find it.

567
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,440
You're not doing well, Ryo-chan.

568
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,160
It's no use doing anything.

569
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,020
Shut up.

570
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,960
You're not...

571
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,680
What's this?

572
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,820
All the players, change!

573
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,800
What?

574
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,680
What's this?

575
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,400
You're all Ryo-chan?

576
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,660
There's no rule that says an owner shouldn't be a player.

577
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,380
Then, let's restart the game.

578
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,360
Play ball!

579
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,100
Ryo, you're good.

580
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,220
Can't go.

581
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,200
You'll get hit.

582
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,000
Hey, stop.

583
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,900
Be careful from here.

584
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,400
I thought you would say that.

585
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,740
I thought you would say that.

586
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:44,920
We'll be over till we make it.

587
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,680
Okay.

588
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,000
Don't let it get out.

589
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,220
No, man...

590
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,700
I could align with you, Ryo-san.

591
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,160
Hey.

592
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,740
I've been waiting for this!

593
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,740
Everyone, go!

594
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,560
Oh, it's a lantern!

595
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,780
You're kidding!

596
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:07,860
Everyone's here, even the audience?

597
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,180
What's going on?

598
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,640
We're going to make some money too!

599
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,360
Let's go!

600
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,480
Let's go!

601
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,980
This is the ultimate trick!

602
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,340
This is crazy!

603
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,060
This is crazy!

604
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,360
They're fighting so hard!

605
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,240
We're going home too!

606
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,640
We'll win with our games!

607
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:34,660
Bye-bye!

608
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,400
Bye-bye!

609
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,400
It's been a hundred years since I last won!

610
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,300
Who's next?

611
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,000
Where did everyone go?

612
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,900
Huh?

613
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,840
Hey!

614
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,240
We still have a match left!

615
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,840
No one can beat Ryo!

616
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,840
Really?

617
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,760
They were trying to fight seriously.

618
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,660
Hey!

619
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,780
Come back!

620
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,700
Hey!

621
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,840
Komachi and I are getting married?

622
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,700
This is a misunderstanding!

623
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,100
Dad! Mom!

624
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,080
No, this "Dad" and "Mom" is...

625
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,240
This is not what I meant!

626
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,940
Next episode: This is the person I like!

627
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,800
That's why I'm wrong!

Thanks for watching!
