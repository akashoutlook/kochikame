1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,340
The End

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,900
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,860
Make sure your room is bright and keep your distance

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:25,260
It's like someone is calling

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,840
After the rain

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,000
You look back and walk

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,420
Put your hand on the gacha

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,760
The strange feeling I felt at that time

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,400
So I walked on the black tile of the arcade

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,780
Everyone is the best

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,340
I was a child once

12
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,620
But everyone forgets

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,300
Politicians with a great face

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,780
And a blue aunt above my eyes

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,680
Turn around and see

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,080
That corner

17
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,480
Everyone can see everyone

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,060
There is a turtle

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,340
There must be a turtle

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,080
ok

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,820
There must be a turtle

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,320
There must be a turtle

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,840
It probably is a turtle

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,520
It must be

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,360
The prize is 200,000 yen cash.

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,800
The cash is the best prize.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,160
If I have 200,000 yen...

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,140
I'll buy Saori's 1/1 scale Vivia, which has been on sale for a long time.

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,940
I have 200,000 yen.

30
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,760
I'll go see Joby, who's coming to practice in Guam.

31
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,180
I'm shocked. I've never played golf before.

32
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,660
You're sweet, Naoko.

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,880
What? Komachi, are you sure you can play golf?

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,580
Actually, I've been taking lessons for 3 months.

35
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,600
No way! Shut up! You're mean!

36
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,800
If you're going to get a high-grade boyfriend, golf is a must-learn thing.

37
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,640
If you go to the practice ground,

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,860
you'll find a man who's pretty good at it.

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,400
He'll teach you how to play golf, and invite you to a date.

40
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,120
Thanks to him, you'll get better at golf.

41
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,800
If you win the next competition, you'll have 200,000 yen cash.

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,040
The bag you've been wanting is mine.

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,940
200,000 yen is mine!

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,580
What are you talking about? I'll be the winner!

45
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,960
What did you say?

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,180
I don't think you three can win.

47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,960
Nakagawa-san.

48
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,220
The winner is Ryo-chan, right?

49
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,640
What? Can that gorilla-guy play golf?

50
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,620
I've never heard of that.

51
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,380
I've played tag-golf with the president and the chief before.

52
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,420
But he said he scored better than the two of them.

53
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,520
He said he won by playing against a professional golf course.

54
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,520
Yeah, I can tell that he's got a great athletic ability.

55
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,140
I didn't know that.

56
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,560
When money gets in your way, you'll get even more power.

57
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,440
That's right! That's right!

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,700
Ryo, are you going to join the golf club?

59
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,620
Of course.

60
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,660
Stop it, stop it.

61
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,880
That course is really difficult.

62
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,660
The first to play must give up.

63
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,280
Does that mean you've played at that golf course before?

64
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,100
I've played it before.

65
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,360
I'm the one who's got the most experience.

66
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,160
I've played the game yesterday.

67
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,420
Ryo, you're getting better at it.

68
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,280
I'm the one who's got the most prize money.

69
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,040
It's time for us to face the odds.

70
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,200
We can't lose!

71
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,400
Let's see who wins.

72
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,220
The fourth group is the president and the chief.

73
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,320
Reiko Nakagawa.

74
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,480
And the last group are Komachi, Volvo, Sakonji, and me.

75
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,880
Do you have any questions?

76
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,300
Ryo, usually, the first group starts early in the morning, but they're pretty slow.

77
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,080
The golf course is close.

78
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,100
It's still in Tokyo.

79
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,260
Oh, the golf course in Kasenjiki.

80
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,040
No, it's not in Kasenjiki.

81
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,860
It's just around the corner.

82
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,980
Just around the corner?

83
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,580
Is there a golf course around here?

84
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,400
Well, it's not like there's a shopping street nearby.

85
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,100
Here we are.

86
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,280
Where on earth is the International Country Golf Course?

87
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,340
But it's written on the sign.

88
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,420
The International Country Golf Course is a private name, isn't it?

89
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,780
It's very fake.

90
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:50,940
It's very fake.

91
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,040
Huh?

92
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,600
Hey, Ryo.

93
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,140
You didn't use the compensation money again, did you?

94
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,740
And you didn't bring me to such a strange place, did you?

95
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,880
I'm not kidding.

96
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,300
I'll know once I get in.

97
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,440
It's nice inside.

98
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,540
It really is.

99
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,620
I've been waiting for you.

100
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,400
This is Kokusai, the owner.

101
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,760
He makes his own golf course.

102
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,940
Do you play the video games of golf here?

103
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,020
Hey.

104
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,980
There's a proper course.

105
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,160
This is my golf course.

106
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,260
Oh, this place looks pretty spacious.

107
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,860
But this is a course from thirty years ago.

108
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,140
What?

109
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,340
Currently, it looks like this.

110
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,120
It's almost in the middle of the city.

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,740
This is the place!

112
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,920
That's right. This is the town.

113
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,840
30 years ago, there was a hill here.

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,440
We used the natural land to build a golf course.

115
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,180
To destroy the hill is to destroy nature.

116
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,460
The natural golf course is the best.

117
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,460
I see. There is a policy.

118
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,300
Soon the railroad will pass.

119
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
This is also natural flow.

120
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,280
Then, the station was built.

121
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,840
My land was also provided to the country.

122
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,060
While we were taking care of the natural flow,

123
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,640
we found a natural town in the golf course.

124
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,100
Where is the natural golf course?

125
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,960
Don't say hard things.

126
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,180
I've been here many times.

127
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,720
This golf course is interesting.

128
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,800
Hall 1, 200 yards.

129
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,900
Per 4.

130
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,020
90 yards to the front.

131
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,040
110 yards to the right.

132
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,600
Green.

133
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
It's almost a course through the alley.

134
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,240
I see.

135
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,540
It's a alley.

136
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,620
The fairway is very narrow.

137
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
It looks difficult.

138
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,640
Chashu-men!

139
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,500
It's OB.

140
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,480
As a rule,

141
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,060
there is no lost ball such as OB.

142
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,900
You can go around the entire course with one ball.

143
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,880
It's a waste of resources to lose many balls.

144
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,280
If you lose the ball, you will be disqualified immediately.

145
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,640
That's tough.

146
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,900
Don't be so hard.

147
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,880
Nice shot.

148
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,760
Kei-chan is good.

149
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,220
90 yards is perfect.

150
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,220
Okay, I'll continue.

151
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,520
Oh, no.

152
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:38,920
I'm in trouble.

153
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,860
I'm in trouble.

154
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,140
Ah!

155
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,020
Oh, a good turn!

156
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,040
You got to a pretty good goal.

157
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,540
Yeah.

158
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,860
It's all right with the results.

159
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
It's my turn.

160
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,760
I won't score if I keep in line like you.

161
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,700
I'm aiming for one-on.

162
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,360
Boss, where's the green ball?

163
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,840
Between OB Curry

164
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,160
and the Ikepocha real estate.

165
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,020
That's a bad landmark.

166
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,040
A lead.

167
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,180
You got away!

168
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,240
That was a good shot.

169
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,660
I'll show you a good shot.

170
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,040
Everyone go to the green and watch.

171
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,820
That's a lot of room.

172
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,840
Let's go.

173
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,040
Well, then.

174
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,720
The target is under the sign.

175
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,920
All right.

176
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,880
The target is perfect.

177
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,940
It's a one-on-one.

178
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,420
What? One-on-one? Who is it?

179
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,340
You did it.

180
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,040
It's an eagle chance.

181
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,680
I don't know the course.

182
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,240
I'm still scared.

183
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,560
No wonder you're the champion.

184
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,680
What are you talking about?

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,960
It's just begun.

186
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll never be the champion.

187
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,940
I can't lose.

188
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,460
I'll do it for Saori's sake.

189
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,120
I thought I was around here.

190
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,460
It's in here.

191
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,320
What?

192
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,680
Oh, here we are.

193
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,800
This is terrible! It's been three days since we had a meal!

194
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,960
S-Sorry.

195
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,880
Sir, if you want to shoot, it's a sandwich. What do you want?

196
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,540
I can't shoot with this.

197
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,400
I'll give up because it's an OB.

198
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,340
Eat something more nutritious with this.

199
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,520
Thank you very much!

200
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Ah! My ball!

201
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,380
Unfortunately, you're disqualified.

202
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,980
I'm disappointed.

203
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,420
You're on the road.

204
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,660
I have no choice but to shoot a high ball.

205
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,840
Nice shot!

206
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,680
Oh, it's a good shot!

207
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,020
Oh, it's a good shot!

208
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,440
Oh, it's a good shot!

209
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,400
Sir, you're disqualified if you don't chase after the ball.

210
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,340
I can't do it.

211
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,280
I'll give up because it's an OB.

212
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,140
Ah! Don't look around!

213
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,740
I don't want to do this anymore!

214
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
I'm going to die!

215
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,020
Everyone who has no commitment to money is falling behind.

216
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,260
I've become more and more advantageous.

217
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,480
Hehehehe.

218
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,300
This is the safest to attack like this.

219
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:29,680
I'm the safest.

220
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,040
You're really smart when you're getting paid.

221
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,700
Caddy, where's my ball?

222
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,080
Under that car.

223
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,340
A little more.

224
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,120
No, I can't get it out.

225
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,560
Hey, Borobo! You're finally giving up?

226
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,640
Don't worry about that.

227
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,560
What are you going to do?

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,040
Everyone, this is dangerous. Get out of the way!

229
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,820
You idiot!

230
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,880
That's no good.

231
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,940
It's out!

232
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,180
Good. I got a par with the fourth hit.

233
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,380
This isn't golf anymore.

234
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,560
Don't shoot at dangerous spots. Get out of the way!

235
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,160
Hey!

236
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,160
Who the hell are you to throw a punch at me?

237
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,640
Come out!

238
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,180
It's you!

239
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,760
No, it's not!

240
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,700
Hmm.

241
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,480
Are you going to shoot there too?

242
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,720
If you don't shoot, you're out.

243
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,100
It seems like you've come this far, Komachi.

244
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,580
What? I'm not joking. Wait a minute.

245
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,260
Komachi!

246
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,340
What are you going to do, Komachi?

247
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,380
What's this?

248
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,500
It's a golf ball.

249
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,320
What?

250
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,460
What's that?

251
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,220
Wow!

252
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,000
Wow!

253
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,600
Wow!

254
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,340
Wow!

255
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:24,760
Wow!

256
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,040
Wow!

257
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,480
Wow!

258
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,060
Wow!

259
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,780
Wow!

260
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,940
Wow!

261
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:32,700
Wow!

262
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,320
Wow!

263
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,440
Wow!

264
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:34,520
Wow!

265
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,100
Wow!

266
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,640
What was that?

267
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,260
I don't know.

268
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,800
Are you okay, Komachi?

269
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,820
I've managed to escape.

270
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,420
You're a girl, but you've come this far.

271
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,980
Komachi might be your biggest enemy.

272
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,920
I'm behind you there.

273
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,100
Komachi.

274
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,300
Komachi.

275
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Komachi.

276
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:04,900
Komachi.

277
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,480
Komachi.

278
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,880
Komachi's back.

279
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,040
Komachi.

280
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,600
Komachi.

281
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:09,920
Komachi.

282
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,040
Komachi.

283
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,560
Komachi.

284
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,600
And he's a man!

285
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,840
Damn it!

286
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,880
What a shame.

287
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,560
Alright, I'll shoot straight.

288
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,980
Oh no!

289
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,560
This time, I'll shoot like a woman.

290
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,340
I'll shoot deliberately.

291
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,540
Hmm, Borubo is weak to a woman's nudity.

292
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,860
That's it.

293
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,140
I'm not happy because I'm just an old man.

294
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,780
Oh, I should have shot like a woman!

295
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,180
I'm just an old man anyway.

296
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,540
Jody!

297
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,440
Oh no!

298
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,280
But I can't stop for Jody's sake.

299
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,080
It seems that there was a young customer.

300
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,480
I'm a little envious.

301
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,320
Ryo Chikankichi, this is your second time.

302
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:23,880
Yes!

303
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,200
Oh, lucky!

304
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,200
This is how you attack a straight long hole.

305
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,700
Alright!

306
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,140
That's it!

307
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,300
Now, it's a straight line to the green.

308
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,500
Oh, what a bad guy.

309
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,700
If this goes on, the gap will open.

310
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,520
Naoko, wait a minute.

311
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:51,840
Hmm?

312
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,240
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

313
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,120
I got it.

314
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,420
If you win, treat me.

315
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,840
Oh, damn it!

316
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,220
I didn't expect to stop so soon.

317
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,680
Oh, lucky again!

318
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:14,760
What?

319
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,000
Hey, stop!

320
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,040
Now, Ryo Chikankichi is done.

321
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,600
Huh?

322
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,700
He's a persistent man.

323
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,680
What about this?

324
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,820
Oh, damn it!

325
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,920
It bent again!

326
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,400
I'm going to win!

327
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,520
Hey, wait up!

328
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,600
Huh?

329
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,220
Huh?

330
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,680
Naoko!

331
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,560
No way!

332
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,540
You grabbed my dirty hand!

333
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:49,880
Hey!

334
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,680
Huh?

335
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,880
No matter what you do, I'm the one who owes you $2,000!

336
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,000
If you're the one who's going to do it,

337
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,920
let me give you a share of my dirty hands, too!

338
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,240
Hey, taxi!

339
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,780
Huh?

340
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,040
Ah!

341
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,180
Ryo Chikankichi, you're so cold.

342
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,420
W-w-w-w-what are you doing?!

343
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,280
Hey, Sakonji. You're lucky to have shot Saori's room.

344
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,660
If you shoot, you'll hurt Saori.

345
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,880
Winning is the only way to win!

346
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,900
I can't... I can't hurt Saori.

347
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,660
You're going to fall off alone.

348
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,340
You're going to fall off alone.

349
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,420
Wh-what is this hall?!

350
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,080
Hall 9.

351
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,260
The final stage is 350 yards per fall using the garden of the animal lover.

352
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,440
Most players will be in danger in Hall 9.

353
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,480
The remaining players are just seniors.

354
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,680
Okay, I'm the owner.

355
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,660
Damn, I wanted to say that I spent my savings in that hall.

356
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,160
Anyway, this is a great place.

357
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,620
We have to fly far away and avoid encountering the other beasts.

358
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,020
Nice shot!

359
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,960
Amazing! It's over 300 yards!

360
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:33,240
You're giving up now, aren't you?

361
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,640
No, not yet!

362
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,960
Not yet!

363
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,720
You're going to fly the helicopter?

364
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,920
What a great obsession.

365
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:53,520
You won't be able to stop her if you don't try.

366
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,920
Yeah, you're freaking out, aren't you?

367
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:58,980
Yeah.

368
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,380
A fox doesn't do great.

369
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,640
Let's see.

370
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,620
That'll be the end of the line.

371
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,260
freshman #6

372
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,020
That's right, what's your mistake?

373
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,440
Think to yourself!

374
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,100
Shosshi!

375
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,560
You've got a good chance.

376
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,660
Don't wake up.

377
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,300
You're not playing golf, you're hunting beasts.

378
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:41,460
You've got a good chance.

379
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,180
Yeah.

380
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,740
What a birdie chance!

381
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,780
Don't come near me!

382
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,280
Don't come near me!

383
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,940
You're gonna get burned!

384
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,680
You're gonna get burned!

385
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,520
You're gonna get burned!

386
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,220
You're gonna get burned!

387
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,000
Let's fight!

388
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,580
This is where you really shine, senpai!

389
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,160
This is where you really shine, senpai!

390
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,720
Come on, if you're gonna beat those beasts,

391
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,480
come to Ikepo-Chan!

392
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,520
Come on, if you're gonna beat those beasts,

393
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,980
I've won twice in this round,

394
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,420
I'm gonna beat you right here!

395
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:24,960
What?

396
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,500
Ryo!

397
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,120
I'm gonna beat you!

398
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,980
Oh yeah!

399
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
What kind of trouble is this?

400
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,840
Out of the way!

401
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,340
What?!

402
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,920
He's one-overced, and he's gonna make a hole-out!

403
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,000
Dammit!

404
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,620
I'm gonna pay you back for that!

405
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,400
Damn, ¥200,000 is mine!

406
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,500
And Ryo's turn is the fourth,

407
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,940
so he'll win at this point.

408
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Ryo's a real royal.

409
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,400
He won't be able to get his chip in without you two.

410
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,740
No way.

411
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,100
He doesn't need to know about all this,

412
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,560
you can just try to be a friend with him.

413
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,260
That's the only place I can aim for.

414
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:16,820
Fire!

415
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,320
Flag!

416
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:28,820
You're a professional golfer, Saruke!

417
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,120
Did I get in?

418
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,480
You did!

419
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,300
Yay! It's the playoffs!

420
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,760
Well, I don't know about that.

421
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:55,360
What's that?

422
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,880
Yay! We won!

423
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,100
N-no way!

424
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,600
I didn't know you could do that.

425
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,360
I'll pay you back in 200,000 yen!

426
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,840
Help!

427
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,140
You didn't do that?

428
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,160
You must have paid for it.

429
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,540
Hey! I'll pay you back in 200,000 yen!

430
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,520
Take that!

431
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:27,880
Take that!

432
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,260
Don't you dare!

433
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:34,720
You didn't do that!

434
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,520
Why didn't you tell me?

435
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,620
I'm not going to do it!

436
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,220
Get the hell out of here!

437
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,780
Don't come near me!

438
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,280
You'll regret this!

439
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,200
I'll get you!

440
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,020
I'll get you!

441
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,720
I'll get you!

442
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,740
I'll get you!

443
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,400
I'll get you!

444
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,160
I'll get you!

445
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,500
I'll get you!

446
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:57,540
