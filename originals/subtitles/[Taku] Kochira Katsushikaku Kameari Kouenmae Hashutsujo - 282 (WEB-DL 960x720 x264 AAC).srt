1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:07,660
One

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,240
TV,

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,880
please

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,700
your

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:09,780
and

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,200
watch

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,400
a different

8
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,020
angle!"

9
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,680
Come

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,980
to

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,000
if you

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,960
money!

13
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,060
I don't

14
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,280
have

15
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,400
money,

16
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,100
but

17
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm

18
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,080
worried

19
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,160
you.

20
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,020
Look

21
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,600
at

22
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:30,880
the

23
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,560
blue

24
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,800
sky,

25
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,180
the

26
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,000
white

27
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,140
clouds,

28
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,000
and

29
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,160
you'll

30
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,400
be

31
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:39,440
able

32
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:39,600
to

33
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:39,720
do

34
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,900
in

35
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,540
the

36
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:56,880
next

37
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,020
life!

38
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,700
I

39
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:01,680
'm

40
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,040
afraid

41
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,680
that

42
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,700
people

43
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:05,720
who

44
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,160
don't

45
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,180
work

46
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,880
Wait for me! Follow me!

47
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,320
Lemon's Unwilling to Eat!

48
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,440
What? Are you still sleeping?

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,160
Wake up quickly!

50
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,760
You're still early.

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,320
What are you talking about?

52
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,940
Stop talking and wake up!

53
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:09,400
Geez, you're short-tempered.

54
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,000
Kankichi!

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,820
Oh, Lemon. Good morning.

56
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,420
Kankichi, look!

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,140
Oh, it's a land cell.

58
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,500
I'm a first-year student from next year.

59
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,340
Grandma bought it for me.

60
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,980
Oh, I see.

61
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,160
It suits you well.

62
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,840
You're a quick-witted old woman.

63
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,700
Miss, have a nice trip.

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,600
Be careful.

65
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,840
Wait for me.

66
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,240
You're too early for anything.

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,600
I like the fresh air in the morning.

68
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,540
I was a little late because elementary school was close,

69
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,260
but I always go out of the house at this time from junior high school.

70
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,400
So,

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,980
I always go to school.

72
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,100
I always go to school.

73
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,620
My family was early in the morning at Tsukudaniya.

74
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,620
I was always late.

75
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
You're late to your home.

76
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,440
Get up and do it.

77
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,340
Hmm.

78
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,320
Usually, women are late to do makeup, aren't they?

79
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,700
Why are you so early to do makeup?

80
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,780
Because,

81
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,820
I just wash my face, brush my teeth, and eat breakfast, right?

82
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,800
I'll be done in five minutes.

83
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,400
That's too early.

84
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,460
Maria said it would take one hour to do morning shampoo.

85
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,820
Too early.

86
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,640
Shampoo is at night, right?

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Hey, you.

88
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,020
Ah.

89
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,120
She went to school early,

90
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,140
so,

91
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,540
you gotta wash your hair, too, right?

92
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,940
Mari,

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,460
It's an up Lower.

94
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,060
Ah,

95
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,720
I see..

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,300
It's so easy to get off the train in the morning.

97
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,140
But I'm not good at that long escalator.

98
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,520
It's always seen by everyone.

99
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,960
No one sees such a thing.

100
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
Kameari! Kameari!

101
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,180
The girl over there was energetic in the morning as well.

102
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,900
Maybe she's going to be an elementary schooler next year.

103
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,620
Are you telling me she's a inside little one?

104
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,520
Oh, the bus is here.

105
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,660
Well then, I'm going to the depction site.

106
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,100
Oh! Oh, right, you!

107
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,700
I have to go to the depction site over there.

108
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:39,860
Huh?

109
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,620
I made some lunch.

110
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,720
I made some kankichi, too.

111
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,680
Come to my place for lunch.

112
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,540
Okay, see you.

113
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,580
Chief Ohara, what's wrong?

114
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,200
R-Ryotsu is coming to Chikokubo Line.

115
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,320
I don't have to be surprised.

116
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,500
It might snow today.

117
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,240
He said he came to work from Matoi's house this morning.

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Here's your tea.

119
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,860
Here, Chief.

120
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,040
Thanks.

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,240
Ryo-tsu, did you come to work at Matoi's house again?

122
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,740
It's a day before his payday.

123
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,460
Well, it's not a part-time job.

124
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,760
I went to get him some food.

125
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,920
So you came to work with Matoi.

126
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,040
So you didn't have to be late.

127
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,740
It's just a long day for him to come out early.

128
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,120
Matoi is really a nuisance.

129
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,220
You idiot!

130
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,640
You're always late and don't do your job properly.

131
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,200
What are you talking about?

132
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,880
Don't get so angry.

133
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,100
What?

134
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,100
Nothing.

135
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,680
Matoi, is that sushi?

136
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,340
Yes, it's sushi.

137
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,760
I made it this morning.

138
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,240
It looks delicious.

139
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,780
Can I have one?

140
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,780
Here you are.

141
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,140
It's delicious.

142
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,080
Komachi, one, please.

143
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,480
Sorry, I don't like fish with a lot of vinegar.

144
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,320
It's delicious.

145
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,400
But Komachi really hates fish with a lot of vinegar.

146
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,200
I don't like hijiki either.

147
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,700
Would you like to eat it?

148
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,040
I'll take it.

149
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,080
Here you are.

150
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,920
Oh, Ryo and Sankichi.

151
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,780
Who told you that I'd give you?

152
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,700
I already ate it.

153
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,340
You're such a Toad.

154
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,420
You're the one who hates to eat.

155
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,060
It's noisy.

156
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,600
You also have one or two things you don't like.

157
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,800
In my case, I only have two things I like and love.

158
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,360
You're a Toad.

159
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,520
I was a fool to think you were.

160
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,200
You know I'm a Toad.

161
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,540
Speaking of likes and dislikes, there's a little problem with the lemon.

162
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,140
With the lemon?

163
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,560
The lemon is a little bitter.

164
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,960
Ita-cho.

165
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,620
Yes?

166
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,180
You're a bit lost.

167
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,340
A famous flower.

168
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,700
A young stone.

169
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,100
It's true that this is a popular shop.

170
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,700
It might be impossible to say "don't be conscious."

171
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,000
But I don't need it.

172
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,400
The chokanda has the taste of chokanda.

173
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,620
It looks simple, but it's a good taste that you can enjoy with two or three people.

174
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,380
Be confident.

175
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,240
Yes, Lady Lemon.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,920
Next, Sanpei.

177
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,600
Did you grill this fish?

179
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,060
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,380
There are too many fins.

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,760
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,420
And the seasoning.

183
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
What's the problem?

184
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,740
You're always so generous.

185
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,240
No.

186
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,620
I've been thinking that I've never had a liking or a dislike for food.

187
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,340
You don't, right?

188
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,040
As I thought, the soy sauce with miso is 6:4 white miso.

189
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,140
You always eat anything without leaving it.

190
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,700
You always nag.

191
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,380
It's.

192
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,900
It's a pamphlet from elementary school.

193
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,420
I brought it.

194
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,280
I made it for you, Lemon.

195
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,160
You're so quick-witted, Grandma.

196
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,260
I'm not bad at being quick.

197
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,240
Lemon, when you enter elementary school,

198
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,700
you'll have lunch instead of lunch.

199
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,580
What's lunch?

200
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,160
It's a meal you get at school.

201
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,120
You get it at school?

202
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,220
Look, it has a menu on it.

203
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,320
Wow! It looks delicious!

204
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,020
What's wrong, Lemon?

205
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,040
N-No, nothing.

206
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,020
The pamphlet I was looking at at that time was that.

207
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,680
Apparently, there's something you don't like in that menu.

208
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,740
It's a luxurious meal that doesn't compare to our time.

209
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,480
Times are too different.

210
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,080
It was a time of dashi stock, wasn't it, when Kankichi was young?

211
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Well, yeah.

212
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,000
But...

213
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,600
I don't think there's anything you don't like in this menu.

214
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,060
I've eaten all the lemons except for the bread in the menu.

215
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,280
What? Bread?

216
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,140
You've never eaten bread, Lemon?

217
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,760
Yeah.

218
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,980
Hmm...

219
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,920
If you ask me,

220
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,060
I've never eaten bread in my family.

221
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,640
It's an unknown food.

222
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,740
Can you ask him?

223
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,700
Okay.

224
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,140
Hey, Lemon!

225
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,860
What is it, Kankichi?

226
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,420
Hmm...

227
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,300
I'm not sure, but...

228
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,440
Do you hate bread?

229
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,000
Of course I do!

230
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,280
I...

231
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,100
I don't think so.

232
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,560
Hey, don't lie to me.

233
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,620
Your eyes are running away.

234
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,260
They're not!

235
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
I...

236
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I...

237
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,000
I...

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,360
I...

239
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,880
I...

240
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,280
I...

241
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,340
I...

242
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,600
I...

243
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:49,640
I...

244
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:49,740
I...

245
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:49,840
I...

246
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,560
I...

247
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:58,020
I...

248
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,300
I...

249
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,920
I...

250
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,480
I...

251
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,920
I... I... I...

252
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,260
I...

253
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,260
I...

254
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:02,760
I...

255
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,140
I...

256
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,240
I...

257
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,700
I...

258
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:03,960
I...

259
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,380
I...

260
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:05,540
I...

261
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,440
Hey!

262
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,200
Lemon!

263
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,500
Where are you?!

264
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,100
I'm sorry!

265
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,340
I'm not saying that you don't like bread.

266
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,400
There's a rule in elementary school lunch.

267
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,920
You have to eat without leaving anything.

268
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,420
What? I can't leave anything? Even if I don't like it?

269
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,880
That's right.

270
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,780
Really? Is it true, Matoi?

271
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,300
The rule is...

272
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,600
What if I left something?

273
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,240
Then what happens?

274
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,040
In that case, you'll be left in the classroom.

275
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,760
Left...

276
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,220
You'll be turned upside down!

277
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,920
Don't lie to me!

278
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,360
That's right, Kakichi!

279
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't like turning upside down!

280
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,000
See? You scared Lemon, didn't you?

281
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,500
Yes.

282
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,020
Lemon doesn't want to go to elementary school anymore!

283
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,740
That's right, you idiot!

284
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,860
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

285
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,120
Don't worry, Lemon.

286
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,920
What?

287
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,260
You can't turn upside down.

288
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,700
That's good. But what about the leftover bread?

289
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,540
If you leave it for lunch, you can eat it after school.

290
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,740
You have to eat it alone in a classroom where there's no one.

291
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,860
If you do that, you'll be left behind.

292
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,620
Huh?

293
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,180
If you keep turning upside down...

294
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,560
Ahhhh!

295
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,040
You idiot!

296
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,840
You're persistent!

297
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,380
Lemon's scared again, isn't he?

298
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:53,980
Don't say that!

299
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,240
Does Lemon really hate bread?

300
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,740
We don't have one to try.

301
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,640
I'll go to the bakery and get it.

302
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:02,800
Lemon, I'm going to the bakery.

303
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,300
Lemon!

304
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,260
Hi!

305
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,040
I can already see it in your face.

306
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,480
It's easy to spot.

307
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,220
You're right.

308
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,620
Can't you eat it at all?

309
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,840
If I eat it...

310
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,600
Well, like this...

311
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,800
Maybe it's like eating biscuits until death...

312
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,220
I'm so thirsty that my throat is dry.

313
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,940
I don't know if you're hungry or not.

314
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,620
Anyway, just try it.

315
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,440
So, what should Lemon eat?

316
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,500
It's bread.

317
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,860
Then let's eat it.

318
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,320
Let's eat it.

319
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,040
I'm hungry.

320
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,060
It's not good.

321
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
I'm done.

322
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,220
It really doesn't taste good.

323
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,240
You've had my Katsu-sand before, haven't you?

324
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,340
Katsu-sand is moist, so you can just pour it in with milk.

325
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,700
But...

326
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,380
The problem is that it's a single-use product.

327
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,980
It's not dry, or soft, or fluffy like it used to be.

328
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,840
That's not good.

329
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,140
But I have to fix it before going to school.

330
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,520
I feel like going to school is getting depressed.

331
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,040
You've gotten worried about how it is, haven't you?

332
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,100
Yeah.

333
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,320
Don't worry.

334
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,260
I just hate it when it's not eaten.

335
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,700
I'll make sure it's edible.

336
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,560
Hey, wait for me, Chutorou!

337
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll add the milk colored with saffron.

338
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,380
All right.

339
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,940
All right, all right, I'll shape it, roll it up, and put it in the oven.

340
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,500
Next, I'll...

341
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,960
What are you making?

342
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,480
Making food using bread.

343
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,320
It looks like he's trying to make me eat it somehow.

344
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,600
I think it's a difficult trick to trick your tongue with lemon.

345
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,260
Let's eat!

346
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,020
It smells like bread.

347
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,960
What are you talking about? There's no bread anywhere.

348
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,300
That's right, it smells like bread.

349
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,260
It smells like bread.

350
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:54,720
What's this?

351
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,300
It's a grilled egg.

352
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,900
You can see it's a grilled egg from anywhere.

353
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,740
See, it's bread.

354
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,280
It's a four-color French toast.

355
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,860
I knew it.

356
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,100
What's this?

357
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,960
It's a mo-men tofu. It's delicious.

358
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,640
It's a bread.

359
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,060
I'm surprised.

360
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,300
I didn't know there was bread here.

361
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,760
It still smells like bread.

362
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,220
It smells like bread.

363
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,840
It smells like bread.

364
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,460
What's this miso soup?

365
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,340
It's fried tofu.

366
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,240
It's bread, too.

367
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,100
That's right, it's fried tofu-like bread miso soup.

368
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,760
What about sushi?

369
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,100
It's all bread.

370
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,940
That's right, it's a new menu, Western-style sushi.

371
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,440
I told you I don't like bread.

372
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,500
I see. I'm sorry.

373
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,060
Hurry up and eat.

374
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,680
Oh, my God.

375
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,700
Oh, my God.

376
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,420
Oh, my God.

377
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,480
I don't like the bread that you made with your teeth curled up.

378
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,120
No, no, no, no.

379
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,980
You shouldn't do that.

380
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,240
I lost.

381
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,660
Lemon is quite tough.

382
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,040
It's impossible to deceive.

383
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,580
Damn it. I'm not giving up.

384
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,240
All right.

385
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,480
Let's go, Lemon.

386
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Oh, nice catch.

387
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,460
Kankichi, I'm tired. Let's take a break.

388
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,540
What? Are you tired already?

389
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
You can't go to elementary school like that.

390
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,200
What?

391
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,680
Elementary school is hard, unlike kindergarten.

392
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,820
Is that so?

393
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,360
If that's the case, tell your teacher to start over from kindergarten.

394
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,880
I don't want to.

395
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,780
Kankichi, let's continue.

396
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,300
You're a child after all.

397
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,880
You should exercise until you get tired and get hungry.

398
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,800
There.

399
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,480
Hey.

400
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,480
There.

401
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,180
How is it? Are you tired, Lemon?

402
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,860
No, it's not a big deal.

403
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,340
As expected, you're a child.

404
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,400
I'm getting hungry.

405
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,420
It's not a part of your nature to be an adult.

406
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,800
What?

407
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

408
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,920
If you get hungry, you're an adult.

409
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,020
I'm hungry.

410
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,200
Grandma, is dinner ready?

411
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,420
Kikyo and Matoi will get it ready.

412
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,020
I'm ready.

413
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:43,560
Here you are.

414
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,020
Thanks.

415
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,280
Itadakimasu!

416
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,840
Here we go.

417
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,400
I'm sorry, Lemon. The rice is gone.

418
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,200
You can put up with this tonight.

419
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,560
Did you cut the rice even though we're a sushi restaurant?

420
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,420
It doesn't matter.

421
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,720
You're hungry, aren't you?

422
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,080
I'm sure it's delicious.

423
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,940
Itadakimasu!

424
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,840
The ham tastes so good.

425
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
The bread doesn't get in the way.

426
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,860
It's a beautiful harmony.

427
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,680
This vegetable sandwich and egg sandwich are delicious.

428
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,240
It's a luxury.

429
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,040
I can eat as much as I want.

430
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,220
I'm sure everyone wants to eat.

431
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,140
It's really good.

432
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,820
I'm hungry, so I'll eat as much as I want.

433
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,040
It's delicious.

434
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,940
How much?

435
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,120
Idiot!

436
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,240
his food!

437
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,500
Kankichi!

438
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,640
Oh, my goodness.

439
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,480
I think I've cooled off.

440
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,100
L- Lemon!

441
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,160
I'm sorry!

442
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,240
As I was expected.

443
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,500
What is it, Kankichi?

444
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,040
You fed us all the bread that Lemon didn't like, didn't you?

445
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,960
I'll ask Sanpei to make something for us, so it's fine.

446
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,320
T-too hard!

447
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,740
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

448
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,400
It's not like that.

449
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,100
Kankichi is just stupid.

450
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,860
That's right.

451
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,320
Damn it!

452
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,060
If this happens, there will be no other way!

453
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,180
Mikan, eat.

454
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,480
No!

455
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,140
Mikan, don't worry.

456
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,340
Mikan, don't you want to eat?

457
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,380
I'm not good at eating spinach.

458
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:03,460
I'm not good at eating spinach.

459
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,000
I eat other things often.

460
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,140
But I'll make you some cocoa now.

461
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,460
Okay.

462
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,720
Mikan, you can't grow if you don't eat well.

463
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,560
You can't do whatever you want.

464
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,600
Mikan, I don't hate lemon.

465
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,400
And I don't hate oranges either.

466
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,520
Oh, you're great, Mikan!

467
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,320
Mikan, don't worry.

468
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,360
I'll give you a burger.

469
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,960
The next day

470
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,720
What's going on?

471
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,440
I don't know...

472
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,080
Who convinced Lemon?

473
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,440
I don't know, but it must be a very skilled negotiator.

474
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,000
But it's the first time in 102 years that bread has been alive since morning.

475
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,660
Lemon, you're the best!

476
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,600
I don't have any likes or dislikes.

477
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,240
Let's eat!

478
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,800
Yes!

479
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,940
Lemon, you're the best!

480
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,840
Well done!

481
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,360
It's delicious!

482
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:50,740
It's delicious!

483
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,560
You're not a bad boy!

484
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,880
You don't eat bread!

485
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:03,540
Who are you?

486
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,840
I'll eat you if you don't eat!

487
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,400
You're eating well, so you're not fat.

488
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,140
What's going on?

489
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,980
Kankichi!

490
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,300
Lemon, you can eat bread now!

491
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,580
Yes, it's delicious, Kankichi!

492
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,260
Really?

493
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,660
Kankichi!

494
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,180
What?

495
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,880
You're surprising people!

496
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,840
No, I'm not!

497
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,840
Wait!

498
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,000
Because of you, my life has shrunk by one year.

499
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,160
Even though 102 years have been alive, it's only one or two years!

500
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,060
Even if it shrunk, it doesn't mean anything!

501
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,040
Shut up!

502
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,960
I'm going to eat it!

503
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,200
Come on!

504
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,840
Help me!

505
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,180
Wait, I'm going to eat it!

506
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,740
I'll understand if you let me go!

507
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,840
You'll understand, Kankichi!

508
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,760
Stop it!

509
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,540
I want to eat it!

510
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,000
I want to eat it!

511
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,740
I want to eat it!

512
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,780
I'm looking forward to going to elementary school.

513
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,240
Stop it!

514
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,540
Stop it!

515
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,380
I want to eat it!

516
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:02,760
Why!

517
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,280
Why?

518
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,960
Why?

519
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,300
Why?

520
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:09,820
Why?

521
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,300
Why?

522
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,820
Good job, guys!

523
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,320
Why?

524
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,700
Why?

525
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,640
Even though Lemon is a kindergarten student,

526
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,640
he likes historical dramas.

527
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:21,980
Why?

528
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,340
Why?

529
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,040
His little beard is a little bit small.

530
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,820
Why?

531
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,520
Why?

532
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,540
Why?

533
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,880
Mr. Kida, when you ride a motorcycle, your personality changes. Why?

534
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,220
Why?

535
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,780
The "Neruo" who lives in the sun only happens once every four years. Why?

536
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,680
Why?

537
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,500
Mr. Nakagawa does not lend money to the mass production company,

538
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,500
but he can easily lend a tank or fighter.

539
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,140
Why?

540
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,400
Mr. Reiko is very rich,

541
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,100
but he works in a gas station. Why?

542
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,160
Why?

543
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,520
Why?

544
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,080
What? You want to be my teacher?

545
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,740
Okay, let me do that.

546
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,140
I wanted to be a teacher like a TV drama.

547
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,260
Why?

548
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,500
Everyone, listen to me.

549
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,100
Next time, "3-year class B teacher, Kankichi",

550
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:46,980
Thank you.

551
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,700
Everyone, come to our town

552
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,820
Thank you!
