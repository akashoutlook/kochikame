00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:07,660
Greatest

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,900
When you watch TV, light up the room and look away.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,820
"The Greatest Movie"

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,060
"The Greatest Movie"

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,760
The rich guy, come to me!

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,940
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,260
Look at the blue sky.

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,040
White clouds.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,600
I'm sure it will be somehow.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,340
I'm sure it will be somehow.

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,100
"The Greatest Movie"

12
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,540
I have no work.

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,220
Follow me!

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,300
A voice?

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,540
A voice!

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:58,820
Come to me!

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:00:59,840
A voice!

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,020
Come to me!

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,200
Uh, uh, uh.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,420
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,540
"The Greatest Movie"

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
The rich guy!

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:25,540
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

24
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:25,740
Come with me!

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,900
World Cup

26
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,040

World Cup

28
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,600
World Cup

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,800
The world's greatest sports event, World Cup Soccer, has finally arrived in Japan!

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,520
The second match of the World Cup, the police league vs. soccer competition semi-final,

31
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,640
is the victory of Team A of Katsushika, by a V goal!

32
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,180
As expected, you have come out, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

33
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,740
As the opponent of the final,

34
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,840
there is no other chance!

35
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,920
You are washing your hair and waiting, aren't you, Komachi?

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,000
That's right!

37
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,040
The final next week will be between Team B of Katsushika, led by Komachi Ono,

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,520
and Team A of Katsushika, led by Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

39
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,780
We have a good news here.

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,300
It's a sudden news, but the winning team of this tournament

41
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,600
will be given the ticket to the World Cup final!

42
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,200
What?

43
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,300
Did you say something strange?

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,920
No, I just said that I will give the ticket to the World Cup final.

45
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,660
The ticket to the World Cup final?

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,860
Ticket!

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,440
What? Are you that excited?

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,180
Speaking of World Cup tickets, they are super platinum papers!

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,400
You can't get them easily in Nakagawa.

50
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,020
There are hundreds of millions of people who want them!

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,600
It's such a big deal!

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,940
I will definitely get the ticket to the World Cup final!

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,240
Machikado Soccer 2000 people!

54
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,380
Finally, the day of the World Cup final,

55
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,960
the day of the World Cup final,

56
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,640
has come!

57
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,980
Team A of Katsushika, led by Ryo-tsu Kankichi, has arrived!

58
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,580
What?

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,460
What? That is...

60
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,480
No way! No way!

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,740
They are...

62
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,360
No way!

63
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,180
They are the players who are playing in the South American Pro League!

64
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,700
They have been disqualified from the qualifying round,

65
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,160
and the top players of the country who couldn't participate in the World Cup are here!

66
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,540
Don't misunderstand me.

67
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,480
They are the people who came to Katsushika as the police officers.

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,680
Well, they might have a little desire for soccer.

69
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,600
Team B of Katsushika has arrived!

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,160
They have come.

71
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,420
They didn't know they would lose.

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,500
What?

73
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,860
Oh, my!

74
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,540
They are the players who are playing in the European Pro League!

75
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:13,940
What?

76
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,240
They are the players who came to Katsushika as the police officers.

77
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,000
They might be able to play soccer, but...

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,280
They called us because they thought something like this might happen.

79
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,280
Now, we have the same power.

80
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,120
Damn it!

81
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,980
Reiko's work...

82
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,880
Both teams have come to the World Cup final to participate in the Super Cooperative Sets!

83
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,500
Wait!

84
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,060
What?

85
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm afraid it's not the same!

86
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,240
They are the players who have made the same mistake.

87
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,780
Team B is going to compete in the Super Cooperative Sets!

88
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:52,900
I want you to play soccer.

89
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:53,960
OK.

90
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,640
I'm ready.

91
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:57,840
We're ready.

92
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,520
I'm ready.

93
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:58,740
I'm ready to go.

94
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,700
I'm ready to go.

95
00:04:59,700 --> 00:04:59,760
I'm ready to go.

96
00:04:59,760 --> 00:04:59,860
I'm ready.

97
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,020
I'm ready to go.

98
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,320
I'm ready.

99
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,120
All right!

100
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,460
Let's go!

101
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,500
-Let's go! -Let's go!

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,700
I'm ready!

103
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,820
I'm ready!

104
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:10,560
I'm ready!

105
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm ready!

106
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,120
-I'm ready! -I'm ready!

107
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,480
That's right!

108
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,520
But...

109
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,600
By the way, the sixth grand was empty.

110
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,700
Really?

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,500
Isn't it too small?

112
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,580
Look at that.

113
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,320
It's the seventh grand.

114
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,780
If you put them together, it's as big as a normal soccer field.

115
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,980
No way, Ryotsu...

116
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,840
That's right. I'm going to use these two grand to play.

117
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,400
What?

118
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,860
That's ridiculous, Ryo-chan.

119
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,700
There's a road in between.

120
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,560
I can't play.

121
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,960
I don't care if you give up the game.

122
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,740
The ticket will be ours.

123
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,980
I didn't say no to anyone.

124
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,280
Well, that's decided.

125
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:08,920
The grand finale of the World Cup Memorial Police Station vs. Soccer is about to begin.

126
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,660
The grand finale of the World Cup Memorial Police Station vs. Soccer is about to begin.

127
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,620
Let's go!

128
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,320
Team Ryotsu!

129
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,180
Aim for the sixth grand and run at once!

130
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,380
I'm not going to pass here.

131
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,620
You can't stop me!

132
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,020
It's a long shot!

133
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,360
It's a long shot!

134
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,760
Team Komachi wins the game!

135
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,260
The game has just begun!

136
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,620
The same attack pattern again?

137
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,160
It was so close!

138
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:42,980
The same attack pattern again?

139
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,240
Oh!

140
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,980
The same attack pattern again?

141
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,600
The same attack pattern again?

142
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:48,960
Damn it!

143
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,500
Go, Honda!

144
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,480
But...

145
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,320
Honda is blocked by the red light and can't move forward!

146
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,320
I was saved!

147
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,040
It's the worst timing!

148
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,280
I was saved!

149
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,180
It's hot!

150
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,560
No!

151
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,240
It hurts.

152
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,660
It's a fierce fight!

153
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,040
The signal is changing!

154
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,400
Everyone, get out of the main hall!

155
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Where's the ball?

156
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Don't leave the ball!

157
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,980
I did it!

158
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,380
It's impossible to play here.

159
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,040
Let's stop it.

160
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,140
I agree.

161
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,540
What about the match?

162
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,420
Of course, we win!

163
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,040
But we have one point.

164
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,660
Right?

165
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,920
I'm not joking!

166
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
The match has just begun.

167
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,220
We should play until the end!

168
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,260
Yes!

169
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,860
But there is no place.

170
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,720
But the old people played soccer without a ground, right?

171
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,040
They played on TV the other day.

172
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,000
It was the time of soccer to kick the ball from town to town.

173
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,640
Then, let's play soccer in town.

174
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,300
What?

175
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,140
No, no!

176
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,860
If we do that, the people of town will be in trouble.

177
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:25,200
Chief, you often say that we should value tradition and respect the culture of tradition, right?

178
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,700
Then, shouldn't we respect the tradition of soccer?

179
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,420
The tradition of soccer is the street soccer.

180
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,980
Then, can we call it the host country of the World Cup without accepting it?

181
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,480
Yes, we can.

182
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,740
Of course, we should be careful not to bother the people of town.

183
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:54,480
But the more important thing is to play street soccer here and show the world how Japan respects the tradition of soccer.

184
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,700
Yes!

185
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,840
I feel like I'm being fooled.

186
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,640
I hope we win with our ability.

187
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,020
Yes!

188
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,620
The match is over!

189
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,120
In the final of the Soccer Tournament against the Police Office, a venue has been changed again.

190
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,040
The goal of the Komachi team is the square in front of the station.

191
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,060
The goal of the Ryotsu team is the third neighborhood park.

192
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,940
The whole city will be a soccer field.

193
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,440
Here we go.

194
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,320
Let's do it!

195
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,980
Let's go!

196
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,200
Take this!

197
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,020
Oh no! The roadside!

198
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,560
Here it comes!

199
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,280
Take this!

200
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,800
The roadside in the town is hard to move in the crowd of 10 people!

201
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,760
What's going on?

202
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,540
The soccer pro is confused in the town of Tokyo!

203
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,420
Did you find it?

204
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,300
It looks like it's lost.

205
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,260
This place is like a garden for Ryo-chan.

206
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,920
Damn it, Ryo-chan!

207
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,900
Leave it to me!

208
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,320
No one's following me.

209
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,920
Alright, I'll go to the goal as soon as possible!

210
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,600
I found it, Ryo-chan!

211
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,360
What?

212
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,060
I won't let you do as you want!

213
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,040
Komachi!

214
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,520
A player is on the roof!

215
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,300
What?

216
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,020
It's a goal!

217
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,360
Everyone, go to the roof!

218
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,420
Europe's best soccer team!

219
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,400
Let's make a good pass!

220
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,060
Stop it, anyone!

221
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,320
The front line!

222
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,360
It's a big one, Sakonji!

223
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,720
Another kid?

224
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,040
Komachi!

225
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,280
Don't push me!

226
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,520
Don't push me!

227
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,460
This is like a pinball!

228
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,920
I won't be defeated!

229
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,660
Naga! Pass!

230
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,420
Offside!

231
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,900
What, you say?

232
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,260
We got a defense goal on the north-eastern island, so we have to pass now.

233
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,920
Look, no one's following you...

234
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,160
There's really a gap!

235
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:21,960
That's right.

236
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,040
Who's that?

237
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,760
I'm sorry, this is a repair cost.

238
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,560
What kind of organization are you?

239
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,080
Keeper 1 vs 1.

240
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,300
A perfect chance!

241
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,080
No, I can't score if I keep it up!

242
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,240
Komachi, shoot!

243
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,680
I got it!

244
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,880
It's enough!

245
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,160
Sorry, I made a mistake with the ball.

246
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,040
It's dirty!

247
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,140
The ball is going to the bargain shop!

248
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,800
Don't stop me!

249
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,740
Oh, no!

250
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,620
It's in the manhole!

251
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,660
You're running away!

252
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Where's the ball?

253
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,420
I got it!

254
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,560
Wait!

255
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,900
Now!

256
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,740
I got it!

257
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,080
I got it!

258
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:27,820
I got it!

259
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,520
I got it!

260
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:28,960
I got it!

261
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,660
I got it!

262
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,960
What are you doing, Ryo?

263
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,920
Senior, the first half is over, and it's already half time.

264
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:35,820
Huh?

265
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,960
I was whining many times, but you were in the basement, so you couldn't hear me.

266
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,280
No way.

267
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,420
I've been through a lot to get here, but no one's chasing me on the street.

268
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,180
You're an idiot!

269
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,220
Huh?

270
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,240
Oh, no!

271
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,880
What?

272
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,780
Let me go in.

273
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,140
Aren't you here to do anything for me?

274
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,700
You should go to that bar for 19 days!

275
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,100
You should!

276
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,700
Why?

277
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,560
Come on, it's too early!

278
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,100
I'll take your time.

279
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,840
Are you on your way to the bar?

280
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:14,880
Yes!

281
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,660
Is this a bar?

282
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,040
I'm gonna get you!

283
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,480
The ball is flying toward the top right corner!

284
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,100
Team Komachi, second point!

285
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,880
I won't let you do that!

286
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,840
The goal is unreachable!

287
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,520
It's unfair to move the goal!

288
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,240
Yeah, yeah.

289
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,840
What are you talking about?

290
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,840
It's a natural courtesy to move the goal in street soccer.

291
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,700
What do you mean, courtesy?

292
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,780
What do you mean courtesy?

293
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,620
Street soccer is a place where residents live.

294
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,380
Of course, there are people who work normally.

295
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,160
For those people, the goal must always be moved.

296
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,280
It's possible to say that.

297
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,700
On the contrary, it's common sense to move the goal in street soccer.

298
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,000
It's a matter of course.

299
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,460
But then, the goal area and penalty area...

300
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,140
Ignore it!

301
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:19,840
Then,

302
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,420
this goal is alive, right?

303
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,040
Pass!

304
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,080
OK!

305
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:24,940
No!

306
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,860
Move the goal!

307
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,460
Alright!

308
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,820
Wait for it!

309
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,780
The goal of Team 4 is moving!

310
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,980
Team Komachi is chasing!

311
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,800
Wait!

312
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,640
Komachi, over there!

313
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
The enemy is tired. It's your chance!

314
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,820
That's it!

315
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,840
It's inoculated, not it?

316
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,980
And then it's in!

317
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,800
It returns!

318
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,040
One point!

319
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,500
The enemy is out!

320
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,240
My team's goal!

321
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,920
Goal!

322
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,860
Team Ryotsu finally caught up with the same score!

323
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,120
It was an awesome match.

324
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,960
I can't say it's soccer anymore

325
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,800
Female 1: I can't say it's soccer anymore.

326
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,540
Run!

327
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,580
Stop!

328
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,560
Run!

329
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,360
Stop!

330
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,200
Run!

331
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,860
The intense battle continues!

332
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,420
World Cup Commemoration!

333
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,240
Police Station vs. Soccer World Cup Final!

334
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,440
Which team will win?

335
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,300
It doesn't matter.

336
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,900
Hurry up and finish!

337
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,900
I told you not to bother the people of that town!

338
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,640
Oh, no!

339
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,100
That was close!

340
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,060
That's it.

341
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,780
I have to go!

342
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,700
Oh, no!

343
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,900
That was close!

344
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,220
I have to go!

345
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,120
Stop!

346
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,300
It's over.

347
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,140
I can't believe you.

348
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,900
It's been a while.

349
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,500
Hi, Bobby and Ryo!

350
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,140
It's been a while.

351
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,780
O-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L

352
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,180
J-Joby!!

353
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,120
Why are you here?

354
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,440
Using the holiday,

355
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,660
I came to Japan with my friends.

356
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,360
I heard that Bobby will play soccer.

357
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,120
So, I came to cheer him up.

358
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,000
So, I came to cheer him up.

359
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,600
Hmm...

360
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,700
Nick!

361
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,860
Ryo!

362
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,460
Give me that!

363
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,400
Go away!

364
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,600
All right!

365
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,720
Hey!

366
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,560
What?

367
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,500
What's this room?

368
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,120
Where are we?

369
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,440
Damn it!

370
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,680
Where is the ball?

371
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,200
There is no place to play!

372
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,340
Here it is!

373
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,400
Wait!

374
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,040
Wait, Senpai!

375
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,440
This way?

376
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:07,920
Yes.

377
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,560
It's quite lively.

378
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,800
I wonder if the Olympics have begun.

379
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,840
Ryo!

380
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,460
What's that?

381
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,500
He's playing the Matsuri!

382
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,540
Senpai!

383
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:37,900
What's going on?

384
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,060
We're playing the World Cup Memorial Big Soccer Matsuri!

385
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,740
Please turn around!

386
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,020
What?

387
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,000
Senpai!

388
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,060
I won't let you!

389
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,640
You!

390
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,520
Get out of here!

391
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,980
My back is big, too!

392
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,040
I won't lose!

393
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,420
The World Cup Memorial Police Station vs. Soccer Tournament is now over!

394
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,760
They have entered the long-term game of the V-goal method!

395
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,240
They're not letting go!

396
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,060
The ball is coming!

397
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,060
The ball is coming!

398
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,780
The ball is coming!

399
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,020
The ball is coming!

400
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,600
Both teams are playing the fierce Tsubateri!

401
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,380
Don't come near me!

402
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,300
Go away!

403
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,520
Go away!

404
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,820
Go away!

405
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,080
Don't come near me, either!

406
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,300
I'll beat you to death!

407
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,740
The player in this position can't get used to this additional power!

408
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,700
The player in this position can't get used to this additional power!

409
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:55,580
The player in this position can't get used to this additional power!

410
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,800
Go away!

411
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,280
You're obviously an otaku of the soccer world, aren't you?!

412
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,440
That's...

413
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,480
No way!

414
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,760
It's the World Cup match venue!

415
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:22,940
It's the World Cup match venue!

416
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,860
Senpai, please turn around!

417
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,820
Komachi, stop!

418
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,700
Stop! Stop!

419
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,620
No! I can't hear anything!

420
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,500
Throw it!

421
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,100
No! I can't hear anything!

422
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,160
Where's the ball?

423
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,960
Ryotsu, the ball!

424
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,720
I got it, Gonji!

425
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,640
Oh, no!

426
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,740
I'll finish you off!

427
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,640
Run over there!

428
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,180
Don't be so stubborn!

429
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,260
Take this, my cross-eyed shoot!

430
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:43,220
Take this, my cross-eyed shoot!

431
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,840
Goal! Goal! Goal!

432
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,200
I did it!

433
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,860
I... I lost...

434
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,480
I did it!

435
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,820
I won the V-goal!

436
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,380
The winner of the World Cup match,

437
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
the police station vs. the soccer tournament,

438
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:58,900
is...

439
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,360
the Ryotsu team!

440
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,280
Ryotsu! Ryotsu! Ryotsu!

441
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,980
We did it!

442
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,600
The World Cup ticket is ours!

443
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,440
Ryotsu!

444
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,580
Here, captain!

445
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,560
I got you!

446
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,720
We won!

447
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,760
Give me the ticket!

448
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:20,900
Give me the ticket!

449
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,560
Ryotsu, you bastard!

450
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,060
This is it!

451
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,300
This is what I wanted!

452
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,580
Hi, Ryo!

453
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,600
Higurashi!

454
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,740
Why is Higurashi here?

455
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,260
I guess Higurashi only wakes up once every four years, right?

456
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,460
Yet...

457
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,140
Why do we think so?

458
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,260
Why are you so angry?

459
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,000
Because...

460
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,280
Well...

461
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,560
I'm just astonished.

462
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,480
I'm going to ask while he's sitting at the end of the line...

463
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,640
etsu is going to come...

464
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,160
looks like there'll be a demise!

465
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,880
He's got good things to do!

466
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,520
But I can't wait to win!

467
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,040
If I do it well,

468
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,340
he'll be a valuable champion for me!

469
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,500
I have to do something to win the Tour of Japan, right?

470
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:07,860
His goal,

471
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,880
and my goal is to win the Tour of Japan...

472
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,200
and some of the tournaments will be held.

473
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,020
I see.

474
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,980
That's why they play soccer in Japan.

475
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,600
It's so exciting.

476
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,180
It's like the World Cup.

477
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,920
It's not like the World Cup.

478
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,420
It's the real World Cup.

479
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,920
O-re!

480
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,660
Giga!

481
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,200
The 2002 World Cup is being held.

482
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,760
O-re!

483
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,120
2002?

484
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,620
Not 2004?

485
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,100
How long?

486
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,460
I haven't slept for two years.

487
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,940
You woke me up.

488
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,600
I don't know. I don't know anything.

489
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,980
Ryota!

490
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,980
The World Cup ticket...

491
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,980
No way! No way! No way!

492
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,000
Wow!

493
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,940
Gyokumon!

494
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,660
Don't come near me.

495
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Nobody'll hit you!

496
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,000
Gyokumon! Gyokumon!

497
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,700
G-ge-get away! Get away!

498
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,740
Just, please do something!

499
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,440
YOSHIMA!

500
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,360
YOSHIMA!

501
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,740
You're too much!

502
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,460
Ryozu! You're the one!

503
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,140
I'm not the one who's been running around the church!

504
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,260
I'm not the one who's been running around the church!

505
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,000
Speaking of the past, it's your fault!

506
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,940
No, no, no!

507
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,500
No, no, no!

508
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,980
I'm sick of soccer!

509
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,600
I'm sick of soccer!

510
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm sick of soccer!

511
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,840
I'm sick of soccer!

512
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:33,820
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

513
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,800

Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

524
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,160
Hey, hey!

525
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,680
I don't know how many picks you've received so far...

526
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,520
You've locked the door too much!

527
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,440
You can't get in there, so you can't help it!

528
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,760
Besides, what are you going to protect by locking the door so much?

529
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,160
Next time, "The Man Who Locked Too Much"!

530
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Don't miss it!

531
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:03,920
Thank you for watching!
