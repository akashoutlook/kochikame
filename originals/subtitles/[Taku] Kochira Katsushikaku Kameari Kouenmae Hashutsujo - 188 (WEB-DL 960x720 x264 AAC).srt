1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
Team up with Sando

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,900
When you're watching TV

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,740
Make the room lighter and try to look away

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:25,300
It's like somebody's calling

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,180
After the rain

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,880
After the rain, I walked back and forth

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,860
I held my mother's hand

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,300
I felt a strange feeling at that time

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:57,160
So I walked on the black side of the Ake-dogai

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,400
I was a child once, but everyone has forgotten

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,320
The politician with a proud face

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,820
And the blue aunt above my eyes

13
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,120
Turn around and see that corner

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,660
I can see everyone

15
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,440
There is a wall there

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,760
Ah, I'm sure

17
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:26,860
There is a wall there

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone, come to our town

19
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,600
Thank you!

20
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,980
Another politician's bad habit?

21
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,720
Seriously, he only cares about his own good

22
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,220
He doesn't think about the people at all

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,220
I think that if you don't improve the bad system in Japan,

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,740
I don't think the bad habit will disappear

25
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,020
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,380
I'm talking about adult society

27
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,460
Oh, I see

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,160
Then it has nothing to do with me

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,520
As usual, you are indifferent to politics

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,980
In the world, it is easier to live without knowing anything

31
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,540
If you make a plastic model every day and read a manga, you will be happy

32
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,820
I envy such an idiot

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,620
What are you talking about?

34
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,560
Then it's like I'm living without thinking about anything

35
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,440
I'm thinking about politics

36
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,140
Oh, then tell me the name of the politician

37
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,480
What?

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,400
What's wrong? Don't you know?

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,040
First, Ryunosuke Akutagawa

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,920
Hikoroku Hayashiya

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,600
Mikimatsu Yanagi

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,900
Parco Hayashiya

43
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,780
There is no one correct!

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,580
There is no one correct!

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,940
Well, you should die without knowing for the rest of your life

46
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,000
You don't have to say such a disgusting thing

47
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,300
It's more difficult for you to understand politics than teaching the chimpanzees English

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,140
You don't have to say that

49
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,780
It's true

50
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,520
But it's not good to say that you don't know and throw it away right away

51
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,660
How about telling Ryo-chan that he understands it easily and carefully?

52
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,820
I see

53
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:28,400
Well, then, as you understand, I will tell you about food very carefully and kindly

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,160
Let's say there is an animal village here

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,040
We are the residents of the animal village

56
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,020
We are going to build a building in our village

57
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,500
We will choose a company to build there

58
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,860
Raise your hand if you want to make it

59
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,920
Yeah

60
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah

61
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,380
But in fact, the construction company has already decided

62
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,520
A lot of money flows to the mayor, the officials, and the politicians

63
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,380
And because the building will be built in tax

64
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,800
We will spend several times the real amount of budget

65
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,200
Then we will divide the money we have earned and earn it in the back

66
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,940
When the construction is over, the back money will not be included

67
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,400
So I will ask the mayor for the next construction forcibly

68
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,300
Of course, I will give you the money

69
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,460
Thank you very much, sir

70
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,500
The mayor will also earn a lot of money

71
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,320
So I will give you permission to build a lot of buildings

72
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,140
Yes, OK

73
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,540
Hahaha

74
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,980
To put it simply, it's like this

75
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,060
Do you understand?

76
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,540
Our tax money is like that

77
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,600
Millions of dollars are used for public construction every year

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,400
What?

79
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,480
Millions of dollars?

80
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,460
That's right

81
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,620
It's really used like that

82
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,160
Really?

83
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,860
It's hard

84
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,820
I'll tell everyone

85
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,020
Everyone knows

86
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,040
Only Ryo-chan doesn't know

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,620
Why don't the citizens get angry?

88
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,100
You can't complain about that

89
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,240
Even if money moves in an invisible place, the real feeling is thin

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,660
I'm giving up half

91
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,460
It's the same as saying yes to not complaining

92
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,500
It's such a bunch of people who just spilt the work that they worked with

93
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,760
It looks like a strange life

94
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,760
There's a election, right?

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,900
Election?

96
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,540
I see the election

97
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,140
That's right

98
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,580
In the election, vote for the person you think this person is

99
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,000
He will work for you

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,180
If that person acts, won't the crops go away?

101
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,440
It may not be that easy.

102
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,180
Look at this!

103
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,200
Who is the person you can trust?

104
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,200
Can you tell that easily?

105
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,720
I-I don't know...

106
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,420
Alright! I've decided!

107
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,780
I'm going to the election!

108
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:57,920
What?

109
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,660
Leave it to others.

110
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,060
If I become a politician, everything will be solved.

111
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,260
It's not like you're going to vote for a student council member.

112
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,620
That's right.

113
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,980
There are a lot of election funds in the election.

114
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,540
That's why, Reiko Nakagawa!

115
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,880
Can you give me a little bit of your money?

116
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,340
I thought that was the case!

117
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,900
I refuse!

118
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,900
Why do you have to go through such stupid things?

119
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,120
What do you mean, stupid?

120
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,200
I'm done with you.

121
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,940
Hey, Nakagawa-kun.

122
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,080
I refuse, too!

123
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,720
Why?

124
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,960
The motto of the Nakagawa Group is not to give money to any student council or candidate.

125
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,160
No way.

126
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,700
Is there no way?

127
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,960
No way.

128
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,100
I can't give it to anyone.

129
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,060
Are you sure you can't give it to anyone?

130
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,860
I'm sure.

131
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,700
I'm sure you can't!

132
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,260
Is it wrong for you to ask for so much money?

133
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,020
No matter how much you ask for it, I can't!

134
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,440
Men, do something about yourself!

135
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,760
Yo-chan, do you really think you'll be an elected candidate?

136
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,220
He's going so far...

137
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,700
But I'm worried about the future of Japan if you actually find it right.

138
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,700
I got it!

139
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,780
Thank you for waiting!

140
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,120
Oh, you're quick!

141
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,040
I'm the best!

142
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,840
If you want to run for election,

143
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,180
leave it to me.

144
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,100
The one who will be the first to win

145
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,020
is Congressman Daigoro?

146
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,280
Yes. From the small presidential election

147
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,960
to the US presidential election,

148
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,600
in every election,

149
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,840
I will definitely let the candidate

150
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,220
who will be the third to run for election

151
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:40,440
win.

152
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,420
Professor, leave it to me!

153
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,840
I will definitely give you

154
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,340
the red carpet!

155
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,620
Professor,

156
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,040
you sound good.

157
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,520
You really will let me win?

158
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,600
Of course!

159
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,300
Alright, I'll leave it to you.

160
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,760
Thank you!

161
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,980
Now, I would like to

162
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,720
start the election campaign.

163
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,140
Then,

164
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,380
let's go to the car.

165
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,420
By the way,

166
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,660
how much is the election funding?

167
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,480
We don't have that.

168
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,260
You don't have that?

169
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:16,820
No.

170
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,320
No?

171
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,640
No, it's fine.

172
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,720
Let's start from the election funding.

173
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,660
How?

174
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,100
The fastest way is to have a party.

175
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,040
You're encouraging the

176
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,300
Chief of Staff, the Chief of Staff.

177
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,120
You're encouraging the Chief of Staff, the Chief of Staff.

178
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,400
You're encouraging the Chief of Staff, the Chief of Staff.

179
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,900
Rolling Stones, Momus,

180
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,040
Sugerio and Fujiwara Norika.

181
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,660
Is this true?

182
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,420
I wonder.

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,500
It seems that the ticket is very popular.

184
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,900
Anyway,

185
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,300
let's go and see.

186
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:50,840
Anyway, let's go and see.

187
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,940
So,

188
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,000
It's too late.

189
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,860
I'm so anxious.

190
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,880
I'm so anxious.

191
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,320
I've been on the line for a long time.

192
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,000
We're in a big success.

193
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,600
We've got so many people.

194
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,800
We're in a big success.

195
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,140
Thank you for taking time to show us your work.

196
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,820
But today is really a mess.

197
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,160
But today is really a mess.

198
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,660
Thank you for the wonderful food.

199
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,280
Thank you for the wonderful food.

200
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,600
I hope you will enjoy the best.

201
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,720
I hope you will enjoy the best.

202
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,560
I hope you will enjoy the best.

203
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,940
We've been hanging around.

204
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,780
Ridge of the Golden Calf.

205
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,840
You're kind, aren't you?

206
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
You're a bad wuss, and you don't have to go back to school.

207
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,440
NO!

208
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,940
Let's play!!

209
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,220
What's with you?

210
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,460
You were drunk, so that's why you're here and you're gonna steal her from me, m'boy?

211
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,620
What the hell, you're such a scumbag!

212
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,460
That's a good point!!

213
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,100
"Do it, now!"

214
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,860
"Laaay!"

215
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,460
Take my life...

216
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:24,720
I'll put it in a zip-up thread...

217
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,460
"No!"

218
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,960
Take my life...

219
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,540
I'll put it in a zip-up thread...

220
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,460
♪ Love is a trap ♪

221
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,200
♪ I'm in danger ♪

222
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,260
Thank you for your help.

223
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,760
Please come to my house.

224
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,200
I want to thank you.

225
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,980
What are you talking about?

226
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,340
I'm glad you're not injured.

227
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,420
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,560
Are you a traveler?

229
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,140
Miss, I'm a traveler.

230
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,360
I'm not a traveler.

231
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,940
Please let me live in the car.

232
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,300
What is this?

233
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,160
Thank you for your attention.

234
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,640
Now, I will introduce the performers.

235
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,500
First, Mr. Taro Sugiryo, who appeared in the movie "Friendship".

236
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,540
Mr. Taro Sugiryo, who appeared in the movie "Friendship".

237
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,040
Taro Sugiryo, who appeared in the movie "Friendship".

238
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,680
I don't believe in Mr. Taro Sugiryo.

239
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,760
Next, Mr. Norika Fujiwara.

240
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,700
Mr. Norika Fujiwara, who appeared in the movie "Friendship".

241
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,100
This is different from Mr. Norika Fujiwara.

242
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,900
This is certainly Norika Fujiwara.

243
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,820
Please take a good look at the pamphlet.

244
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,880
Please take a good look at the pamphlet.

245
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,280
klfv

246
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,380
The letter is written as "Qual" instead of "Kaoru".

247
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,520
klfv

248
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,240
klfv

249
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:58,700
Gah!

250
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,540
I-I'm going to use my dirty hands!

251
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,260
It's like the pamphlet, so it can't be helped.

252
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,660
In this case, Rolling Stones and Morning Musume will also...

253
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,160
Thank you for waiting.

254
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,280
Now then, the second part, the start of the calligraphy show.

255
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,720
The singer is everyone's familiar...

256
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,600
Rolling Stones!

257
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,160
And the backdancer is...

258
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,580
Morning Musume!

259
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,940
The backdancer is...

260
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,600
I knew it.

261
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,720
He's too arrogant and angry.

262
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,860
Well then, let's hear it.

263
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,400
My Way!

264
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,760
Now!

265
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,940
I don't want to get involved, so let's go home.

266
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,920
That's right.

267
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,480
Well, as expected.

268
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,600
Yes, it was terrible.

269
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,140
But, teacher, now we have a perfect election budget.

270
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,380
I see.

271
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,820
I'm going to go to the election with such a look.

272
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,000
I will definitely, definitely win!

273
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,940
Teacher! Good morning!

274
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,160
How are you, teacher?

275
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,680
I am sorry to interrupt, but this office...

276
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,400
Yes, it's not so bad.

277
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,480
Speaking of Thor...

278
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,480
What is this poster?

279
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,360
I don't remember taking such pictures.

280
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,660
And why is it Raghavan?

281
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,220
It is an image strategy to get the vote.

282
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,340
The people of this city are deceived by these refreshing images.

283
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,720
So we used the computer to compile it.

284
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,920
I made a hiragana so that it was easy to remember the name.

285
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,500
Who bought this dharma?

286
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,000
Yes, it's me.

287
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,880
Ryouto sensei is a big power candidate.

288
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,700
I'm ashamed of you.

289
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,700
I'm sorry.

290
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,420
It's big.

291
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,860
Sensei, I'm going to ask for a discount.

292
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,400
Discount?

293
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,540
It's the "Niwa Akatsuki" I won.

294
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,360
That's right.

295
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,960
However, it doesn't matter how you make a election pledge.

296
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,340
There are few people who win and protect their pledges.

297
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,200
Therefore, it's good to have a speech that has an impact on the hearts of the people listening to it.

298
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,100
I'm an ally of the salaryman OL.

299
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,300
Japanese people work too hard.

300
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,020
The red moon I won is the one of the state.

301
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,220
They are forced to work 24 hours a day and have 3 hours of time for work.

302
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,740
They also receive two months of holidays.

303
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,880
I will make sure that this will be realized.

304
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,440
CG is 10000 yen to the younger people.

305
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,120
Video software is 150 yen.

306
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,960
Movie tickets 80 yen.

307
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,560
Academic there are two courses and a limited time.

308
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,980
Old school although现在 4學校。

309
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,160
I'll protect all this.

310
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,400
Dads, when I want to be a member of the government,

311
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,440
I will get my family's food after receiving the Government's food policy and I will avoid trouble and muddy food making at home.

312
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,960
Thank you, teacher!

313
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,800
You have a good schedule after this.

314
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,720
Please rest for about 20 minutes.

315
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,620
But I'm not sleeping with my hands in the air.

316
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,500
I'm showing this outside the car, so don't worry.

317
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,260
It's not worth it.

318
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,020
I'm back!

319
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,280
Camera, hurry up!

320
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,120
Teacher, as agreed.

321
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,980
Leave it to me. I have confidence in my acting skills.

322
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,660
I have confidence in my acting skills.

323
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,460
Hello, everyone.

324
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,020
Ryo-san, how are your hands?

325
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,640
I can't read them clearly.

326
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,440
I'm just working hard.

327
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,520
You're so thin. You're working hard.

328
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,240
Teacher, it's time for dinner.

329
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,080
Thank you for your hard work.

330
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,320
Only rice balls?

331
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,240
You're so fit.

332
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,240
If I die while exercising as a politician,

333
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,720
I'll be in trouble.

334
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,880
Wonderful.

335
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:14,580
Teacher!

336
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,040
A telegram from your family!

337
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,020
What's wrong?

338
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,220
My father...

339
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,780
My father has passed away.

340
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,140
He fought against the Byouma to support my victory.

341
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,980
It's too bad.

342
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,520
I'll definitely win for my crying father

343
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,200
and offer him a silver bowl of rice balls.

344
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,040
and offer him a silver bowl of rice balls.

345
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,840
Now you have 30,000 votes.

346
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,460
But, is it okay?

347
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,940
I killed your father without permission.

348
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,380
Don't worry about that.

349
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,140
Your father invited you to a hot spring far away from the people.

350
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,520
Don't come out until the election is over.

351
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,180
Don't come out until the election is over.

352
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,760
Don't come out until the election is over.

353
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,400
Teacher, thank you very much.

354
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,540
No, it's nothing.

355
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,160
I'm finally back.

356
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,960
I'm hungry.

357
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,120
I'm hungry.

358
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,040
How's the vote count?

359
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,740
Well, the Kisamachi Party is in the lead,

360
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,680
but the votes aren't enough.

361
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,860
If we get 100,000 votes, we'll be safe.

362
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,620
Leave it to me.

363
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,300
I have a good idea.

364
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:23,940
Mr. President,

365
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,920
Ryo-chan's political broadcast is starting!

366
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,520
I didn't expect him to be on TV

367
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,320
other than the incident.

368
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,100
Next, we'll broadcast

369
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,700
Mr. Ryo-chan's political broadcast.

370
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,940
Born in Asakusa, graduated from Senzoku High School,

371
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,220
15 times on the streets,

372
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,340
became a policeman,

373
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,260
and killed countless people.

374
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,160
He was executed 18 times.

375
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,100
He's making me embarrassed.

376
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,140
This is Mr. Kankichi Hatsuyoshi's political broadcast.

377
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,720
It's meaningless.

378
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,380
It's meaningless.

379
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,040
It's meaningless.

380
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,360
Welcome to today's meaningless show.

381
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,240
Here's a letter.

382
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,240
From Mr. Kankichi Ryo-chan.

383
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,540
Does this have any meaning?

384
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,220
Or not?

385
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,640
The chief told me

386
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,220
to be a little more normal.

387
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,240
Ready?

388
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,100
It doesn't mean anything.

389
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,680
What is this?

390
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,300
It seems to be mistaken for a variety show.

391
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,440
I expected it.

392
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,380
The votes are coming in.

393
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,900
I'll get a vote too.

394
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,880
Please write "Tanuki, Tanuki Saburo"

395
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,600
in the tomorrow's vote.

396
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,580
Please make the sleeping Kiroshiro a man.

397
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,200
Please make the sleeping Kiroshiro a man.

398
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,140
Please make the sleeping Kiroshiro a man.

399
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,620
On one hand,

400
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:53,900
Mr. Kankichi Ryo-chan

401
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,540
is thinking like this.

402
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,900
First, Tanuki.

403
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,780
You can't lie to your wife and go to a beautiful place and a hot spring.

404
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,120
No, no.

405
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,440
Ah, is that really a curse?

406
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,840
No, that's not a magic either.

407
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,580
I'm sorry.

408
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,220
Sleepy.

409
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:19,800
You have a pool-like bath at home, but you can't go to the bathhouse and get your old man's back washed.

410
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,720
No, no.

411
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,440
Why are you sleeping?

412
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
Oh, no!

413
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,580
Hanamaru candidate.

414
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,660
What is it?

415
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,580
I'm saying that men and women are the same, but I'm not doing anything.

416
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,440
I have to do everything from water-based laundry to children's class.

417
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,380
No, no.

418
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,240
You said it well.

419
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,220
It's not something to avoid.

420
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,800
No, no.

421
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,560
Then, to everyone, come on, Kameari.

422
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,120
No, no.

423
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,220
No, no.

424
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,960
Top no.

425
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,620
No, no.

426
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,400
No, no.

427
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,500
No, no.

428
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,020
No, no.

429
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,220
No, no.

430
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,040
No, no.

431
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,560
Donna Deba?

432
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,160
No, no.

433
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,060
No, no.

434
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,600
Dynatti?

435
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,240
No, no.

436
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,940
Hanamaru?

437
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,980
No, no.

438
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,660
Yes, sir, please.

439
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,320
No, no.

440
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,920
Stop it! Stop it!

441
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,900
Where are you going?

442
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,780
You pervert! Stop it!

443
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
What's that?

444
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,560
That's your armpit too!

445
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,480
Kiss me!

446
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,760
Bye!

447
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,000
I fell!

448
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,620
You're so mean!

449
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,540
You're so mean!

450
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,440
You're so mean!

451
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,860
You're so mean!

452
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,740
The voting starts at 7pm.

453
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,480
Mr. Uda, what do you think?

454
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,780
Mr. Uda, what do you think?

455
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,340
The voting starts at 7pm.

456
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,560
Hurry up!

457
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,920
Don't worry, teacher.

458
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,180
Look!

459
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,500
The computer predicts 99% of the votes.

460
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:00,800
The computer predicts 99% of the votes.

461
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:01,940
I see.

462
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,940
It was a tough battle.

463
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,020
The media is waiting for you.

464
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,620
It's time for the climax.

465
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,740
Sorry to keep you waiting.

466
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

467
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,780
Everyone, please step forward!

468
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,720
Is this angle OK for the dharma?

469
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,980
Is this angle OK for the dharma?

470
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,520
OK. Perfect.

471
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,940
Mr. Moriguchi, what do you think?

472
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,360
I think it's a wise choice for the people.

473
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,000
I think it's a wise choice for the people.

474
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,480
What?

475
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,500
Mr. Tokio, you've just finished the voting.

476
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,380
Mr. Tokio, you've just finished the voting.

477
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,660
Mr. Kiyoshiro, you've got 650,115 votes.

478
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,340
Mr. Kiyoshiro, you've got 650,115 votes.

479
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,740
Mr. Yoshiko, you've got 580,3585 votes.

480
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:44,780
What?

481
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:44,960
What?

482
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,780
Mr. Saburo Kanuki got 5502113 votes

483
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:51,900
Mr. Saburo Kanuki got 5502113 votes

484
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,260
Mr. Kan-Kichi Ryotsu got 1 vote

485
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,400
Mr.Kan-Kichi Ryotsu got 1 vote

486
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,460
Mr. Kiyoshiro?

487
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,960
Is this right?

488
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,820
Sorry tomorrow.

489
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,400
Mr. Kiyoshiro, you've got 6 wishes.

490
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,800
Mr. Kiyoshiro, you've got 6 wishes.

491
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,480
H-hey, stop it!

492
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,540
Your viewers are out of brings.

493
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:12,740
This means that there are only a few of us.

494
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,620
So, the candidate who was very popular seems to have disappeared like fireworks.

495
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,440
How about this, Mr. Moriguchi?

496
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,480
I don't want you to underestimate politics, but it's scary.

497
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,720
What the hell is this?

498
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,620
I got enough votes on the data.

499
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,840
Why is it seven votes?

500
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,520
The teacher must perform such a full-scale performance.

501
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,460
Even if he receives such a vote, it will not be able to reach the vote.

502
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,080
The people are serious, so they will not vote for such a person.

503
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,380
Everyone, this is the end.

504
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,360
That's right!

505
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,340
No way!

506
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,120
So,

507
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,380
Ryozu Kakushi,

508
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,300
I came back while being embarrassed.

509
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,260
Well, the election is a water problem.

510
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,860
I thought I might have to work hard at the police station again tomorrow.

511
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,400
What are you talking about?

512
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,260
You are no longer a policeman.

513
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,760
What?

514
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,280
If you run for the state, the civil servants will lose their jobs.

515
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,220
It's Article 90 of the Civil Servant Law.

516
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,500
In other words, you became unemployed at the same time as the Rakusen.

517
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,740
What?

518
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,100
Did you not know, senpai?

519
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,580
Poor thing, it will be hard from now on.

520
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,960
Chief, can't you do something about it?

521
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,020
Hey, let go!

522
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,260
There will be no use of my power at this rate.

523
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,020
I'm not a general!

524
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,880
Don't be suffocated! It's annoying!

525
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,180
Please, chief!

526
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,420
Do something about it!

527
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,220
I hate the election!

528
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,960
What?

529
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,800
What is this?

530
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,940
What is this?

531
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,420
What is this?

532
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:04,940
My fingers hurt

533
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,420
I'll just brush my eyebrows

534
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,060
and then I'll go to the station

535
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,740
DASH DASH DASH

536
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,240
I'll sleep on my dad's back

537
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,960
on the main train

538
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,020
This week, I'll be doing my best

539
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,200
I'll be doing my best

540
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,520
I'm putting the bucket in one hand

541
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,400
but I'm feeling a bit hot

542
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,140
I'm feeling a bit cold

543
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,120
I'm feeling a bit irritated

544
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,520
but I'm feeling a bit irritated

545
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,280
I'll get over it

546
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:46,080
Every day is no problem

547
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,540
If the hot train passes through the blue

548
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,760
Every day is no problem

549
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,520
I'll get better with a sleeping pillow

550
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,380

556
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,240
What?

557
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,340
The cash carrier that was carrying the bonus was attacked!

558
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,720
Damn it!

559
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,200
Taking away my precious bonus!

560
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,920
I'll take back anything and everything!

561
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,140
Huh?

562
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,360
You're a plumber, you idiot!

563
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,220
Why are you all accusing the culprit?

564
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,720
Next time on Bonus Soudatsusen Five

565
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,000
Please take care of me!

566
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,680
There's a turtle over there

567
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,640
There must be a turtle

568
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,620
Everyone come to our town

569
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,720
