00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,160
"The Unwanted Cat"

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,240
When you watch TV,

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,780
make your room bright and

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,960
try to look away.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:13,680
"The Unwanted Cat"

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:15,920
"The Unwanted Cat"

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,000
Come to me,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,380
if you're a poor man!

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,380
I'm not here,

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,980
but I'm worried.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,140
Come to me,

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,060
if you're a poor man!

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,160
"The Unwanted Cat"

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,660
"The Unwanted Cat"

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:45,520
"The Unwanted Cat"

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,800
Come to me!

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but don't worry

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:11,960
Look, the red cloud is burning

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,620
It'll be alright eventually

20
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,580
You know, right?

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,220
You know, you know!

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,720
If you know, then just follow me!

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,120
Ryo-san, you're getting bigger!

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,720
You idiot!

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,740
I'll kill you right now!

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,560
Stop killing me!

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,020
I'll see you later, boss!

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,700
Ryo-san, what did you do this time?

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,940
He found the place where he was playing at the game center

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,580
That's part of the patrol!

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,240
That's amazing, Ryo-san!

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,940
I'm the one who got caught

33
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,400
I see. It's a pretty fun patrol

34
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,500
This time, take me with you!

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,140
Of course, boss! It'll be fun!

36
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,740
I'm a fool!

37
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,720
I see

38
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,480
I finally got him to forgive me

39
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,340
If I'm found by the chief,

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,140
He'll become really angry at me!

41
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,800
The chief hates me

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,400
He's always mad at me

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,600
He doesn't even look at me when I'm working seriously

44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,280
Every time, every time, every time

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,340
When I'm on a work trip,

46
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,440
Only when I'm feeling a little better.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,460
You big idiot!

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,980
That's why it's good.

49
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,220
If you're going to be scolded, you'd better do what you like.

50
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,420
It's like a rebellious child.

51
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,140
Then what?

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,660
Have you ever skipped a single second of your work?

53
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,300
That's...

54
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,220
One second is...

55
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,260
It's not like that, but...

56
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,400
Look! Even if you skip the same time, you won't be scolded and I will be scolded.

57
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,380
The manager hates me.

58
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,780
Excuse me.

59
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,100
How do I get to the Kameari Library?

60
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,280
The traffic light ahead is on the right.

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,820
It'll be noticeable, so you'll understand soon.

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,960
Thank you very much.

63
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,100
I'm the one who taught you.

64
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,200
You should thank me.

65
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,700
I'm the one who's being told that.

66
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,440
Always.

67
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,920
That's not true.

68
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,360
I've told my seniors about it.

69
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,080
Even if I do it seriously, in the end, I'll be scolded.

70
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,340
It seems like it's useless to say anything now.

71
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,260
Let's leave it for a while.

72
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,220
Go in, go in, go in, go in.

73
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,520
Go in, go in, go in, go in.

74
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,320
Professor Ezaki

75
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,040
This is the gorilla and his friends.

76
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,520
It's a coincidence, isn't it?

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,580
We're always here.

78
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,720
It's strange that we met here.

79
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,080
If you have time, will you go with me for a while?

80
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,300
Gorilla-kun.

81
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,160
I'm working right now.

82
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,020
I don't have that much time.

83
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,940
That's not true.

84
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,860
I'm trying to help Gorilla-kun so much.

85
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,540
It's not good to be involved with you.

86
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,740
Well, it can't be helped.

87
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,720
If only for a while.

88
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,240
『 Manju and Jumbo Manju 』

89
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,500
Do you want to eat manju first?

90
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,620
Here you are.

91
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,900
Just a manju?

92
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,620
...

93
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,380
No way.

94
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,440
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,820
That's a new generation supplement.

96
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,500
Jumbo Manju.

97
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,340
Jumbo Manju?

98
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,320
No way it's going to make my body bigger if I eat it.

99
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,120
Ping-pong table tennis!

100
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,020
All sportsmen think they have a good shape

101
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,980
That's right, mama! It's a revolutionary invention called "Sacrificing Victory"!

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,660
That's a good thing about doping!

103
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,180
Well, that's one way of saying it.

104
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,600
When you grow up, your life will change, Gorilla.

105
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:32,980
What?

106
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,980
You've been hiding in the shadows of people and lived a simple life!

107
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,720
I'm jealous...

108
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,900
You can eat only this jumbo manju!

109
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,700
Bak! Bak! Bak! Bak!

110
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,280
Ah! That's a great sportsman!

111
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,440
He's popular among girls!

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,220
What's wrong with him...

113
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,760
This great invention, the jumbo manju, is...

114
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,880
...now in my hands!

115
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,060
One is not enough, big guy. Two is not enough, big guy.

116
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,560
Three is...

117
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,360
It doesn't taste bad either.

118
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,260
What?

119
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,200
It's not like you're a gorilla.

120
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,200
What?

121
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,680
Your body is so...

122
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,360
...much-much.

123
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,640
Not at all.

124
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,460
You're so...

125
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:20,600
...much-much.

126
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,020
Not at all?

127
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
As I thought, you shouldn't be a gorilla, you should be a human.

128
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm a human!

129
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,820
You're late, Ryo-san.

130
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,840
Damn it!

131
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,260
Ryo-chan!

132
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,740
Senior!

133
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,340
What? It seems like you guys have become smaller.

134
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,040
It's not that! Senior has grown up!

135
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,300
What?!

136
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,980
It seems like my jumbo manju is working.

137
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,280
Jumbo manju?

138
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,820
I think it's probably a new invention by Professor Ezaki.

139
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,800
I see! But Ryo-san, you're doing good.

140
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,180
He's got long legs and looks like a NBA player!

141
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,760
R-really?

142
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,480
No, he's pretty cool!

143
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,900
But if you guys change your perspective like this,

144
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,960
you'll have to forgive all the rude things you've done to me before.

145
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,560
I wonder if I can forgive them.

146
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,480
You've grown so big, even your heart and body.

147
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,560
I wish I could, but...

148
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,920
I have a favor to ask.

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
- Me? - Yes.

150
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,040
When you grow up, your life will change, Goriya!

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,680
Here it comes.

152
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,740
What kind of voice is that?

153
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,020
- Here you go. - Thank you.

154
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,840
It's a cheap meal.

155
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,440
It's decided.

156
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:58,520
N-no way!

157
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,180
And what's that?

158
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,580
- Yosuke! - Senpai!

159
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,700
- It's bigger than before! - Oh no!

160
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,860
This is going to be a daily routine.

161
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,280
I'm sure you'll be late.

162
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,060
I guess so. I'm going.

163
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,200
Where are you going?

164
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,720
Hey, Bram. How's the cake?

165
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,280
Oh, just as good as before.

166
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,920
This is faster.

167
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,000
Move, move, move!

168
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,340
Bram, Bram.

169
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:42,800
Come on!

170
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,780
Bram, Bram.

171
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:45,900
Come on, Bram.

172
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,320
Bram, Bram.

173
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,460
Hey, Goriya.

174
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,920
It sounds like you're having a good time with the jambo-manju.

175
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,960
How does it feel to have grown up?

176
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,040
You're not talking about that!

177
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,940
It's too big!

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
You have to change your body size.

179
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,140
Come on, Goriya.

180
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,460
What's that?

181
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:09,520
What's this?

182
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,540
This is a super ultra hyper jumbo manju made with a concentrated supplement.

183
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,360
Do you want to try it?

184
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,880
No! The manju will get smaller!

185
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,260
No, it's only getting bigger.

186
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,120
That's a problem. Do you want me to live with this size for a long time?

187
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,600
No, it's not that size for a long time!

188
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,900
Huh? Will it go back to normal naturally?

189
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,560
That's also wrong.

190
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,660
If you eat one jumbo manju, it's a little big.

191
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,560
If you eat two, it's a little big.

192
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,260
If you eat three, it's...

193
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,620
If you eat three, it's...

194
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,840
If you eat three, it's...

195
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,200
If you eat three, it's a little bigger!

196
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,580
What?

197
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440
It's too big!

198
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,520
What?

199
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,680
What's going on?

200
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,480
It's a monster!

201
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,780
Yes, this is the exit in front of the park.

202
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,840
What? A monster is swimming in the river?

203
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,640
What?

204
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,100
It's alive!

205
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,240
Nesiko!

206
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,100
It's a turtle!

207
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,400
It's a turtle!

208
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,640
It's a turtle!

209
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,640
It's a turtle!

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,100
It's a turtle!

211
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,940
It's a turtle!

212
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,240
It's a turtle!

213
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,300
I don't understand.

214
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,560
Where did it come from?

215
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,700
Anyway, let's evacuate the citizens to a safe place!

216
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,200
Hurry!

217
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:45,920
Hurry!

218
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,700
Hurry!

219
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,240
Hurry!

220
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,400
What are you doing?

221
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,420
You're not here, are you?

222
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,440
This is noisy.

223
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,440
I should look around.

224
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,200
It's there!!!

225
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,680
You're not here, are you?

226
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,020
You're not here, are you?

227
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,700
Where are you?

228
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,740
No, no, no!

229
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,560
No, no, no!

230
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,640
"Fought for a

231
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,900
"Fought for a

232
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,020
"Fought for a

233
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,180
"Fought for a

234
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,200
"Fought for a

235
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,660
"Fought for a

236
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:23,680
"Fought for a

237
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:23,820
"Fought for a

238
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:31,240
My beloved, what do you think of my special uniform?

239
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,180
Please come, Bu-chan!

240
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,040
Senpai, what do you think of the special uniform?

241
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,420
It fits perfectly.

242
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,780
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Nakagawa.

243
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,080
We have arranged the daily necessities for the time being.

244
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,580
If there is anything else you need, please let me know.

245
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,460
I have to stay here for a while.

246
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,480
Well, it's convenient because the room is close.

247
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
Even so, everyone is small.

248
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,720
It's like a well-made figure.

249
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:57,940
It's like a well-made figure.

250
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,860
It's about the future, Ohara-kun.

251
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,040
Director, I will take charge of the director.

252
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,000
Please take care of Ryotsu so that he can work as a detective.

253
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,720
But even if it's a job, it's not that kind of thing.

254
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Ryotsu should have something to do.

255
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,540
I'm sure something.

256
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,800
Director!

257
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,400
What's wrong?

258
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,360
Carrier accident!

259
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,020
What?

260
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,240
Ryotsu, it's work!

261
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,240
What?

262
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,340
Hey, how about that?

263
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,620
The carrier is broken.

264
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,160
Don't worry. I'm a policeman.

265
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,960
It's dangerous, so everyone get down.

266
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,080
It's like the first gauge railway model.

267
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,720
This is really before I woke up.

268
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,780
When the steam train ran conditioning, he was having trouble getting to the correct track.

269
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,720
It's done.

270
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,120
Eh? Is it you? The cause of the traffic jam?

271
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,240
Right?

272
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,380
Can't be helped.

273
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,080
I can't help but feel sorry for you.

274
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,140
Look here!

275
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,560
Everyone, get off the way.

276
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,500
Go. Go!

277
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,560
What? The ?

278
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,100
Hey, come down.

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,960
What? Did you want to catch an octopus with the TV?

280
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,200
Did you get hurt?

281
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,420
Can't you get down?

282
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,740
Ryo-san, help me!

283
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,920
Ryo-san, I'm begging you!

284
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,320
Ryo-san, help me!

285
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,520
Ryo-san, it's a big problem!

286
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,020
I was busy today as well.

287
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,080
Well, I guess I'll go to bed.

288
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,200
What's wrong, chief?

289
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,740
Sometimes it's good to sleep while looking at the stars outside.

290
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,560
I think that's a good thing.

291
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,000
You seem to be working hard every day.

292
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,280
Yeah, I can't skip work because it stands out.

293
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,240
The chief of the office is very happy with your work lately.

294
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,780
If he's happy, I want him to show his face a little more.

295
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,120
Like, "I want a feast of 1000 yakiniku."

296
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,740
You can't make it a special treat for yourself all of a sudden.

297
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,160
There are other staff at work, too.

298
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,380
You can make it a special treat for me.

299
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,460
It's a special treat.

300
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,000
He's here!

301
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,620
What's going on here?

302
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,880
"I want a feast of 1000 yakiniku."

303
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,700
"I want a feast of 1000 yakiniku."

304
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,200
I want a feast of 1000 yakiniku.

305
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,360
The chief of the office is going to give me a thank-you letter.

306
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm so glad.

307
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,900
"Thank you?"

308
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,660
That's right.

309
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,060
"Thank you".

310
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,420
I would like to thank you on behalf of the Katsushika and the citizens for your new work.

311
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,360
Thank you.

312
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,900
Katsushika's President, Tonda Gomez.

313
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,460
Thank you? Is this all you have?

314
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,020
100 rice and 100 million yen in cash?

315
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,300
Good job!

316
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,920
You've got a lot of people, and you only have one of these?

317
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,680
You're eating a sign for the emergency every day!

318
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,280
Ohara-kun!

319
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,080
Hey, Ryotsu! Don't get carried away!

320
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,600
I'm grateful for the thanks you've received!

321
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,080
I understand.

322
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,460
If you don't reward me, I won't work anymore.

323
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,460
But I might get in the way of the citizens' lives.

324
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,840
Idiot! You're still a policeman!

325
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,120
It's better to be a policeman.

326
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,620
Hey, where are you going?

327
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,220
Where are you going, Ryotsu?

328
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,620
Senpai, he left...

329
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,800
Ryo-chan...

330
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,780
If this goes on, I'll survive on my own!

331
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,080
Koji was late and got drunk!

332
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,060
I'll be saved!

333
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,840
Huh? Leave it to me!

334
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,840
Eizi!

335
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,160
Hurry up and fix it!

336
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,100
Cut!

337
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,180
Good! Perfect!

338
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,520
Thank you!

339
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,960
I'll leave the fish to you!

340
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,800
Okay!

341
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,140
I'm tired!

342
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,540
Good work!

343
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,880
Senpai, good work!

344
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,100
Yeah.

345
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,860
What's the schedule for tomorrow?

346
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,080
Tomorrow is the guest of the elementary school sports club and the cleaning of the department in front of the station.

347
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,820
The maintenance of the roof of the Tokyo Dome and the shooting of the Dogira vs. Mecha Dogira.

348
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,220
That's the continuation of our shooting.

349
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,000
That's a lot of work.

350
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,060
There's a rumor that we'll earn our annual salary in a day.

351
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,840
Senpai, you're amazing!

352
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,480
I'm doing hundreds of people's work alone.

353
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,680
It's a matter of course.

354
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,020
I'm tired, so I'll go to bed today.

355
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,920
See you tomorrow.

356
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,420
Yeah!

357
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,300
Good night, senpai!

358
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,200
I'll be better!

359
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,900
Well, then, introduce your friends.

360
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,020
On the way to the program, an emergency press conference will be held from the prime minister's office.

361
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,600
W, what is it?

362
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,880
Emergency communications have just come in from President America.

363
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,720
In ten hours, a large-duty meteorite is going to fall on Earth.

364
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,800
And the meteorite army will fall precisely on Earth.

365
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,200
A new location has been discovered.

366
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,740
That location is the Katsushikaku in Tokyo, Kameari!

367
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,680
Kameari?

368
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,900
I wonder if we can get it done by Ryochi, Ohara-kun.

369
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,680
Even if you say meteorites, each one of them look small.

370
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,280
There is no other way.

371
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,000
Ryochi will do something about it.

372
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,500
What? Meteorites?

373
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,120
The price will change depending on the size.

374
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,540
Idiot! Don't be so serious, Ryochi!

375
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,360
The residents of Kameari have already started to evacuate.

376
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,880
Why don't you get a part-time job?

377
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,920
It's better to protect the Kameari town than that!

378
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,540
We're also living here, chief.

379
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,980
We're starving, so we're going to have to pay a lot of money.

380
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,420
I understand.

381
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,820
I'll do what you say.

382
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,640
Let's hear what you have to say.

383
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,060
Chief, please don't make Ryochi feel bad.

384
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,480
It's fine. It's fine.

385
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,700
Well, I'll have a 1,000 serving of Otoro sushi,

386
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,560
1,000 servings of grilled meat from the Matsuzaka-class,

387
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,720
and a 1,000 serving of Chinese food as dessert.

388
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,380
If you'll let me eat it every day for a year, I'll take it.

389
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,580
Idiot!

390
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,660
You're still being polite because you're obsessed with the weakness of others!

391
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,080
There are other ways.

392
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,280
I don't need your help anymore!

393
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:14,860
Go!

394
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,080
Ohara-kun!

395
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:26,120
Ohara-kun, what are you going to do?

396
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,040
I'm sorry.

397
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,440
Ryochi is just about to...

398
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,300
Soon, a number of meteorites will fall in this area.

399
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,760
It's dangerous, so please evacuate immediately.

400
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,540
I repeat, a number of meteorites will fall in this area soon.

401
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,980
It's dangerous, so please evacuate immediately.

402
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,160
Are you still there?

403
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,000
Ryo-chan, do you remember the thank-you letter we received from the general manager?

404
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,920
Thank-you letter?

405
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,400
That is what President Ohara asked the general manager for.

406
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,620
What did he say?

407
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,140
I can't raise the salary immediately, but I want to at least make Ryo-chan's salary.

408
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,660
Hey!

409
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:16,720
The person who asked the chief and the police chief to keep Ryo-san in the Kazushika office was Chief Ohara.

410
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,100
Chief Ohara?

411
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,020
I think you hate Chief Ohara, but that's not true. Chief Ohara loves you.

412
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,220
Oh, they're already here. You guys, evacuate quickly! Hurry!

413
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,680
Roger that, Ryo-san.

414
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,760
There they are!

415
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,300
Get out of here!

416
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,480
Gah!

417
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,120
Look! Chief Ryotsu is shooting back the meteorite!

418
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,320
Ryotsu!

419
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,260
We just received some new information.

420
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:23,000
We found that the center of this meteorite army is a giant meteorite, not a gas.

421
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,220
The diameter of this giant meteorite is almost the same as the Kamiari district, and the damage caused by its fall is...

422
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,720
Tokyo's disappearance?

423
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:32,940
Ah!

424
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,180
Ah!

425
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,320
Tokyo's disappearance!

426
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
We need to evacuate Ryotsu!

427
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,680
Damn it! They're still coming!

428
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,680
Ryotsu!

429
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,320
Ryotsu! It's over! The giant meteorite is coming! Run away now! Hurry!

430
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,220
How big is the giant meteorite?

431
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,420
It's about the same size as the Kamiari district. Tokyo will be destroyed!

432
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,540
What did you say?

433
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,720
Run away, Ryotsu! Run away with full power!

434
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,240
It's the Super Ultra Hyper Jumbo Manju!

435
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,520
That's right!

436
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,700
Over there!

437
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,300
Ezaki!

438
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,420
Oh, it's Gorilla-kun!

439
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,760
Do you have Hyper Manju?

440
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,380
If you have Hyper, there's a lot here!

441
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,060
I'll take all of it!

442
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,760
You should evacuate quickly too!

443
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,660
Gah!

444
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,700
Gah!

445
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,670
Gah!

446
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,530
Dyamu!

447
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,890
Gah!

448
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,190
Gah!

449
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,490
Dyamu!

450
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:49,770
Gah!

451
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,410
Gah!

452
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:50,830
Gah!

453
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,130
Gah!

454
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:52,810
Gah!

455
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,690
Gah!

456
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,030
Gah!

457
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:55,510
Gah!

458
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:55,530
Gah!

459
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:56,850
Gah!

460
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:00,990
Gah!

461
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,170
Good job.

462
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:06,690
Good!

463
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,230
Is that it?

464
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,250
Gyaaaaa!

465
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,210
Please watch over the head!

466
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,730
Gyaaaaa!

467
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,670
We did it! The meteorite's orbit has changed!

468
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,930
The Moon Dome since the center of the Earth is saved!

469
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,450
We're saved!

470
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,530
Ryozu, you did a great job!

471
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,850
We did it, Bujou!

472
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,930
Now, Ryozu the police chief, who saved humanity, is back on Earth...

473
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,430
Could it be...

474
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,850
Is this Bujou?

475
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,570
That's impossible!

476
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,790
You're fired!

477
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:33,470
At that time I felt some kind of strange feeling

478
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:39,490
That's why, I came along the street at daybreak

479
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,530
And walked only in the street light

480
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:53,190
Everyone was just a young child, but everybody had forgotten

481
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,870
A politician with a great face

482
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,910
And a silhouette in his eyes

483
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,470
Don't go up there, old lady!

484
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:06,010
Turn around and look at that corner

485
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,710
You'll see everyone there

486
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,470
There's a turtle over there

487
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,270
Ah, there must be a turtle

488
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,390
Everyone, come to our town

489
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,490
Thank you!

490
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,530
What?

491
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,330
You call coffee "South American bean soup"?

492
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,090
If you force me to say it in Japanese, it's hard to understand!

493
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:42,170
I'm really into Japanese, but why is Kami-san an American?

494
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,230
Next time, "Yamato Damashii Hozonkai"

495
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:46,970
Thank you!

496
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,830
There's a turtle over there

497
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,650
Ah, there must be a turtle

498
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:58,390
Everyone, come to our town

499
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,970
Thank you!
