Thank you!

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,240
Yaaay!

24
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,500
Yaaay!

25
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,620
Oh no!

26
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,320
The winner is Sakonji-san from Katsushika!

27
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,540
Cheers!

28
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,780
This year was our one-two finish.

29
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,160
Yeah, but it was only 5000 yen, and last year it was 30,000 yen.

30
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,460
Speaking of which, I feel like the trophy has shrunk.

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,380
Hey Ryotsu, that guy...

32
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,500
No way!

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,480
Wait, don't rush!

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,280
What?

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,580
If you're alive, you'll do something good!

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
Let me go!

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,040
Sakonji!

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,940
R-Ryotsu...

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,280
It's okay, just stand up and shake hands.

40
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,920
Okay, let's do this!

41
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,420
I'm fine now.

42
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,160
I can't believe I'm dying trying to save someone's life...

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,520
I just came here to get myself fired up!

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,680
Don't let go of my hand!

45
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,020
Sorry, sorry.

46
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,320
I was getting fired up because I was starting a new business.

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,360
A new business?

48
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,600
Thank you very much!

49
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,400
It's not a mistake, but he was trying to save me.

50
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,540
Come to my store tomorrow.

51
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,540
I'll make you a taco as much as you want.

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,620
A taco?

53
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,860
This is a Mexican style taco.

54
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,200
This one's pretty good.

55
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,400
It's my first time eating it, but it's pretty good.

56
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,280
You're going to sell this?

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,920
Yes. My name is Señor Tacota.

58
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,680
I've been a big fan of tacos since I was a kid.

59
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:54,840
I used to be a pizza chef.

60
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,540
But in Japan, tacos are very famous.

61
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,200
Even if you order tacos from a pizza shop,

62
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,000
they're sold out.

63
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,440
I made tacos myself when I was home,

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,160
but when I was still working, I couldn't do it.

65
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,440
That's when I thought,

66
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,280
"Pizzas used to be a major dish."

67
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,660
That's the trend of the delivery pizza,

68
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,300
and there are no more people who don't know about it.

69
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,640
That's right.

70
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,220
Why don't we start a delivery of tacos?

71
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,640
I thought about it.

72
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,020
So I decided to start this restaurant.

73
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,140
I see.

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
I found something interesting here.

75
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,640
You said tacos were delicious earlier, didn't you?

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,700
Actually, I was looking for a delivery man who seemed to be strong enough.

77
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm not kidding.

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,900
We don't have much time either.

79
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,920
We're going home, Sagonji.

80
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,440
Wait!

81
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,800
How about 10,000 yen for the hourly wage?

82
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,240
10,000 yen for the hourly wage?

83
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,180
100,000 yen for 10 hours a day for 100,000 yen.

84
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,980
1,000,000 yen for 10 days.

85
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,620
3,000,000 yen for a month.

86
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,820
You're so enthusiastic about the spread of tacos.

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,780
I'll lend you my strength.

88
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,940
Thank you.

89
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,460
Will you do it?

90
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,180
Sagonji.

91
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,580
Yes.

92
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,160
Amigo, let's open it now.

93
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,740
Amigo.

94
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,060
Now, the delivery tacos are ready.

95
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,440
Tako-san and Mutao, today is the opening day.

96
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,920
Tacos?

97
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Shall we get on the road?

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,420
Yeah.

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,560
Actually, there is a big problem here.

100
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
It's a nice place.

101
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll get to know it once I deliver them.

102
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,820
Yes. Tako-san and Mutao.

103
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,420
Well, I'm okay if I do it here.

104
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,460
I'll deliver it to you right away.

105
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,040
Tako-san and Mutao.

106
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,140
Captain!

107
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,560
Yes!

108
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,840
Here it is.

109
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,460
It doesn't even take 5 minutes to get here.

110
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm counting on you.

111
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,140
I'm ready!

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,060
Good!

113
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,580
There is no time.

114
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:14,560
I'm only 4 steps ahead.

115
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,380
What is this elevator?

116
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,120
I can only go once.

117
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,960
I'm getting off.

118
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,760
Let me down.

119
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,400
Damn it.

120
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,380
The stairs are faster.

121
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:42,840
It took me 30 minutes to get down.

122
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,520
I have to hurry.

123
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,620
The customers are waiting.

124
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm home.

125
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,540
You are late.

126
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,560
The customers are calling you many times.

127
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,680
I know.

128
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,100
It took too much time to go down to the first floor.

129
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
I told you.

130
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,620
That is the big problem of this shop.

131
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,460
Too big!

132
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,000
It's almost fatal.

133
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,900
Why did you open the shop here?

134
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,120
Well, look.

135
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,160
What?

136
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,360
The contract of the mortgage of this shop.

137
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,260
I want to rent this place on the B floor.

138
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,540
That is, on the basement floor.

139
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,020
Yes.

140
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,260
The basement floor?

141
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:20,760
Yes.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,920
What is the basement floor here?

143
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,920
Look at the B floor on that document.

144
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,880
Huh?

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,540
Here.

146
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,140
It says B floor.

147
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,400
However, this is not B.

148
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,220
It is 6.

149
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,280
It is 61.

150
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,540
Yes.

151
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,240
If you look closely, it is 6.

152
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,040
What?

153
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,680
You didn't notice it immediately.

154
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,280
After the contract is over,

155
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,260
I leave the shop construction to someone else.

156
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
I went on a business trip to the real Mexico.

157
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,960
However...

158
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,340
What is this?

159
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,660
When I came back from the press, the construction was already finished.

160
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,060
That's right.

161
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,380
The problem is the distance to the ground.

162
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,720
If I could go down to the ground by motorcycle all at once...

163
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,420
On the stairs?

164
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,320
No way.

165
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,060
What?

166
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,360
There is only one person who can do it.

167
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,000
Now, I will deliver the package to you in a super high-speed motorcycle.

168
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,140
I'm going.

169
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,000
What is this?

170
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,780
Why am I wearing such clothes?

171
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,280
Are you all right?

172
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,160
He doesn't look like he's riding a motorcycle.

173
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,580
Well, I'll see.

174
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,160
Yes, Takuhai Tacos Monamucho.

175
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,540
Yes, yes, I will deliver it immediately.

176
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,400
Tacos Nicho.

177
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:36,820
Yes.

178
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Honda, it's your turn.

179
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,000
Eh?

180
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,980
Do I carry it?

181
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,240
That's why I called you, Logan.

182
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,460
No, no.

183
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,100
I'm done.

184
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,120
I'm done.

185
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,840
OK.

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,720
Hurry up, Honda.

187
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,800
But...

188
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,220
I told you to hurry up!

189
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,060
But...

190
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,300
I'm going to challenge you!

191
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,920
Well, I'll stop you right away.

192
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,420
Go ahead.

193
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,360
Uh?

194
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,800
Oh!

195
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,600
Amigo, it's a speed.

196
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,620
I said I was going to be all right.

197
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,860
But the stairs are.

198
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,380
Don't worry.

199
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:06,980
He's fine.

200
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,180
I have�

201
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,440
Woo-hoo, wuh-woof, wuh-woof, woo-woo-woof, woo-wooff!

202
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,840
Wooo-woo-woof, wuh-woof, woo-woo-woo-woof, woo-woo-woof!

203
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,120
Just eligible.

204
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:17,900
"Hikaru's

205
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,300
"Limit"

206
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,660
"Limit"

207
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,640
"Limit"

208
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:20,740
"Limit"

209
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,080
It's back.

210
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,320
It's back.

211
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,720
It's back.

212
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,160
I'm coming back.

213
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,420
Here, I have a gift for you.

214
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,700
A gift?

215
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,120
I'm sorry, but I'll never do such a thing again.

216
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,420
I'm terribly sorry.

217
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,400
Yes, of course, I'll pay you back.

218
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,680
Yes.

219
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,660
What's wrong?

220
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
The Tacos you saw just now.

221
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,860
It was all over the place.

222
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,720
That's true.

223
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,860
If it had been that shocking,

224
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,220
it would have been a disaster.

225
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,860
You shouldn't have driven so quietly.

226
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,560
I was the one who said to hurry.

227
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,520
Hurry up and drive quietly.

228
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,720
Don't say that.

229
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,280
I can't take a bike.

230
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,900
Is there any other way to bring it down at once?

231
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,360
All the way down at once.

232
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,280
That's right.

233
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,340
Now, Takai Tacos Monamucho.

234
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,380
I'll deliver it at a free fall.

235
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,160
Why am I in such a thing?

236
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,060
This is the fastest and most certain way.

237
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,280
Volvo, how is it?

238
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,120
OK.

239
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,800
Order.

240
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,580
Deliver it immediately.

241
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:37,900
All right.

242
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,920
Now, the destination is on this box.

243
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,100
The bike is down there.

244
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,880
Now, get down there at once.

245
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,580
No way.

246
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,700
Shut up.

247
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,120
Don't say that.

248
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,540
It's a Gondola improved by Volvo.

249
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,000
Don't worry.

250
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,280
Don't worry?

251
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,360
Volvo, do it.

252
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:55,940
OK.

253
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,840
Senpai.

254
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,040
Don't worry.

255
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,380
It's firmly fixed with that belt.

256
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,180
It won't die even if something happens.

257
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
No way.

258
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,140
What should I do?

259
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,400
Please forgive me.

260
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,680
I told you, it's OK.

261
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,400
Don't look down.

262
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,020
If you look at the front building, you'll be fine.

263
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,100
I told you to look down.

264
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,140
I don't care.

265
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,620
What did I say?

266
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,300
Don't look down.

267
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,900
Volvo.

268
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,740
Bonji.

269
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,720
Bonji.

270
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,740
If the rain gets wet, it'll go all the way down to the ground.

271
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,180
It's 10 seconds down.

272
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,780
It's the biggest free fall in Japan.

273
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,520
No way.

274
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
The End

275
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,060
Hey, it stopped.

276
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,020
That's fast.

277
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:43,960
What happened?

278
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,140
Honda's not moving at all.

279
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,960
Did it crash into the ground?

280
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,240
No, it should have stopped just in time.

281
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,360
Honda!

282
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,740
It's just fainted.

283
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,640
Hey, wake up and hurry up and carry it!

284
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,300
Calm down, Honda.

285
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:02,920
It's over.

286
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,020
It's over.

287
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,400
Get out of here.

288
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,140
Senpai, am I still alive?

289
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,700
Of course.

290
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,600
You can't lose your mind with that.

291
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,400
Thank goodness.

292
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,320
I had a dream of flying to heaven with wings.

293
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,780
I want real wings too.

294
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,580
Then you can fly out of the window and go to the delivery.

295
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,660
Wait.

296
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,720
Maybe I can do it.

297
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,440
Yes, you can.

298
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,700
You can fly.

299
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,460
Fly in the sky.

300
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,000
Fly in the sky?

301
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes.

302
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,460
It's a flying octopus-shaped plane.

303
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,140
What's that?

304
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,500
It's a mobile hang glider we developed at home.

305
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,620
If you put this on, you can fly in the sky.

306
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,300
Fly in the sky?

307
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,440
I'm ready.

308
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,840
Let's do an experiment, Nakagawa.

309
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,480
Okay.

310
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:01,800
Please stop.

311
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,180
It's okay.

312
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,220
Trust the technical skills of Nakagawa Group.

313
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,860
Stand at the tip of that board and...

314
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,640
No.

315
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,580
I'm going to faint.

316
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,300
It can't be helped.

317
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,040
I'll do it.

318
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,560
It seems like you've become a hero of justice.

319
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,460
I'm counting on you.

320
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,500
Leave it to me.

321
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,980
Spread your hands sideways.

322
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,440
Okay.

323
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,440
Yaaay!

324
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,220
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

325
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,740
Yahoo!

326
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,300
I did it!

327
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,000
It's a success!

328
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,160
Amigo, you're wonderful!

329
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,480
Yahoo!

330
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:41,980
He-he.

331
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,860
Huh?

332
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,100
Huh?

333
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:45,920
Huh?

334
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,220
Huh?

335
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,240
Huh?

336
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,320
Huh?

337
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,740
Huh?

338
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,940
Hey, Sakonji!

339
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,080
What?

340
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,280
You're not skipping.

341
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,140
What?

342
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:49,960
What?

343
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,300
Ryotsu, what are you doing?

344
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,200
I found a new delivery method.

345
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,900
What?

346
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,940
Now, monamucho, the delivery octopus.

347
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,740
We'll deliver it to you from the sky.

348
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,200
It's a flying octopus ship.

349
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,080
It's a flying octopus ship?

350
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,400
Really?

351
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,620
Yes, I'm Monamucho, and I'm a flying octopus.

352
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,320
I'm Otsuka's Bon Shoji.

353
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,040
I'm counting on you.

354
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,700
Senpai, I've upgraded the helmet.

355
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,960
I've installed a navigation device on it.

356
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,120
Please lower the hood.

357
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,280
This is it.

358
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:19,880
Huh?

359
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,280
The red dot is blinking.

360
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,700
Hold the red dot in the middle of the hood.

361
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,520
If you fly in that direction, you'll reach your destination.

362
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:27,560
If you fly in that direction, you'll reach your destination.

363
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,960
If you fly in that direction, you'll reach your destination.

364
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,300
Alright, got it.

365
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,260
Senpai!

366
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,640
Senpai!

367
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:33,680
Let's go!

368
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,780
Senpai, you've completely made that suit yours.

369
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,620
Yes, a man with power.

370
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,980
That's what a person like Trie is.

371
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,320
That's right.

372
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,000
That's what a person like Trie is.

373
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,680
That's what a person like Trie is.

374
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,560
We've gone up to deliver the octopus.

375
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,740
We've already arrived?

376
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,800
It's been three minutes.

377
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,200
As expected of the flying octopus ship.

378
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:57,500
As expected of the flying octopus ship.

379
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,400
We've gone up to deliver the octopus.

380
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,400
Great work!

381
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,280
We've gone up to deliver the octopus.

382
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,200
Great work!

383
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,700
We've gone up to deliver the octopus.

384
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,820
Great work!

385
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,380
We've gone up to deliver the octopus.

386
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,840
Yes, the flying octopus ship is over.

387
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:11,920
Yes.

388
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,360
Yes, the flying octopus ship is over.

389
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:12,620
Yes.

390
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,300
Yes.

391
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,600
Roger.

392
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,800
We're back.

393
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,880
Ah, senpai, I'm sorry, get out of here immediately.

394
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,560
Yes, take us to the toilet.

395
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,400
Yes, take us to the toilet.

396
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,120
Yes, take us to the toilet.

397
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,980
Sorry, our order has gone out of order.

398
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,180
Please be patient.

399
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,060
What?

400
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,500
Folmo-san, please lower the hood a little.

401
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:27,660
Please help me

402
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,900
Nakagawa is too lonely

403
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,600
Help us out

404
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,700
I got it

405
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:35,960
Ok

406
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,840
Please

407
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,900
Me too?

408
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,860
Of course

409
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,620
Honda's is special

410
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,340
Honda, hold the handle

411
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,820
Handle?

412
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,720
I don't care

413
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,020
I'll go anywhere

414
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,600
Ok

415
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,740
It's so cool

416
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,420
I can't say anything

417
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,460
Great

418
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,400
Konji

419
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,680
Hold the handle

420
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,960
Hold it

421
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,460
Hold it

422
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,540
I just

423
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:13,760
Good luck

424
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,800
I have experience

425
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,460
It's easy

426
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:26,000
What are you doing?

427
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,600
Hey

428
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,760
Well, I'm going to go this way.

429
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,680
I'm counting on you!

430
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
Gracias, amigo!

431
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,940
Thanks to you guys, my "Mucho" is getting a lot of attention.

432
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,380
And today, I finally have a big order.

433
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,240
I want you to deliver tacos to this Mexican restaurant that's going to be held next week.

434
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,160
I want you to sell it to the whole world.

435
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,240
Oh!

436
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,180
If this is a success, tacos will be available all over Japan and all over the world.

437
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,900
But if you fail, it won't be an international problem.

438
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,880
Failure is never allowed.

439
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,700
So, if you succeed, let's double your part-time job!

440
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:07,880
Yes!

441
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,620
Be motivated and encourage yourself to work!

442
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,060
Yes!

443
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,700
I can't believe it!

444
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:21,960
Ouch!

445
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,240
Oh!

446
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,460
Arararararaaah!

447
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,120
Nooo!

448
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,080
Honda, get up, Honda!

449
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,780
What's wrong? Who did it?

450
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,700
The partner was supposed to be taking his fried tacos.

451
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:39,940
What?

452
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,060
Maybe...

453
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,020
Oh, my goodness, Ryotsu!

454
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,920
Look outside!

455
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,360
Huh?

456
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Fried tacos?

457
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,480
Takoyaki... I knew it.

458
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,760
Mr. Monamucho, the delivery is here!

459
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,920
Ah, yes.

460
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,720
Long time no see, brother.

461
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,020
Yakio!

462
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
They look alike!

463
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,460
Brothers, huh?

464
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,300
Takota Yakio...

465
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,800
...is my twin brother.

466
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,380
What?!

467
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,540
It's getting a lot of attention, huh?

468
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,520
But that's all I can say about it.

469
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,020
I'll make you a big shame at the next Mexican exhibition.

470
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,720
What did you say?

471
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,880
I'll be rewarding the ones who betrayed the Takota family!

472
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,420
What a weirdo.

473
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,480
The day has finally come.

474
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,420
Boss, what's the Takota family?

475
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,200
My ancestor was a man called Takota Hachibai.

476
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,180
He was a huge fan of takoyaki.

477
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,780
But in Japan, takoyaki wasn't very well known at the time.

478
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,600
But he was a big fan of takoyaki.

479
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,280
He said, while he was still alive,

480
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,600
"I can eat takoyaki anytime, anywhere, let me spread takoyaki."

481
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,060
Since that day, the Takota family's mission has been to spread takoyaki.

482
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,240
After much effort, takoyaki has become a food that no one in the whole country knows about.

483
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,920
Hachibai's dream has finally come true.

484
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,260
So this time, I'm going to sacrifice my own favorite, the Takos' life,

485
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,640
and sacrifice it for my brother's sake.

486
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,760
But it seems like my brother didn't think that way.

487
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,020
He said he'd write a big letter at the next Mexican exhibition.

488
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,060
Yeah. He's probably going to interfere with the delivery.

489
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,100
But I have a wish to spread takoyaki.

490
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,820
I can't let him interfere.

491
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,620
I'll leave the delivery to Ryotsu on that day.

492
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
If it succeeds, I'll pay for the special treatment.

493
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,140
Okay, leave it to me.

494
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,140
Yes, yes, I understand. Thank you very much.

495
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,060
Here it is!

496
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,820
It's an order from a Mexican restaurant!

497
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,700
Okay, it's done.

498
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,120
This side is also ready.

499
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,660
Oh, wonderful.

500
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,120
Senpai, this is a rocket booster for the airport that our company has newly developed.

501
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,840
If you need it, use this to fly all the way to the exhibition venue.

502
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,440
Okay.

503
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,740
But this has too much power, so please don't use the maximum power.

504
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,100
Roger that. It's done.

505
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,780
If this succeeds,

506
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,980
a large number of orders will be made during the period of the Mexican exhibition.

507
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,720
Good luck, Ryotsu!

508
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,400
Let's fight!

509
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,860
Senpai, please return safely.

510
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,220
I'm counting on you, Ryotsu.

511
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Leave it to me!

512
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,040
I knew you wouldn't let me go to Sunarita.

513
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,980
You won't let me go to the restaurant of my older brother?

514
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
I'll crush your brother's restaurant!

515
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,760
Help me!

516
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,440
Here I come!

517
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,940
Shit!

518
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,700
What's going on?

519
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,000
That's all.

520
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,180
Ryotsu, I'm here to help you!

521
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,100
Everyone!

522
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,620
What's going on?

523
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,060
I'm here to help you!

524
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,920
Let us handle this!

525
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,640
Got it!

526
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,340
Brother!

527
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,940
Why don't you understand baseball?

528
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,700
The supply of takoyaki is already enough!

529
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,480
If you're from the Tako Taichi clan, it's natural to risk your life for the supply of takoyaki!

530
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,840
You don't understand even if I say this?

531
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,840
I don't understand!

532
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,560
Oh no!

533
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,600
This is...

534
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,700
I did it!

535
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,960
You too!

536
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,180
I want to shoot a shot!

537
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,060
What the hell is this?

538
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,320
The wind of the windmill that generates the wind of the wind is complicated and generates the wind of the wind!

539
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,640
You measured it, baseball!

540
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
I was going to drive it here from the beginning!

541
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,580
With this wind of the wind, I must erase my brother's ambition!

542
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,380
Senpai!

543
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,640
I don't have time anymore!

544
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,640
I have no choice!

545
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,020
I'll use the boosters to the maximum power and fly to the venue at once!

546
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,900
It's too dangerous!

547
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,540
There is no other way to break this wind of the wind!

548
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,000
Senpai!

549
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,580
No!

550
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,900
I'm going to burn!

551
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,060
Damn it!

552
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,600
I'm going to burn!

553
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,640
That's it!

554
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,840
Taishi, you've done a great job! Congratulations!

555
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,980
Amigo Tequila Mon Amucho!

556
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,120
The takoyaki is about to arrive!

557
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,340
I'm going to eat the takoyaki!

558
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,120
It has arrived!

559
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,980
It's good that it has arrived! It won't stop!

560
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
Yaki!

561
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,140
Yaki, get a hold on yourself!

562
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,560
Brother!

563
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,920
Did you notice?

564
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,120
Did you help me?

565
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,920
I was trying to make you fail.

566
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,420
I was trying to make you fail.

567
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,360
We're sisters.

568
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,400
Brother!

569
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,400
I'm sorry, brother!

570
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,120
I was actually just envious of you.

571
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,080
You found your own path and went forward.

572
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,880
I was actually in love with Takosu too!

573
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,580
I knew it.

574
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,100
We're twins.

575
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,720
But you were the only one I could trust with Takota's family tradition.

576
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,120
I had to placement it back to you!

577
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,420
I'm sorry to what I did to you, and I'm going to have to blame it on you.

578
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,680
Brother!

579
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,040
We both get good at takoyaki and takoyaki.

580
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,940
So I thought I should try to help out from now on!

581
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,680
Yes!

582
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,660
Programmable H2 rocket!

583
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,000
It's finally ready and successful!

584
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,580
We've overcome our past mistakes and now it's gone!

585
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,700
You're not the guy I needed, or something!

What is it?

599
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,460
When I was a child,

600
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,240
I used to read the newspaper.

601
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,300
Is it so strange that I was delivering?

602
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,340
Certainly, it is not for me to deliver early in the morning and walk slowly.

603
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,080
But there was a unforgettable memory with my best friend.

604
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,240
Next time, "The Newspaper Boy, Kankichi Story".

605
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,960
Thank you.
