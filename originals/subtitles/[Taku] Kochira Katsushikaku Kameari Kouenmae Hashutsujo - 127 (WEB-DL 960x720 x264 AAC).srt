00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:18,020
『Hana Re Te Mite Ne...』

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:29,980
中川に浮かぶある日を めがけて Nakagawa ni ukabu aru hi o megakete Bright and sunny by the Nav biliary

3
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,900
When I kicked the tree, it flew to my shoes

4
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,820
I wonder if it's going to be a good time to save money

5
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:48,420
I was laughed at that it was just a tree

6
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,880
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,040
There are only thorns and thorns

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,260
There is no one bad day

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,260
The cityscape is strangely gentle

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,720
From the waterfront of the Tongari-boshi

11
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,320
The sun sets to the Taishakuten

12
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,080
Tomorrow will end tomorrow

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,980
tomorrow will end tomorrow

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,060
I'm not happy

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,500
I lost my happiness

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,420
And I realized

17
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,560
I'm an idiot

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,740
A man of love, Ryo-tsu Kankichi

19
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,200
People call me the love-hunt

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,360
I was popular since I was a child

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,420
But what's wrong?

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,620
When I came with recent girls

23
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,200
I didn't know my charm

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,580
If I think about the stories I heard

25
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,800
I think I'm different

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,080
I'm a woman

27
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,020
I'm a man

28
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,200
I'm the first man I don't want to marry

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,120
I'm the number one

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,260
10 years in a row

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,440
I think there's a woman

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,240
who understands my wonderfulness

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,960
somewhere

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,840
Burn, the island of love

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,620
The island of love

36
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,680
The island of love

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,260
The island of love

38
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,520
Burn, the island of love

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,700
The island of love

40
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,640
The island of love

41
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,360
The island of love

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,460
The island of love

43
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:34,720
The island of love

44
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:34,760
The island of love

45
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:34,840
The island of love

46
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,120
To the sea

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,460
To other people

48
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,060
The island of love

49
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,960
Isn't it grand?

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,880
Wait a bit

51
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,940
Wait a minute. Why do I have to go to Hokkaido?

52
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,720
There is a girl I know in Hokkaido.

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,160
Let's meet up.

54
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,320
When I showed you the photo, you seemed to like it.

55
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,000
I said I wanted to see you as soon as possible.

56
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,380
So I thought I'd see you before you changed your mind.

57
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,820
There is an important meeting tomorrow, so you should go first.

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,360
I understand. I'm going to Hokkaido.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,980
I'll pay you back if you give me a flight ticket.

60
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,600
If I can get a 3-day leave and get money back...

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
What is it, Chief?

62
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,860
Don't tell me you want to pay back the ticket.

63
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,000
No, I don't want to. I don't want to do that.

64
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,380
Listen, Ryotsu.

65
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,760
I'll come to the meeting as soon as the meeting is over.

66
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,200
If you don't go to Hokkaido, what will happen to me?

67
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,420
That's a threat, isn't it?

68
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,080
Then I won't see you.

69
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,340
You idiot!

70
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,480
You're getting old, and if you don't have savings, you don't have a home.

71
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,820
You liked me and sent me a ticket to Hokkaido.

72
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,560
I won't do this again!

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,040
I understand.

74
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,640
If only we could meet a little.

75
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,380
That's fine.

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,100
You're a woman I like at first sight.

77
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,220
And what kind of woman is she?

78
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,180
That's right.

79
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,180
Her style is like that of Fujiwara Nori.

80
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,400
Oh, the one with the nice body?

81
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,220
Her hairstyle is like that of Ina Mori Izumo.

82
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,920
That's amazing!

83
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,480
That's a misunderstanding.

84
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,940
No, wait a minute.

85
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,300
What about her face?

86
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,060
Face?

87
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,960
It's hard to say, but to put it bluntly...

88
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,680
To put it bluntly?

89
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,860
Shimura Kento and Hanako Yamada were split by two.

90
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,660
And they couldn't sleep at night.

91
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,220
And I thought that Nagagawa came to pick me up in the morning.

92
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,940
But I'm stuck in a seat.

93
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,560
Both the chief and Nagagawa do not trust him at all.

94
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,340
I'm so suspicious.

95
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,180
Where do I get in?

96
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,840
You idiot!

97
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,480
Be careful!

98
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,320
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,600
I saw him somewhere.

100
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,160
He's a man with a good sense of taste.

101
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,580
"Akimoto"

102
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,860
Huh? What's wrong?

103
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,300
It's pretty warm.

104
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,700
I thought it'd be colder this season.

105
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,000
Lord Ryochi!

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,660
Do you need anything from me?

107
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,840
Actually...

108
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,400
What? You switched the flight tickets?

109
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,880
I bumped into the cartoonist Akimoto in Haneda's lobby.

110
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,300
In Haneda?

111
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,400
Oh, that's right.

112
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,140
So this isn't Hokkaido?

113
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,800
It's Kagoshima.

114
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,500
Kagoshima?

115
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,160
Anyway, please return to Haneda with the return flight.

116
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,560
You're kidding me!

117
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,340
I took a three-day leave.

118
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,920
I'm going back to Haneda and go to Hokkaido.

119
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:01,380
Thank you.

120
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,540
If you don't return, you'll be in trouble for a whole day!

121
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,740
Even if you say that...

122
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,460
All right! I'll talk to the cartoonist Akimoto.

123
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,840
Thank you for your help.

124
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,120
Oh.

125
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,420
Are you Akimoto?

126
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,460
Yes.

127
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,680
I have to go to Okinoerabujima for an interview, so please come back soon.

128
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,820
Okinoerabujima?

129
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,240
It's an island between Amami Oshima and Okinawa.

130
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,560
Oh.

131
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,180
The locals should be waiting for me.

132
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,080
Then I'll go there and interview you.

133
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,040
So you go to Sapporo instead of me and meet me.

134
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,020
That's ridiculous.

135
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,700
I'm a good man.

136
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,080
Shut up!

137
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,980
I decided that, so do it!

138
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,620
See you!

139
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,120
I've talked to him.

140
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,180
I'm going to Okinoerabujima.

141
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,320
Really?

142
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,340
Yes.

143
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,780
Take me to the plane to Okinoerabujima.

144
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,120
Yeah.

145
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,280
Thank you.

146
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,200
Thank you.

147
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,360
Thank you.

148
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,160
Thank you.

149
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,720
All right.

150
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,540
Thank you.

151
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,460
Thank you.

152
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,300
Thank you.

153
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,920
Thank you.

154
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,340
Thank you very much.

155
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Thank you.

156
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,800
Thank you.

157
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,640
Thank you very much.

158
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,120
Chief Ohara!

159
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,580
What's wrong, Nakagawa?

160
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,360
I just got a call from the dad of Ryo-chan's fiancé at the exit.

161
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,120
He said he wanted to take the plane he was planning to take.

162
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,880
What? Ryo-chan did go to Haneda this morning, didn't he?

163
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,820
Yes, he took me there by car. There's no doubt about it.

164
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,120
If he's not sleeping, where is he?

165
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,140
I thought he was a famous manga artist, so I thought he was a more difficult person.

166
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,280
But he's a pretty mean person.

167
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,520
Chief, wait a minute.

168
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,420
What?

169
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
Stop! Stop!

170
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,680
What's wrong, Chief?

171
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,320
Who are you?

172
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,780
I don't want to. Ryo... No, I mean, I'm Akimoto Osamu.

173
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm Akimoto Sensei.

174
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,300
You!

175
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,140
This is terrible! You're going to make me sleep!

176
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,140
You should've told me in Sapporo!

177
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,420
Why do I have to marry you instead of you?

178
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,520
You!

179
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,960
Wait a minute.

180
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,620
What?

181
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,100
What's going on?

182
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,080
You!

183
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,560
You!

184
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,320
You!

185
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,760
You!

186
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:49,900
You!

187
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,420
You!

188
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:50,520
You!

189
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,720
You!

190
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,420
You!

191
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,860
You!

192
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,360
You!

193
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,200
It's hot. My throat is dry. I'm dying.

194
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,280
Water... Rain?

195
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,880
I'm going home.

196
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,960
Why is it raining in the desert?

197
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,960
Hey!

198
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,120
Hey!

199
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,660
Hey!

200
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,960
You idiot! What are you doing?

201
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,840
Hey!

202
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,180
I'm sorry!

203
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,380
I didn't know you were in such a place!

204
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,060
Shut up! You're drunk!

205
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,740
What's wrong, Hiroshi?

206
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,460
What's wrong, Hiroshi?

207
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,840
Ritsuo?

208
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:54,920
Ritsuo?

209
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,240
Hiroshiro?

210
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,620
Thats...

211
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,920
I know you and Ritsuo!

212
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,400
Ritsuo?

213
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:19,840
Ritsuo-san?

214
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,800
Ritsuo-san?

215
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,100
I have a dozen of them.

216
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,300
Ryoichi-san, are you sure?

217
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,780
It's the first time I've met you, and you're carrying all your stuff.

218
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,280
I was just sleeping.

219
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,900
Yuriko-sensei, this old man tried to hit me earlier.

220
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,060
Hey, what are you saying, Boku-chan?

221
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,120
But it's great to be able to educate children in this kind of nature.

222
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,680
Is that so?

223
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,740
It's wonderful.

224
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,960
The kids in Tokyo are so naive, they can't do anything about it.

225
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,860
The children on the island are cute.

226
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,700
The children in Tokyo are cute.

227
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,080
15 minutes by ship from Elabujima.

228
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,460
That's quite close, isn't it?

229
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,980
But there are only 3 ships a day.

230
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,760
The last one is the evening return.

231
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,180
This is the elementary school I teach.

232
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,740
It's a really small school.

233
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,640
Yuriko-sensei is back!

234
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,400
Yuriko sensei!

235
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm back!

236
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,060
Everyone's so cute!

237
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,100
Yuriko sensei, who's this?

238
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,520
It's like a gorilla!

239
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,080
It's rude to meet you for the first time.

240
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,720
This is Ryotsu-san, who brought us the marble and coral for the school.

241
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,360
Let's greet him.

242
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,220
Hello!

243
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,280
As expected of Yuriko sensei, you're polite and polite.

244
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,160
Thank you very much.

245
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,580
Excuse me, but can you take this to the science room?

246
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,080
Yes, yes, I understand.

247
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,200
Then, Shinji-kun, Hiromi-chan, please.

248
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,060
Yes!

249
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,900
This is the science room.

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,040
I can't do it.

251
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,300
I'm in trouble.

252
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,520
What's wrong? Are you sick?

253
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,740
Oh, this is a little stiff.

254
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,860
You have to fix it.

255
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,120
Hey, bring the nails and tongs.

256
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,120
Yes!

257
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:24,900
Just a little bit.

258
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,360
You don't have to do that.

259
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,400
I'll fix it, I'm good at it.

260
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,560
I'll fix it soon.

261
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
This school is a mess.

262
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,400
By the way, I'll fix it all.

263
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,940
You do your own work!

264
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,360
Is that okay?

265
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,140
I'm sorry.

266
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,640
Then I'll be in the office.

267
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,600
Hey, Yuriko sensei, are you still a single child?

268
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,140
Yeah.

269
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,460
I see.

270
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,100
I see...

271
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,500
Your luck is back now.

272
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,940
I've been waiting for you!

273
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,740
You idiot!

274
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,140
I said get out of here!

275
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,040
Get out!

276
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,100
Ah, wait, no, I said get out!

277
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:19,260
Okay, now this is perfect.

278
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,340
Wow, it's perfect!

279
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,920
It's only a few hours away.

280
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,440
I can't thank you enough.

281
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,260
Don't thank me.

282
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,580
Oh, no! The last flight to Erav Island has left.

283
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,360
Yeah, the inn will stop at Minshikun, so don't worry.

284
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,160
But there's no such facility on this island.

285
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,920
What a perverse place.

286
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,160
If you don't mind, can you come to my house?

287
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,280
It's a small place.

288
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,900
No, I can't go to a single single woman's house.

289
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,020
I can sleep in the school's bathroom.

290
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,060
Please let me treat you to dinner.

291
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,660
What? Dinner?

292
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,340
This is about me?

293
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,620
Oh, but...

294
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,060
Oh, I'm so weak.

295
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,660
It hurts!

296
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,540
I was really happy, but I was embarrassed.

297
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,540
Shut up!

298
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,520
Don't tease me!

299
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,920
Wait!

300
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,120
Wait!

301
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm not going to sleep!

302
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,380
Hey!

303
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,620
So you fixed all the doors in the school's bathroom, right?

304
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,240
That's right, Mrs. Ryotsu.

305
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,300
You're very clever, Mr. Ryotsu.

306
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,680
Well, I'm not that clever.

307
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,860
I didn't think I'd live with an old lady from the gym in the school's bathroom.

308
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,860
You're so good at talking.

309
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,020
What happened, Mr. Ryotsu?

310
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,720
Nothing.

311
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,160
Nothing at all.

312
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,900
More importantly, are there only you and Mrs. Ryotsu in the school's bathroom?

313
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,760
I used to have five of them, but now there are only two of them.

314
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,860
A new teacher is coming from Kagoshima, but...

315
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,380
It's not easy.

316
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,780
It must be hard for you two to clean up the classroom.

317
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,900
All right, I'll help you tomorrow.

318
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,380
What?

319
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,980
The classroom's bed and chair are broken.

320
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,320
If possible, you should repaint the classroom's paint.

321
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,680
Besides, I can't teach you how to study, but I can teach you how to do the gym.

322
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,500
But, Mr. Ryotsu, you're a police officer, right?

323
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,220
Is that okay?

324
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:27,840
It's fine.

325
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,620
My boss is always bullying me.

326
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,560
Sometimes I want to live in the rich nature.

327
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:36,900
I see.

328
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,880
Then I'll count on you, Ms. Yuriko.

329
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,460
But...

330
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,240
It's fine.

331
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,860
You're like your ex-boyfriend.

332
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,020
You have a new love for him.

333
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,860
Ms. Yuriko!

334
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,600
Yes, thank you.

335
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,980
I have something to do early tomorrow, so I'll get some rest.

336
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,660
Then, Mr. Ryotsu, I'll leave it to you tomorrow.

337
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,420
Oh, okay.

338
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,340
You must be tired today.

339
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,180
There's a futon in the next room, so please take a rest.

340
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,080
Oh, okay.

341
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,480
Um, Ms. Yuriko, are you from this island?

342
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,960
No, I'm from Nagasaki.

343
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,520
Why did you come to this island?

344
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,380
Well...

345
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,220
I like children.

346
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,320
Then, you must have a elementary school in Nagasaki.

347
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,400
Why did you come to such a strange island?

348
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,760
Because there was something I didn't like about Nagasaki.

349
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,000
You mean him?

350
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,620
Yes.

351
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,500
He's different from Mr. Ryotsu.

352
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,080
He's not friendly or manly.

353
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,200
I'm not friendly or manly.

354
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,680
I'm manly, after all.

355
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,660
Once you decide something, you have to do it no matter what.

356
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,820
That's right.

357
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,260
I'm going to make a test problem, so please take a rest.

358
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,360
Oh, really?

359
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,920
Then, good night.

360
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,720
Damn it.

361
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,860
I can't sleep well when I think that Ms. Yuriko is next to me.

362
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,020
She's a good woman.

363
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,720
If I could marry her...

364
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,960
But, Ms. Yuriko is a true Japanese.

365
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,060
I want my child to be able to play baseball team.

366
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,020
What's wrong?

367
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,360
I had a bad dream.

368
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,240
Oh, my.

369
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,500
I want my child to be like Ms. Yuriko.

370
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,520
Okinoe Love Island?

371
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,320
Why are you there?

372
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,220
I'm not going to be long if you talk to me.

373
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,400
Idiot!

374
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,500
I'm not your father.

375
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,540
You're so mean to me.

376
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,340
I think I might get married.

377
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,740
What?

378
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,520
I met the ideal woman.

379
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,340
Really?

380
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:21,960
Yes.

381
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,940
Anyway, don't worry.

382
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,940
Bye.

383
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,540
Hey!

384
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,620
Damn it.

385
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,340
What's wrong?

386
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,120
Ryotsu's ideal woman appeared.

387
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,400
I think I might get married.

388
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,980
What?

389
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,160
Everyone, I have a very good news today.

390
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,620
Mr. Ryotsu, who fixed the school gate yesterday, will help me today.

391
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,080
What?

392
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
I'm looking forward to it.

393
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Peace, peace.

394
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,060
Mr. Ryotsu, is the teacher of the high school good?

395
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,100
Leave it to me.

396
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,680
Come on, get out of here.

397
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,380
But I have to change my clothes.

398
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,900
Come on, get out of here.

399
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,120
Come on, run.

400
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,060
I'm a grand master.

401
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,780
I knew it.

402
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,320
Mr. Kuriko, you're different from a man.

403
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,000
Really.

404
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,900
It'll be a great help.

405
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,660
Alright, I'll give you a test.

406
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,620
Ichiro!

407
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,140
Good job!

408
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,980
Hiroshi!

409
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,120
That's mean.

410
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,700
Everyone, be careful now.

411
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,160
Some people think that studying won't help them, but...

412
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,920
That's right! Life is fun because it can be done.

413
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,200
What's important in life is that you can do whatever you decide to do.

414
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,120
That's my policy.

415
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,320
So, that's all for today.

416
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,780
-Yuki-sensei. -Yuriko-sensei.

417
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,040
You've gotten used to the children.

418
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,900
Did you hear that?

419
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,700
I love children too, so I've become a hot-tempered child.

420
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,920
How long will you stay on this island?

421
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,040
How long?

422
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,040
If it's okay with you, I'll stay forever.

423
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,860
I'll stop being a police officer and become a teacher.

424
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,320
That's great.

425
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,480
Great?

426
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,180
Yuriko-sensei.

427
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,040
This is definitely Yuriko-sensei's...

428
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,560
...punishment.

429
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,000
It might be the greatest confession from a girl.

430
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,020
Yuriko-sensei, I've got a delivery.

431
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,440
Delivery?

432
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,120
Yuriko-sensei wants to stay with me forever.

433
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,180
Alright, let's make a confession.

434
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,060
I love you! Please marry me!

435
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,200
No, I don't want to, Ryotsu-san.

436
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,560
I'm over 50 years old.

437
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,880
But if you're serious about it, you should think about it.

438
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,240
Yuriko-sensei is...

439
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,560
Yuriko-sensei.

440
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,680
What's wrong?

441
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,240
You seem to be crying.

442
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,660
What is it?

443
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,020
I can't make up my mind.

444
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,300
I'm sorry for making you sad.

445
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,780
I'm in Kagoshima City now.

446
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,500
My parents won't let me marry you.

447
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,420
So I left home yesterday.

448
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,640
I want to see you right away.

449
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,780
And we can talk.

450
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,100
Don't cry.

451
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:36,660
Did I cry out of happiness?

452
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,780
We're going back to Tokyo?

453
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,740
You said you would stay here forever.

454
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,840
It's fun being a teacher.

455
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,700
But I think I love to be a police officer.

456
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,040
I think the people in the police force worry about that too.

457
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,160
Yuriko-sensei, the typhoon is coming, and the ship is damaged.

458
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,660
I'm sick of it.

459
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,620
I guess we shouldn't do it today.

460
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,880
If a man says something, he must do it no matter what.

461
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,280
I've taught the kids that.

462
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,680
Boss, are you sure we can swim to Kagoshima?

463
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,900
I'm confident.

464
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,640
We'll reach Satamisaki in 20 hours.

465
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,800
We can return to Tokyo by train from Kagoshima.

466
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,380
But it's too dangerous.

467
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,420
We don't know where we'll be in this storm.

468
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,060
Don't worry.

469
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,300
Besides, Ms. Yuriko,

470
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,960
you should care about your children's happiness,

471
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,060
but also yours.

472
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,840
Mr. Ryotsu...

473
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,840
Could it be that letter...

474
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,260
Sorry, I read it.

475
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,780
Mr. Ryotsu, I...

476
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,920
I...

477
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,360
I'm sorry.

478
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,720
Listen to Ms. Yuriko!

479
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,140
Okay?

480
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,600
Yeah.

481
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:05,960
Goodbye!

482
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:17,180
Mr. Ryotsu

483
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,640
Thanks to Mr. Ryotsu,

484
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,560
I was able to start over again with him.

485
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,880
He also came here

486
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,760
and he'll teach us the script with us.

487
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,380
Thank you so much.

488
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,100
I sincerely wish you happiness.

489
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,040
From Yuriko

490
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,620
Senpai, it seems like you were dumped.

491
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,720
Even so, where on earth did you go?

492
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,080
That idiot.

493
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:52,160
Why, why is it Hong Kong even though I swam for ten days without drinking or eating?

494
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,880
You're already in love, aren't you?

495
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,380
Idiot!

496
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,480
If it's you, then I'd rather wake up.

497
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,400
Even if it's a boring story,

498
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,280
I want to make the whole body hot.

499
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,800
I want to see my friends.

500
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,440
I definitely want to be loved.

501
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,780
I don't want everyone to hate me.

502
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,240
I feel like we're melting.

503
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,400
I definitely want to be loved.

504
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,840
For some reason, love is just cowardly.

505
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,300
Don't hide everything about being strong.

506
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,520
Wow!

507
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,280
You're really a crazy professor!

508
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,860
This time, it's the Air Police!

509
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,280
And what's with this plane?

510
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,200
It's not a surprise human contest.

511
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,280
You don't have to fly with this.

512
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,860
Next time, "The Crazy Air Police".

513
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,200
That's why I said I don't want to!
