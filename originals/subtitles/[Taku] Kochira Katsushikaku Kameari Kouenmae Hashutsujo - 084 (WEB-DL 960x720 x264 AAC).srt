00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:13,840
♪ NECROPOLIS

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,560
♪ I watch the sunset on the river within

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,780
♪ I kick a stone

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,560
♪ and I fly into the slippers

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,260
I wonder if he went to the gym where he was saving money

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:38,500
He laughed at me saying I was still a kid

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,660
Even if I try to cheer up, I can't win

8
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,580
There is no change in my yawn

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape is strangely gentle

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,520
From the fountain of a pointed hat

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,960
To the taishakuten, the sun sets

12
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,500
Tomorrow will end like this

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,620
I lost my happiness again

14
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,740
I realized

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,240
I'm an idiot

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,640
So

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,280
Kareinithenshin Gekkou deka

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:49,600
I pulled back to the special patrol

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,040
From the east, no abnormalities

20
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,520
You did a great job

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,380
Senpai, it's our turn next time.

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,600
Shut up. This is important.

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,860
Ryo, what if the Nekonome Settou-dan shows up while you're just playing around?

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,020
What's wrong with Nego's gold ball?

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,560
Nekonome Settou-dan!

26
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,280
Recently, the Settou-dan has been stealing high-end items such as jewelry and jewelry in the Katsushika Prefecture.

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,020
Six of them have already been damaged.

28
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,760
They're strengthening the night patrol to catch them.

29
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,320
Now that you mention it, that's what the chief was talking about.

30
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,220
Damn, he's making me work overtime.

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,140
It's a rumor that there are three women.

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,520
Maybe there's a beautiful woman like Ryo-chan.

33
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,680
I'm not interested in stupid women who are all about high-end items.

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,500
Nakagawa, I'll leave it to you.

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,480
Go patrol by yourself.

36
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,280
I'd love to, but...

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,940
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,740
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,540
You idiot!

41
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,620
Do you have any sense of self-awareness as a police officer?

42
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,620
You don't, do you?

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,340
Of course you don't.

44
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,960
You don't!

45
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,280
You don't, right?

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,440
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,380
If someone like you is here, the head of the prefecture will worry and send reinforcements.

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,040
Reinforcements?

49
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,220
Is someone coming from the prefecture?

50
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:17,880
That's right!

51
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,840
In order to solve the incident involving the Nekonome Settou-dan this time,

52
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,220
we have sent a 100% elite detective.

53
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
We will all join his command.

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,620
What kind of person is he?

55
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,040
We haven't heard his real name, but he's called "Gekkou Deka" in the prefecture.

56
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,020
Gekkou Deka?

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,960
By the way, there used to be a program called "Gekkou Kamen."

58
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,780
There was also a "Ninja Unit Gekkou."

59
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,620
I wonder if he's wearing that costume.

60
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,240
What are you two talking about?

61
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,900
The enemy is an elite detective.

62
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,420
There's no way he's wearing that kind of costume.

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,360
Then what kind of person is he?

64
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,200
I wonder.

65
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,220
He's a musician.

66
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,940
Once the incident is solved, he will definitely play Beethoven's "Gekkou."

67
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,840
By the way, Gekkou Deka belongs to the Special Police Department.

68
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,440
Special Police Department?

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,920
The Special Police Department is where the "Kaipan Deka" and the "Dolphin Deka" are.

70
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,020
I can't expect him to be a musician.

71
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,900
I'm going to go home because I'm going to be in pain.

72
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, I see.

73
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,340
You're going home, Ryo-tsu.

74
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,200
We're going to get a special bonus when the incident is solved.

75
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,180
A special bonus?

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,020
Then we'll arrest the culprit and get the bonus.

77
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,600
Ryo-tsu, I'm going to join the command of the Gekkou Deka.

78
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,340
Hmm...

79
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,600
Bonus, bonus.

80
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,420
Is the moon out?

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,060
It's out.

82
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,860
That is...

83
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:10,020
That back and the car weight attached to the door.

84
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,400
That is the Gekkou Deka, the night-time fighter that was active in the end of the Pacific War.

85
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,400
They call it Gekkou.

86
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,180
Then is that the ones who drive it?

87
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,960
The Gekkou Deka?

88
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Grrr...

89
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,940
Everyone prepare to be shocked!

90
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,860
An awesome pervert father will come!

91
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,700
There are three private detectives in Japan.

92
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,240
The sea, the dolphin, and me in the sky!

93
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,740
The Moon Dekka.

94
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,960
He's a good guy.

95
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,220
No way!

96
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,900
He's a special detective of the Moon Dekka.

97
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,860
Nice to meet you.

98
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,480
Nice to meet you!

99
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,780
And the other one.

100
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,700
My partner, the Venus Dekka.

101
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,780
I'm Venus. Nice to meet you.

102
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,500
Nice to meet you!

103
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,420
There's a normal person in the Special Investigation Department, too.

104
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,440
I got a bad feeling about it.

105
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,720
That's not mine.

106
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,420
It's mine.

107
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,880
The Pekomei Thief Squad has appeared.

108
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,780
Get ready to go!

109
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,840
Right away!

110
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:49,940
Aren't we going to the scene?

111
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,460
Before that, there's something we have to do.

112
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,220
Moonlight Power!

113
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,220
Dゃàn!

114
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,560
Like a

115
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,480
There's something wrong with that guy.

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,020
Let's hurry!

117
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,420
Look out!

118
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,960
Let's go!

119
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,080
I've got a bad feeling about this car.

120
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,900
I can't believe you're in the car.

121
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,700
I'm changing into something special.

122
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,740
Let me explain.

123
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,360
By changing your costume,

124
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,780
you can display 7 special abilities.

125
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,860
Now, I'll...

126
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,380
I-Is that so?

127
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,380
As expected of a special detective.

128
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,440
You're a real one.

129
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,780
But...

130
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,020
What kind of costume is he wearing?

131
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,380
The moonlight is my energy.

132
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,260
The messenger from the moon.

133
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,780
Moonlight Deca!

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,560
And Venus Deca!

135
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,800
I'm back.

136
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,260
The criminal who disturbs the world is...

137
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,320
I'll turn into the moon and...

138
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,620
I'll crush you!

139
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,000
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

140
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,760
What are you doing?

141
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,620
It's a ceremony.

142
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,940
Why are you wearing a sailor suit?

143
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,840
This is easier to move when the criminal is chasing after him.

144
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,620
And by showing the punch line,

145
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,340
I've killed many criminals so far.

146
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,160
You're getting sick and tired.

147
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,420
All right.

148
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,440
Now, let's all go.

149
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,000
You guys should change into this.

150
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,840
Me too?

151
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,860
Of course.

152
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,800
Me too?

153
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,580
Of course.

154
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,740
And then, me too.

155
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,640
You and Daijirou are like...

156
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,660
super love-love.

157
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,060
Well, it can't be helped if it becomes a mission.

158
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,380
What are you doing, Chief Ohara?

159
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,400
No, I'm changing into something else.

160
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,900
You're a contact officer.

161
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,460
You can stay here.

162
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,400
I-Is that so?

163
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
Sorry, everyone.

164
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,840
I don't want to!

165
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,800
I can arrest the criminal like this.

166
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,680
I can't stand wearing a sailor suit.

167
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,840
Then, Yamuen.

168
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,980
It's a forced transition.

169
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,020
The subordinate who defends the superior's orders...

170
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,320
I'll turn into the moon and...

171
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,140
I'll crush you!

172
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,000
Make up!

173
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:14,400
What?

174
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,040
Ouch!

175
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,820
I'll change into this.

176
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,600
I'll change into this!

177
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,460
I'll change into this!

178
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,380
I'll change into this, so let me go!

179
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:23,780
I see.

180
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,020
Are you okay, Senpai?

181
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,020
It was just a small accident.

182
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,140
What's wrong?

183
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,280
I heard a scream.

184
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,500
Hurry up and put on your pants!

185
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,800
I'm not going to show you anything.

186
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,280
I don't want to scare you!

187
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,340
Then, hurry up and transform!

188
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,660
If you keep on moving, the criminal will run away!

189
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,400
Oh, that's right.

190
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,380
Make up!

191
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,800
How is it?

192
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,880
It's not bad.

193
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,300
M-Make up!

194
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,180
How is it?

195
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,320
It's not bad.

196
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,320
It's like a rural school girl from the war.

197
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,520
Make up!

198
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,320
Look at those wicked duties!

199
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,000
"So cute!"

200
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,940
"Will you add tequila here?"

201
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,160
"You're making me angry!"

202
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,460
How can you say such things right now?!

203
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,810
It's not ok!

204
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,600
Ouch!

205
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,380
And what's that trunks for?

206
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,340
Any underwear of yours is my own!

207
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,500
You won't be able to bring that to the trunks!

208
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,440
Wait a minute!

209
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,720
You're wearing a new outfit.

210
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,880
What?

211
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
The next day

212
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,920
What do you think?

213
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,040
Wow! It looks good on you!

214
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,980
You look like a real high school girl!

215
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,620
Thank you.

216
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,680
But Reiko, you can't wear trunks on a sailor suit.

217
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,800
What are you thinking?

218
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,020
I don't wear trunks, do I?

219
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,940
Who's who?

220
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,520
What are you doing?

221
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,560
I don't want to!

222
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,500
Then everyone get on the moon.

223
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,560
There are two people on the moon!

224
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,940
If you get on, you can get on three more people.

225
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,220
Three people? There's one more person!

226
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,220
Don't worry. I have a special seat for you.

227
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,360
Huh? I feel like I'm being locked up in a nursing home.

228
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,900
Why are you doing this?

229
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,080
Go!

230
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,100
Go!

231
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,960
I'm scared!

232
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
Stop! Stop right now!

233
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,960
There it is.

234
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,480
Get off!

235
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,120
Get off me!

236
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,680
I just got a call from the moon that the culprit has just been taken away.

237
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,360
What?

238
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,360
No way!

239
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,280
I'm going back!

240
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,400
I did it! I'm on the moon!

241
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,180
What are you doing, Chief?

242
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,320
What?

243
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,700
This is too far away.

244
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,500
I'm gonna take you on a trip.

245
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,480
I'll be on the moon.

246
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,660
Watch it!

247
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,400
Watch it!

248
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,320
Watch it!

249
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,520
Watch it!

250
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,040
Watch it!

251
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,320
I'll catch you!

252
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,260
I'll catch you!

253
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,680
I'll catch you!

254
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,020
I'll catch you!

255
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,500
Watch it!

256
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,080
A lot of people are enjoying the view of the

257
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,000
It is amazing.

258
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,320
The view is amazing.

259
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,480
The view is amazing.

260
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,880
The Ekonome Setotan is the most famous sapphire

261
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,400
shop in the world.

262
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,240
The Ekonome Setotan is the most famous sapphire

263
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,360
shop in the world.

264
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,660
So, this is the notice board.

265
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,920
This is the notice board.

266
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,380
When the culprit was caught last night,

267
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,180
they didn't come to this place.

268
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,100
The chief's elite heard and they were amazed.

269
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,900
You should have changed your clothes

270
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,220
on your last night.

271
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,160
If you had changed your clothes,

272
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,080
you wouldn't have missed your culprit.

273
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,420
If you were told to wear sailor clothes,

274
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,060
there is no one who would change their clothes.

275
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,420
I'm curious.

276
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,660
I'll show you my ability today.

277
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,700
I don't know where the culprit is.

278
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,400
Let's disguise ourselves and guard the place.

279
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,180
Yes, sir!

280
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,320
Prince Venus, transform!

281
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,080
Yes, sir!

282
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,520
Moonlight Power!

283
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,160
Makeup!

284
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,180
Makeup!

285
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,880
Again?

286
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,980
Is he going to get a sale this time?

287
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,920
Let me explain.

288
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,680
I'm going to search for the clothes I bought last night.

289
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,020
At the moment, I'm transforming into a very ordinary person.

290
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,640
Then, I'll...

291
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,780
You look like a normal person right now,

292
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,880
so I don't think you need to transform.

293
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,640
Yeah, yeah.

294
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,940
Yes!

295
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,440
I've finished my makeup!

296
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,480
Wedding Moonlight Power!

297
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,480
Same as Wedding Venus!

298
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,180
I won't lose again!

299
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,060
What kind of ordinary person is that?!

300
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,060
During the wedding, the bride who was taken away by her ex-boyfriend

301
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,660
stopped by the department store as she was running away.

302
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,800
It's a common thing, right?

303
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,020
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,960
By the way, if you wear these clothes,

305
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:43,980
you can see the woman's eyes.

306
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,880
If you're sensitive to the woman's eyes,

307
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,120
and if you try to steal the jewelry,

308
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,300
you can see it in one shot.

309
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,780
I'm going to give you a candle service tonight!

310
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,760
Look, look, Venus.

311
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,740
This jewel looks really good on you!

312
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,160
Oh, my sister looks better on you.

313
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,640
Oh, my!

314
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,540
Venus is a good girl.

315
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,260
You look good on her.

316
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,640
My sister looks better on...

317
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,300
her.

318
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,400
Oh, Sam Genghis.

319
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,240
I don't think this is the world.

320
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,480
It's creepy.

321
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,360
Well, we can't say anything about people like that.

322
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,880
After all, we're in this outfit.

323
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,320
I never wanted to wear it.

324
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,680
What?!

325
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,680
What's wrong?

326
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,460
What's wrong?

327
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:33,860
Hurry up and turn on the light!

328
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,900
The tears of the princess!

329
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,940
It's gone!

330
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,180
What's this?

331
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
It's over there!

332
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,560
Over there!

333
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
You silly people!

334
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,320
I got the tears of the princess.

335
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,500
Then, adieu.

336
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,940
It's the building next door!

337
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,920
Hey! Hey!

338
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,020
This is strange.

339
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,960
There should be no suspicious woman.

340
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,740
Anyway, let's go!

341
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:08,480
Yeah!

342
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,260
What are you doing?

343
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,040
The game is over.

344
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,420
I'll show you the true power of Moon Dagger!

345
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,020
Even if you chase a dark cloud, you can only escape like this.

346
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,800
First, transform!

347
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,140
Moonlight Power!

348
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,380
Make up!

349
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,720
Venus, please give me a helmet!

350
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,880
Yes, sir!

351
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,300
Lovely Nurse Moon Dagger!

352
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,300
Also, Pretty Nurse Venus Dagger!

353
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,880
Transform!

354
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,900
Why are you a nurse?

355
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,100
Because I'm a man of honor!

356
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,260
Quiet!

357
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,120
There is a car that is running at a high speed toward South China.

358
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,480
It's the culprit's car.

359
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,140
Then, let's rush after it!

360
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,280
Okay!

361
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,340
Before that, transform!

362
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,500
Me again?

363
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,540
Moonlight Power!

364
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,380
Make up!

365
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:07,580
Oh, my goodness!

366
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,020
It's connected to the fans!

367
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,160
No way!

368
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,280
I feel sorry for Venus!

369
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,160
The queen is the moon, my lord!

370
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,600
The queen is Venus, my lord!

371
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,420
-I'm... -Pen-san!

372
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,400
What's with that outfit?

373
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,240
This is better for the night.

374
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,300
-I'm going to sleep. -What?

375
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,660
Is this it again?

376
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,300
It's stronger than last time.

377
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,900
Don't worry about it falling.

378
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,460
Attack!

379
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,180
Hey!

380
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,760
Don't we have enough distance to land?

381
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,620
It's okay.

382
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,200
We'll manage.

383
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,600
What?

384
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,080
What?

385
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,300
Why are you driving?

386
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,520
That's it!

387
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,040
Let's go!

388
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,080
He's so playful!

389
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,600
I can't run away anymore!

390
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,060
Give me some food!

391
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,020
You cat!

392
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,860
I won't let you go!

393
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,880
You're a bad guy, Ojogeya.

394
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,980
Hey!

395
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,540
It's climbing!

396
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,500
Climb!

397
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,320
Don't worry.

398
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,440
I'm surely very good at driving.

399
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,180
It's not safe at all!

400
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,640
It's bad!

401
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,860
I'll take it with one blow!

402
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,880
Hey! Don't just leave me!

403
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,700
If you don't leave me, I'll die!

404
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,420
I'll take it!

405
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,940
You idiot! You'll die here!

406
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,380
What's that?

407
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,120
They're trying to escape from the sky!

408
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,680
Look at that, it's huge!

409
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,700
You bastard!

410
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Fly over that airplane, Ryotsu!

411
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,460
What?

412
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,540
You're going to die before they get on board the ship!

413
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,380
What? They're three women. You can do it!

414
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,420
Don't joke!

415
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,160
You'll die if you fail to fly!

416
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,660
I'll give you two special bonuses!

417
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,260
Two special bonuses!

418
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,880
Got it?

419
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,560
I'll do anything for the world and for the people!

420
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,100
I'll arrest the culprit!

421
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
Alright, let's go!

422
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:16,780
Yeah!

423
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,380
I'll be the moon's savior!

424
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,200
I'm sorry!

425
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,900
No, don't do it!

426
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:27,920
Look!

427
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,460
You were looking for me!

428
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,480
No, no!

429
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,800
You're scum!

430
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,380
I'll take you for the world's emperor!

431
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:34,600
Yeah, okay!

432
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,260
I'll take you!

433
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,380
What do you want?

434
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,160
게?

435
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,920
He won't be able to fly...

436
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,380
I won't even be able to see him!

437
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,760
This is the end!

438
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,600
"I'm the most perfect monster for my age!"

439
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,080
Ouch!

440
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,860
What a mess!

441
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,300
They're all men!

442
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,900
They're all dressed up like women!

443
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,780
I don't want to be told!

444
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,920
Mission complete.

445
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,060
That was a good job, Ryo-tsu.

446
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,520
Well, if I were to be serious, it would be that easy.

447
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,240
The Kitten Eye Thief was disguised as a woman to attract the police.

448
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,480
The police thought she was a woman, so they couldn't catch her.

449
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
That's a double bonus!

450
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,600
Here's a special letter from the Special Police Department.

451
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,540
Here it is!

452
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,920
A cardboard box?

453
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,800
It's so big!

454
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,140
There's a letter in it!

455
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,360
As a special bonus for solving the case,

456
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,280
I'll send you a special police figure.

457
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,920
You can't get any other specials.

458
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,940
The Kite-Pan-Dekka, the Dolphin-Dekka,

459
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,620
the Moon-Dekka and the Venus-Dekka.

460
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,800
And to honor your performance,

461
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,660
I also got a special figure for you, Ryo-tsu.

462
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,740
Please cherish it.

463
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,980
Don't let me display it in my room.

464
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:36,600
I'm sorry.

465
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,200
This case is like Ryo-chan solving it all by herself.

466
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,660
I'll give it to Ryo-chan.

467
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,200
I'll do it.

468
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,300
Me too!

469
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,680
Here, Senpai.

470
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,200
Here you go.

471
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,720
I worked hard,

472
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,900
and worked hard,

473
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,140
and this is the result!

474
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,580
This is a double bonus!

475
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,600
I can't believe I'm getting this much money!

476
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,580
Why, didn't he buy the Iron Thread-Gun?

477
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,000
This guy was with the ordinary Secret Weapon Otaku.

478
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,660
We'll get back this Iron Thread-Gun to the key of the exit.

479
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,460
Next time: I'll deliver the Iron Thread-Gun.

480
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,560
Thank you for watching!

481
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:23,860

485
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,520
See the tomorrow, believe in the yesterday.

486
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,980
Draw the universe and stand up on the ground.

487
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,140
The roundhouse planet drawn a circle.

488
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,660
This should do it, right?

489
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,820
This should do it, right?
