00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Episode 1: The

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm hungry.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,700
Ah, Senpai.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,040
Your luggage has arrived.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,680
What? Food?

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,520
A relative of Shibamata brought it.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,820
Ah, the tempura shop's father.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,880
It's a bit heavy, though.

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,840
Ah, a sword!

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,780
Eh?

11
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,660
Ah, I remember that I left it at my house long ago, so I took it back.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,520
What is it? A cookie mold?

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,260
It's not a good quality thing.

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,640
You put clay inside and take the mold.

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,720
Where did you buy this?

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,360
It's on the street.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,160
There was a thing like a catch sales that was selling at a shop aiming for elementary school students' school graduation.

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,720
It's selling things like a handkerchief, a medicine that makes a sound by putting it on a cup, and something that makes children happy.

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,760
It's selling things like a handkerchief, a medicine that makes a sound by putting it on a cup, and something that makes a child happy.

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,880
This mold, clay, and gold powder were a set, so it was about 30 yen.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,980
Gold powder?

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,780
You put it on the molded clay.

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,940
What do you do with it?

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,380
You show it to the old man in the mold shop and get a point.

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,000
If you collect points, you get a big mold.

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,260
Eh?

27
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,740
Now that I think about it, it was a messy old man.

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,720
I'll have to check it out for now.

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,160
Old man, you did it!

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,320
Who? Who?

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,640
Hmm, it's no good to have one gold.

32
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,880
It's 200 points.

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,420
Eh?

34
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:22,460
Eh?

35
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,280
It would be better to use more red or blue silver.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,640
Old man, I did it too!

37
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,580
Oh, amazing!

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,080
This is 5000 points!

39
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,380
Eh?

40
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:30,880
Really?

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,100
Aoki-shi, it's nice to use 5 colors.

42
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,760
After all, the evaluation is decided by how much money you spent on the work.

43
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,940
It's a severe evaluation.

44
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,340
However, if you give up and try to go home, you will get a good point.

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,320
This is 1000 points.

46
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,000
I did it!

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,940
I'm still watching you work hard.

48
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,120
You're so naive.

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,060
It's a food to keep you from going home.

50
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,040
If you get more points, you'll work hard to collect them.

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,740
I did it!

52
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,500
It's 7000 points!

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:58,980
Change it!

54
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,700
Boy, it's a waste to change it now.

55
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,480
With 3000 points, you'll have a big mold like this.

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,580
That's true.

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,360
Okay, I'll do my best.

58
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,480
Please take care of me.

59
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,280
Hahaha, do your best.

60
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,860
The next day, the mold was gone.

61
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,320
It's a great house.

62
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,440
It's a great house.

63
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,300
I'm jealous.

64
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,720
There were many patterns that disappeared around the fourth day of the number of points.

65
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,020
When I threw away the number of points and forgot, it will come again.

66
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,240
Because the child is an idiot, I will be caught in the same hand again.

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,240
I see.

68
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,540
I have been complaining about the number of points for a long time.

69
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,540
This is a different person.

70
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,240
What?

71
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,460
It's different from the uncle.

72
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,540
Well, I don't remember well.

73
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,500
That man is a bad man.

74
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,940
It's not the old man.

75
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,420
It's different from the old man.

76
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't worry.

77
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,200
I see.

78
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,820
I'm glad.

79
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,620
I let him rest assured and it disappeared well on the fourth day.

80
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,560
Somehow it looks like the bad luck method in modern times.

81
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,480
I have also left it behind to know the identity of the other.

82
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,880
It's like Ryo-chan.

83
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,640
Hey, boy.

84
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,880
Go home quickly.

85
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,360
No.

86
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,640
It's going to disappear around tomorrow, so I'm going to stop the house.

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
Boy, I'll give you 100 yen.

88
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,360
What?

89
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:10,920
Really?

90
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,700
Yes.

91
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,420
Yay!

92
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,280
Yay!

93
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:13,860
I got it.

94
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,060
I got it.

95
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,640
It's a button.

96
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,220
When I turned around, the old man was no longer there.

97
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,420
It was already an art technique to disappear.

98
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,880
Well, I'm not talking about this today.

99
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,800
I can't eat a sword.

100
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,720
It can't be helped.

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,320
I'll drink tea and confuse my hunger.

102
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,700
What?

103
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,620
What is this?

104
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,780
What is this?

105
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,100
What is this?

106
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,720
When you watch TV,

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,980
make the room bright and try to look away.

108
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,980
Come to me, the poor man.

109
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,160
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

110
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,020
Look at the blue sky.

111
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,900
The white clouds.

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,620
I wonder what will happen.

113
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,640
They will come longer.

114
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,360
It is the time for you to find the Então it is like this.

115
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,100
Come to me who doesn't have a job.

116
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,980
What's wrong?

117
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,060
Why don't you worry?

118
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,440
Don't worry about it

119
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:45,000
Look, the red spider is burning

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,680
I wonder what will happen to it

121
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,620
You know it, right?

122
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,420
You know it, you know it!

123
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,740
If you know it, then shut up and follow me!

124
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,260
The Magic Pagoda

125
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,540
The Magic Pagoda

126
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,200
What is this?

127
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,560
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

128
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,600
The Pagoda...

129
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,920
There's a hole in it

130
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,420
Damn it, I can't drink tea with this

131
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,280
Well, that's why Ryo-sama is upset

132
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,440
If it's tea, I'll buy it

133
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,140
I don't really want to drink tea

134
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,940
I just wanted to drink tea and get hungry

135
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,120
You don't have any pay for this month?

136
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,620
There's only this left

137
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,440
Can't you buy a candy for 5 yen?

138
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,420
Maybe you can buy bread ears

139
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,200
Bread ears will make me full

140
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,700
If you're a mouse, you'll be full

141
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,860
What?

142
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,240
Don't be silly!

143
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,500
I'm sorry

144
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,200
Huh?

145
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,240
Maybe it's better to be a mouse

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,960
If we're all so mean

147
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,500
It turned out to be aуль

148
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,540
What the hell is going on?

149
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,000
I told you

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
It's better to be a mouse

151
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,820
Koume

152
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,580
Koume Hanayama

153
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,220
She is a higher-up in heaven

154
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,160
She is on a recommendations list

155
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,420
Of course, you can use magic.

156
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,300
Koume's old man is working for the Heaven Police.

157
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,120
Well, I don't care about him.

158
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,940
What did you say?

159
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,860
Everyone, long time no see.

160
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,580
Really? You're doing fine, Koume-chan.

161
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,980
It's been a while since the spring training camp.

162
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,280
Hello.

163
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,360
Hey, you don't have to greet me, just get back to normal.

164
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,700
Ah, I'm sorry, Ryo-san.

165
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,760
You're a pain in the ass.

166
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,180
I'm finally back to normal!

167
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,540
Ah, I'm sorry.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,760
You came to play a lot.

169
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,200
It was my first time meeting Maria.

170
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,360
Nice to meet you, I'm Maria.

171
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,060
Nice to meet you.

172
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,120
Nice to meet you, too.

173
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,120
You're so pretty.

174
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,940
Are you Ryo-san's girlfriend?

175
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,020
Don't be silly.

176
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,080
That can't be true.

177
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,800
Ah, someone's phone is ringing.

178
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,080
Huh? Ah, it's mine.

179
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,540
Even the high school girls in Heaven have their phones, don't they?

180
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,440
It's definitely from my old man.

181
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,340
When I go to the school, he tells me to call him regularly.

182
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,080
He's so noisy.

183
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,860
You're a protective old man.

184
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,780
Yes.

185
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,700
Yeah, I'm at Ryo-san's place.

186
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,620
And Maria has a very beautiful son-in-law.

187
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,520
What's going on?

188
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,500
Huh? I think I heard something.

189
00:07:59,500 --> 00:07:59,660
What's going on?

190
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,060
Grandpa!

191
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,100
Grandpa Bachi!

192
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,520
Where is Maria, who is very beautiful?

193
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,980
Oh, you're Maria?

194
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,580
Y-Yes.

195
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,480
Please come in.

196
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,860
I'm Rika Hanayama, the head of the Heaven Police Department Security.

197
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,560
Nice to meet you.

198
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,760
You're really a beautiful woman.

199
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,820
Y-Yes.

200
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,060
Are you free now?

201
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,280
Would you like some tea at my house?

202
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,240
It's right upstairs.

203
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,680
I'm picking up girls here.

204
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,620
Maria, you don't know that you're a man, do you?

205
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,120
I don't think so.

206
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,620
Probably.

207
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,440
You're such an idiot.

208
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,640
Wait, if you're good at cooking, you might be able to eat a lot of Heaven's food.

209
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,440
Just a little bit, please.

210
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,440
Ryo-sama.

211
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,140
Maria, go with him.

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,520
What?

213
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,440
You don't know what you're talking about.

214
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,340
Instead, I'll go with you.

215
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,320
What?

216
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,760
Ryo-sama!

217
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,040
You don't need me.

218
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,440
Maria is fine.

219
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,760
If you don't go with me, Maria won't go to your house.

220
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,500
I can't go with you.

221
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,440
I have no choice.

222
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,020
I'll take you with me.

223
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,700
So, how are we going to Heaven?

224
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,880
Just you wait.

225
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,100
My cacca, my cacca!

226
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,140
Hoi hoi!

227
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,060
Oh!

228
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,760
See you later, Koume-chan.

229
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,160
Yes.

230
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,780
Just say it to the chief.

231
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,560
Hold on tight!

232
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,840
I really went there.

233
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,960
So this is Heaven?

234
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,660
Apart from the cars flying around, it doesn't look any different from the ground.

235
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,160
That's not true.

236
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,940
Heaven has a lot of tourist attractions.

237
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,920
Look! That's Heaven's famous thing, the Heaven Tower!

238
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,680
It's really cheap.

239
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,320
That's Heaven's famous thing, the Heaven Castle.

240
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,760
This is even more suspicious.

241
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,740
Heaven's Nezumi Land.

242
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,020
Hey, hey, is this really okay?

243
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,240
Heaven's Rainbow Bridge.

244
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,860
Heaven's TV.

245
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,660
They're all just fiddling with the buildings on the ground.

246
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,660
That's not true.

247
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,540
The earth's earthlings are fiddling with it.

248
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,220
How do they do that?

249
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,200
Heaven might be able to see the ground,

250
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,620
but Heaven can't see the ground.

251
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,360
That's right.

252
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:23,900
I'll show you.

253
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,360
Don't say such things.

254
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,480
Lord Ryo?

255
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,840
What a violent old man.

256
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,460
I told you.

257
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,340
This is your house, huh?

258
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,040
That's right.

259
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,040
It looks like a small, old house.

260
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,380
Thank you for your help.

261
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,320
What? It's still a town.

262
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,360
Heaven and life are the same.

263
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,240
Heaven and life are the same.

264
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,680
I'll make you some tea.

265
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,180
I want to eat the food of Heaven.

266
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,660
Okay.

267
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,660
He's a nice guy.

268
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,700
I don't want you to tell him.

269
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,060
Maria, can you take a look at the painting I drew?

270
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,780
Yes.

271
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,860
How is it?

272
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,580
It's beautiful.

273
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,320
I didn't know you had such a hobby.

274
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,840
You're not good at painting.

275
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,040
You're not good at painting.

276
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,600
I'll destroy time until I can cook.

277
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,120
I see.

278
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,760
It's a town that's a long time ago.

279
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,820
It reminds me of my old friend's house.

280
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,220
Hey.

281
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,920
You can do it in a little while, so wait.

282
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,140
Okay.

283
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,920
I'm bored.

284
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,180
Why is the night view like this?

285
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,980
I don't know.

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,300
My night view is fine.

287
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,560
I wonder if my grandfather put it.

288
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,280
That old man.

289
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,220
That's right.

290
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,420
The night view of the living room is broken.

291
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,740
Can I take it?

292
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,780
I don't think so.

293
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,640
Then I'll take it.

294
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,640
Ryo.

295
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,480
Tell your grandfather to prepare the table.

296
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,500
Okay.

297
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:19,720
I'm here.

298
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,920
Maria.

299
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,380
Ah, Maria is beautiful.

300
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,120
I've never seen such a beautiful woman.

301
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:27,900
What?

302
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,580
I'll grab the heart of the beautiful woman.

303
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,860
Grandpa.

304
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,000
The food is ready.

305
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,080
Hurry up and prepare.

306
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,280
At this rate, we won't have a date.

307
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,080
Ah, Maria.

308
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,900
It's a UFO.

309
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,500
What?

310
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,480
What?

311
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,820
Where?

312
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,660
What?

313
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,720
What?

314
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,600
Where is the UFO?

315
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,280
Senior.

316
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,760
What's wrong, Ryo?

317
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,740
Huh?

318
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,300
Huh?

319
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,660
I was beaten.

320
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,100
It's that old man's work.

321
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,980
Damn it.

322
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,480
I couldn't eat the feast.

323
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,860
Damn it.

324
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,960
A gift from heaven.

325
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,020
What is this night view?

326
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,580
I can't help it.

327
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,480
I'll have tea with this guy.

328
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,240
Hot.

329
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:11,720
Hot.

330
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,840
What?

331
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,580
What?

332
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:13,800
What?

333
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,500
What?

334
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:14,580
Hot!

335
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,720
Stop the fire.

336
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,260
Actually.

337
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,660
A little faster.

338
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,440
Hurry up, hurry up.

339
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,140
Ah, hot, hot.

340
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,200
Ah, I'm going to get a burns.

341
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,900
Let's get a burns.

342
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,760
I was saved.

343
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,860
What are you?

344
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,040
Yes, I'm a magic

345
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,460
Magical night view?

346
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,560
Yes, I'm a magic night view.

347
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,080
The secret is to increase the money.

348
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,760
What? Really?

349
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,900
If you doubt it, I'll show you.

350
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,860
Put money in the basket.

351
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,060
All right.

352
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,820
5 yen.

353
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,340
That's all I have.

354
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,200
I'm just trying.

355
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,280
All right.

356
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,060
Increase, increase, money, increase.

357
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,060
Yes, yes.

358
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,120
Great.

359
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,820
Hey, what if I put it in again?

360
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,980
I'll try to increase it again.

361
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,780
All right. Try it.

362
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,620
Increase, increase, money, increase.

363
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,080
Yes, yes.

364
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,340
Increase, increase, money, increase.

365
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:29,360
Yes, yes.

366
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,260
Yes, yes.

367
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,940
Increase, increase, money, increase.

368
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,140
Yes, yes.

369
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,780
If I do this much, it's still 80 yen.

370
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,220
What did you do?

371
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,100
I did it.

372
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,600
It's not going to be 100 times at once, is it?

373
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,540
The double is the limit.

374
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,380
The original price is too low.

375
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,060
Then.

376
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,120
What?

377
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,240
Is it 10,000 yen?

378
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,520
No.

379
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,400
The manager told me not to lend money to Ryo-chan.

380
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,860
Just one minute.

381
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,100
No, it's okay for 30 seconds.

382
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,660
I'll pay you back soon.

383
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,320
But I don't have any cash with me.

384
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,460
What?

385
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,100
Lately, I can use cards at any store.

386
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,680
I don't need to carry it.

387
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,180
What a mess.

388
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,960
I'm the same.

389
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,540
If I don't have money, Ryo-chan will borrow it.

390
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,740
Damn it.

391
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,940
That's why the rich people are like this.

392
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,840
Terai.

393
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,960
You have cash with you, right?

394
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,640
Yes.

395
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,280
I'll definitely pay you back in 30 seconds.

396
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,980
So can you give me one full card?

397
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,040
But...

398
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,620
Can I believe you?

399
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,280
I understand. I'll lend you.

400
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,040
Thank you.

401
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,200
It's okay.

402
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,740
Ouch.

403
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,980
I'll pay you back soon.

404
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,760
I don't have any cash with me.

405
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,360
Hurry up.

406
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,440
What?

407
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,360
What's wrong?

408
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,460
I think I dropped my wallet.

409
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,200
What?

410
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,440
I think it's from the patrol.

411
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,280
It's my money!

412
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,580
Don't drop your wallet, you idiot.

413
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,780
Shit!

414
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,980
It's a time of magic.

415
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,400
It's a time of magic.

416
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:03,860
This is a treasure.

417
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,640
Hey, can you use any other magic?

418
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,780
That's what I'm talking about.

419
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,680
I can turn a stone into a diamond.

420
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,220
I can turn a stone into a diamond.

421
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,920
A stone into a diamond?

422
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,220
I can't do that.

423
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,220
I'll go and bring you the stone.

424
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,940
Ah, Senpai.

425
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,840
What's wrong?

426
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,860
It's okay.

427
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,660
Ohara-buchou

428
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,540
I just got a call from the temple, but the night view is broken.

429
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,960
Yes, the hole is open.

430
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,720
Let's change it while we go to the library.

431
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,240
Are you going to do it in the back?

432
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,160
Ah, me?

433
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,320
Yeah, I don't mind.

434
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,300
This is it.

435
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,700
I'll bring you a new one soon.

436
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,560
I'll bring you a new one soon.

437
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,080
Senpai, Ohara-buchou just...

438
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,760
Wait, wait.

439
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,920
Don't you know the night view over there?

440
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,660
Ohara-buchou brought it.

441
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:11,880
What?

442
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,900
He said he'd change it.

443
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,100
What?

444
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,580
You're doing your own thing.

445
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,000
He's really attached to that night view.

446
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,840
You did something wrong.

447
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,380
What are you doing, Buchou?

448
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,740
That's not just a night view!

449
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,900
Give it back!

450
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,500
It's a night view!

451
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,320
Hey, where's the night view?

452
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,140
Night view?

453
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,660
Where's my night view?

454
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,460
My...

455
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,620
Night view...

456
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,800
Where is it?

457
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,460
Where's the night view?

458
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,320
What?

459
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,680
Night view?

460
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:52,860
Where's my night view?

461
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,440
Night view?

462
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,240
If it's a night view, it's over there.

463
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,540
Oh, my!

464
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,280
Night view!

465
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,900
Ouch!

466
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,700
Ouch!

467
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,580
Hey, hey!

468
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,640
Ryozu, Kankichi, you...

469
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,600
Are you okay, night view?

470
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,520
Hm?

471
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,840
If you look closely, it looks completely different.

472
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,960
Damn it!

473
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,640
Night view!

474
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,080
Wh...

475
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,000
What was that?

476
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,060
He's finally broken.

477
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,660
Night view!

478
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:21,860
Night view!

479
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,600
Where's my night view?

480
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,300
Buchou!

481
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,020
Huh?

482
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,960
Night view!

483
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,640
Where's my night view?

484
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,680
Right here.

485
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,600
Oh!

486
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,700
Night view!

487
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,040
Oh, I didn't expect you to be so happy.

488
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,020
It was worth bringing a new one.

489
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,960
Huh?

490
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,320
A new one?

491
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,800
Hmm...

492
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,840
What's up, Ryozu?

493
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,960
It's not this.

494
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,860
I brought it from the station.

495
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,040
I brought it from the office.

496
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,800
Then I left it in the beauty room.

497
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,640
Beauty room?

498
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,680
No!

499
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,100
What's wrong with him?

500
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,380
No! No! No!

501
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,420
No!

502
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,880
Where is it?

503
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,960
Answer me!

504
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,800
No! Where is it?

505
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,760
Where did it go?

506
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,100
No!

507
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,860
No! No!

508
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,380
Is there any other gun?

509
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,720
I think I brought a rugby club's handgun.

510
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,060
It's a rugby club.

511
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,640
I'll pour magic water on you.

512
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,200
It's magic water.

513
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,080
This is it!

514
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,400
This is my handgun!

515
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,260
Gear gun!

516
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,820
Hey!

517
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:45,980
Take it!

518
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,000
I told you it's mine!

519
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,260
I'll kill you!

520
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,800
You're in my way!

521
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,620
I'll kill you!

522
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,600
You're in my way!

523
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,000
Are you okay, gear gun?

524
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,040
I'm sorry to make you drink water.

525
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,280
Okay, I'll let you eat the stone.

526
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,440
What?

527
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,780
You're going to make it into a diamond, Logan!

528
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,080
That's right.

529
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,700
I'm going to make it into a diamond.

530
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,740
I'll fire it with this katana.

531
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,360
Here you go.

532
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,060
You've tried all kinds of things, but you're not going to die.

533
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,640
I'll show you haiku!

534
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:39,860
You're not going to die from this.

535
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,300
This is the in the first edition's

536
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,580
best looking cutie-pie.

537
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,400
You can't even taste it yourself, Logan.

538
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,120
I never had a chance to taste it before.

539
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,000
Oh, you want to eat it yourself, Logan?

540
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,420
You don't have Master's armor.

541
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,540
I have a lot of luck.

542
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,940
He's a busy guy, too.

543
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,660
I'll be leaving soon.

544
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,940
Eh?

545
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,820
It'll be a little longer, right?

546
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,860
But I have work to do.

547
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,080
Oh, right.

548
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,200
I'll show you something rare before I go home.

549
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,100
If you give me the diamond in that nightclub, I'll get Maria's heart.

550
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,000
I got it the other day.

551
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:18,760
Here.

552
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,240
Eh?

553
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,300
Ah!

554
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,340
What is it?

555
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,380
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

556
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,140
What is it, old man?

557
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,220
I'm sorry.

558
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,520
Where is the nightclub?

559
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,440
I gave it to Ryo-san.

560
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,340
What did you say?

561
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,800
I'm sorry.

562
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,260
I didn't know it was a magic nightclub.

563
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,420
Damn it!

564
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,540
You're always in my way!

565
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,640
It's over there, right?

566
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,920
Then bring it to me.

567
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,080
Here.

568
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,900
Looks like he hasn't really used it yet.

569
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,700
I need to change the personality.

570
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,080
Change!

571
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,220
Oh, no! Why is it here?

572
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,420
I'll bring the diamond back to its original place.

573
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,740
Maria!

574
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,060
I'll be back soon!

575
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Let me rest for a little while.

576
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,540
Oh, please.

577
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:22,600
Please.

578
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,280
Eh?

579
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,300
Eh?

580
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,200
Ah!

581
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,760
Ah!

582
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:33,880
Ah!

583
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:33,960
Ah!

584
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,020
Ah!

585
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,660
I feel something strange in my head.

586
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,480
I-I can't believe it.

587
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,660
No, it can't be.

588
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,560
Ah!

589
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,820
I just heard that Maria is a man.

590
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,860
Eh?

591
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,660
Man?

592
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,920
It's a mankind.

593
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,660
Oh!

594
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:50,760
Hahaha!

595
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,220
Nee!

596
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,300
Ah!

597
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,200
We ate it.

598
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,100
Hey! How much is it?

599
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,920
It's 4562.75 yen.

600
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,180
It's cheap!

601
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,480
I will come to eat it again.

602
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,680
Then, I will pay you.

603
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,060
Just like this.

604
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,420
And then...

605
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,180
"Call the jewelry inspector!"

606
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,060
He should buy it at a reasonable price.

607
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,180
That's what you're saying?

608
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,500
You're so impressed by the diamond, aren't you?

609
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,100
Sir, you're kidding...

610
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,720
Please, do it properly!

611
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,240
What's wrong? You have to be more careful!

612
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,900
Why?

613
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,960
Sir...

614
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,880
That's right, there should be a stone that you changed to diamond first.

615
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,920
This, this...

616
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,480
What?

617
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,780
Hey, you, do something about it!

618
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,660
No!

619
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,680
You can't trust me!

620
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,140
Hey...

621
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,100
You can't trust me!

622
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,680
It's not done yet.

623
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,380
Hey...

624
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,720
It's too late!

625
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:28,740
Hey, the jewelry...

626
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,460
The treasure!

627
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,940
No, let me go!

628
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,680
Hey...

629
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,560
I just walked through the black place

630
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,640
Everyone was a child once, but they all forgot

631
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:00,560
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above their eyes

632
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,920
Turn around and look at that corner

633
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,580
I can see everyone

634
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,480
Let's go!

635
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,360
There's a wall over there

636
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,180
There's definitely a wall

637
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,300
Everyone, come to our town

638
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,360
Thank you!

639
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,120
"Electronic Plus is in love with Lemon?"

640
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,320
"You finally woke up to a manly feeling?"

641
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,600
"What? No answer for an email?"

642
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,980
"No way! No way! Emotions can't be transmitted by an email!"

643
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,420
"A man should hit and crush the person directly!"

644
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,820
"Next time, I'm going to fall in love with Lemon!"

645
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,980
"I'll be in your care!"

646
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,540
There's a wall over there There's definitely a wall

647
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,660
Everyone, come to our town
