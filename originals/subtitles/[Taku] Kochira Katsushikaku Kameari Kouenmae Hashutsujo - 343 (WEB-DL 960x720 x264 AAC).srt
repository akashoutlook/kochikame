00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,800
I look up at the sunset floating in the middle of the sea

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,340
I kick a pebble and fly to the end

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,200
I looked at the taiko player jogging

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,600
And they said he was perfectly dressed

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:38,520
The sound of the everyone cheering is so brothy

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,680
The townscape keeps changing, it's so nice

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,480
Because the shells cry, the fireflies appear

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,740
The cocks are running and the veal is so big

10
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,320
People are lying on the grass in the middle of the 잘못ed day

Don't eat it while holding it.

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,760
No, I can't quit my job at the sushi shop because of this.

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,860
Toro.

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,380
Yes, big toro.

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,020
Toro is no good!

40
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,720
I knew it.

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,820
I've been thinking about asking you this for a while.

42
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,680
Why is tuna toro so cheap?

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,720
Because it's a small piece of tuna, it's very valuable.

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,240
Besides, we only use gold-mine tuna.

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,260
Black-mine tuna is no longer available.

46
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,900
I see.

47
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,460
But if you don't know the price, customers will be scared.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,400
The price is decided by the loan, so it can't be helped.

49
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,540
It smells like money.

50
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,500
It's 193 yen!

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,340
To make it cheap, you should reduce the average margin.

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,640
It's not worth it.

53
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,220
I'll buy it.

54
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,120
It's expensive because it takes a lot of effort.

55
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,540
If the sushi shop goes to catch fish directly, it will be cheap and stable.

56
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,860
That's true, but it's impossible.

57
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,700
No, I can do it.

58
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,700
I think Kanbei has a friend who catches tuna in Amuri.

59
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,320
I'll catch it right away.

60
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,460
Oh, wait a minute.

61
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,540
I've gone.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,420
That's his idea.

63
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,860
Yes, I've been waiting here for so long.

64
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,540
That's right, I've been waiting here for so long.

65
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,980
When do you get here?

66
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,420
I think it's around the house I was talking about.

67
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,080
You're working hard.

68
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,140
You think you can be easy on the superiors.

69
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,420
I bet you can get a little more than that.

70
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,060
It's öyle.

71
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,260
What is it?

72
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,440
So this is Gen-san's ship.

73
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,580
Hemingway?

74
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,420
What is this weird name for a ship?

75
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,660
The last name is "way."

76
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,860
In other words, Hemingway.

77
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,620
It's a name like a bandit.

78
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,680
Is grandpa Gen-san?

79
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,740
Or is he not Gen-san?

80
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,760
What?

81
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,380
What is it?

82
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,840
Don't call me San-chan-go.

83
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,280
Why?

84
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,280
Hemingway is an old man and a sea.

85
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,400
I don't know that.

86
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,560
If you don't know such a famous novel,

87
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,000
remember that the main character of this novel is San-chan-go.

88
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,820
I see.

89
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,080
Anyway, haven't you heard about me from Kanbei?

90
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,420
I have.

91
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,660
I'm a tuna fisherman.

92
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm a stupid grandson of Kanbei who came to teach you about the sea.

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
Stupid is unnecessary.

94
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,560
From now on, I'll teach you the spirit of the man of the sea.

95
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,520
The man of the sea has the scent of salt.

96
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,980
Is that so?

97
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,820
It's more like alcohol than salt.

98
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,760
Yesterday, I put out a ship in the sea of alcohol.

99
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,840
As expected of a master.

100
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,620
You're cool.

101
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,400
I still have something to tell you.

102
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,900
The place where the man of the sea died...

103
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,520
What? Wait a minute.

104
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,720
What?

105
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,940
What's wrong with your face?

106
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,340
Did you fight a shark?

107
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,260
This?

108
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,820
I was killed by a shark named Neko.

109
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,580
That's not cool.

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,480
Get on.

111
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,480
Boy, you're new.

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,040
Yes.

113
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,740
What's up, Captain San-chan-go?

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,480
Why is the super poor man here?

115
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,300
That's my line.

116
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,460
I see.

117
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,480
You're moved again.

118
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,520
It's gross.

119
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,020
No, that's...

120
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,920
It's like a stag.

121
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,740
Shut up.

122
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,880
To become a super rich man,

123
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,140
I need the patience and tenacity of a man of the sea.

124
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,460
My father says so.

125
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,260
I'm just coming to learn from him.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,680
There is no tuna to catch a big man like you.

127
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,220
Shut up.

128
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,780
If you catch a fish with your own power,

129
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,500
you will be able to solve the problem.

130
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,280
What?

131
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,500
You're moved again.

132
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,940
Shut up, super poor man.

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,980
If you're with me,

134
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,200
I can't meet you.

135
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm going to train on another ship.

136
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,800
San-chan!

137
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,300
Hey, everyone.

138
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,000
Did you bring lunch?

139
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,420
I made three servings.

140
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,140
What are these girls?

141
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,580
They are my girlfriends.

142
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,000
Girlfriend?

143
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,620
Girlfriend?

144
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,760
They are like old men.

145
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
Usually,

146
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,660
beautiful granddaughters make lunch for you, don't they?

147
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,120
The man of the sea is very popular.

148
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,440
Oh,

149
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,740
you're the thin boy San-chan said.

150
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,700
Boy?

151
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,580
Please catch a big tuna.

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,360
Please.

153
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,640
Leave it to me.

154
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,320
Can I go with you?

155
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,260
Okay.

156
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,360
I'm going to train.

157
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,580
Boy, take off the rope.

158
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,500
Boy.

159
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,800
Hey, my son.

160
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,400
What?

161
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,360
Is this about me?

162
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,400
Why am I a boy?

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,080
And I'm not an idiot.

164
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,600
Old people and the sea have a boy they respect the most.

165
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,580
Is it so?

166
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:13,760
What's that?

167
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,340
Hurry up, boy!

168
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,020
Yeah, yeah.

169
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,340
San-chan, do your best!

170
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,160
If you catch a big one, please give me a plastic bag!

171
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,220
Is it okay to go to Honborokan like this?

172
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,680
I'm going to be swallowed by the waves before I catch a tuna!

173
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you okay?

174
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,400
I feel bad...

175
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,760
You're a coward.

176
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,340
Don't complain.

177
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,300
Boy, don't you have anything?

178
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,600
I don't have anything.

179
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,340
You're a pretty good boy.

180
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,460
Boy, don't you eat?

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,180
You're a pretty good boy.

182
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,820
You're a pretty good boy.

183
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,340
I'll eat it.

184
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,620
You're a pretty good boy.

185
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,380
San-chan, why are there so many birds over there?

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,720
I'll tell you a good story.

187
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,300
When a bird is swarming on the big sea, a legendary fish appears.

188
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,200
It came!

189
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,160
The one I'm chasing after...

190
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,660
The one I'm chasing after...

191
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,460
The one I'm chasing after...

192
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,720
The one I'm chasing after...

193
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:45,900
The one I'm chasing after...

194
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,800
The one I'm chasing after...

195
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,560
It looks like a bad thing, but the engine is a twin turbo.

196
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
It's faster than any other ship.

197
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,620
Boy, get ready to go!

198
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,600
Boy, get ready to go!

199
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:25,460
It seems that it was hit by a tuna.

200
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,880
How do you know tuna?

201
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,100
It's a long-time fishing rod.

202
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,820
I was watching a fishing expedition.

203
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,940
I thought it would be better to see it with my rod.

204
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,000
I thought it would be better to see it with my rod.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,920
All right.

206
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,420
I think it's okay.

207
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,900
Wow!

208
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,620
But...

209
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,160
If the tuna

210
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,500
If the tuna

211
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,200
If the tuna

212
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,740
If the tuna

213
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,300
If the tuna

214
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,920
If the tuna

215
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,360
If the tuna

216
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,920
If the tuna

217
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:05,960
If the tuna

218
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,080
If the tuna

219
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,460
If the tuna

220
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,420
If the tuna

221
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,140
It was close to 2 meters.

222
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,920
It's not a sea bream.

223
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,100
You don't look happy to catch a big fish like this.

224
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,920
I don't want to catch a small fish.

225
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
It's a sea bream.

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
Sea bream?

227
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,600
It's the owner of the sea.

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,840
All right.

229
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,500
What is it?

230
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,820
Isn't it a black tuna?

231
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,800
It's a small fish.

232
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,140
But it's a tuna.

233
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,260
I'll catch it.

234
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,020
What?

235
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,520
It looks like a whale.

236
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,140
Is that a sea bream?

237
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,220
Is it really a sea bream?

238
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,420
What?

239
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,500
It's a sea bream.

240
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,020
But it's a sea bream.

241
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,920
Help me.

242
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,080
I'll catch it.

243
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,040
Damn it!

244
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,980
I will not forgive you.

245
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,340
He's the best rival.

246
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,760
I can't let him go this time.

247
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,600
There are 250 km/h.

248
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,500
It's countless.

249
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,280
How many kilometers do they go?

250
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,380
About 5 million.

251
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,940
That much?

252
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,440
You're going to do that?

253
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,760
You're going to get a lot of debt if you catch one, huh?

254
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,320
Oh, no, one isn't enough.

255
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,180
Boy, I'm going to do this tuna for you.

256
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,180
What? Really?

257
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,200
I'm going to say something cool.

258
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,660
Listen carefully.

259
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,640
I'm not interested in anything other than Aragami.

260
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,160
What do you think?

261
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,540
You're cool, Captain Sanjago!

262
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,260
This is the man of the sea.

263
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,040
Super poor man, I'm sorry, but please push the shutter.

264
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,180
Come on, hurry up.

265
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,520
It's worth 500 people.

266
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,460
Taro is also a top-class product.

267
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,980
It's fresh because it was ordered by Nakagawa and sold.

268
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,940
I heard that you have a debt of 5 million yen.

269
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,400
Hey!

270
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,420
Look!

271
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,040
You can cut it.

272
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,600
Wow!

273
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,720
I'm going to make a profit!

274
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,500
Well, Captain Sanjago's house is around here.

275
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,680
I'm going to make a profit.

276
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,860
What?

277
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,780
Is that Captain Sanjago's house?

278
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:40,440
Is that Captain Sanjago's house?

279
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,720
Chan-chan, the boy is here.

280
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,840
Chan-chan, the boy is here.

281
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
Huh? Boy? What happened?

282
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,380
You were rich, weren't you?

283
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,560
Well, I've been taking tuna since I was ten years old.

284
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,840
Well, I've been taking tuna since I was ten years old.

285
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,780
It's really a big deal to have a brandy in one shop.

286
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,540
What a grandpa!

287
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:03,700
A grandpa!

288
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,460
You don't complain too much about your family.

289
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,820
I don't need a family to be a man of the sea.

290
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm a lonely man of the sea.

291
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,500
You say that often, you make girls around here and there,

292
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,440
and they are used to being abused and left.

293
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,620
Did you say that?

294
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,740
Well, you are just like Kanbei.

295
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,360
What do you want from me?

296
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,220
I quit the police and decided to become a fisherman with tuna.

297
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,520
I quit the police and decided to become a fisherman with tuna.

298
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,960
Please let me catch tuna with you.

299
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:35,880
That's right.

300
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,760
I'm not interested in anything other than Aragami.

301
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,520
Aragami has already gone to Sanriku.

302
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,460
He'll come back next year.

303
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,080
Then let's chase him.

304
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,920
Let's catch Aragami together.

305
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,400
I can't go.

306
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,080
The next day

307
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,360
Shiratori, what are you doing?

308
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,540
Thanks to the picture you took, I'm so moved.

309
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,940
That's why I'm like this now.

310
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,660
Huh?

311
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,940
You're the president of Shiratori Fishing Company?

312
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,460
Hahaha.

313
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,400
You let me know that I'd make money by talking about tuna.

314
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,880
I'll start a fishing company.

315
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,040
How about that, super-poor people?

316
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,180
Would you be my employees?

317
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,100
Hey, kid!

318
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,240
Where is San-chan's super-poor?

319
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,780
Don't you like his house?

320
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,840
Huh?

321
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,040
It's better than my house.

322
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,920
Haha.

323
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,640
Your house is great, but it's not as expensive as that fish farm.

324
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,580
We have a big fish farm that goes to the very end of the earth.

325
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,460
There's always a tuna herd around.

326
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,380
The killer is running around the Sanriku area chasing a prey.

327
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,140
I'm planning to join the helicopter from now on.

328
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,460
Really? Then take us with you.

329
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,760
Oh, do you want to be my staff?

330
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,660
No. I'll sell the tuna I caught to you cheaply.

331
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,500
Captain Sanjago will go too.

332
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,780
No.

333
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,960
Aragami will catch it.

334
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,980
Maybe Aragami is too big to be scared.

335
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,080
That's not true.

336
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,440
Okay, deal.

337
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,940
Then take me with you.

338
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,500
On the boat.

339
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,660
On the boat?

340
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,740
It's like a statue and a ring.

341
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,180
The amount of tuna is not the matter of the boat.

342
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,240
The important thing is to reach the herd quickly.

343
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,420
I'm not impressed.

344
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,380
Anyway.

345
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,500
Let's search the bird mountain.

346
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,720
Look for the bird mountain.

347
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,340
It's faster to search with your eyes than your eyes.

348
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,420
Well, that's true.

349
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,320
Oh, it's working.

350
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,440
All right.

351
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,620
It's working.

352
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,080
It works.

353
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,360
It works.

354
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,340
It works.

355
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,380
It works.

356
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,440
They found a tuna. They're going to catch it.

357
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,440
What are you doing? You're getting let go.

358
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,760
President, we can't. We're pulling the line.

359
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,260
That ship is too fast.

360
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,560
What a bunch of tuna!

361
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,740
This is the first time we've had this many of them.

362
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,800
All right, let's do this!

363
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,640
You're late. We caught all the tuna.

364
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,380
Huh? Who are they?

365
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,440
The ship is sinking because we caught too many.

366
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,960
Hurry up and get them!

367
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,400
We caught 200 of them, so we'll take a few and get 1 billion.

368
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,160
Shiratori, I'll pay you in cash.

369
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,700
I'll pay you after I sell them at Tsukiji.

370
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,560
I'm not kidding. If I don't pay here, I won't sell.

371
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,480
There's no way we can get 1 billion in cash right away.

372
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,480
Help me!

373
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,860
I can't swim!

374
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,300
You're such a hard-working guy.

375
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,040
Here!

376
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,140
It's the ararami!

377
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,240
Captain Sancharo!

378
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,520
What are you doing?

379
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,140
We're going to catch ararami!

380
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,280
I can't.

381
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,620
What a bunch of tuna!

382
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,180
I'll pull the boat!

383
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,040
This is bad. There's not enough rope.

384
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,940
Captain Sancharo!

385
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,180
We have to get them!

386
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,560
But you're still the man of the sea!

387
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,480
Hemingway is crying!

388
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,000
Then you should do it!

389
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,120
What?

390
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,060
Then you should do it!

391
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,100
You should fight like the sea!

392
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,900
Get them down!

393
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,020
Idiot!

394
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,760
No way!

395
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,740
No way!

396
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:20,600
No way!

397
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:20,960
No way!

398
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,560
No way!

399
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:21,640
No way!

400
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,260
No way!

401
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,880
No way!

402
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,240
No way!

403
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,680
No way!

404
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,660
No way!

405
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,460
No way!

406
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,120
No way!

407
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,660
No way!

408
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:41,760
No way!

409
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:41,820
No way!

410
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,220
No way!

411
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,080
It's pain in the butt!

412
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
No way!

413
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,520
You're not going home!

414
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,540
Why so shoot?

415
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,640
Pagoda!

416
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,060
3. A Moose

417
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,920
4. A visceral nols

418
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,640
Yes!

419
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,500
My tribal rival. It was a magnificent battle!

420
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,620
The Sea Man, San-chan finally got Aragami.

421
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,500
I caught a sea urchin!

422
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,820
You fool!

423
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,100
You haven't done anything!

424
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,300
Help me!

425
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,560
I can't swim!

426
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,960
What's a sea urchin without swimming?

427
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,860
Captain Sancha-go was very happy.

428
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:40,940
He was very happy.

429
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,020
One sea urchin for 100 million yen.

430
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,360
That's a lot of sea urchins.

431
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,700
I just entered the capital.

432
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,860
I have about 20 minutes left.

433
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,980
I'll wait for you.

434
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,560
Of course.

435
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,060
200 sea urchins at once.

436
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,640
By the way,

437
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,360
I've got a story to tell you.

438
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,840
8 years ago,

439
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,380
I was a sea urchin and you were a sea urchin.

440
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,080
What are you talking about?

441
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,780
I'm 8 years old and you're 2 years old.

442
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,860
The transportation fee is all paid by me.

443
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,020
What?

444
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,720
Wait!

445
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,260
Look ahead.

446
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,860
Oh, no.

447
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,180
You...

448
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,220
Oops.

449
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,200
Ouch, it hurts.

450
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,380
Ouch...

451
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,280
You're talking nonsense,

452
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,620
that's why this happened.

453
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,660
It's because you're greedy.

454
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,500
Huh?

455
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,160
Whoa!

456
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,860
A 500 million sea urchin

457
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,740
I'm going to catch you, Shiratoi!

458
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,040
Damn you!

459
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,660
Tuna?!

460
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,860
I can't stop at all!

461
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,600
What's this?!

462
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,140
Tuna!

463
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,820
What's this?

464
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,620
Tuna?

465
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,720
Papa's going to be impressed again!

466
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,240
My 10 billion yen!

Episode 6: Masamune Uchidaka

471
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,400
Guys, we've brought you into great trouble by now.

472
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,440
Now we're saying our goodbyes to you all!

473
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,420
"What? Do you think you can run away from me that easily?"

474
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,080
"You know how easy it is for me to get lost like this, eh?"

475
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,760
"How about trying to scare me?"

476
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,060
I just wanted to say that.

477
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,660
Hey, wait!

478
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,680
It's a lie!

479
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,960
