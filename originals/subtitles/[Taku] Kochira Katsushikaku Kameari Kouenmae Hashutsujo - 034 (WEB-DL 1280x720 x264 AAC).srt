1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,340
The Big Dipper of the Rumors

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,160
-Soiri-san! -So, what's up?

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,060
-Good morning! -Good morning!

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,580
Ah! Chief Ohara! Good morning!

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,220
Good morning, Chief!

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,260
Good morning!

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,140
Good morning!

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,360
Oh! Good morning, Ryo-chan!

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,060
Ryo-chan?

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,180
Well, you look fine, after all.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,920
W-What is it, Chief?

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,300
Today, I have a very important and special task for you.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,640
Task?

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,540
Even though you're Hiroshi, the head of the Katsushika office,

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,420
you're the only one who can carry out this mission.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,320
Ryo-chan!

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,780
I have a bad feeling about this.

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,180
It's a joint investigation with the Chief.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,740
You and the veteran Keiji Kitano will combine together.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,020
Keiji Kitano?

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,980
You know him, veteran?

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,680
No, just his name.

23
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,480
It's just a story about an elite detective who has a 100% criminal record.

24
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,200
That's amazing, Ryo-chan!

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,480
To be selected by such an elite detective's partner...

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,540
Here you go, Chief.

27
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,940
Thank you.

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,520
But why me?

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,020
Well, that's because...

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,200
The Chief asked me to send the most powerful person in the Katsushika office.

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm the head of the Katsushika office.

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,220
So I recommended you.

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,380
I'm convinced of that.

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,780
What?

35
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,960
You're the head of the Katsushika office.

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,080
According to the Chief's attitude of work, he's thinking about your promotion.

37
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,280
What? Promotion?

38
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,260
I love Japanese with a lot of money!

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,480
You did it, Senior!

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,720
It's a chance!

41
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,500
If it's a promotion without a test, Ryo-chan might be able to do it.

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,280
What do you mean, Tera?

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,760
It's about time we arrived.

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,880
Well, I'll be leaving now.

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,620
What? You're leaving already?

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,120
Please introduce yourself.

47
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,180
Well, I'm going to do a lot of things from now on.

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,240
Hey, Chief!

49
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,840
Wait a minute!

50
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,920
Listen carefully.

51
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,840
Listen to what the North Police officer says and obey him honestly.

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,120
Chief!

53
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,880
What's that? What is it?

54
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,780
Chief!

55
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,520
I somehow managed to escape.

56
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,640
Huh?

57
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,420
They're coming! They're coming!

58
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,200
Nakagawa! Kushi! Kushi!

59
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,700
Yes!

60
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,760
Ryo-chan, your tie is bent.

61
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,460
Oh, I'm sorry.

62
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,200
Listen, Ryo-san.

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,160
This is important for the first impression.

64
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,200
You have to do it right.

65
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,380
I'm getting nervous.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,740
What are you doing?

67
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,060
Oh, it's Ryo-chan.

68
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,560
You have to do it right.

69
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm just doing it my way.

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,720
S-ommelier...

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,120
Keep your eyes off me, Taka.

72
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,900
I don't know who you are.

73
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,100
I can't be helped.

74
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,800
Where's Kisha-kun...

75
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:25,940
A detective?

76
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,600
I'm a detective from the north.

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,980
My name is Kaipan Deka.

78
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,680
I have my profile on the back of the case.

79
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,940
Please take care of it.

80
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,340
He's a good guy.

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,980
I can't read without my glasses.

82
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,280
But why?

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,940
Because I'm the only one wearing a uniform.

84
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,640
Well...

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,680
He's sharp.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,360
He's 100% sure that the culprit is the real culprit.

87
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,100
I don't have to ask anything else, right?

88
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,180
Alright.

89
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,540
I'll answer you.

90
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,040
All animals except humans are naked.

91
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,580
In other words, this is the nature.

92
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,300
You guys don't realize that your body is being taken away by the uniform.

93
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,140
You, try to bend your body.

94
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,180
Like this?

95
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,820
No, just like that.

96
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,820
What do you mean by that?

97
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,180
Just like this.

98
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,100
Try it.

99
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,820
If you're naked like this,

100
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,300
the load of the uniform will not interfere with your body movement.

101
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,940
You can move freely.

102
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,660
That's dangerous.

103
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,320
However, there is no limit to the naked body.

104
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,140
The human's potential motor nerves are increased to the extreme by being naked.

105
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,980
When the culprit is arrested,

106
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,540
he can make a dangerous move.

107
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,760
Can you do it just by being naked?

108
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,680
Throw me.

109
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,000
Now.

110
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,640
Then, without hesitation,

111
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll throw you.

112
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,160
Then, without hesitation,

113
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,920
Damn it!

114
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,240
I can't catch it even if I slide!

115
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,760
I can't catch it even if I slide!

116
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,000
There's no place to catch a naked body.

117
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,660
There's no place to catch a naked body.

118
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,820
There's no place to catch a naked body.

119
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,080
Are you alright, Ryo?

120
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,880
This is the secret oil that our Kitano family is passed on.

121
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,160
The burning scent that flows in the air

122
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,680
also has the effect of calming the guilty's irritated heart.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,160
also has the effect of calming the guilty's irritated heart.

124
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,080
Everything is logical.

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:25,980
I think so.

126
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,760
In other words,

127
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,700
this is the natural way that a detective should be.

128
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,120
a natural way that a detective should be.

129
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,020
Don't ask me why you're naked.

130
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,320
You too should ask yourself why you were in such heavy uniform.

131
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,220
Ask yourself.

132
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,480
He's not because you're embarrassed.

133
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,700
Ryo!

134
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,540
What's wrong?

135
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,420
I can't.

136
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:53,100
Here I'm eenstexed because Kitano's ヅ

137
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,480
- And one more thing. - There's more?

138
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,880
- No! - By not decorating the side of the house,

139
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,140
you can break the heart of the culprit.

140
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,920
That's all. Any other questions?

141
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,180
- Yes. - Good. You?

142
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,200
What's on your feet?

143
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,740
A spare gun.

144
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,700
- But normally... - That's right.

145
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,400
The detective wearing the uniform is wearing this to hide the spare gun.

146
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,400
Then he'll be seen and stand out.

147
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,500
The culprit is not only a heartbreaker, but also a...

148
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,900
- No! - That's right.

149
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,300
But...

150
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,320
I hate to hide things.

151
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,740
What's that?

152
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,940
Even if the culprit is a criminal,

153
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,700
I will deal with them with justice.

154
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,340
That's my policy.

155
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,720
Perfect. It's logical in everything.

156
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,200
Where?

157
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,680
Yes.

158
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,140
Why do you do that?

159
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,140
It's time to recharge energy.

160
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,780
No matter what the situation is,

161
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,800
I always have a meal on time.

162
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,660
How about you guys?

163
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,480
- Good. - Good.

164
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,340
Damn. The chief.

165
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,360
He knew about this and ran away.

166
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,960
By the way, my partner, Ryo-tsu...

167
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,860
Here.

168
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,380
Unfortunately, Ryo-tsu is sick today.

169
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,500
He's resting.

170
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,760
What?

171
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,660
Sick?

172
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,960
That can't be helped.

173
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,540
Then I'll choose from the members who are here now.

174
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,260
This person is Ryo-tsu.

175
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,260
What's the point of my appearance?

176
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,280
The board and the tie are our clothes.

177
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,200
Since you're my partner,

178
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,380
you must follow my policy 120%.

179
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,120
Do you understand?

180
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,760
If you go out in this outfit,

181
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,120
I'll catch you before I catch the culprit.

182
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,880
Ryo-tsu, your butt is loose.

183
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,780
Pull it tighter.

184
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,460
How?

185
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,900
Like this.

186
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,100
Like this?

187
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,440
No, no.

188
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,040
Look.

189
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,940
Is it the pants again?

190
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,380
Like this.

191
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,260
Amazing.

192
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,480
This is a technique that can never be done

193
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,540
without wearing clothes.

194
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,800
What's the point of doing it?

195
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,100
It's useless even if you wear it.

196
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,900
Oh, it's not mine.

197
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,880
It's different from my phone.

198
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,100
It's mine.

199
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:28,820
What?

200
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,060
Yes.

201
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,580
A pigeon or a pangokki will come out now.

202
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,340
It can't be.

203
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,200
What?

204
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,160
A serial robber has killed an enemy?

205
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,760
A serial robber?

206
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,740
I understand.

207
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,140
I'll go to the scene immediately.

208
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,780
I'll go to the scene immediately.

209
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,340
Let's go, Ryo-tsu.

210
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,380
It's too much to be an elite detective.

211
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,580
The culprit is standing in the school

212
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:56,880
for the sake of the students.

213
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,080
The long investigation has finally

214
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,900
tied him up, but

215
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,280
this is not good.

216
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,020
That's fine, but

217
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,000
I can't move like I thought

218
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,480
if it's this cold.

219
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,180
I see.

220
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,020
Then, I'll wear my tights.

221
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,240
I'm going to wear my tights.

222
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,740
I'll wear my tights.

223
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,420
I'm wearing my tights.

224
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,860
I'm wearing my tights.

225
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,120
I'm wearing my tights.

226
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,440
I don't like clothes.

227
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,440
I don't like clothes.

228
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,940
I don't like clothes.

229
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,120
Don't!

230
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,300
Don't!

231
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,620
Give up your head!

232
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,480
Let go of a равa

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,340
and calm down!

234
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,300
Shut up!

235
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,260
If you come any closer,

236
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,740
I don't care what happens to her life!

237
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,020
Shut up!

238
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Shut up!

239
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:03,860
You're here!

240
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,060
Wh-wh-what happened?

241
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
Wait for me, Kusano!

242
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,720
Chief, how's the situation?

243
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,020
It's not good. The culprit won't listen to my persuasion.

244
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
The hostages are almost at their limit, both mentally and physically.

245
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,020
How long are you gonna make me wait?

246
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,800
Die now!

247
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,080
You're pretty excited.

248
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,720
I understand.

249
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,600
Leave the rest to me.

250
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,840
Put the mobile unit down to the gate.

251
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,740
I got it.

252
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,020
I'll leave it at the gate.

253
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,020
Let's go, Ryotsu.

254
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,460
What?

255
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,700
Let's go.

256
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,900
Kusano, be careful with the mobile unit!

257
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,100
I don't need it. I'm a big shot.

258
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,240
N-no, you don't need it.

259
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,360
No matter what you think about it...

260
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,800
Ryotsu, follow me.

261
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,740
F-follow me? W-w-wait!

262
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,040
W-w-what's with him?

263
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,060
Don't come near me!

264
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,120
I'm innocent.

265
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Leave this to him.

266
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,660
Huh?

267
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,600
You're his partner, right?

268
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
What are you going to do, running away?

269
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,340
I'm just...

270
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,040
I'm just...

271
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm just...

272
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,040
He's just so reckless!

273
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,060
Watch out! Watch out!

274
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,100
Stop shooting.

275
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,040
We're all in.

276
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,820
We're just here to talk to you.

277
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,460
Then what's that on your leg?

278
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,100
What's that on your leg?

279
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,980
What's that on your leg?

280
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,680
You found out?

281
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,400
Of course!

282
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,720
Now, this should do it.

283
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,700
You're not hiding anything yet, are you?

284
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,300
W-w-what's going on?

285
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,460
No, no.

286
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,980
Energy supply is 30 minutes away.

287
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,220
Don't you feel nervous?

288
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,060
Damn it.

289
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,080
Damn it.

290
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,760
You're exaggerating!

291
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,560
You can't be scared.

292
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,180
But I am!

293
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,180
Look.

294
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,960
Since you'll be using this for your first time...

295
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,320
can you use this?

296
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,320
Can you use this?

297
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,520
What?

298
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,700
Damn it.

299
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,080
What are you doing?

300
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,100
I have to use it.

301
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,600
I have to use it.

302
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,400
Now I am in neutral state.

303
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,780
Now I am in neutral state.

304
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,860
What are you doing, Ryotsu?

305
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,340
What?

306
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,780
Oh, no way.

307
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,440
This is...

308
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,280
You can't do that!

309
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,560
Ryotsu.

310
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,840
It's a matter of life and death.

311
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,100
I understand.

312
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,660
Get out of here.

313
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,880
Get out!

314
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,680
Hey!

315
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:14,900
Senpai!

316
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,060
Ryo!

317
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,060
Ryo!

318
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,400
Listen, I'm going over there.

319
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,840
Calm down and listen to me.

320
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,260
Long time ago...

321
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,540
It was a long time ago...

322
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,500
I went to a place...

323
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,300
Hey, hey, hey!

324
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,620
You haven't been convinced!

325
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,120
What?

326
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,080
What?

327
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,980
What are they doing?

328
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,780
Those people!

329
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,320
Stop it!

330
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:46,880
Tell me!

331
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,700
What are those perverts doing?

332
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Shut up!

333
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,740
Don't ask me!

334
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:52,980
Now!

335
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,060
I'm falling!

336
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,220
I did it!

337
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,320
High five!

338
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,160
Roar!

339
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,560
You a-

340
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,680
I'm here, detective!

341
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,400
Ryotsu, protect her.

342
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,480
Yes sir.

343
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,440
Don't come any closer!

344
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,080
Don't worry.

345
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,420
I'm better looking than her.

346
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,700
Darn it...

347
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,580
So you still refuse?

348
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,380
You intend to coal with me?

349
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,960
If you got caught by Furuchin's detective, you'll regret it for the rest of your life!

350
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,480
This guy's Furuchin!

351
00:14:49,100 --> 00:15:04,160
Yah-tah!

352
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:05,680
What?

353
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,180
You're not a bullshitter, but I'm a monster!

354
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,080
It seems the oil smells good.

355
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,980
The oil smells good?

356
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,740
Ryotsu, what's wrong with her?

357
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,560
She ran away under the table because she was scared.

358
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm sorry.

359
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,380
It's okay now.

360
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,840
It's over, Miss.

361
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,020
I'm sorry.

362
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,360
Oh, I was just being careful.

363
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm sorry for jumping in front of the lady.

364
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,360
My tie was bent.

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,080
Lower! Lower!

366
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,600
Hey! It's over!

367
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,340
It's over!

368
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,360
I did it, Mr. Kitano!

369
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,840
Isamu, let's go home soon.

370
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,260
Watch out!

371
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,060
Is everyone okay?

372
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,040
Yes, sir!

373
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,740
That soul?

374
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,560
-What is it? -I don't understand.

375
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,780
-There's nothing to explain. -There's nothing to explain.

376
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,920
It's�도 mono.

377
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,260
Can you remember if you didn't steal the towel and get the person?

378
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:51,620
He didn't steal the towel.

379
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:51,740
The staff never told me this story.

380
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,840
So you called me Mr. Kitano.

381
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,880
I-I...

382
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,740
Didn't you call me Mr. Kitano before?

383
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,680
You couldn't tell me.

384
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,460
L-Let me get to work.

385
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,160
I need to keep buying new clothes.

386
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,540
Mr. Kitano.

387
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,840
-I'm sorry. -And this is a present.

388
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,800
Put on the same tie as mine, and do your best for the new year.

389
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,340
Ah, thank you very much. I'm so happy.

390
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,740
Tomorrow at 8:30, tie it to an important place, and come to my place.

391
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,160
Eh?

392
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,280
It's called "Full-chin Deca."

393
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,540
Kaipan Deca and Full-chin Deca. You two are going to be a great pair.

394
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,900
Don't be ridiculous! You pervert!

395
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,920
You're not going to use me in the Golden Time!

396
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,400
You're an idiot!

397
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,620
Next, I'm going to face the Hyper Junior!

398
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,080
Hyper Junior vs. Ryou!

399
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,440
Hyper Junior vs. Ryou

400
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,360
Alright!

401
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,080
Um, I was lost on the way there.

402
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,220
They're taking you in now. Wait, wait!

403
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,740
Ryou, what are you talking about?

404
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,060
Teach him properly!

405
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,140
Don't talk to me!

406
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,300
What are you doing?

407
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,920
It's over!

408
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,780
What is it?

409
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,300
I'd like to borrow your map.

410
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,820
Come on, just find it yourself.

411
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,440
What year is this map?

412
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,720
I don't know that!

413
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,820
It's the latest version of the one released this year.

414
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,580
Thank you.

415
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,820
No, thank you.

416
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Sergeant Nakagawa, we have returned from the patrol.

417
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,700
Thank you for your hard work.

418
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,000
I see.

419
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,040
This river was built and turned into a road.

420
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,100
I should be able to find it.

421
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,300
All right, let's convert the navigation software.

422
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,320
Navigation software?

423
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,920
You have that kind of thing?

424
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,400
Yes.

425
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,160
Could you please convert it into a desk?

426
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,160
A computer is being built into it?

427
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,400
Where is the keyboard?

428
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,200
A solo board?

429
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,320
It doesn't seem to be just a solo board.

430
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,200
I see.

431
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,400
Oh, what a great finger work!

432
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,660
Oh!

433
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,400
A solo board is the keyboard.

434
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,340
The conversion is complete.

435
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,460
That's great!

436
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,900
Let's save it.

437
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,320
That's pretty good.

438
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,160
It's 1 o'clock.

439
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,800
It's time for the cram school.

440
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,100
Wow, it's even managing the schedule.

441
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,840
Oh no, we won't make it to the cram school.

442
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,060
Let's just fax the homework print.

443
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,760
Oh, fax.

444
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,740
Don't worry.

445
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,840
What?

446
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,700
What? Even a fax?

447
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,680
It's a printer, too.

448
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,760
What... what is this awesome set...

449
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,580
Who are you?

450
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,820
I'm Deng finances.

451
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,860
My direct heir is the president of the Super Electronics Dept.

452
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,480
Huh?

453
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,060
It's the company the most popular with electronics!

454
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,280
So, that's the company's treasure.

455
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,140
That's why you have one.

456
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,680
No.

457
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,960
This Super Electronics Land Cell...

458
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,900
I'm still in the process of testing it, and I'm currently monitoring it.

459
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,180
Are there any other functions?

460
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,740
It's a corporate secret, but I'll show it to you as a thank you for showing me the map.

461
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,140
Alright, alright.

462
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
-Amazing! -Amazing!

463
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,800
-Amazing! -Amazing!

464
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,840
All the classes are taken with this, and printed out.

465
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,560
48x zoom, the world's largest digital camera.

466
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,360
Amazing!

467
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,360
But I feel relieved when I see something like this in here.

468
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,220
It's nostalgic!

469
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,280
It's also a side item.

470
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,040
We'll inform you of the weather forecast for the Tokyo region.

471
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,720
First, the sky.

472
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,040
There's a north wind, then a south wind.

473
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,440
-I'll take care of looking after this! -Amazing!

474
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,440
You can control the dead on this display.

475
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,240
There's a lot of music.

476
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,980
It'll turn on various switches, and it's still a prototype.

477
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,920
It's pretty heavy. About 5kg.

478
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,940
We use it to train our bodies.

479
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,820
There's even that?

480
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,460
Uh, hold on. A moment please.

481
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,080
I'm in trouble. Dad's going to get mad.

482
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,960
Don't say anything harsh. I'll give it back to him.

483
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,380
Ryo, don't be like that.

484
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,560
Just a little.

485
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,960
My precious flower!

486
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,660
Ryo!

487
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,280
This airbag is useless.

488
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,240
It's a basic defect.

489
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,820
There's a chance of improvement.

490
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,260
Don't monitor me!

491
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,780
It's a very old-fashioned airbag.

492
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,100
It's also for adults.

493
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,360
For adults?

494
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,640
It's a little weird.

495
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,340
What are you thinking?

496
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,800
It's not an airbag for adults.

497
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,940
It's attached.

498
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,840
Wow!

499
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,860
It even has a communication function.

500
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,520
It's like a machine gun.

501
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,000
It uses a special satellite for communication.

502
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,860
If you register your fingerprint,

503
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:58,980
other than the owner,

504
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,540
it will be locked.

505
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,560
I think businessmen will want it.

506
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,980
We plan to sell it after the land sale.

507
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,120
We're looking for a monitor for 50,000 yen per month.

508
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,280
50,000 yen?

509
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,500
Okay, I'll do it.

510
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,340
Really?

511
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,380
Leave it to me.

512
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,680
Senpai, you haven't contact with me.

513
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
I'll leave it to you.

514
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,480
I'll contact Ryo.

515
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,340
Senpai!

516
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:29,720
Huh?

517
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,520
Good morning...

518
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,080
What do you mean, good morning?

519
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,100
I took a three-day break

520
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,740
and I met the chief.

521
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,960
What's that?

522
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,440
This is a manual of his.

523
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,180
He made it up in three days.

524
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,760
He has nothing but work.

525
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,300
Thanks to that,

526
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,720
he can use the Internet

527
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,260
and other digital cameras.

528
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:50,720
Perfect.

529
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,520
I even opened a website.

530
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,420
Wow, that's amazing in such a short period of time.

531
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,820
Besides, I asked the president to put in a new feature.

532
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,780
You're pretty good at this, Ryo.

533
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,840
I'm good.

534
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,260
What's with this flash?

535
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,400
It's the current position of the director.

536
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,620
The director?

537
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,500
Yeah, I put a transmitter on the director.

538
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,880
It's getting closer and closer.

539
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,060
This speed is like a car.

540
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,520
What?

541
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,200
If you enter within 500 meters, a warning will be set.

542
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,960
I don't think I can do this.

543
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,080
I'll go to the monitor. See you later!

544
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:32,820
Senior!

545
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,600
Ryo!

546
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,000
He really came.

547
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,100
-Good morning, director! -Good morning, director!

548
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,660
Good morning.

549
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,940
Ryo is coming today, isn't he?

550
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,200
That's because...

551
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,680
What? The monitor?

552
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,480
That idiot...

553
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,620
Are you going to do another health check-up?

554
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,080
Health check-up?

555
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,240
Ryo hasn't taken regular check-ups for 15 years.

556
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,580
That much?

557
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,540
This morning, he was lectured that the director didn't get the information.

558
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,860
I've already made a declaration that I'll take a health check-up.

559
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,340
You don't have to go that far.

560
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,000
Anyway, we have to find Ryo.

561
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,600
It's impossible. It's like a gun.

562
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,680
There's no way to find him.

563
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:18,620
Then, what do we do?

564
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,680
If we don't do it, I'll lose my head.

565
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,880
That's right! Let's call Plus!

566
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,480
Come on! Come on!

567
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,100
You can watch the movie of the road show right away!

568
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,620
And it's 1,000 yen!

569
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,020
Come on! I won!

570
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,420
1,000 yen!

571
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,500
It's 8,000 yen!

572
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,260
8,000 yen!

573
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,580
8,000 yen!

574
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,120
8,000 yen!

575
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,920
8,000 yen!

576
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,700
This is the spirit of money!

577
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:46,920
I'll take it!

578
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,680
I'll take it!

579
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,560
Oh, it's a phone call.

580
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,860
Is it the president of Super Base?

581
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,860
Hello?

582
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,040
Hey! Ryo!

583
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,440
Don't take a rest!

584
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,360
Chief! Why do you know this number?

585
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,940
I'm just looking at you!

586
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,040
Ryo, take a health check-up today!

587
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:08,880
Come back soon!

588
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,360
Oh, shut up!

589
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:11,380
You're a lot of work!

590
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,720
I've got a phone call!

591
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,340
Plus, is there no other way to find him?

592
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,280
You're right.

593
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,780
You said you put the transmitter on the president.

594
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,560
I think it's possible to check it from frequency.

595
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,240
All right! Let's find the transmitter.

596
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,920
It should be somewhere on the president's body.

597
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,600
Well, that guy...

598
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,640
What a surprise!

599
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,220
Okay!

600
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,220
Where is it?

601
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,900
Where is it?

602
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,600
Nothing! Nothing!

603
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,140
Nothing!

604
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,400
Oh!

605
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,820
Oh, no, no, sorry, sorry.

606
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,780
N- no, it's okay.

607
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,260
There's no other way to make money.

608
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,940
You're a bad boy.

609
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,480
Huh?

610
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,160
Chief, I'm sorry.

611
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:51,920
Huh?

612
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,960
What are you doing?

613
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,320
That's all, excuse me.

614
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh, it's not me.

615
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,980
The profit of hundreds of millions will be a par.

616
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,260
Hundreds of millions?

617
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,380
Hey, what's wrong?

618
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,320
The computer equipped with the car broke down,

619
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,960
so I couldn't get the important information.

620
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,860
If it's computer communication,

621
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,720
I can do it with my Super Electronics GX767.

622
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,900
Really?

623
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:14,980
Yeah.

624
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,460
Oh.

625
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,040
However,

626
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,480
the access fee is high.

627
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,220
It seems that you can earn a lot of money,

628
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,420
so you don't get a hundred percent of your income.

629
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,500
That's expensive.

630
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,760
It's 1%

631
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,920
I can't help it.

632
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,980
How about 7% in between?

633
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,540
What do you mean by between?

634
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:35,940
No, I mean,

635
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,400
if you don't want to, that's fine.

636
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,860
Uh, okay, okay.

637
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,400
I'll help you with 7%.

638
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,160
Okay, I'm ready to make a deal.

639
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,140
Hurry up.

640
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,160
It's White House.

641
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,320
At 5:00 p.m. Japan time,

642
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,040
the purchase price of the next year's Orange Save will be announced.

643
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,300
I want to know that.

644
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,720
We don't have much time.

645
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,820
Where's the address?

646
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,240
Here it is.

647
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:55,720
Yeah.

648
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,460
What's the password?

649
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:57,980
Okay.

650
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,440
It's pretty fast.

651
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,240
I'm using a special communication satellite.

652
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,160
Yeah.

653
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,600
The Orange Save is coming out.

654
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,600
It's higher than last year.

655
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,420
Hey, contact the headquarters

656
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,180
and buy Orange Save all over the world.

657
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,060
Yes.

658
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,420
Excuse me.

659
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,220
The battery is out of charge.

660
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,100
You idiot.

661
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,860
Yeah, use my phone.

662
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,400
It's a special communication satellite,

663
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,440
so it'll be connected soon.

664
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,840
Oh, thank you.

665
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,660
Found it.

666
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,140
That guy,

667
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,760
he's paying for the bonus.

668
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,680
Lend it to me.

669
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,940
I'll connect it soon.

670
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,400
Ryo,

671
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,280
I'll find it and

672
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,420
give you medical examination.

673
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,800
Wow!

674
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,540
The Orange-related company's stock

675
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,900
has gone up twice as fast as it has

676
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,520
You're doing great, Mr. Ryo.

677
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,920
The stock market of London will open soon.

678
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,300
Access me.

679
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,320
I got it.

680
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,920
I'm so pissed.

681
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,380
What about the Orange stock?

682
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,000
Oh.

683
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,160
The trading is about to start.

684
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,500
London is twice as good.

685
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,040
Okay, sell it to me.

686
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,000
Idiot.

687
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,720
Can you compete with a double?

688
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,160
Even if it's a share, it's not a double.

689
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:10,940
It's similar.

690
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,520
Wait, wait.

691
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,260
Wait until the three times.

692
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,800
No matter how much it is, it's not that much.

693
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,520
It's delicious, but it's very solid.

694
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,400
Thanks to you, I earned about 300 million yen.

695
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,200
Thank you.

696
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,600
300 million yen?

697
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,480
That's good.

698
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,580
No, no.

699
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,500
It's 300 million dollars.

700
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,580
Dollars?

701
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,840
Well, if one dollar is 110 yen...

702
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,300
3.3 billion yen?

703
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,120
Yes.

704
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,660
Now, your share.

705
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,380
It's 7%.

706
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,040
1, 10, 11, 12...

707
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,840
23.1 billion yen?

708
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,860
23.1 billion yen!

709
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,960
Is it okay to get so much?

710
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,000
Yes.

711
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:56,900
It's a promise.

712
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,080
More importantly, you have the talent for business.

713
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,960
You have become my partner.

714
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,240
Would you like to become my partner?

715
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,240
Partner?

716
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,620
Please become my co-owner with 1 billion yen a year.

717
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,980
1 billion yen!

718
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,880
Something like that.

719
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,260
No, no, no.

720
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:13,940
Okay.

721
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,540
Okay!

722
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,880
Good morning, sir.

723
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:31,980
Good morning.

724
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,180
Good morning.

725
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,880
- Hello? - Hello.

726
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:41,540
Good morning, sir.

727
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,740
- Good morning, sir. - Good morning, sir.

728
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,260
Good morning, sir.

729
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,820
- Good morning, sir. - Good morning, sir.

730
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,100
Good morning, sir.

731
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,840
Good morning, sir.

732
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,400
How is his sitting?

733
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,540
Not bad.

734
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,620
It's bad!

735
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,020
The wheat in Ukraine is being destroyed!

736
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,640
What?

737
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,260
The American wheat market is going up!

738
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,440
The American wheat is being suppressed by other investors.

739
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,740
Let's buy Australian wheat!

740
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,860
Wait! Don't call!

741
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,420
At this time, you should meet with the farmers directly.

742
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,680
I see.

743
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,840
Vice president, will you fly with me to Australia?

744
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,780
It's a good question.

745
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,080
I made Haneda wait for the next flight.

746
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,760
We'll go straight to there.

747
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,620
As expected, the executive is different.

748
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,300
Ryotsu seems to have headed to Haneda Airport.

749
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,860
Ryotsu, are you going to fly somewhere?

750
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,800
Really?

751
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,920
Hokkaido or Kyushu?

752
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,460
I wonder.

753
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,400
It's that plane.

754
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,540
It's a foreign plane.

755
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:02,100
What are you going to do, chief?

756
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,300
I have a neck injury.

757
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,940
I'll get a medical checkup no matter what.

758
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,360
I won't let you get away, Ryotsu!

759
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,100
Chief?

760
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:12,960
I'll take care of the aircraft.

761
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,760
The SR71 will definitely catch up with me.

762
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:31,760
What?

763
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:36,960
The SR71 will definitely catch up with me.

764
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,360
No!

765
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:39,740
No!

766
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,300
No!

767
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,440
No!

768
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:40,800
No!

769
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,060
My father...

770
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,380
What's with this busy schedule...

771
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,780
Hello?

772
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,180
Ryotsu!

773
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,440
What are you doing in Australia?

774
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,880
Chief, what are you doing here?

775
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,180
Ryotsu-san, I didn't ask you to monitor us going overseas.

776
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,100
What's wrong?

777
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,340
Oh, nothing.

778
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,600
I was just talking to you about something important...

779
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,360
Ryotsu!

780
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,420
Come out!

781
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,580
Go back to Japan and get your medical checkup!

782
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,740
Chief, what's with that?

783
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,380
Damn it!

784
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:21,940
That guy Nakagawa!

785
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,780
I can't just stay here and wait.

786
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,660
Let's get this over with.

787
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,600
Hey!

788
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,760
You thief!

789
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,900
What a great decision.

790
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,300
Yeah.

791
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,400
Hey!

792
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,000
Can't you go faster?

793
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,740
What's wrong with you?

794
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,240
How dare you!

795
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,540
How dare you!

796
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,900
Ryotsu!

797
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,520
You can't run away from us!

798
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,140
We have a Super Land Cell here!

799
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,940
We have a Super New Generation too!

800
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,540
It's a good idea!

801
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,300
That's why we're not going anywhere!

802
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,180
Come back and get your medical checkup!

803
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,080
Okay!

804
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,720
I quit being a policeman and became a vice president for 1 billion yen!

805
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,380
I can't get my medical checkup now!

806
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,940
What nonsense are you talking about?

807
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,540
The world is already different from the president of the common people!

808
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,960
Goodbye!

809
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,460
What do you mean, goodbye?

810
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,660
Nakagawa, can you do a counterattack?

811
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,380
I don't have any armament!

812
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,720
Urasku, is there anything?

813
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,680
There's a signal bullet in the land cell.

814
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,240
Is that so?

815
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,680
Is there anything like that?

816
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,240
It's for your safety.

817
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,140
All right, that's enough.

818
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,140
You're persistent!

819
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,260
Good job, Plaskun!

820
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,720
What are you going to do?

821
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,580
I'm going!

822
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,980
What's going on?

823
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,040
Damn it!

824
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,260
Which one are you going to do?

825
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,880
There's a missile in the land cell.

826
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,000
Even if I die, I should have a weapon!

827
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,660
I don't want to die!

828
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,140
Ow, ouch!

829
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,780
All right!

830
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,980
Good job!

831
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,460
Are you crazy?

832
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,420
Nakagawa, return to Japan by force.

833
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,780
Roger that!

834
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,380
Good job!

835
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,000
Ah!

836
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:28,940
Huh?

837
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,960
Huh? What's this button?

838
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,260
Ryo!

839
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,960
Justice always wins!

840
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,520
That's right!

841
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,820
You're a bad luck guy!

842
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,200
You're a bad luck guy!

843
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,500
Ryo, is there any other way to catch Ryo?

844
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,720
You can if you're a good luck guy.

845
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,900
But if you're able to catch him...

846
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,420
Why don't you call him again and persuade him?

847
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,480
It's useless.

848
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,100
That's right. I have a good idea.

849
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,120
What?

850
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,420
Hey, hey! You're not a fake!

851
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,780
Hey, brother!

852
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,900
Here! Here!

853
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,480
Ryo!

854
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,680
Ryo, that's not all.

855
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,600
The gold market is falling.

856
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,780
Next, sell all the gold that I have.

857
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,820
I got it!

858
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:33,980
Hurry up, Ryo.

859
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,060
Don't be in a hurry.

860
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,240
Huh? That's strange.

861
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,380
I can't access it.

862
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,160
What are you doing?

863
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,480
If you don't hurry, I'll be in big trouble.

864
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:43,720
It's strange to say that.

865
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,920
Oh, I'm already losing $50 million every second.

866
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,860
Hurry up, Ryo!

867
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,580
Ryo!

868
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:53,740
Forgotten!

869
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,900
Ryo!

870
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:55,800
probabilistically

871
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,740
I thought you didn't want to tell him anything

872
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:57,940
that I hadn't thought you didn't want to inform the girls and the others.

873
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,300
that I hadn't thought you didn't want to inform the girls and the others.

874
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,260
what if I were in trouble.

875
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,320
I knew better.

876
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,360
What the heck are you doing!

877
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,140
Let's go!

878
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,300
Why would you do that?

879
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:08,660
I can't before.

880
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,100
Why would you do that?

881
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,160
Why would you do that?

882
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,280
Why would you do that?

883
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,920
He's showing me his interest.

884
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,080
I'm so sorry.

885
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,640
I've already spent $1.2 billion.

886
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,320
It's a sound lock.

887
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,920
I'll have to open it with a stick.

888
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,380
I think it was a dummy.

889
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,180
What?

890
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,060
It's a good thing.

891
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,640
I think it was a do-fa-ra.

892
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,340
What?

893
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,260
That's a good thing.

894
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,840
It's a good thing.

895
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,560
It's a good thing.

896
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,480
We've made it.

897
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:52,740
What?

898
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,900
Be quiet!

899
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,720
Two Chinese noodles and one ramen and rice please.

900
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,960
Don't play around!

901
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,480
What should I do?

902
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,980
Thief!

903
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,240
What are you doing?

904
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,700
Sell the gold!

905
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,140
Thief!

906
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,140
Thief! Thief!

907
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,720
Hey, I'm the real one! Thief! Thief!

908
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,480
Thief!

909
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,920
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Stop! Let go!

910
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,580
I'm the owner's Ryotsu!

911
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,000
You're not the real one!

912
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,920
I'm the real one!

913
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,340
Ryotsu!

914
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,520
To protect the secret data,

915
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
we'll blow up in 60 seconds.

916
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,480
What?

917
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,120
59, 58, 57,

918
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,700
Don't mess with me!

919
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,660
Ryotsu, you!

920
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,260
That's not it.

921
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,600
If you keep going like this,

922
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,520
your strategy will be ruined!

923
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,360
50 seconds left.

924
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,000
Mr. Ryotsu,

925
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,920
you have a unique business sense.

926
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,440
Really?

927
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,320
I've been thinking so for a long time.

928
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,560
I saw it with my own eyes,

929
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
so I threw it away.

930
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,260
But...

931
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,400
My love is...

932
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,840
My eyes are just like a dead skin.

933
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,660
You're a head!

934
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,980
I'll use this to cover up your loss.

935
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,380
3, 2, 1.

936
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,680
It seems that the protection device

937
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,140
for the secret data worked.

938
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,380
Over there!

939
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,820
What's wrong?

940
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,940
How lucky I am to be saved by that explosion!

941
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,040
The protection device was not enough,

942
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,260
so the airbag was activated.

943
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Let's report this to the government

944
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:46,920
to improve it.

945
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,120
I'll take any medical examinations,

946
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,980
so help me!

947
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,800
Ryotsu,

948
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,600
you quit the police, right?

949
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,120
You can't take any more.

950
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,240
I'll take the rest.

951
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:57,520
Thank you for the monitor.

952
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,040
I'll put the gala in the course.

953
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,900
Okay,

954
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,700
everyone, go home.

955
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,660
Yes, sir!

956
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,820
Wait a minute!

957
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,440
That's a joke!

958
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,140
It's too cold!

959
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,120
Please!

960
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,680
Chief,

961
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
that's the fire in Paris!

962
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,580
What?

963
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,000
Hiromi is in a coma?

964
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,160
Yes.

965
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,960
She came to the hospital suddenly last night.

966
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,640
What about the European trip, chief?

967
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,560
Well,

968
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,860
I was going to go with my wife,

969
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,800
but my wife said that it's not a good time to go on a trip at this time.

970
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,540
Well,

971
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,460
your wife must have been really looking forward to it,

972
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:39,820
right?

973
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,060
That's too bad.

974
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,100
Oh,

975
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,080
the wedding...

976
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,160
Thank you.

977
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:44,960
It was a souvenir.

978
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,400
I was going to cancel it,

979
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,560
but the cancellation fee...

980
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,340
It's expensive just before the wedding.

981
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:52,860
Yes.

982
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,420
My wife said that it's a good opportunity,

983
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,400
so I'm going to cancel it.

984
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,240
Well,

985
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,200
this time I'm thinking of going alone,

986
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,480
but...

987
00:40:59,480 --> 00:40:59,980
Why don't you invite someone?

988
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,620
Then,

989
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,020
I can go with you.

990
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,160
I haven't decided on a vacation yet.

991
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,800
Don't be stupid!

992
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,940
I can't go on an overseas trip with a single woman.

993
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,120
I can trust you,

994
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,160
so I'm a little disappointed.

995
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:17,980
How about you?

996
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:18,820
Huh?

997
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,800
You grew up in New York,

998
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,800
and you speak English well,

999
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,160
so you must be used to going abroad.

1000
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,170
Excuse me.

1001
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,820
I'm skiing in Switzerland with my sister on vacation.

1002
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,640
I'm going back to Paris,

1003
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,080
so I can go with her for about a day.

1004
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,760
Oh,

1005
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,300
then,

1006
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,220
the rest is...

1007
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,520
The temple.

1008
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,560
Oh,

1009
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,220
you can't go to the temple.

1010
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,880
You said you don't have a passport.

1011
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,040
Even if I apply now,

1012
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,900
it will take a week,

1013
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,720
so I can't make it by the time I leave.

1014
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,280
If you can't go to the temple,

1015
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,080
then...

1016
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,580
Oh,

1017
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:50,560
I'm sorry.

1018
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,720
I'm sorry.

1019
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,080
I'm sorry.

1020
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,700
I have to go alone now.

1021
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,560
Director…

1022
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,040
What's wrong?

1023
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,500
Give me some time,

1024
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,020
I need to think about something.

1025
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,880
Director,

1026
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,500
why don't you invite me?

1027
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,460
Don't be silly,

1028
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,780
it's not worth it to pay for the trip

1029
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,980
I'm going away with you without canceled money.

1030
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,360
But I really have a brain,

1031
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,040
so carrying my luggage will help.

1032
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,000
But you don't have to feed me this.

1033
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,960
He's three times more likely to die than me.

1034
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,620
He's no good.

1035
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,040
Listen up!

1036
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,940
You have to call me in ten minutes.

1037
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,800
Here, this is your phone card.

1038
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,340
Okay!

1039
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,000
I'll be on the phone, so you don't have to say anything.

1040
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,500
This is just my opinion. Take it.

1041
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,680
100 yen?

1042
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,920
Then I'll leave it to you.

1043
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,020
He's been in Italy and France for 10 days.

1044
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,140
It's going to be a hard trip.

1045
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,680
That's right.

1046
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,740
If you polish your bicycle, it will rain.

1047
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,740
Hey, Senpai.

1048
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,580
Something fell.

1049
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,620
What?

1050
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,060
This is my passport.

1051
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,900
I accidentally dropped it.

1052
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,440
Right?

1053
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,440
Ryo, you had a passport.

1054
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,160
Yes. A few years ago, I went to Hong Kong for a trip to the shopping district.

1055
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,040
I ended up not going there and ended up paying for it.

1056
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,260
Hahaha.

1057
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:15,840
Hahaha.

1058
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,080
What is this?

1059
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,360
I was surprised when I opened it.

1060
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,560
It's been a year since I had a passport.

1061
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,300
I guess I can go on a trip abroad anytime.

1062
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,380
I see.

1063
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,540
Whoa!

1064
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,160
Ryo went to get his passport, too.

1065
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,940
He's not fit for his face, and he's a very refined person.

1066
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,540
Oh!

1067
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,020
What is this?

1068
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,600
This is bad!

1069
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:45,000
A man, a traveler, and a foreign traveler who is robbed of his money!

1070
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,740
A Japanese tourist is killed while traveling abroad!

1071
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,300
This is terrible!

1072
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,520
The Japanese who were hurt by this were both on their first trip abroad!

1073
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,500
When did this newspaper come out?

1074
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,940
And there's a red mark on the article.

1075
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,480
I guess I have to bring someone who's strong.

1076
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,300
I'm fine.

1077
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,680
Judo and kendo are three layers.

1078
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,160
No matter how much Jukendo is in his mind,

1079
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,800
if he gets hit with a sword,

1080
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,500
it's a hell of a fight!

1081
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,880
He's got a gun from such a small baby to a dog and a monkey!

1082
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,180
No, no.

1083
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:25,540
No, no.

1084
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,820
Well, I'm glad I went on a trip abroad.

1085
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,800
I'm relieved to have a flight attendant.

1086
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,680
Oh, by the way,

1087
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,040
I heard that one of the people who participated in the trip abroad

1088
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,540
was found dead a month after the meeting.

1089
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,140
I was on board today, and I was very happy.

1090
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,880
Nakagawa, you must have been very happy.

1091
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,660
No, I wasn't on board.

1092
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,720
I was on board!

1093
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,680
I knew it!

1094
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,580
By the way,

1095
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,980
you said you were going on a trip abroad, didn't you?

1096
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,340
I didn't know that.

1097
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,200
What are you talking about now?

1098
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,960
Of course, French is fluent, isn't it?

1099
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,500
No, I don't understand much.

1100
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,240
How about Italian?

1101
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,380
It's not good at all.

1102
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,680
Oh, I'm surprised.

1103
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,540
He's a man who doesn't fear God.

1104
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,700
How are you going to talk to him?

1105
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,580
Italians are a group of people with a lot of blood.

1106
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,880
How will you meet with a little misunderstanding?

1107
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

1108
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,380
Oh, yes, yes.

1109
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,320
Hey, here is Katsushika Kamihari, Kouenbai.

1110
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,020
What's your phone number?

1111
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,040
Oh, good evening.

1112
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,720
Oh, my spaghetti, Michelangelo.

1113
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,020
Oh, yes, Lamborghini Countach,

1114
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,880
Sofia Roller, Ratatat.

1115
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,620
You do it well too.

1116
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,260
He's using Italian that he knows.

1117
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,680
He's mixing up things he doesn't know.

1118
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,680
Good evening, Adios Condios.

1119
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,900
It was from my Italian friend,

1120
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,100
Galileo Gonzales.

1121
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,860
You're tired, Gonzales.

1122
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,440
Does an Italian have a friend?

1123
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,020
In Osaka,

1124
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,140
he's a fourth generation Italian born in Osaka.

1125
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,740
That's a lie.

1126
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,580
I'm not saying it myself,

1127
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,460
but I'm a man who relies on overseas travel.

1128
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,900
I'm...

1129
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,400
I'm not saying it myself,

1130
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,480
but I'm a man who relies on overseas travel.

1131
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,880
I'm...

1132
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,660
Moto Guzzi, Roberto...

1133
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,260
Oh, no, no.

1134
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:41,840
I'm getting a habit.

1135
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,440
Da Vinci, Pacquignola.

1136
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,780
Wait, wait, wait.

1137
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,380
I'm gonna read it again without speaking.

1138
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,240
But...

1139
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,760
Is it better to take four people?

1140
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,800
Well, I think the vocabulary is pretty suspicious.

1141
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:55,580
I think the vocabulary is pretty suspicious.

1142
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,020
I think the vocabulary is pretty suspicious.

1143
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,500
But Senpai has something more difficult to draw.

1144
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,580
But Senpai has something more difficult to draw.

1145
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,220
For example, whether it's a foreigner or an alien,

1146
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,100
No matter what you encounter,

1147
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,180
It's a heart that doesn't scare you.

1148
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,920
I can say that.

1149
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,360
Even if I'm attacked by a wild animal with a sword,

1150
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,140
I can't stop it.

1151
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:11,520
Even if I'm attacked by a wild animal with a sword,

1152
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,700
Senpai has been through many hardships.

1153
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,340
I can see it now!

1154
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,540
If your opponent is up to five people, you'll be fine.

1155
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,180
if your opponent is up to five people, you'll be fine.

1156
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,240
This is when he's on a French trip.

1157
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:18,560
But...

1158
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,420
If you have bodyguards and a luggage stand with you,

1159
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,780
It would be more advantageous than a travel fee.

1160
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,540
Do fools and scissors work?

1161
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,720
That's exactly right.

1162
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,340
Ah, Ryozzo.

1163
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,000
Do you want to travel to Europe?

1164
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:37,740
Me?

1165
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,120
Yes!

1166
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,660
It's a little urgent.

1167
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,340
Ah!

1168
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,700
It's 10 days from next week.

1169
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,520
Please wait a moment.

1170
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:45,700
Huh?

1171
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,420
I'm busy, too.

1172
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,320
I must see the schedule.

1173
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,760
Well, what's the schedule for next week?

1174
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,300
Ouch!

1175
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,100
I'm in trouble.

1176
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,020
I have to play golf with the director,

1177
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,080
and there are various meetings.

1178
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,240
But it's for the director, not anyone else.

1179
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:01,820
Enough!

1180
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,580
I'll go by myself!

1181
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,560
It's okay, director!

1182
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,240
I can go!

1183
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,840
I can go!

1184
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,220
That's right.

1185
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,460
I have a leave of absence,

1186
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,100
and I'm going to use it next week.

1187
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,220
Don't lie!

1188
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,120
I've used it long ago.

1189
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,060
I'm so happy to be able to take you on a trip to Europe.

1190
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,820
I can't believe you're so generous.

1191
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:25,420
Huh?

1192
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,680
Ouch!

1193
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,000
Ouch!

1194
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,260
Ouch!

1195
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:33,800
Ouch!

1196
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,700
Ouch!

1197
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,120
You're late.

1198
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,200
What are you doing?

1199
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,760
I'm checking my passport.

1200
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:38,880
You forgot your passport,

1201
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,700
so you're going back to get it.

1202
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,340
No, I'm taking care of my passport and my flight ticket.

1203
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,440
I have to wait two hours from here to Narita.

1204
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,600
I'll call Ryo again.

1205
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,320
Oh!

1206
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,140
Hey!

1207
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,660
Today's pachinko is a big success!

1208
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:58,620
Look!

1209
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,800
It's amazing, isn't it?

1210
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,560
Senior!

1211
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,820
Good job!

1212
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:04,920
Huh?

1213
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,120
Director, what's wrong with your outfit?

1214
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,920
Are you going on a trip somewhere?

1215
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:11,800
Yeah.

1216
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,060
I'm going.

1217
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:13,760
Huh?

1218
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,160
Maybe today!?

1219
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,080
Yeah,

1220
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,160
that "maybe" is what I was talking about.

1221
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,380
Huh?

1222
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,520
Huh?

1223
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,000
Huh?

1224
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,440
I'll be back right now!

1225
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,260
I won't make it in time!

1226
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,660
Right now!

1227
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:35,780
I'm going home!

1228
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:36,520
Come on!

1229
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,880
But, you have to wear your underwear!

1230
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,620
I don't have time for that!

1231
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,120
Taxi!

1232
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,640
Chief, wait a minute!

1233
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,820
I'm still in uniform!

1234
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,540
I don't care!

1235
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,080
I'm in a hurry!

1236
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:48,700
Driver!

1237
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,140
I don't need a toothbrush!

1238
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,820
That's a big one in Italy!

1239
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,400
I'm not used to using it!

1240
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,420
Don't be so nosy!

1241
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,240
You're just a bonus!

1242
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,580
Chief!

1243
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,840
No way!

1244
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,440
Driver!

1245
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,640
I'm in a hurry!

1246
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,300
I'm in a hurry!

1247
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,600
Chief, you're mean!

1248
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,360
I don't have the right to change!

1249
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,080
Shut up!

1250
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,100
You forgot about the travel law,

1251
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,400
and now you're talking about the right to change!

1252
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,380
No, I mean, as a human!

1253
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,960
Were you a human?

1254
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,540
He said he was still before he left.

1255
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,080
He's already making up his mind about the travel law.

1256
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,000
Chief!

1257
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,240
I'm sorry!

1258
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,340
Please let me get off at the next stop!

1259
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,320
I forgot my pillow!

1260
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,340
I have a lot of pillows in Italy!

1261
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,260
Well, if you have a pillow,

1262
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,340
I can't sleep!

1263
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:33,740
I can't sleep!

1264
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,540
That's terrible!

1265
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,340
Shut up!

1266
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,480
Excuse me.

1267
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,180
Please be quiet, sir.

1268
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,800
The other passengers are...

1269
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,360
Oh, Rome!

1270
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:46,680
Rome!

1271
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,640
Rome!

1272
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:50,600
Rome!

1273
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,400
Chief!

1274
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,160
Chief!

1275
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:53,500
Please look!

1276
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,200
Chief!

1277
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,340
Chief!

1278
00:50:59,560 --> 00:50:59,820
It's Rome!

1279
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,020
Chief!

1280
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:02,740
Oh, ok.

1281
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,180
Here we go.

1282
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:03,880
Everyone,

1283
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,460
Europe's journey is a battle of time.

1284
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,280
"Time is money."

1285
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,020
"Take 1 minute and 1 second seriously."

1286
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,200
Use it, please.

1287
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,920
Did you hear it, chief?

1288
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,320
"Time is money."

1289
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,720
"Take 1 minute and 1 second seriously."

1290
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,160
Even if it's 1 minute and 1 second,

1291
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,460
let me sleep.

1292
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,060
This is it for the elderly.

1293
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,940
Who do you think I've become sleepy for?

1294
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,280
I'm thinking that I've become a robot.

1295
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,840
For whom?

1296
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:29,820
For you!

1297
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:31,400
What?

1298
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,400
I've been sleeping all the time while I was on the plane.

1299
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:39,420
Your snoring and snoring made me unable to sleep.

1300
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,000
This is what a beginner of overseas travel is.

1301
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,860
You're a beginner, too.

1302
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1303
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,200
I was doing self-portrait in the plane.

1304
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,240
What?

1305
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:58,020
I asked the Honda crew to do mahjong in the night.

1306
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,600
I slept in the plane without sleeping for the whole night.

1307
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,420
This is the correct way to avoid snoring and snoring.

1308
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,960
You forgot the departure date.

1309
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,460
You were just playing mahjong.

1310
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,860
Help me!

1311
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,160
Hello? Hello?

1312
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,160
The customer behind me.

1313
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,180
Please be kind to the other customers.

1314
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,840
What about this?

1315
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,540
Excuse me, everyone.

1316
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,160
Please be polite as a human being.

1317
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,640
You have to apologize, too.

1318
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,200
Why do I have to apologize?

1319
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,260
You're the cause of everything.

1320
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,620
It seems like you've done it again.

1321
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,320
I guess so.

1322
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,440
This is Trevi's well.

1323
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,060
Yes.

1324
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,980
If you throw the coin backward in this well,

1325
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,280
you'll be sent back to Rome.

1326
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,060
That's what they say.

1327
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,500
The movie is "Roma's Holiday," and...

1328
00:52:59,500 --> 00:52:59,580
Oh!

1329
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,100
Hey!

1330
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:01,980
Stop picking up the coin!

1331
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,440
It's a good idea!

1332
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,680
It's a good idea!

1333
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:05,800
Ouch!

1334
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,920
You're just a bonus, but don't show off your Japanese pride.

1335
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,220
You're just a bonus, but don't show off your Japanese pride.

1336
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:10,580
I'm not going to hit you.

1337
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,860
Do you remember the captain's name?

1338
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,900
"The Truth's Mouth"

1339
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,960
Captain, Captain.

1340
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,600
This is the truth's mouth.

1341
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:21,660
Oh.

1342
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,280
This is the truth's mouth.

1343
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,620
If you put your hand in the mouth when you lie,

1344
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,360
you're told to bite off.

1345
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,820
I have absolutely no problem with that.

1346
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,060
Sorry!

1347
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,480
I dropped the coin!

1348
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:36,760
I dropped the coin!

1349
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:36,840
I dropped the coin!

1350
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,520
I've put the coins in my brother's snack.

1351
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,380
Look at his face.

1352
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,060
Ryotsu!

1353
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,500
You bastard!

1354
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,900
Come on, laugh!

1355
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,160
You bastard! Don't waste the film!

1356
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:56,940
It's hot!

1357
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,580
Ah, ah, I used three films just for the stupid picture of the chief.

1358
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,720
Three? It's my camera!

1359
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,920
Don't say such a disgusting thing.

1360
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,140
Didn't you say you'd take a lot of pictures when you arrived in Rome?

1361
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,380
I said take a proper picture.

1362
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,000
I haven't taken any commemorative pictures yet.

1363
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,460
It's boring to take pictures like that.

1364
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,160
Rather, let's take some of these as a souvenir.

1365
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,120
You're telling me not to be so rude anymore, right?

1366
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,700
Rather, I don't know what this is, but take a picture of the statue.

1367
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,120
This is what it is, Japanese people.

1368
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,940
Huh? What's wrong?

1369
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,640
It seems that you're taking pictures of two people.

1370
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,000
Oh, is that so?

1371
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,840
Hey, pause!

1372
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,820
Italians are also quite kind, aren't they?

1373
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:46,980
Yes.

1374
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,780
Hey, okay! Cheese, pizza, spaghetti.

1375
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,520
Don't be so rude!

1376
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,180
It's fine, isn't it? You're the one who should pose for the picture.

1377
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,920
Hey, aren't we going far away?

1378
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,400
So that we can put in all the food, right?

1379
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,380
But we don't have to go that far away, do we?

1380
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,660
Are you choosing the pose?

1381
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:11,980
Everyone, there are many refugees around here, so please be careful of your belongings.

1382
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,660
Please keep your luggage in a safe place like this.

1383
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,420
I see. I'm relieved if you do this.

1384
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,840
You have to be careful of your clothes and your belongings.

1385
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:21,680
Huh?

1386
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,020
Yeah.

1387
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:24,880
Goodbye.

1388
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,200
Gah!

1389
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,080
My belongings!

1390
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,840
You bastard!

1391
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,780
You can travel without a camera!

1392
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,520
If you don't change your clothes, you'll be fired!

1393
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,060
Damn it! Wait!

1394
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,840
I won't let you get away!

1395
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,400
You're going to underestimate the Japanese police!

1396
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,640
Hey!

1397
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:42,900
Hey!

1398
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,060
Hey!

1399
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:43,540
Hey!

1400
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,380
Hey!

1401
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,160
Hey!

1402
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,560
Move! Move!

1403
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,580
Damn it!

1404
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,380
Did that bastard run away?

1405
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,360
But it was only a bit.

1406
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,800
Is the camera okay?

1407
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,180
Can we travel with this?

1408
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,320
Ah!

1409
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,920
It's been more than 10 minutes now.

1410
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,080
Everyone!

1411
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:01,940
Keep running!

1412
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,920
We won't be able to see Colosseum anymore!

1413
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,080
Are we running again?

1414
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,160
What a fussy trip!

1415
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,440
You can do whatever you want until dinner.

1416
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:21,800
I'm in room 412, so if you have any questions, please come and ask.

1417
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,380
For now, we'll be leaving.

1418
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,840
Good grief, I'm tired as expected.

1419
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:35,920
Well, you have an hour and a half to eat, so why don't you visit the hotel?

1420
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,460
Hey, hey, you just got here, let me take a bath.

1421
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,600
I'm not here to get tired of the hot springs.

1422
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,020
Anyway, I'm going to take a bath.

1423
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,020
I don't want to come here with an old man.

1424
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,120
He's so impulsive.

1425
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,940
Hey, hey!

1426
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,460
What is it?

1427
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:56,900
Come here, I'm fine.

1428
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,540
Okay.

1429
00:56:58,860 --> 00:56:59,460
What is it?

1430
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,960
Is this the bath? It's pretty small.

1431
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,760
It's not like the Japanese hinoki bath.

1432
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,580
This is a foreign country.

1433
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,240
You go in like this, like a corpse with a formalin.

1434
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,740
I don't like baths.

1435
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:14,640
It's not like the Japanese hinoki bath. It's a foreign country. You go in like this, like a corpse with a formalin.

1436
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,520
Then, what is this?

1437
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:16,260
Huh?

1438
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,400
I know it's a bathroom, but what is this lidless toilet?

1439
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,280
I don't like it. You don't know this, chief?

1440
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:24,440
Ouch!

1441
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,940
It's a fountain. Italians like fountains.

1442
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,220
You're lying.

1443
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,020
But I don't like the bath and the bathroom being the same.

1444
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,520
Don't say that. Please go in.

1445
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,800
What? The heating is too good.

1446
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,420
This is the cheap hotel for backpacking.

1447
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,100
It's hot. It's hot.

1448
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,860
This is too bad. After you, I'll piss too.

1449
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,000
What?

1450
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,360
Do you have any more thieves?

1451
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,140
That's GG.

1452
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,040
Oh no! It's a hot disappearing. Please open the door!

1453
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:00,700
Chief!

1454
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,940
What is this? Are you okay?

1455
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,160
What?

1456
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,640
Religion, why are you down here alone?

1457
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,040
I got caught by you!

1458
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:10,800
Stop it!

1459
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,320
What?!

1460
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,100
I can't open it!

1461
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:15,880
It's automatic lock!

1462
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,120
You can't come out to the head office!

1463
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,360
You don't have a key?

1464
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,900
How can you have a key in this form?

1465
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,340
You're so bad, Ryotsu.

1466
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:24,960
I'll call the captain.

1467
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,600
What room was it?

1468
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,360
It was room 421.

1469
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,560
I see. It's room 421.

1470
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:31,880
Room 421.

1471
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,480
Captain, please come out!

1472
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,380
Emergency!

1473
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:36,460
Emergency!

1474
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,040
You're wrong!

1475
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:42,940
You saw the ball!

1476
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:45,660
Alright.

1477
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,580
You can borrow the key at the front.

1478
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:48,760
I'm a coward!

1479
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,980
At least lend me the captain's towel.

1480
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,700
Then mine will be gone.

1481
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:53,920
This is no time to be embarrassed.

1482
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,200
It's the captain's order. Go now!

1483
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,420
Oh, come on!

1484
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,460
I'm so embarrassed!

1485
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:06,600
Hurry up!

1486
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,520
Give me the key!

1487
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,560
Hurry up and get the key to room 401!

1488
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,160
This is a real trouble.

1489
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,700
He's running around the hotel naked.

1490
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,000
This is a foreign country.

1491
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,520
Do you think he's running around because he likes it?

1492
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,360
This is called the rhythm of things.

1493
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:25,960
What?

1494
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,220
What?

1495
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,040
What's wrong?

1496
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:28,940
You're making a big fuss.

1497
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,180
It seems like he met someone upstairs.

1498
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,260
Huh?

1499
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,740
The bath water.

1500
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:35,280
What?

1501
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,140
I spilled it!

1502
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,260
What?

1503
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:38,920
Come on, Ryozu!

1504
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,420
I'm worried about the luggage.

1505
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:43,740
Hurry up and give it to me.

1506
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,600
Hurry up, Ryozu!

1507
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,360
I'm doing it right now!

1508
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,620
What a customer.

1509
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,660
I've been a tour conductor for 20 years.

1510
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,820
This is the first time I've had such a customer!

1511
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,640
You aren't carrying inside, are you?

1512
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,080
The head of the company can't go to hotel.

1513
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,760
I'm sorry, I keep making a fuss!

1514
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,860
The head of the company is sorry!

1515
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:12,900
You are!

1516
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:13,980
The head of the company!

1517
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:14,440
You!

1518
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,400
The head!

1519
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:15,800
The head of the company!

1520
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:20,180
After lunch, we take a bus to Monmartel Hill.

1521
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,600
Sacré-Cœur Prairie.

1522
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,140
P91 Square Universe Museum.

1523
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:23,860
Louisville Museum.

1524
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,620
Concord Square Museum.

1525
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,720
磋 Show Spa Museum.

1526
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:27,260
Huh.

1527
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,760
At three, we will go to the duty-free store.

1528
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,180
After that, Madrane Genie.

1529
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:31,900
Opera House.

1530
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,280
Luxembourg Park.

1531
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,500
The Rodin Museum.

1532
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,760
Hey, hey, are you going to go around in one day?

1533
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,900
I told you that Europe is a battle against time.

1534
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,860
Everyone, please eat plenty and keep your stamina.

1535
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,220
That seems really good.

1536
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,960
I was lost alone in Montmartre.

1537
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,460
I spent more than 20 minutes of my precious time.

1538
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,760
For that reason, I will visit this Louvre Museum in 10 minutes.

1539
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,700
Please forgive me.

1540
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,200
10 minutes?

1541
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,280
It will take 4 days to visit the guide for a normal tour.

1542
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,820
Europe trip is a battle against time.

1543
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,240
I have an octopus in my ear.

1544
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,300
If you understand, please be careful and follow me.

1545
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,240
Then, everyone.

1546
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,320
Let's go!

1547
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,340
That's the Venus in the museum, right?

1548
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,660
It's the Mona Lisa. That's the Mona Lisa for sure.

1549
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,300
Don't look at the Mona Lisa.

1550
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,120
Don't look at it for more than 5 seconds.

1551
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,880
This is an obstacle competition.

1552
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:32,900
It's a cotton candy store.

1553
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,100
It's a Madelaine jean.

1554
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,680
It's a 3 minute long park.

1555
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,940
It's not good.

1556
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:37,820
I'm losing 3 minutes.

1557
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,180
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1558
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,560
I'm dying.

1559
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,440
I can't stand it anymore.

1560
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:44,520
It's an opera.

1561
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,700
It's a Rodin Museum.

1562
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,020
Everyone, thank you for your hard work.

1563
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,240
The schedule is too packed.

1564
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,360
I don't remember what I saw.

1565
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,420
I don't remember what I saw.

1566
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:04,460
If you don't remember, buy a postcard and take a look.

1567
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,220
Tomorrow, I'm going to visit the Palace of Versailles at 4 am.

1568
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,540
I'll go to Japan at 9 o'clock.

1569
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:12,560
I'll be back in a day.

1570
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,760
Please be careful.

1571
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,280
My room is in room 909.

1572
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,040
Thank you.

1573
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,000
You're a professional.

1574
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:28,100
Let's go to the room, director.

1575
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,200
Senior.

1576
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,160
What?

1577
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,680
Nakagawa.

1578
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,480
Director.

1579
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,200
Ryo.

1580
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,160
Reiko, too?

1581
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:35,760
She's here.

1582
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,740
She seems to be very tired.

1583
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,160
What happened?

1584
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,500
Was it such a hard schedule?

1585
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,300
I don't remember what I saw in Paris.

1586
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,840
I hate it.

1587
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,100
Reiko, if you have time for dinner,

1588
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:51,600
Why don't you go shopping?

1589
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:53,560
Yes.

1590
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:54,920
I'm thinking of buying a souvenir for my wife and daughter.

1591
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,320
I'll be happy to go with you.

1592
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,080
I'm going to come back tomorrow.

1593
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,360
I didn't have to deliver the trunk on purpose.

1594
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,000
I thought you'd use it to put in the souvenir.

1595
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,620
I forgot my wallet and I have nothing.

1596
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,180
A souvenir.

1597
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,700
I've had a lot of trouble, but I'm grateful to you.

1598
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,840
This is my allowance.

1599
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:17,620
Take it.

1600
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,200
Director.

1601
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,320
Buy your parents a souvenir.

1602
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:23,740
Thank you.

1603
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:25,600
Director.

1604
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,760
I'm so happy to have you.

1605
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,700
I'm so happy.

1606
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,360
I'm so happy to have a good boss.

1607
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:39,500
I'm so happy.

1608
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:39,880
I'm so happy.

1609
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:39,900
I'm so happy.

1610
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:40,520
30,000 yen?

1611
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,320
That's a lot.

1612
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,280
But if you come abroad like this,

1613
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,000
I think Japan is the best.

1614
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,680
I think so, too, if you're as old as the director.

1615
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:54,180
The bath, the toilet, and the fountain-shaped face wash are the same.

1616
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:58,300
The bath, the toilet, and the fountain-shaped face wash are the same.

1617
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,060
The fountain-shaped face wash?

1618
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:00,980
It's like a good toilet.

1619
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:02,700
What?

1620
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,600
Maybe it's...

1621
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,180
It's like a good toilet.

1622
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,300
I see.

1623
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:08,840
He's in good shape.

1624
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,260
And he's a wind dragon.

1625
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:10,900
And he's a wind dragon.

1626
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,940
Oh, yes.

1627
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,340
Let's go buy some souvenirs.

1628
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:14,900
Let's go buy some souvenirs.

1629
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,380
Hey, senpai.

1630
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:15,980
Hey, Ryo.

1631
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:16,200
Ryo.

1632
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,440
Wait a minute.

1633
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:19,780
Oh, my.

1634
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,600
I'm going to pay a lot.

1635
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:22,880
Well, well.

1636
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,160
We're going to buy something, too.

1637
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,180
Let's go buy some souvenirs, director.

1638
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,480
When I hear you bought 30,000 yen worth of H-bons,

1639
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,100
the director is going to be angry.

1640
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,560
The boss and team like Ryo like these.

1641
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,000
But they're picked up when you pass through.

1642
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:43,220
But they're picked up when you pass through.

1643
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,240
Hide them in your pants and get through.

1644
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,160
I can't use a lot of H-bons like that.

1645
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,260
I can't use a lot of H-bons like that.

1646
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:50,620
I'm back.

1647
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,080
Oh, welcome back.

1648
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,200
Ryo, what did you buy?

1649
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:59,820
I bought felt-tip and a special monaka for everyone.

1650
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,040
You sell things like that?

1651
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,620
Tourist souvenirs are common in the world.

1652
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,760
Please leave the big stuff here.

1653
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,840
The only things you can bring inside are your hand luggage.

1654
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,100
You're pretty cautious.

1655
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,560
Did something happen?

1656
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,060
I'll go and ask.

1657
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,840
Rodin made the people who think.

1658
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,060
The problem is how to trick the tax officials.

1659
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:33,420
Oh, no!

1660
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,520
It seems that there's a warning that the airport will be blown up at 10:00 just.

1661
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:38,960
What?

1662
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,580
10:00 just?

1663
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,900
It's only two hours away.

1664
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:42,880
It's just after our departure.

1665
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:45,940
But this seems to be affecting.

1666
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:47,740
You're right.

1667
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,420
Let's go.

1668
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,240
I've got everything I need.

1669
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:52,780
The souvenirs are also full.

1670
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:54,540
Farewell, Paris.

1671
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,660
What? Are you still lined up?

1672
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,780
Reiko, please take care of me.

1673
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:05,720
Oh.

1674
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,040
Ryo, where are you going?

1675
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,380
I'll go and have some tea.

1676
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,280
Ryo, can I leave the trunk?

1677
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:12,840
What?

1678
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,240
No, it's not good if the wake and monaka are crushed.

1679
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:16,940
I'll take it inside the plane.

1680
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:20,140
It seems that the wake and monaka are very heavy.

1681
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:21,420
That's not true.

1682
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,220
This is just like this.

1683
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:23,720
It's light.

1684
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,920
Ryo, please wake the effel and monaka.

1685
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,020
What?

1686
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,420
No, I want to see it.

1687
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:36,840
No, it's boring.

1688
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,500
No, I think it's rare enough.

1689
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,220
No.

1690
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,620
Why? Show me.

1691
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:42,600
No, it's not.

1692
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:43,240
It's a rubber band.

1693
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:43,640
No.

1694
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,140
I guess I put it in the middle of something.

1695
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,240
It won't get away unless I climb the wall, right?

1696
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,020
Wait a minute.

1697
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:53,900
It's the same thing.

1698
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:57,340
It seems they don't like this set-up.

1699
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:58,580
I think so, too.

1700
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:02,240
What can I do?

1701
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:16,920
I'll go and find it.

1702
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:26,460
Huh?!

1703
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,320
I think it is different.

1704
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,080
That trunk belongs to your party major.

1705
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,200
-What? -What?

1706
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,400
I'm sure. I've checked girls yesterday.

1707
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,180
However...

1708
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,580
I'm sure that Ryo-kun did have a trunk.

1709
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:42,460
W-Wait!

1710
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,840
It has the same colors and shape.

1711
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,280
They must have covered it with something special.

1712
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,380
Then, the trunks Ryo-chan was carrying...

1713
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,820
...were full of dimensional bombs!

1714
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,860
I told you!

1715
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,680
There's no Kobucha!

1716
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,000
Kobucha?

1717
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,420
You're not doing a coffee shop...

1718
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:56,920
...without Kobucha!

1719
01:07:59,060 --> 01:07:59,620
Huh?

1720
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:00,740
Ryo-chan!

1721
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:01,560
Give me that trunk!

1722
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,400
What?

1723
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:05,340
You made a mess of it!

1724
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,680
I'm not giving you this!

1725
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:08,640
No!

1726
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,020
It's not what it looks like, senpai!

1727
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:11,960
Oh, my!

1728
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,480
Wow!

1729
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:12,500
Wow!

1730
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,020
What the heck is this?

1731
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,080
Damn it!

1732
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,380
Ryo-kun, get me a padlock!

1733
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:19,720
Yes!

1734
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:22,820
Damn it!

1735
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:25,440
Why does it have to end up in a padlock?

1736
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:27,520
Huh?

1737
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,200
I can't do this!

1738
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:34,680
This is bad!

1739
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,480
Senpai got on a bicycle!

1740
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:37,720
It's okay!

1741
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:39,560
Bicycles are easy to catch!

1742
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,640
He's not trying to be a man!

1743
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:46,500
What do you think?

1744
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,200
If you couldn't have killed him then...

1745
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,300
...you wouldn't have been able to catch him, right?

1746
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:49,520
How much longer until we get the explosion?

1747
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,020
About an hour and a half.

1748
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,400
Oh no!

1749
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:54,860
Ouch!

1750
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:00,860
Aargh!

1751
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:01,940
Ouch!

1752
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:02,080
Ouch!

1753
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:02,500
Ouch!

1754
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:03,360
Ouch!

1755
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:03,760
Ouch!

1756
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:03,940
Ouch!

1757
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:04,000
Ouch!

1758
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:06,120
Ouch!

1759
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:06,400
Ouch!

1760
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,260
Patz! Pass that trunk over here!

1761
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,460
A lot of lotteries!

1762
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,520
Yes! Ryotsu doesn't have to look at you!

1763
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,020
The brake!

1764
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,860
I'll leave you to it!

1765
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:26,940
What the hell...

1766
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,760
Did you even lose an hour before it exploded?

1767
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:29,680
긱ly?

1768
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,100
Try to evacuate the citizens of Ryotsu!

1769
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:32,420
That idiot...

1770
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:33,420
I don't know what he'll do!

1771
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,300
Yes sir!

1772
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,520
With this, we should let Zibatsu Nakagawa's

1773
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,580
Paris Chong-Zang Embassy work.

1774
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:47,220
All the helicopters, get on the bicycle and chase the man who looks like a gorilla wearing the uniform of a Japanese officer!

1775
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,180
You're really here!

1776
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:57,860
The gorilla is climbing the hill on a bicycle!

1777
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,340
Is he King Kong?

1778
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,100
The gorilla is heading to the observatory on the second floor, on the bicycle!

1779
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:03,280
He's going to the observatory!

1780
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,720
Senior, can you hear me?

1781
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,760
Hey, don't come near me, traitor!

1782
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,540
That's not true!

1783
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,440
The trunk that you have is not yours!

1784
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,360
The trunk that you have is a bomb-like thing!

1785
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,820
There's a dimensional bomb inside!

1786
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,560
Throw it away in a safe place!

1787
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,880
You can't get caught up in a story like that!

1788
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,080
The airport is closed!

1789
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:33,220
I've changed the toilet!

1790
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,460
I'll put my ears on the trunk and hear the sound of the dimensional device!

1791
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,780
The dimensional device?

1792
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,580
Huh? I can hear the sound of the clock!

1793
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,940
This is the sound of the clock that I've been looking for!

1794
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:49,440
Don't be fooled!

1795
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,480
No matter what anyone says, I'll protect the H-bomb for the Honda!

1796
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,780
If it's Ryo-chan's bomb, it's here!

1797
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:57,720
What?

1798
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,440
What?

1799
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:03,180
Is there something else?

1800
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,440
Don't be fooled!

1801
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,100
Don't be fooled!

1802
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:08,860
Don't be fooled!

1803
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,800
I finally figured it out!

1804
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:12,520
Idiot!

1805
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,320
Ryo-chan!

1806
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,560
How many seconds is the timer of the dimensional device?

1807
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,880
10 seconds left!

1808
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,940
We can't make it!

1809
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,160
Nakagawa, get out of my way!

1810
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:23,680
Yes, sir!

1811
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,380
Don't leave me!

1812
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,080
Don't leave me!

1813
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:28,840
Don't leave me!

1814
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:29,860
Don't leave me!

1815
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:30,300
Don't leave me!

1816
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,140
Don't leave me!

1817
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,220
You're on fire!

1818
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:42,540
I'll do it!

1819
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,380
That's enough!

1820
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:49,420
What, Mikoto?

1821
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,740
Don't leave me...

1822
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,740
Stop!

1823
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:54,080
Stop it!

1824
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:54,320
The inside...

1825
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:54,880
Ryo-chan!

1826
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:55,780
Stop!

1827
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:57,340
He's still running!

1828
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,720
He's alive!

1829
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:16,920
What a bad luck guy!

1830
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:17,480
He's a very strong guy!

1831
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,960
We're glad we made it to Japan safely.

1832
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,140
Really? I was wondering what would happen next.

1833
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,020
We're glad you didn't have to go to prison.

1834
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,000
We stopped the bombing of the airport.

1835
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:39,040
Don't forget about him!

1836
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,620
I would have been happy if you had entered the prison in France for the rest of your life!

1837
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:49,780
I'm glad you didn't have to go to prison.

1838
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,200
You're going to be in a place like this!

1839
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,940
Hey, it seems like he just became a human.

1840
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:55,960
It can't be a gorilla, right?

1841
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:57,140
You bastard!

1842
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:58,900
I'm not going on a trip with a gorilla anymore!

1843
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,820
A Big Clash! God vs. Ryo

1844
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:11,900
Senpai!

1845
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Senpai!

1846
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:17,480
Please wake up!

1847
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,380
I'm going to be late!

1848
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,720
Shut up!

1849
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,120
You're going to wake up soon, aren't you?

1850
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:39,660
What's with him?

1851
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:41,960
It's noisy.

1852
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,200
But he slept well.

1853
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:48,900
What's this? A chicken?

1854
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,680
Isn't this a chicken?!

1855
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,120
Shibata-san!

1856
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:58,280
Shibata-san!

1857
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:58,400
What?!

1858
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,080
This is it!

1859
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:02,300
It's me!

1860
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:06,040
Please, don't leave me!

1861
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,320
Please!

1862
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:07,840
I'm not a chicken!

1863
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:08,660
It's me!

1864
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,560
Please, don't leave me!

1865
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,440
It's a chicken!

1866
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:17,280
It's a chicken!

1867
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:17,520
How much is a gram?

1868
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,080
It's a snack for dinner.

1869
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,120
It's a chicken!

1870
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,940
It's not a fake chicken!

1871
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,380
It's not a fake chicken!

1872
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,620
I can't just sit here.

1873
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,060
I'm going to work for now.

1874
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:31,340
I'm going to work for now.

1875
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:36,460
Hello! Good morning!

1876
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:37,880
Ryo!

1877
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,540
What time do you think it is?

1878
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:44,060
You don't have the sense of being a real human being.

1879
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,420
You don't have the sense of being a real human being.

1880
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:45,720
Chief!

1881
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,160
It's a chicken!

1882
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:50,220
Ouch!

1883
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,580
What's wrong, Ryo?

1884
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:57,940
Did you eat something bad?

1885
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,120
I thought I was a human being,

1886
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,760
but I can't believe I'm really a human being.

1887
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,560
I can't believe I'm really a human being.

1888
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,020
Maybe it's a heaven punishment.

1889
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:08,300
Maybe it's a heaven punishment.

1890
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:08,880
Heaven punishment?

1891
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,100
Ryo, you're always doing bad things,

1892
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,040
so the gods of heaven punished you.

1893
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:15,740
So the gods of heaven punished you.

1894
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:16,040
Say whatever I did!

1895
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,960
Don't tell me!

1896
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,260
That's right!

1897
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,420
If you're going to complain, you should tell the gods!

1898
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:25,880
That's right.

1899
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:26,740
That's right.

1900
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,800
I'm going to heaven.

1901
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:33,580
You're going to heaven?

1902
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,040
Do you know where it is?

1903
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,340
Are you listening?

1904
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:38,660
It's so high that you can even call it heaven!

1905
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,540
It's so high that you can even call it heaven!

1906
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,440
But birds don't fly, do they?

1907
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,640
But birds don't fly, do they?

1908
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:49,800
But birds don't fly, do they?

1909
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,000
Boing...!

1910
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,640
Boing...!

1911
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,340
Boing...!

1912
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:56,720
Boing...!

1913
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,940
Boing...!

1914
01:15:57,940 --> 01:15:58,060
Boing...!

1915
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,780
Boing...!

1916
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:07,840
Is that a chicken?

1917
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,040
Do gods exist?

1918
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,460
I have to see it.

1919
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:17,380
If I let him be possessed any longer, I don't know what he'll do.

1920
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,180
Damn it! Where is it? Heaven is...

1921
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,020
Stop it!

1922
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,000
I'm tired.

1923
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,240
I won't lose!

1924
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:38,720
There's no doubt! This is heaven!

1925
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,200
Hey, hey! Where are the gods?

1926
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,200
Ryouchi Kankichi has come to ask a question!

1927
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,440
Hey, where are you?

1928
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,800
Where are you?

1929
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,060
Where are you?

1930
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,380
Where are you?

1931
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:10,520
Where are you?

1932
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:12,540
Well, you ran away when I came.

1933
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:18,240
I'll leave you the proof you came here.

1934
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,540
Well, well, well.

1935
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,040
This is fine.

1936
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,740
What's this voice?

1937
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,100
It's a god.

1938
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:31,040
A god? Where did it come from?

1939
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,660
It's right in front of you.

1940
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:35,400
Look.

1941
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,840
Oh, my God!

1942
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,060
What's that?

1943
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,060
A god!

1944
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:48,700
A god!

1945
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:49,180
What's this?

1946
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,080
That's a heaven.

1947
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:51,160
I heard it before.

1948
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,420
I would like to see a god's face.

1949
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,520
A god?

1950
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,380
What kind of quemble is that?

1951
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:57,960
Oh, man, what a room!

1952
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,200
A god!

1953
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,100
A god!

1954
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:00,560
A god!

1955
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:00,720
A god...

1956
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,580
A god!

1957
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:01,720
A gamer!

1958
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:04,900
A gamer!

1959
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:07,200
The reason I made you a chicken is because you have over 20,000 evil points!

1960
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,020
What is that evil point?

1961
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,760
Every bad deed of a human is marked with points.

1962
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:22,080
If you lie, you get 1 point. If you talk nonsense, you get 10 points.

1963
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:26,960
If you get over 10,000 points, you will be sent to hell.

1964
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:30,860
And if you get over 20,000 points...

1965
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,260
Go!

1966
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:34,060
...you will be a chicken.

1967
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,360
I'm not that evil!

1968
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,900
You're so naive.

1969
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,120
It's written in the Bible.

1970
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,460
Do you think I'll let you do that?

1971
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,080
When you were a baby, you took a baby's milk bottle.

1972
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,600
So you get 12 points.

1973
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:55,460
What?

1974
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,880
In elementary school, you got 12 points for wearing a skirt.

1975
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:01,860
In middle school, you got 12 points for being a principal.

1976
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:05,740
In high school, you got 12 points for being a thief, and got 222 points.

1977
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,020
Oh my.

1978
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,880
And you got late when you became a police officer.

1979
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,840
You're not used to being a thief.

1980
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:20,200
You got 12 points for being a thief, and got 12 points for being a thief.

1981
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:21,240
Wow.

1982
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:26,420
And then, yesterday, you stole the Taiyaki knife that Head Coach Ohara bought.

1983
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:28,820
What?

1984
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:34,440
The 100 points have become 20,000 points.

1985
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:47,460
Wait a minute!

1986
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:48,880
What?

1987
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,360
If you calculate it, it's not 20,000 points!

1988
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,000
What?

1989
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,560
There's no mistake! It's 19,995 points!

1990
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,400
What?

1991
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:00,180
I calculated it twice!

1992
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:00,900
What?

1993
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,160
What?

1994
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,040
I can't even add up.

1995
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,700
What a fool.

1996
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,280
The first prize is the decision to include the dead.

1997
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,360
You're using human resources to defend yourself.

1998
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:17,040
This sin is heavy.

1999
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,980
You have 35,000 additional points.

2000
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,080
Hey! What are you doing?

2001
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:30,880
A total of 55,000 points.

2002
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,440
If you exceed these points, you will be a fly.

2003
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:34,660
Hey, you're disgusting!

2004
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,140
Get back to your original state!

2005
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:42,440
Oh, this is...

2006
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,460
A message from a goddess.

2007
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:53,520
Um... The phone number is...

2008
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,360
Hey! It's the Paiga!

2009
01:20:59,360 --> 01:20:59,580
Come on, come on!

2010
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:00,600
Put me back where I was.

2011
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:03,260
Back, back, back, back!

2012
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:09,080
Shut up, you.

2013
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:15,980
Back, back, back!

2014
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:19,040
Geez.

2015
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,020
Shut up.

2016
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,940
Back, back, back!

2017
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:28,300
Let go!

2018
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,040
You!

2019
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,760
Let go! Let go! Let go!

2020
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,860
Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go!

2021
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,020
How dare you!

2022
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,520
I'm back to being a human!

2023
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:51,600
I'm back!

2024
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:57,700
Hey! What are you doing? Let me go!

2025
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,640
Even a god like you who fears no god is going straight to hell!

2026
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:15,200
That god...

2027
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,400
What if he suddenly throws himself up and dies?

2028
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:28,560
I'm not going to die!

2029
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:28,880
What is this?

2030
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:32,280
He's a living human, Lord Daioh.

2031
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:33,600
What?

2032
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:36,860
What?

2033
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:40,120
He's going to be sent to hell as he is.

2034
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:43,000
He's a lot of trouble.

2035
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:47,500
It's been a long time since someone worth of pity came here.

2036
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,120
Who are you?

2037
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,340
I'm the master of hell.

2038
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,840
I'm the master of hell, Enma Daioh.

2039
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,300
I'm going to make you taste the suffering of hell.

2040
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:11,880
Skip! Skip! Lan! Lan! Lan!

2041
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:15,220
Skip! Skip! Lan! Lan! Lan!

2042
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:19,020
Today is a fun date with Megami-chan.

2043
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:20,140
Oh!

2044
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,300
Now, which clothes should I wear?

2045
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,240
What?

2046
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,260
Lord, this is bad!

2047
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,440
What's going on?

2048
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,920
The army of hell has invaded heaven!

2049
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,360
What?

2050
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:41,620
What?

2051
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:44,140
What?

2052
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,400
What?

2053
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,200
What?

2054
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,120
What?

2055
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:50,220
What?

2056
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:51,500
What?

2057
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:55,280
But Enma Dioh is not an idiot in the way to oppose me.

2058
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,180
But Enma Dioh is not an idiot in the way to oppose me.

2059
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,280
The revolution in hell occurred the other day.

2060
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,880
He's been change the new leader.

2061
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,040
The revolution in hell has turned into a new leader.

2062
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,820
Enma Dioh.

2063
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:08,020
Enma Dioh.

2064
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:08,460
Enma Dioh.

2065
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,580
Damn you!

2066
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:16,600
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

2067
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:21,720
Today I will destroy you!

2068
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:21,920
Ahhhh!

2069
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:29,860
Alright!

2070
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:32,000
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

2071
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:34,300
I will show the power of the hell to the gods!

2072
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,340
I will show the power of the hell to the gods!

2073
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:37,980
It happens to be,

2074
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:41,280
it is not our fight who can beat us...

2075
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,340
Hey!

2076
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,840
What are you doing?

2077
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,960
Eh? Eh?

2078
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:47,220
If you have time for that,

2079
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:49,520
If you have time to get your hands on, get to work!

2080
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,140
Yes, sir!

2081
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,560
The Great Empire and the Empire of Gouga will be destroyed!

2082
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,360
Half of Heaven is already in the sea of fire!

2083
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:08,700
Did you think of that, God?!

2084
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,480
Hey, foolish human!

2085
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:12,160
Think of the power of God!

2086
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:16,360
The Great Empire and the Empire of Gouga will be destroyed!

2087
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:41,740
The Great Empire and the Empire of Gouga will be destroyed!

2088
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:51,640
The Great Empire and the Empire of Gouga will be destroyed!

2089
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:59,640
The Great Empire and the Empire of Gouga will be destroyed!

2090
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,420
Hey, God!

2091
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,040
You've done something terrible!

2092
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:09,480
You're still alive despite the attack, aren't you?

2093
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:14,560
Don't think you can do it like this, God!

2094
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,520
Wow, you live in a pretty nice place.

2095
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:36,280
Oh, that smells good!

2096
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,620
Oh, that smells good, Mickey!

2097
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,280
Let's eat!

2098
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:52,320
Damn it.

2099
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,220
I shouldn't have thrown it away.

2100
01:26:57,220 --> 01:27:00,220
I should have taken it with me.

2101
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:01,120
I should have taken it with me.

2102
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:08,020
I should have taken it with me.

2103
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:08,060
Damn it.

2104
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,480
You should have taken a bath instead.

2105
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,320
Today is a date with the goddess.

2106
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,360
Today is a date with the goddess.

2107
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:27,760
At a time like this, a wig is convenient.

2108
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,960
But this is a secret no one knows.

2109
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:34,400
If you are found out, God's authority will be destroyed.

2110
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:38,820
I'm afraid that the goddess will hate me.

2111
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,220
I saw it.

2112
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:45,700
You!

2113
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,460
I thought it was suspicious to do something like a punch perm to God,

2114
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,680
but I'll let everyone do it!

2115
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,700
No, no, no, stop it!

2116
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,600
You!

2117
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,280
Heaven's people!

2118
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,680
God's head is actually...

2119
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:05,040
Return to the world!

2120
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,700
I was in a dangerous place.

2121
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,620
Sen... Senpai!

2122
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:19,500
Where did you come from?

2123
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:23,040
Oh, this is inside the exit!

2124
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,300
Yay, yay, yay!

2125
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:27,300
I was worried.

2126
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:28,320
I was worried, Ryo-chan!

2127
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:29,480
I was worried, I was worried.

2128
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:29,640
It's true.

2129
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,120
I haven't come back for a week.

2130
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,440
Hey, Ryotsu!

2131
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,620
If you do this, you will never be a chicken again.

2132
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,860
You have to change your attitude to life.

2133
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:40,720
What?

2134
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:41,660
I'm fine.

2135
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,280
What do you mean, "I'm fine"?

2136
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,400
I will never be a chicken again.

2137
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,200
Because...

2138
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,160
Because?

2139
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,180
Because I have the weakness of God.

2140
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,060
The weakness of God?

2141
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:57,800
The weakness of God?

2142
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:58,020
Yes.

2143
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,040
That's all I have to say.

2144
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,500
Actually, the God's head is...

2145
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,140
The weakness of God?

2146
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,700
The weakness of God?

2147
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,140
Sen... Senpai!

2148
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,320
Ryo-chan?

2149
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:10,940
Don't worry.

2150
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,780
I'm just fainted.

2151
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,780
Don't be so surprised.

2152
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:24,980
I am God.

2153
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:25,300
I am God.

2154
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,740
You are God?

2155
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,500
I've never seen you before.

2156
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:32,080
Normally, you don't come to the human world.

2157
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:36,440
But if you leave this man alone,

2158
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:39,000
I don't know how much trouble will be caused to the people around you.

2159
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:43,560
Above all, if you get rid of Katsura, you will be in trouble.

2160
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,460
By the way, this man...

2161
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:46,740
Huh?

2162
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:48,680
He said he had the weakness of God.

2163
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:48,800
Come again?

2164
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,220
I said he was in trouble.

2165
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:51,700
Katsura?

2166
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:52,380
Ke-ke.

2167
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,840
This man's weakness is impossible!

2168
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,320
He can't say he has the weakness of God!

2169
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,940
He will definitely...

2170
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,360
reveal my secret!

2171
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:02,720
Eh.

2172
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:05,240
Bad people must stay up from the start.

2173
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:08,880
I shall extract the sharp edge of evil from him!

2174
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:10,220
You weak!

2175
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:12,260
Hey..!

2176
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:23,660
I'm not going to let you do anything to me!

2177
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,680
Show me what you've got!

2178
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,380
I'm not going to let you do anything to me!

2179
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:30,580
Money! Money!

2180
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,640
What's going on?

2181
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,020
We have to do something about this!

2182
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:35,060
There's nothing to be afraid of.

2183
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,400
Humans have evil spirits and good spirits.

2184
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,540
If you can fight them,

2185
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:42,120
good spirits will definitely win.

2186
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:43,900
Good spirits, come out!

2187
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:52,180
I don't have any reaction at all.

2188
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:53,800
I don't have any reaction at all.

2189
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,700
Money! Money!

2190
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,180
Ryo Shin, come out!

2191
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,220
Ryo Shin, come out!

2192
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:02,040
Come out!

2193
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,120
Money!

2194
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:08,740
Hey, can't you hear me, Ryo Shin?

2195
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:10,760
Hey, Ryo Shin! Ryo Shin!

2196
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,780
It seems like this man

2197
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:15,680
doesn't have a Ryo Shin.

2198
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:19,880
Money!

2199
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:24,680
Money!

2200
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:26,800
Money!

2201
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:27,620
Money!

2202
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:27,840
Money!

2203
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:31,900
Only the lumps of desire

2204
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,320
have great power!

2205
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,640
If you leave it alone, it will be a big deal!

2206
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,540
If this happens,

2207
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:38,560
I'll have to stop them!

2208
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:41,780
Ready for battle!

2209
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:45,340
Ready for battle!

2210
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:50,020
Come!

2211
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,060
I'll be your opponent!

2212
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,440
Come! I'll be your opponent!

2213
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:55,180
What's with this guy?

2214
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:56,700
Transform!

2215
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,180
How's that?

2216
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:06,340
He's a gold-hungry man!

2217
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:08,380
I'll defeat you with my sword!

2218
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:09,580
One!

2219
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,200
Two!

2220
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:12,980
Three!

2221
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:13,840
Four!

2222
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:20,060
Six!

2223
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:20,680
Seven!

2224
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:21,720
Eight!

2225
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:21,880
Nine!

2226
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,240
Ten!

2227
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:27,540
Eleven!

2228
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,180
Thirteen!

2229
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:30,320
Fifteen!

2230
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:36,460
Fifteen!

2231
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,140
Fifteen!

2232
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:37,160
Fifteen!

2233
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,660
Fifteen!

2234
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:49,240
Nineteen!

2235
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:50,660
Thirteen!

2236
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:51,340
Twenty!

2237
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:53,000
Twenty!

2238
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:55,580
Forty!

2239
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:56,300
Fifty!

2240
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:56,740
Fifty!

2241
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:57,320
Fifty!

2242
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:57,560
Fifty!

2243
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:00,280
Cut!

2244
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,080
Fifty!

2245
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,580
I'm so sorry.

2246
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:10,440
It was all a lie,

2247
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:11,480
I was too sectarian

2248
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:11,620
who look after only그

2249
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:11,860
I'll be a good father!

2250
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:13,620
You're right.

2251
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:15,620
Okay.

2252
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:22,780
He's serious about what the bad guys say!

2253
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:26,820
Money is the most important thing in the world!

2254
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:28,540
Damn it!

2255
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:34,600
God, I have a good idea.

2256
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:35,840
What?

2257
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,940
Hiss, hiss, hiss...

2258
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:40,540
Hiss, hiss, hiss...

2259
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,420
I see.

2260
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:44,960
Hey, bad guy!

2261
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:46,320
Look at that!

2262
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,940
That's the bell!

2263
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:01,920
With this, I don't need to worry about money!

2264
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:24,500
Fly to the ends of the universe!

2265
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:29,280
He's the last one to destroy himself with money.

2266
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:33,600
Ryo!

2267
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:35,820
Ryo!

2268
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,500
Hey, bad guy!

2269
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,500
You've got to go!

2270
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:55,560
Hii!

2271
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,400
Hii!

2272
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,380
Hii!

2273
01:34:59,660 --> 01:34:59,760
Hii!

2274
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:00,700
Hii!

2275
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:02,020
Hii!

2276
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:02,100
Hii!

2277
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,240
Hii!

2278
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:04,220
Hii!

2279
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:05,380
Hii!

2280
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:05,580
Hii!

2281
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:05,660
He's the last one to destroy himself with money.

2282
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,220
How can he be so bad!

2283
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:08,920
I'm afraid he's gonna make us get out of our lives.

2284
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:13,220
His planet is a nuisance to this man.

2285
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,060
Please do something about it.

2286
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:17,800
Haa...

2287
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:21,160
He's a nuisance to another planet...

2288
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:23,480
It's a mess on Earth!

2289
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:25,400
Seriously...

2290
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,480
Money! Money!
