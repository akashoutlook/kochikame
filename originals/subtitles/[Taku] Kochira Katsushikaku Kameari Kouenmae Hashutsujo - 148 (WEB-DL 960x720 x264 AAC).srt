00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
OPEN SUBS

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:13,840
♪ When watching TV, look out the window and look away. ♪

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:26,200
♪ At the end of the rainy season, as if someone's calling you, ♪

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,420
I walked while looking back at the afternoon after the rain

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,460
I reached out to my mom

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,280
I felt a strange feeling at that time

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,220
So I walked on the black side of the Akegai Tile

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,460
Everyone was a child once, but everyone has forgotten

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,800
Politicians with a great face and a blue aunt above their eyes

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,200
Turn around and see that corner

11
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,280
Everyone, everyone can see

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,500
There is a wall there

13
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,180
There is a wall there

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,600
There is a wall there

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,040
There is a wall there

16
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone, come to our town

17
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,720
Thank you!

18
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,600
Senpai, good morning

19
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,760
You're early today

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,180
I was studying Chinese at night to respond to international society

21
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,720
It was a little late, I arrived as it is

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,440
It's amazing, right?

23
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,440
What's amazing?

24
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,780
Marjan, Marjan

25
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,240
I see

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
Anyway, I sleep there

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,520
What is this future map?

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,140
It's the completion schedule for the Nakagawa Island plan

29
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,540
To overcome the 21st century in which international competition is getting more and more intense

30
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,500
Now at the Nakagawa Group, one-third of Tokyo Bay is full

31
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,780
and gather the main building of the group.

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,020
Oh, as expected of the world's best, Konzen Nagagawa.

33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,000
It's not easy to do.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,300
Of course, each company is connected online,

35
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,500
and it will be a global communication base

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,720
that can be accessed by satellite communication and light fiber overseas.

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,660
Since each building is connected by monorail and aerial road,

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,960
it will activate the interaction within the group and make the work smoother.

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,160
I see.

40
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,820
But isn't it inconvenient to commute?

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,140
Odaiba is now only available by car and Yurikamome,

42
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,460
so it's quite inconvenient.

43
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,720
I don't worry about that.

44
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,980
Before Nakagawa Island is completed,

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,360
I plan to run a non-stop linear subway from Tokyo, Yokohama, Chiba, and my house.

46
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,660
That's great!

47
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,520
How about you try to go from Kameyari?

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,160
That's a good idea.

49
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,560
I'll tell the project team.

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,940
Oh, that's great!

51
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,560
The bus arrives at the station and is barely safe.

52
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,880
Good morning, Mr. Terai!

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,200
Oh, good morning.

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,900
You always arrive 15 minutes before, Mr. Terai.

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,600
You're late.

56
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,420
Well, I actually bought a house.

57
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,300
I was supposed to go to work today.

58
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,340
What?

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,260
The house is the story of the time you were a real estate agent about two years ago?

60
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,600
Yes, after that, I looked at various properties and finally decided on one.

61
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,500
I thought I had given up completely,

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,180
I thought he was a good man, but he's been looking for two years.

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,680
He's a very dedicated man.

64
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,400
That's normal when you're looking for a house.

65
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,480
Oh, Chief!

66
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,600
Good morning!

67
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,220
Good morning.

68
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,760
Ryotsu, when you're looking for a house, you have to be careful,

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,940
and look for it until you're convinced.

70
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,180
If you decide to buy it lightly,

71
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,740
you'll end up crying later.

72
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,380
I don't have to be a good man.

73
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,420
So, Terae-san, what is the next house?

74
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,240
What's the next house?

75
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,260
Well, while I was looking for a cheap house,

76
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,740
I went to the back.

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,260
It's either Chiba or Saitama, right?

78
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,300
Anyway, the budget...

79
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,200
Where is it after all? Tell us clearly.

80
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,560
You probably don't know, but the nearest station is Kokkyougaoka.

81
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,380
Kokkyougaoka? I've never heard of such a station.

82
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,220
Is that definitely Japan?

83
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,000
Excuse me, but it's a range that can be used for commuting.

84
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,380
That's why you were late.

85
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,200
I was a little late.

86
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,320
It's because of the bad weather.

87
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,400
It takes three and a half hours.

88
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,760
Three and a half hours?

89
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,780
But the area is 220 square meters,

90
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,500
and there's one person per family,

91
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,580
and there are 20 rooms in the living room.

92
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,520
That's a lot of money.

93
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,900
If you don't mind,

94
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,620
please come with us on the next day.

95
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,280
We'll welcome you.

96
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,040
Oh, we'll have free lunch.

97
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,660
I agree.

98
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,520
If you want to drive, let's all come.

99
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,760
Well, then I'll...

100
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:13,980
But...

101
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,060
I can't drive.

102
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,040
There's a place I can't pass on the way.

103
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,320
What?

104
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,380
Don't worry.

105
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
The train is passing by.

106
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll write a map now.

107
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,180
If I get lost on the way, I won't be able to go back.

108
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,320
That place is...

109
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,040
I don't think he's living in the city of Fuji.

110
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,140
Hmm, there's still an SL running.

111
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,940
Oh, that's nice.

112
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,200
It's nice to feel good.

113
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,480
It reminds me of the French garden landscape.

114
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,400
How long will it take?

115
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,900
Wait a minute.

116
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,060
The station we just passed is at the end of the Gaoka.

117
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,380
Next is the Kusoto Bridge.

118
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,020
We'll change trains there.

119
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,140
I see.

120
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,640
It should take three and a half hours.

121
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,520
Anyway, the land was 500 yen.

122
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,500
500 yen?

123
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,460
I bought 200,

124
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,660
but I heard that if you buy 10, you get one.

125
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,520
I heard that if you buy 10, you get one.

126
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,300
That's 220.

127
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,760
What kind of real estate did he buy?

128
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,580
I'm here.

129
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,320
It's a station that's different from a toilet.

130
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,220
That's amazing.

131
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,980
There's no convenience store or house in front of the station.

132
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,220
There should be a bus stop in front of the station.

133
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,200
Senpai, isn't that the one?

134
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,600
What?

135
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,260
This is a trace of a wild animal.

136
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,240
What time is the next bus?

137
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,700
It's 5:05 p.m., so it'll be in about two hours.

138
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,260
What?

139
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,900
It's 5:05 p.m., so it'll be in about two hours.

140
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,220
Wait for two hours?

141
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
I've exchanged the things I came here for.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,380
I didn't expect to see a wooden bus running at this time.

143
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,400
I didn't expect to see a wooden bus running at this time.

144
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,860
It's better than the bus that comes out of the TOTORO.

145
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,720
It's better than the bus that comes out of the TOTORO.

146
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,840
Check it out.

147
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,560
There's a used car center.

148
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,320
It's a pretty big used car center.

149
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,360
It's a pretty big used car center.

150
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,400
Business is about to start here in this rural area.

151
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,480
Why is it written with name and address.

152
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,080
Director, everyone, thanks for coming.

153
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,560
Boss, did you buy the whole journey?

154
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,760
Boss, did you buy the whole journey?

155
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,240
We will have to buy a car to live here.

156
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,440
Now, everyone get on!

157
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,020
We will have to buy a car to live here.

158
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,640
Now, everyone get on.

159
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,660
I'm going to the supermarket.

160
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,340
It takes 30 minutes to go to the supermarket.

161
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,740
And 1 hour to get to the nearest bus stop.

162
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,580
It's not one bus per family, it's one bus per person.

163
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,740
It's a long way.

164
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,840
Is the bus that has the name on it for commuting?

165
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,760
It's impossible to use a bicycle.

166
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,320
All the employees are using cars.

167
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,680
Then we should go to the station by car.

168
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,800
It's hard to go to the station.

169
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,800
There's no gas bill.

170
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,480
There's a used car center here.

171
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,000
You can buy one for 5000 yen.

172
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,560
What? Is it that cheap?

173
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,720
It's like a bicycle.

174
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,200
Yes, that's why the bus stop is not a local bicycle.

175
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,040
It's a local car park.

176
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,860
It's more amazing than Tokyo.

177
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,240
We're here.

178
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,580
It's a big and nice house.

179
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,080
It's the best environment to raise children.

180
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,800
Yes, it is.

181
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,520
It's green and the air is good.

182
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
It's embarrassing.

183
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,900
It's a small house.

184
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,880
It's really big.

185
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,840
It feels like we're all alone in the Pacific.

186
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,820
Let's go inside.

187
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,540
Hello.

188
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,600
What's this?

189
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,340
It's a time-lapse ticket.

190
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,040
If you give me one, I can only invest.

191
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,980
Invest?

192
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,840
Here you are.

193
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,200
It's nice.

194
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,680
It's a pretty girl.

195
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,520
You're so proud of yourself.

196
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,520
It's a calm and spacious house.

197
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,740
I like this place too.

198
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,760
Please have a seat.

199
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,680
Now the lord is also a master.

200
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,520
He's the lord of the city.

201
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,240
It's a big house.

202
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,480
From now on, we'll live together alone.

203
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,300
Sorry for making you come all the way from far away.

204
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,260
It's perfect for this place.

205
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,460
Ryo.

206
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,980
Thank you, madam.

207
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,440
I'm coming.

208
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,060
This is our moving party.

209
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,760
You don't have to be so careful.

210
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,580
I told you I didn't have to be careful.

211
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,260
I told you I didn't have to be careful.

212
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,820
Hey, don't say that.

213
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,940
You don't have to hit me.

214
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,360
Here's your tea.

215
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,740
Hello.

216
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,700
Oh, you're the kids.

217
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,860
Hello.

218
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,900
You look like a monk.

219
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,900
Especially your brother.

220
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,760
I'm your older brother, Eitaro.

221
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,360
I'm your younger brother, Bisaku.

222
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,380
Hello.

223
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,540
How are the kids doing in school?

224
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,060
Are you driving?

225
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,000
Elementary school is close.

226
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,800
It's only 10 minutes away.

227
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:32,940
Oh.

228
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Let's play baseball in the yard.

229
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,520
Yeah.

230
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,320
All right.

231
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,020
Let's go.

232
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,620
You're the best match for kids.

233
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,060
Sorry.

234
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,340
I'll be serious next time.

235
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,520
Here we go.

236
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,620
The yard is too small.

237
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,540
And it's too big.

238
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,460
How about we play in the school yard?

239
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,640
What?

240
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
In the school yard?

241
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,460
It's only 10 minutes away.

242
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
But...

243
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,260
We should stop.

244
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,880
What are you talking about?

245
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,960
Let's go.

246
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,160
Oh, that's the school yard.

247
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,120
It's closer than I thought.

248
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,560
Ryo, it's time to grab the rope.

249
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,580
It's not so far.

250
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,600
It's narrow.

251
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:29,940
What do you mean narrow?

252
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,360
Oh, no.

253
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,280
What is this hill?

254
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Are you OK, Ryo?

255
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

256
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,160
He said I should stop.

257
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,620
He said I should stop.

258
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,680
That may be 10 minutes,

259
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,100
but it takes an hour to get back.

260
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,960
It takes an hour to get back.

261
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,800
Just you see!

262
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,980
You're a real jerk. You moved to such a terrible place.

263
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,840
That's strange. I paid this month.

264
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,260
What's wrong?

265
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,820
I'm here to collect the tax.

266
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,900
I paid the house tax, but the staff is here again.

267
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,540
I'll ask the staff.

268
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,740
Hello, sir. I'm Kanetori, the manager of this district.

269
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm not the boss. But I heard your wife paid.

270
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,060
This is the receipt.

271
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,040
Excuse me.

272
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,080
This is the amount of the next house.

273
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,240
We haven't received it yet.

274
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,920
What? What does that mean?

275
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,000
Let me explain on the map.

276
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,580
This district is made by filling the river. The river is in the area of the prefecture.

277
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,320
This house is just on the border.

278
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,000
This is 52% of our prefecture, and the other 48% is the other prefecture.

279
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,360
Oh, really?

280
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,860
I'll tell you in detail.

281
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,920
This is what it looks like.

282
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,100
This is how it looks like.

283
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,460
The children are completely in my prefecture.

284
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,240
The bedroom is like this.

285
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,540
By the way, is the master sleeping on the right side of the bed? Or is it the left side?

286
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,720
It's the right side.

287
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,680
So the master is in the next prefecture, and the wife is sleeping in my prefecture.

288
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,880
I see.

289
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,660
What's this?

290
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,100
The kitchen, the bathroom, the bathroom, the children's room on the second floor, and half of the bedroom.

291
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:03,260
Besides, one-third of the current one is my prefecture, and the other two-thirds, half of the bedroom, and the guest room are in the other prefecture.

292
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,900
The phone bill is in the other prefecture, isn't it?

293
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,340
The gas and water bill are in this prefecture.

294
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,800
Chief, what should we do?

295
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,340
We should immediately ask the real estate agency.

296
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
What's going on?

297
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,340
What the hell?

298
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,540
We were about to hit it!

299
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,200
I just saw a gorilla and I made a mistake.

300
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,800
I didn't know there was a human population here.

301
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,500
It was a field last year.

302
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,280
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

303
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,420
Are you okay, Ryo-chan?

304
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,180
We were about to attack the second class.

305
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,440
The real estate agency said this place is in the Kinryoku prefecture.

306
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,440
That's strange.

307
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,280
It's true. It's in the Kinryoku prefecture.

308
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,700
Be careful.

309
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,300
The Kinryoku prefecture is the prefecture next to it, so it's fine if it's on this side.

310
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,180
Hey, John. Come here.

311
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,460
It's dangerous!

312
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,200
Hey, you guys, stop it!

313
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,940
This is Kinryoku!

314
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,080
I thought it was a perfect point.

315
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,960
The population has risen.

316
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,300
Hey, wait a minute!

317
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,840
What a place!

318
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,480
It's the real estate agency's car!

319
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,240
What?

320
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,320
How are you, sir?

321
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,940
It's a wonderful environment, isn't it?

322
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,120
This land is worth 500 yen.

323
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,480
Hey, real estate agency!

324
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,600
Geek!

325
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,980
I saw it somewhere.

326
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,540
What are you talking about?

327
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,140
I'm the head of the Nikoniko real estate agency.

328
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,800
I've never seen you.

329
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,460
I never saw you.

330
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,420
I got it!

331
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,820
You're a...

332
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,500
As expected, you're Hanyu, the real estate agent of the hens!

333
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,720
No, he was pretending.

334
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,540
Hey, Hanyu, you were just lying and making that man buy a house.

335
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,420
Please stop it, you're so rude!

336
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,400
Shut up!

337
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,580
The whole area is Kinryoku!

338
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,220
Didn't I say that?

339
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,540
I didn't say anything like that.

340
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,640
But the contract is over.

341
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,520
I'll pay you later.

342
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,040
-You're complaining... -Shut up!

343
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,500
The hunter fired his gun and we were about to die!

344
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,940
Hey, give me a thousand more sticks to keep the flow going!

345
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,380
That's ridiculous.

346
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,500
Then, sir, this is Hanyu...

347
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,540
No, stop it! I'll give you a thousand more sticks!

348
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,640
I don't need anything else!

349
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,840
That's great, Mr. Terai.

350
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,580
If we can get a thousand more sticks around here, the hunter won't be scared.

351
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:40,740
Sure.

352
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,820
Wait a minute.

353
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,920
Hey, come here.

354
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,980
I heard you were selling Toho for 10 minutes to elementary school.

355
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,140
That's the intersection of the school.

356
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,020
It's true that it takes 10 minutes to get there, but it takes an hour to get home.

357
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,660
This is a fraud, isn't it?

358
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,460
And you said that the subway would open in two years.

359
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,060
That's also a fraud, isn't it?

360
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,980
Sir, this is...

361
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,160
Don't interfere with business!

362
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,600
I'm not a demon.

363
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,840
And if you sell me a thousand more sticks, I'll let you go.

364
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,040
If you want to buy it, I don't mind buying a thousand or two thousand sticks.

365
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,060
I see. Then I'll buy two thousand sticks for a single stick.

366
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,080
Here's your cash.

367
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,640
That's not...

368
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,260
If you don't want to...

369
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,700
Sir!

370
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,580
All right! I'll sell it!

371
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,840
All right. I'll let you make the rest of the money.

372
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,100
Nakagawa, come here!

373
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,620
What is it, sir?

374
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,820
Nakagawa Island Project.

375
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,400
Stop the Tokyo Bay and do it here.

376
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,140
What?

377
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,980
If you move the Nakagawa Group to this border hill, this countryside can turn into a great city.

378
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,580
Do it!

379
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,700
Even if you say that suddenly...

380
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,760
Rather than building the Tokyo Bay, it's much cheaper to use this 500-yen pot of land.

381
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,380
But...

382
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,800
You suddenly said that. Ryo, you're thinking of something strange again, aren't you?

383
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,440
Don't say that.

384
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm...

385
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,560
I'm thinking about the happiness of my colleague's wife.

386
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,720
My happiness?

387
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,700
Nakagawa Group, move here.

388
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:21,280
Nakagawa Railway will definitely create a new route, so it will be much better for transportation.

389
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,180
Well, that's what I think.

390
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,240
Then the three and a half hours of commuting will be reduced, and there will be a lot of supermarkets and convenience stores.

391
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,540
Children will also be able to go back to elementary school without going through such a dangerous slope.

392
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,460
I see.

393
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,860
Nakagawa, do it!

394
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,240
Even if you say that, I understand.

395
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
But I cannot change my plan.

396
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,520
Senpai, please create a simulation to persuade the members of the Nakagawa Group.

397
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,600
Hmm...

398
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,940
Okay, leave it to me!

399
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,620
Ryo has been resting for a long time since then, but what's wrong?

400
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,220
Good morning!

401
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,220
Ryo, what have you been doing for three days without any money?

402
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,880
What?

403
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,560
It's a simulation!

404
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,520
You...

405
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,500
Well, well, I made a great CG, so please take a look.

406
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,300
Everyone, put it on.

407
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,980
What is this?

408
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,620
I put it in the CG and made it possible to see it in virtual reality.

409
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,540
Virtual reality?

410
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,220
It's virtual reality.

411
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,040
You can experience it in real time.

412
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,180
I see.

413
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,200
Anyway, put it on.

414
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,200
Okay, here I go.

415
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,700
Oh, isn't that Kameari Station?

416
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,220
What do you mean?

417
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,820
There's no zero-line platform at Kameari Station.

418
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,780
Nakagawa Railway was able to get on it.

419
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,880
Wow, isn't that the Giniya Motor Car?

420
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,760
It's 600 kilometers per hour, so you can get to the border hill in 5 minutes.

421
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,560
Now, get on!

422
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,100
Oh, that was quick.

423
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,680
The station name has changed.

424
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,300
It's stupid to say the border hill.

425
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,000
We changed it from Beverly Hills to the border hill.

426
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,200
The monorail is connected to the house of the guest, but we're taking the helicopter.

427
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,460
I'm impressed by this virtual reality.

428
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,060
The virtual reality?

429
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,960
That's...

430
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,580
Yeah, it's the building army of the Nakagawa Group.

431
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,780
Oh, it's my house!

432
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,100
Your house is right in front of the monorail station, so it takes 30 minutes to get to Kameari.

433
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,460
You can save up to 3 hours.

434
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,180
That's good, isn't it, Terai-san?

435
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,840
But there's no rice paddies or rice paddies, so the environment is...

436
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,240
What?

437
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,020
You're talking about luxury.

438
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,100
In front of a station in such a great city, the land will naturally rise.

439
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,300
That's true, but...

440
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,460
One grain will cost you 3 million yen.

441
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,960
3 million yen?

442
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,900
Your land is 1,000 grains that you took from Hanyu, so it's 1220 grains, so it's 36.6 million yen.

443
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,340
That's...

444
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,580
Look at that.

445
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:19,540
Departments, banks, schools, hospitals, etc. are connected to the central highway, so you don't need a car.

446
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,260
What a great city.

447
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,900
Even between each building, you can go freely without getting wet in the rain.

448
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,580
Then let's go to the observatory of the Nagagawa Group main building.

449
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,180
There's a factory, too.

450
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,420
Nagagawa Group has many customers from abroad.

451
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,860
I think the management team will be okay with this.

452
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,320
I want to move, too.

453
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,320
But this looks like you live in the city.

454
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,780
I don't think so.

455
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,100
Don't be so luxurious.

456
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,800
I'm doing this for your convenience.

457
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,400
Ryotsu, what's up with the gang of facilities in the stadium?

458
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,880
That's...

459
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,920
It's all gambling.

460
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,640
After all, we need facilities to survive.

461
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,920
You're making a city of your own choice.

462
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,020
No, it's not that.

463
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,660
I don't like it.

464
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,900
There's an edge zone next to the stadium.

465
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,480
What?

466
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,920
Why do we have a branch?

467
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,340
We thought it would be fun to move here.

468
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,720
Idiot!

469
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,220
What are you thinking?

470
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,960
It's too bad for the environment of children.

471
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,300
I don't like it.

472
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,580
You should go there once in a while.

473
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,400
I'm a wife.

474
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,540
The gambling, the edge zone, and the branch are all cool.

475
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,040
I'll erase them later.

476
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,720
What's that?

477
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,240
What was it?

478
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,940
It's strange that the first floor in the middle of the city is empty.

479
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,160
Hello.

480
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,200
What?

481
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,320
Ryotsu, I brought the land contract.

482
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,340
Please sign and return it.

483
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,120
Land contract?

484
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,820
I bought 2,000 barrels for 1 yen.

485
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,660
Idiot! Don't say that!

486
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,000
Give it to me!

487
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,060
That land is your land.

488
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,040
What are you talking about?

489
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,520
It's terrible, Ryo.

490
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,060
I refuse this selfish transfer plan.

491
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,900
No way!

492
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,400
I put all my money into making this CD.

493
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,740
Shut up!

494
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,100
You are...

495
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,760
Wait, you idiot!

496
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,840
What are you thinking?

497
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,340
Damn it!

498
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,740
I thought it was a good opportunity.

499
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,720
Humans should live a life of their own.

500
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,820
Why are you so frustrated?

501
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,460
You're really angry.

502
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,120
What?

503
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,020
You don't have enough calcium?

504
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,880
Shut up!

505
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,020
You're doing unnecessary work.

506
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,500
I'm getting angry again.

507
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,380
Next time, "Send it with calcium!"

508
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,360
Please watch it.

509
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,380
Please subscribe to my channel.
