Wait!

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,100
Please, Reiko-chan!

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,160
If I eat a lot of katsu-don, I'll be able to drink water until the end of the month!

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,700
No way!

34
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,940
How about you try putting this on your wallet from next month?

35
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:10,620
Yeah!

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,560
You can lend me a little!

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,980
I'm hungry...

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,600
I don't have anything to eat.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,320
I'll watch TV though...

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,020
It's juicy meat.

41
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,980
It's delicious!

42
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,200
It's so good!

43
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,380
It's so good!

44
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,440
I ate meat before the end of the month!

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,280
It's the best!

46
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,960
Don't make me watch this show!

47
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,780
I love you.

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,020
I love you.

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,820
I really love you.

50
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,480
I really love you.

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,120
I really, really...

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,420
I really, really love you.

53
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,800
I can only win 3% because I'm making a drama like this!

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,080
I love you.

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,040
I really love you.

56
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,560
I really love you.

57
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,860
The viewership rate at this time is common common sense!

58
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,820
Mimi takes a dog tail every week and will shampoo!

59
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,220
The clothes are Chanel.

60
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,520
Thepede is special products of Geragamo.

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,960
Kobe bureau is a popular item...

62
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,680
Ahahaha!

63
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,140
Ahhh! The color of the moon!

64
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,080
Ryo-san, what are you doing?

65
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,440
I'm hungry, so I'm watching a horror movie.

66
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,100
Let's eat it!

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,180
Ugh!

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,620
Ugh!

69
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,040
I don't know how the viewers feel on TV these days.

70
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,120
I don't understand anything!

71
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,400
It's so unpleasant!

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,020
Oh! This is the Katsudon of Tsurukame Prefecture!

73
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,400
What's up, Reiko?

74
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,580
You took my share, didn't you?

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,160
This is Kei's.

76
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,620
Well, you don't have to say that.

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,200
Ugh!

78
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,380
I told you it was Kei's!

79
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,180
By the way, you're late, Nakagawa.

80
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,100
Oh, really.

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
It's about time to return from the patrol.

82
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,040
When the Katsudon of Tsurukame Prefecture cools down, the taste is halved.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,620
I knew it!

84
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,720
Ryo-chan!

85
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
If you eat someone's food without permission, it's a theft!

86
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,100
Huh?

87
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,920
I-I-I don't care!

88
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,580
Ryo-chan!

89
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,820
You're a good cook.

90
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,560
I'll give you some.

91
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,660
Ouch!

92
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,640
What are you doing?

93
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,620
I'm going to sell it to Nakagawa.

94
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,020
Hey, be careful!

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,560
Hey!

96
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,640
Nakagawa!

97
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,760
Nakagawa!

98
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,280
Nakagawa!

99
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,220
Nakagawa!

100
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,160
What's that?

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,080
Nakagawa!

102
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,860
Nakagawa!

103
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,680
Please help me!

104
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,040
I'm sorry, I'm on a strike.

105
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,400
Please open the road.

106
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,860
Nakagawa!

107
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,480
Please look this way.

108
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,040
Nakagawa?

109
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,080
Hey, stop!

110
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,500
Sen-Senpai!

111
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,300
Oh, Nakagawa.

112
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,540
What are you doing here?

113
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,820
Senpai, please help me!

114
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,520
What's going on?

115
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,580
I don't know.

116
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,580
Are you okay, Senpai?

117
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,120
Nakagawa!

118
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,440
Please do something!

119
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,720
I can't go any further!

120
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,840
You can help me if you break the katsudon.

121
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,500
Please!

122
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,620
Okay!

123
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,840
Move!

124
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,280
Move!

125
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,680
Move!

126
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,420
Move, Move Move!

127
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,100
Move, Move!

128
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,260
Move,

129
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,620
Move!

130
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,320
Musset mantener!

131
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,750
Move,

132
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,720
Move,

133
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:53,980
Move!

134
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,420
Da-da-da!

135
00:05:59,560 --> 00:05:59,800
Move!

136
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,540
Move!

137
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:12,660
Da-da-da!

138
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,700
Hurrah!!!

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,560
Oh my god! Are you OK?

140
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,320
Well...

141
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,820
Tell me you're going to stop!

142
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,560
Sorry to interrupt, but we're waiting for the bus...

143
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,300
Uh...

144
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,920
I'm, the producer of Kanto TV, Sugihara.

145
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,100
Kanto TV?

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,700
I'm Yamanoto. I'm also the director.

147
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,400
Well, what's Kanto TV?

148
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,880
That's...

149
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,480
In other words,

150
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,100
a full-fledged interview with Detective Nakagawa!

151
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,720
Okay?

152
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,280
A 24-hour interview!

153
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,340
Um, why me?

154
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,440
Here you go.

155
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,440
Oh, it's Nakagawa!

156
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,360
Nakagawa is the winner of the Nice Guy contest

157
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,340
This is the cause of all the commotion.

158
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,960
Oh, hello?

159
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,540
Nakagawa, have you been to Kanto TV?

160
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,040
Yes, but Chief, what's this all about?

161
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,300
If you appear on TV,

162
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,660
it'll improve the image of the Katushika office.

163
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,540
Please help me.

164
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,900
No, Chief!

165
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,140
Look, they're here again!

166
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,560
Nakagawa, do something!

167
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,240
You just have to take my day.

168
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
Okay, let's do it!

169
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,480
Yay!

170
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,360
Then, follow me!

171
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,620
Oh!

172
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,160
Oboki-chama, it's morning.

173
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,420
Oh, good morning.

174
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,380
It's time to go to work.

175
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,900
A uniform I ordered from Barbary

176
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,360
has been delivered from England.

177
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,360
Yeah, let's try it when we get back.

178
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,440
Oboki-chama, have a good day.

179
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,700
The end!

180
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,480
Okay! Good job, Nakagawa-chan!

181
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,500
I tried to recreate the atmosphere of this morning as it is.

182
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,640
See?

183
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,580
The ratings will be 20% harder.

184
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,760
I don't understand the audience's feeling.

185
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,280
Huh?

186
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,340
The 24 hours of close contact has already been compared with the ratings of the worst section.

187
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,780
1.2, 1.0, 1.3%.

188
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,440
If this continues, the show will be cut off.

189
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,780
What?

190
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,860
You're an amateur. What do you know about this?

191
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,060
An amateur watches the show!

192
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,640
Huh?

193
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,800
A few years ago, the old man's stall was closed for 24 hours.

194
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,200
That should have hit 20% of the high ratings.

195
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,080
The excitement at that time.

196
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,540
The smile of the old man at that time.

197
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,420
It still burns in my brain and never leaves me.

198
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,420
Oh, oh, oh!

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,600
It's all over.

200
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,960
The show is called "24 hours of close contact".

201
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,760
It's a show that goes through the attitude that comes with living in the common people,

202
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,480
and at one time, it was even said to be the parents of Kanto TV.

203
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:43,980
How about that?

204
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,640
You can show Nakagawa's rich side and say, "Yes, it's okay."

205
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,060
I can't do the same thing forever.

206
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,040
Yeah, but you're a professional.

207
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,320
Hey, ramen and dumplings.

208
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,840
Welcome.

209
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,120
Welcome.

210
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,860
You know what?

211
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,780
You're trying to make the guests who came to the ramen restaurant eat spaghetti.

212
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,400
What?

213
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,880
That's right.

214
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,360
It's true.

215
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,920
Sui- Sui-Hara-chan.

216
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,620
What kind of program do you want the viewers to watch now?

217
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,660
Hey, hey.

218
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,420
Well, for example, the five-man show that takes away the tears of the viewers.

219
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,000
That's it.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,180
It's a show where you can see the misfortune of the people you've met.

221
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,120
What do you mean?

222
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,380
Listen.

223
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,940
The viewers want the misfortune of the people.

224
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,240
You have to fulfill that desire.

225
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,900
The concept of the project is...

226
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,120
poverty!

227
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,440
I see.

228
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,620
Depending on the consultation, this high viewing rate will be accepted,

229
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,580
and Director Ryoichi Binwan will be able to get rid of it.

230
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,660
One or two of these.

231
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,600
However...

232
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,480
Please lend me your wisdom, Director Ryoichi.

233
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,580
Let's go with a low-paying rate of 100,000 yen per percent.

234
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
100,000 yen per percent?

235
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,340
Senpai, what are you thinking?

236
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,320
The great plan to completely convert Nagagawa-chan into a citizen.

237
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,080
Cut!

238
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,080
Producer

239
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,160
We'll set it up as to how much will be taken in this condition.

240
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,520
Nakagawa-kun who lives an upright, bright country by his own lamps.

241
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,120
Listen, Ryoichi-chan.

242
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,860
I don't think that's sound good.

243
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,460
Sound good?

244
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,400
Hey!

245
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,100
This isn't something like that.

246
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,440
What exactly is it?

247
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,680
Production, sir.

248
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,900
Production, huh.

249
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,460
The End

250
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,300
Hey, old lady. I just got home.

251
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,720
Oh, Mr. Ryo. You're home early.

252
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,340
Yeah.

253
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,100
Inruna-kun's in.

254
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,620
Oh, a guest?

255
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,980
I'll put you on TV.

256
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,140
What? TV?

257
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,440
Thank you. Thank you. Good evening.

258
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,700
Oh.

259
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:17,800
Oh.

260
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,640
This is awful.

261
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,140
I-I know.

262
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,780
This place might give the viewers a sense of comfort, but...

263
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,260
Do you really live here every day?

264
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,760
Of course.

265
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,580
Come on in, Mr. Ryo.

266
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,980
I'll get you some tea.

267
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,280
No, thanks.

268
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,860
First, you need to wake up.

269
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,040
You need to lay down on the floor.

270
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,680
Then, you need to get up.

271
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,020
You need to twist your head.

272
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,680
And then, you need to face the screen.

273
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,640
I'm a rookie, so I'm in trouble.

274
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,260
Such unnatural camera marks are not good.

275
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,440
Right, Mr. Sugihara?

276
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,300
Y-Yes, you're right.

277
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,320
The director of the TV show is silent!

278
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,600
What?

279
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,320
Even the most lively fish can't be eaten by a bad fish.

280
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,660
Ugh, it's a disaster.

281
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,320
So, let's see what I can do.

282
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Uh, will you sleep in this futon?

283
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,120
You can't sleep in uniform.

284
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,020
Hurry up and take off your jacket.

285
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,780
That...

286
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,040
What about your pajamas?

287
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,020
Pajamas?

288
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,200
That kind of thing?

289
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,100
Hey, by the way, this chair is...

290
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:46,380
Well, in that case, the citizen's safety guard will be on standby with his own shirt.

291
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,540
Stand by in T-shirt.

292
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,200
Is it like this?

293
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,660
Hmm, it's not like this.

294
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,480
Hey, Eddie!

295
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,400
It's you, you!

296
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,060
Me? What did you say?

297
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,960
Yamamoto-chan, hold on tight here.

298
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
What? What?

299
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,220
Put that over there, put it over there.

300
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,680
Try to make this and that a telecon.

301
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,340
All right.

302
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,740
It's not like that!

303
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,380
No, no, it's not like that!

304
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,940
You just have to line them up!

305
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,100
Hey, Nakagawa, stretch your hand.

306
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,680
Yes, sir.

307
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,720
Everything is within reach.

308
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,420
And then, a picture of the beautiful lady.

309
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,780
Well, this is what realism is.

310
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,320
By the way, Yamamoto-san,

311
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,580
you and Eddie?

312
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,440
Yes, sir!

313
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,960
Do you think something is missing?

314
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,260
Huh?

315
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,780
You're a pathetic guy.

316
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,920
Do you not understand this?

317
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,920
No!

318
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,800
It's a chicken.

319
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,560
A chicken?

320
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,480
Go buy a chicken! Hurry!

321
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,120
I should buy it, right?

322
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,200
A chicken in winter, Senpai?

323
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,220
Nakagawa doesn't know.

324
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,640
A summer windmill on the window of winter.

325
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,300
A winter kotatsu on the window of winter.

326
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
A dinner table in the middle of summer.

327
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,200
That's the love of a single man.

328
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,980
Now, the husband's tears are squeezed tightly.

329
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,480
Um, what should I do?

330
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,500
I think the viewing rate is 3% up.

331
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,060
Ha! Ha! Ha!

332
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,780
The love is bleeding.

333
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,020
Standby, okay!

334
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,360
Ah, I slept well.

335
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,560
The weather is good today.

336
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,740
Cut!

337
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,460
Huh? Why?

338
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,400
There is no commoner who has such a well-prepared face when he wakes up!

339
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,880
Ah!

340
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,380
There is no one who has such a well-prepared face when he wakes up!

341
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:53,780
I don't have any set lotion.

342
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,440
I'll use the remaining oil from the frying pan to make you sleep like this.

343
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,400
I'll blow on your sleep and make your eyes red and clean.

344
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,700
I'll make you sleep like this.

345
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll blow on your sleep and make your eyes red and clean.

346
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,380
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

347
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,920
I don't have enough swelling!

348
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,940
Ah, um, Ryo-chan, that's enough.

349
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,140
Don't interfere with the production!

350
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,500
The finishing touches are the sleeping fashion.

351
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,420
But in terms of budget...

352
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,120
Oh, this is worse!

353
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,580
This is also part of the job.

354
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,620
Nakagawa!

355
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,620
Alright!

356
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,280
The reality has come out!

357
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,440
Listen!

358
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,600
You have to do it only once.

359
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,500
So watch carefully!

360
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,260
Yes, sir!

361
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,040
Shut up!

362
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,400
Yes, sir!

363
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,940
Good morning.

364
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,800
The wake-up kiss!

365
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,660
Did you see that?

366
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,260
This is what we call human sleeping!

367
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,220
Try it!

368
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:54,900
Yes, sir!

369
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You know this is not for everybody, right?

370
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,940
Got it?

371
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,280
And this is for the people.

372
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,820
Isn't this too much?

373
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,360
Break!

374
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,540
Break!

375
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,200
Break!

376
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:29,520
Break!

377
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:29,800
your second job,

378
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,360
and now the second one!

379
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,480
Just get rid of everything and become naked!

380
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,580
You're dangerous.

381
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,800
I..I lost.

382
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,480
Morningナ

383
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,880
Don't make me cold...

384
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,960
NO!

385
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:54,820
SHIT!

386
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:55,940
SHIT!!!

387
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,980
Oh, it stinks!

388
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,740
What? Why is there a mold?

389
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,980
Oh, this is bad!

390
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,460
I see. I thought you'd eat the ramen and then blow it out like this.

391
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,840
And then you're going to be aged as it is!

392
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,460
Well, I guess I'll have to wait another week or two.

393
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,280
Why isn't this thing working?

394
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,540
I'm sorry, Senior. I can't get my fart out.

395
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,920
Cut!

396
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,720
Okay. Well, your episode is different.

397
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,300
You've improved a lot, Nakagawa.

398
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,320
Your ratings are now 5% for sure.

399
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,560
Now all that's left is to decide how many things the viewers like to see.

400
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,840
Nakagawa, a poor police officer, has a garbage bag to store food.

401
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,540
Hey, you!

402
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,300
What?

403
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,560
Nakagawa, a nice boy, gives his dog a fried bento he picked up for dinner.

404
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,540
Now he can grab the heart of the other person and get a 1% rating.

405
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,660
Yay!

406
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,820
Nakagawa, a nice boy, also has a heart of a child.

407
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,100
He's a good police officer.

408
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,820
Now he can grab the hearts of his husband and children and get a 1% rating.

409
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,680
"A little help from the police"

410
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,740
There's a great boss named Junsa Ryoutsu at the Kameari Park branch.

411
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,300
He sometimes serves ramen to the hungry Nakagawa.

412
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,340
"A little help from the police"

413
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,960
With the appearance of ramen, the ratings are now 10% up.

414
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,000
"A little help from the police"

415
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,020
"A little help from the police"

416
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,400
What the hell is going on, Ryou-chan?

417
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:01,980
No!

418
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,240
The camera's too high.

419
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,580
I'll take it.

420
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,400
"A little help from the police"

421
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:09,500
"A little help from the police"

422
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,340
Alright, Reiko.

423
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,840
Just walk straight ahead.

424
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,240
I don't want to.

425
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,340
I've been doing too much, so don't aim.

426
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,080
"A little help from the police"

427
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,140
Nakagawa is in the frame.

428
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:21,920
Ame!

429
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,280
"Ame"

430
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,060
"Ame"

431
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,940
A sexy beauty and a second person.

432
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,500
"Ame"

433
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,080
"Ame"

434
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,580
"Ame"

435
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:32,840
"Ame"

436
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,700
"Ame"

437
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:33,920
"Ame"

438
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,100
"Ame"

439
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:34,900
"Ame"

440
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,000
"Ame"

441
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,300
"Ame"

442
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:37,400
"Ame"

443
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,220
"Ame"

444
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,700
"Ame"

445
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,380
"Ame"

446
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,320
"Ame"

447
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,120
"Ame"

448
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,140
"Ame"

449
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,680
"Ame"

450
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,280
"Ame"

451
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,080
"Ame"

452
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:48,660
"Ame"

453
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,840
"Ame"

454
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,740
"Ame"

455
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,080
"Ame"

456
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,060
"Ame"

457
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,320
What are you talking about? I don't remember you being born!

458
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,480
Ryo, what are you doing there?

459
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,380
Director, maybe...

460
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,860
Grandma is a mischief.

461
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,520
An amateur's reaction is life.

462
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,080
Grandma's lines are overflowing.

463
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,060
How many percent of the heart of the eyelid is recovered?

464
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,940
18% of the national tears and emotions.

465
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,500
18% of the reaction.

466
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,900
Then, the total number of views is 40% x 100,000.

467
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,360
4 million!

468
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,820
Well, Nagagawa, who is wet with tears,

469
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,820
will enter the battle.

470
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,460
Sometimes, Nagagawa, who accidentally enters the real world,

471
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,200
Um, soap, soap, and...

472
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,700
There it is.

473
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,260
Shampoo.

474
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,980
Lucky, it's still there.

475
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,380
The civilian police officer collects and uses both soap and shampoo.

476
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,460
Finally, he closes it with maniacal fruit milk.

477
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,840
Alright! It's the climax!

478
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,400
The civilian police officer, Nagagawa, will be doing this for a day.

479
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,000
Mom!

480
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,200
Keiichi! Keiichi!

481
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Keiichi, what are you doing?

482
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,960
I wanted to see you!

483
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,680
I wanted to see you!

484
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,540
I wanted to see you!

485
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,660
Reiko-san!

486
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,400
Well done, Nagagawa!

487
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,320
You've made it this far.

488
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,660
It was nothing, poor Kei-chan.

489
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,120
This is another person.

490
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,300
Not me!

491
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,740
Nagagawa-chan!

492
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,060
Ryou-chan!

493
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,280
Hello!

494
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,420
So...

495
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,160
Right after the show started,

496
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,300
Nakagawa-chan received letters, faxes,

497
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,540
and a whole staff room full of gifts from all over the country.

498
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,460
Nakagawa is really good at acting.

499
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,740
I... I fooled the government.

500
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,420
How can I apologize?

501
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,140
Oh, yes.

502
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,660
By the way, what is the viewer rating?

503
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,640
It's 30%.

504
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,520
Oh, I see.

505
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,740
Which means...

506
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,980
My money is 3 million yen.

507
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
But...

508
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,380
Ryosu-chan was the director of the ballet club.

509
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,760
I don't need someone less capable than an amateur.

510
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,640
You two are...

511
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,460
Nonsense.

512
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,640
So...

513
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,320
I don't have any money!

514
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,560
W-what?

515
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,640
Ryosu...

516
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,180
W-Wjong!

517
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,660
That fake show is your doing after all!

518
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,520
That's mine!

519
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,720
It's the final of Nakagawa's sweat and tears!

520
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,980
Right?

521
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,480
Because...

522
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,920
My senior forced me to do it.

523
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,460
Chief, it was good, wasn't it?

524
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,380
You are...

525
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,120
You idiot!

526
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,820
Who is this guy who is like a catalog of walking brand products?

527
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,980
It's super rich Shiratori Reiji!

528
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,360
Did he follow Reiko to the press office?

529
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,240
Hey, Reiko!

530
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,580
Do something about this dangerous guy!

531
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,860
Next time on "Super Rich Shiratori Reiji"!

532
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,560
