Nature is also a relaxation.

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,760
You guys, golf doesn't have anything to do with nature.

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,340
Oh, why?

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,480
We harvest the forest that we originally had, plant the grass on the front, and make artificial ponds and bunkers to make it more difficult to hit.

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,180
Where in the golf course is there nature?

28
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,980
That's true, but...

29
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,100
Where is relaxation?

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,580
As you say.

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,280
Who are you?

32
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,440
I'm the golf director of our company.

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,500
Nice to meet you all.

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,320
As Ryotsu-sama said, the current golf is said to be natural.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,900
Originally, golf was a game where the sheep were hit by a rock with a bow cut in the corner and played in the rabbit's nest.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,060
Now, the golf course is originally called a golf club, and it's made of aluminum and titanium.

37
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,400
It depends on the thing.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
It's a high-tech thing that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

39
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,200
In this case, it's no use saying it's natural and big.

40
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,560
Don't be so mean, Otaku!

41
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,660
No, I thought so before.

42
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,740
How about this, Keiichi-sama?

43
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,660
This time, we're going back to the origin, and we're going to play golf in nature.

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,060
Yeah, that's good!

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,280
Let's do that!

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,680
Then I'll leave it to you.

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,180
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,320
Then I'll help with the competition project.

49
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,320
Captain Settai, let's talk here.

50
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,560
It's golf, after all.

51
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,440
Senpai has always said that golf is a money-growing paradise.

52
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,360
He has a great jealousy for money-growing.

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,500
I'm scared.

54
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,880
By the way, where are you heading to?

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,740
To the island of Saiko on the

56
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,200
Great Island of the South Pacific.

57
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,820
I'm surprised.

58
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,580
Surprised?

59
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,180
I've never heard of it.

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,920
There's no way.

61
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,220
Since the beginning of time, humanity has never stepped on an island.

62
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,780
Is that where you can play golf?

63
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,940
That's why I told you.

64
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,140
This time, we're going to play golf in the nature.

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,800
We're almost there.

66
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,860
Let's go.

67
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,880
Let's go.

68
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,140
Welcome, Dajoubu!

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
We're glad to see you.

70
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,160
Hey, what are you doing with the golf bag?

71
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,000
We didn't bring it from the start.

72
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,180
Huh?

73
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,120
If we didn't have the club, we wouldn't be able to shoot.

74
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,960
The club is ready. Let's go to the hall.

75
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,600
It's a big nature.

76
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,260
It's a big nature.

77
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,240
This is a golf club.

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,500
What's this?

79
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,360
It's a red-leaf pine.

80
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,560
It's a natural material.

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,000
What's a red-leaf pine?

82
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,800
It's a year-old tree with strong stems from China.

83
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,040
It's a cane that thousands of people have.

84
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,080
Oh, that cane.

85
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,380
If you make a head of the root, it can be used as a club.

86
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,200
I see.

87
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,880
And...

88
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,180
Use potatoes in the ball.

89
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,440
Potatoes?

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,220
The lost ball is usually the same no matter how many decades have passed.

91
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,880
Potatoes grow roots there and eventually return to nature.

92
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,960
It's true that it's 100% natural material.

93
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,960
In that case, it's better to make it round.

94
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,820
But it's hard to hit everything with just one ball.

95
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,260
This one is also pretty big.

96
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,480
Well, let's get started.

97
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,240
Before that, I'd like to announce the winner of this competition.

98
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,320
The winner is...

99
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,100
This one.

100
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,420
It's a pair ticket for the world tour of the luxury line provided by Nakagawa Group.

101
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,360
Oh!

102
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,560
I'm getting motivated.

103
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,960
It would be great if I could go with Jody.

104
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,900
I wish I could go with Nana-chan.

105
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,800
The winning product can be made in cash.

106
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,520
Of course, that's fine.

107
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,400
If we win the world tour, we'll get 10 million yen.

108
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,260
All right! Let's get started!

109
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,940
Here is the first hole.

110
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,140
There is a hole on the beach where the jungle is located.

111
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,340
It's called the Meerkat.

112
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,980
That's the cup of the first hole.

113
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
The hole is also natural, isn't it?

114
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,940
It's a long hole of a par-5.

115
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,680
We'll find out the order when we hit the goal post.

116
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,480
I'll be the captain.

117
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,900
Somehow, it's not easy to hit it.

118
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,160
V Omomomo!

119
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,520
Hurry up and hit it!

120
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,140
All right!

121
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,340
Yes.

122
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,860
Oh, it bent!

123
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,360
Reiko-san, potatoes tend to bend.

124
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,960
I'll be careful.

125
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,380
Now to the left.

126
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,480
To the left.

127
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,300
What?

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,880
Senpai, potatoes are impossible.

129
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,060
That's not true. Look closely at the potatoes.

130
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,940
You need to calculate the irregular bulge.

131
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,000
If you rotate it, it will fly straight.

132
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,440
Push it from the wind and extend the distance.

133
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,280
Furthermore, this part of the stick is the impact spot.

134
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,540
This angle is good.

135
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,840
If you shoot at this angle,

136
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,920
at the same time as the impact,

137
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,860
it will rotate to the right and fly straight.

138
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,040
That's just a theory.

139
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,780
It's impossible.

140
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,340
Then let's try it.

141
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,480
In nature golf, the basics of golf so far are not applicable.

142
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,680
It's about 300 yards.

143
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,660
Good.

144
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,840
It doesn't bend at all.

145
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,980
It's not bad.

146
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,500
It's not bad at all.

147
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,360
I don't get it.

148
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,080
With this tool ...

149
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,540
Then let's go!

150
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
What should we do with the ball in the jungle?

151
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,600
I think it's a lost ball.

152
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,320
What?

153
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,620
There is no way that it will be a lost ball.

154
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,660
After this, these two dogs will play the role of caddies.

155
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,960
What?

156
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,900
What do you mean, Captain?

157
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,660
I've already made them smell your smell.

158
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,720
so you can find the ball by relying on it.

159
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,260
I found it!

160
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,560
Thank you, One-chan.

161
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,680
One-chan, please go down a little.

162
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,240
It's difficult, but we have to get out of that gap to get to the fairway.

163
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,860
Eek!

164
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,980
Oh, dear...

165
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,960
In a place like this?

166
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,020
It's impossible to get out of here, right?

167
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,440
I'll move it a little bit.

168
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,680
Ouch, it itches!

169
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,520
Ouch, it itches!

170
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,160
What? I just cheated!

171
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,580
If you cheat, you'll be bitten!

172
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,480
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,740
I'm paying for it, so let me shoot from a distance.

174
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,980
I shot ten bullets just by getting potatoes out of the jungle.

175
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,500
All right, all right. Good job.

176
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,640
There are a lot of birds.

177
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,920
There are a lot of birds.

178
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,220
This island is called Bird Island.

179
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,420
There's a hole in the end of the meerkat.

180
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,000
Who is it from?

181
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,980
It looks like my potato.

182
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,040
All right, go!

183
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,380
Yes, sir!

184
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,120
All right.

185
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,080
All right.

186
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,440
I'll give you this ball and you can shoot his legs!

187
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,460
That's a good shot!

188
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,060
Oh, dude!

189
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,500
First, it's an vale!!

190
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:11,560
Woo-hoo!

191
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,520
Why again?

192
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,300
It must be a lost ball.

193
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,020
It can't be right!

194
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,060
Fucking golf.

195
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,660
I don't get it.

196
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,180
Hmm.

197
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,280
You must be surprised.

198
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,040
You're surprised? I'll definitely get 10 million!

199
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:42,860
Alright, now it's my turn!

200
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm going to get 10 million!

201
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,360
So that's where you're aiming for.

202
00:11:52,540 --> 00:12:01,560
Alright, I'm aiming at it!

203
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Ryo-chan is really good at this.

204
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,520
Just hurry up!

205
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,220
I failed!

206
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,440
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

207
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:18,680
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

208
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,480
That's a lot of them.

209
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,380
That was scary.

210
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,820
Thanks to the birds, it's a lot easier to shoot.

211
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,840
My ball is...

212
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,080
Huh?

213
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,700
Ah! My ball is being eaten!

214
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,100
The shape of the pit has completely changed!

215
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,080
Damn it!

216
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,640
Nice!

217
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,160
Thank you very much.

218
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,120
It's certainly easier now.

219
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,840
I managed to get into the bogey.

220
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,860
Hmph! I'm aiming for the eagle!

221
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,020
Ouch!

222
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,060
Ouch!

223
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,040
It's...

224
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,760
Ouch!

225
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,420
Oh, no!

226
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,080
What the heck! I'm a bird!

227
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,100
This is the Par 3's shortfall.

228
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,500
Hmm...

229
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,900
Hey, Tanma.

230
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,960
I'm going to go clean up, so you shoot the inside first.

231
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,200
Come on, Ryo-chan.

232
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,280
Hehehe...

233
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,180
Hehehe...

234
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,200
Hehehe...

235
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,240
Ouch!

236
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,460
Ouch!

237
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,160
This is my...

238
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,120
What was that just now?

239
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:50,920
Ah!

240
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,580
I'm not sure if I'm getting better or not,

241
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,680
but the lower part of the hole

242
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,160
is a trapping course.

243
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,060
I can feel it!

244
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,280
Just throw the ball away!

245
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,240
Super easy!

246
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,660
T-that's not it!

247
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,320
My...

248
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,560
Where?

249
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:11,660
Huh?

250
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,500
Use your head a little!

251
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,940
What do you mean?

252
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,500
You can aim from where the waves don't come.

253
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,600
This is dynamic golf!

254
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,660
Come on!

255
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,900
I did it! It's a hole-in-one!

256
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,120
Huh? Ah...

257
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,620
Ah...

258
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:39,980
Uh...

259
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,560
Ah...

260
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,000
Ah...

261
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,900
Ah...

262
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,420
Ah...

263
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:42,740
Ah...

264
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,680
Senpai!

265
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,360
Are you okay, Ryotsu?

266
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,280
Ah, damn it! What is this?

267
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,480
Ah...

268
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,880
It's really dynamic.

269
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,200
That's also the natural snow, so I can't complain.

270
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,080
Ah, sen-sen-senpai!

271
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:02,920
Huh?

272
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,660
Yeah!

273
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,500
Wow!

274
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,920
It's an ictiosaurus!

275
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,040
It's really so natural!

276
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:12,900
Yah!

277
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,480
Yah!

278
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,240
Yah!

279
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,560
Yah!

280
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,720
Is this a white rabbit from Inaba?

281
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,220
Yah!

282
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,520
Yah!

283
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:17,920
Yah!

284
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,500
Yah!

285
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,360
Yah!

286
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,160
Yah!

287
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,720
Yah!

288
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,480
Yah...

289
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:22,820
Yah...

290
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,080
Yah...

291
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,840
What a順ing life!

292
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,840
Really...

293
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,980
You did it! It's a hole-in-one!

294
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,540
You did it! It's a birdie!

295
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,820
Do your best!

296
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,540
Damn it!

297
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,600
You two have excellent athletic ability.

298
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,920
There's a better course in the second half, so I'll pull you out of the hole in the first half.

299
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,380
I'm sure that's...

300
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,640
Nice kick!

301
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,280
If I use that rock, I can get a hole in one.

302
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,280
I will also get a hole in your back!

303
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,140
Dinosaur!

304
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
T- Tyrannosaurus!

305
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,940
Begone!

306
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,840
Why did Tyrannosaurus...

307
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,780
It's not distant human form?

308
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,840
My leg!

309
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,640
Senpai, what are you doing?

310
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,820
I'm the one who gets 10 million!

311
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,320
What?

312
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,660
I'm going to eat Tyrannosaurus and give up!

313
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Yay! Another hole-in-one!

314
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,960
W-what?

315
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,640
Hey! Even though it was a hole-in-one, you bastard!

316
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,220
You bastard! Come out, you bastard!

317
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,640
All right, there you go.

318
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,000
You bastard!

319
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,380
This is of no use in the wilderness.

320
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,080
Yay!

321
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,720
Hole No. 17.

322
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,420
Ouch ouch ouch!

323
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,020
Ouch ouch ouch!

324
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,460
Idiot!

325
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,600
I'm sorry, senpai. I'm sorry.

326
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,340
I'll have to try again with the OB.

327
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,600
OB?

328
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,740
If he gets a +2 with the OB, he'll get caught up in the middle.

329
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,120
I'm not kidding.

330
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,780
Ryo-chan, you can't do it! Come back!

331
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,300
What? There's no OB in the game.

332
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,900
It's not OB. I'll shoot from below.

333
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,820
I won't let anyone get the win.

334
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,600
I'll take it.

335
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,000
The prize money...

336
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,280
is 10 million yen!

337
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,740
Oh!

338
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,620
Amazing.

339
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,940
He's got it.

340
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,660
What a terrible habit.

341
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,720
He's the kind of man who gets caught up in the money.

342
00:18:48,980 --> 00:19:02,780
I-I'll do it.

343
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,020
I'll get the prize money.

344
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,700
Next, the final hole!

345
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,520
It's finally time.

346
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,900
This surprised man, Mou San's outfit is the cup of the final hole.

347
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,640
And, by the way, this is the "super-long hole" of par 80.

348
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,700
Par 80? Stop talking nonsense.

349
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,480
It's that big of a cup, so it's easy.

350
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,080
The hole is big, though.

351
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,440
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

352
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,980
It's said that it's the fastest to climb the right route.

353
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,680
It seems like they're doing it seriously.

354
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,480
As I thought, it's impossible to climb the jungle.

355
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,120
No, you don't have to climb the jungle here.

356
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,180
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

357
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,480
Damn! I was just a little bit further!

358
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,660
It's hard to see what's ahead at the next stage.

359
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,920
Yeah, that's why he's carrying a magnet.

360
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,900
What's going on?

361
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,680
What's this?

362
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,320
It's a snake's big movement!

363
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,660
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

364
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,960
It seems like it's common in this season.

365
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,060
But it's not that bad.

366
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,380
The local staff says it's not that bad, so I'm not worried.

367
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,620
I'm going to pay the penalty and go on a trip.

368
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,200
Me too.

369
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,640
I'm going to pay the penalty and go on a trip.

370
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:40,900
They're so stupid.

371
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,220
This is the shortest route.

372
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,540
I'm going.

373
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,480
Hey, Senpai!

374
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,320
Leave me alone, you idiot.

375
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:56,060
It's in the way.

376
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,820
The ball is hard to see.

377
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,560
Okay.

378
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,520
It's about time.

379
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,940
Hey, don't get caught in the air!

380
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,540
It's hard to shoot!

381
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,460
It hurts so bad!

382
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,380
Damn!

383
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,260
Ouch!

384
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,860
I'm marvelous bitten.

385
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,360
Are you okay, Ryo-chan?

386
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,400
I've been too tired.

387
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,820
And I'm so hot.

388
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,340
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

389
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,060
The local staff might be poisonous snakes.

390
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,600
Huh?

391
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,760
Idiot.

392
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,300
I'm at my limit. I'll give up.

393
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,380
I won't give up, but I've already hit about 200.

394
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,000
But I can finally see the past.

395
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,100
I can see the past.

396
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,620
It's 76 so far.

397
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,820
If you put this in, you're an albatross.

398
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,980
Okay.

399
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Something's shaking.

400
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,560
That's the nature golf!

401
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,960
It's the final hole lift!

402
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,740
Idiot! That's not the time to say that!

403
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,760
It's dangerous!

404
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,580
Hurry up!

405
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:23,920
Let's go down!

406
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,300
Run, run!

407
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,340
This is the end!

408
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,780
Okay, clear!

409
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,220
Go!

410
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,080
I did it! I'm in the cup!

411
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,300
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

412
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,480
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

413
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,480
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

414
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,860
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

415
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,760
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

416
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,040
Senior, are you okay?

417
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,580
Don't worry.

418
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,160
He's stronger than a cockroach.

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,740

420

To be continued

424
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,240
I really got in the cup just before the lava came out.

425
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,280
To be continued

426
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,760
I really got in the cup just before the lava came out.

427
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,480
But no one has seen it.

428
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,480
Senior, unfortunately, it means there's no winner.

429
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,200
I really got in the cup just before the lava came out.

430
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,740
That's 10 million yen!

431
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,460
I bet you'll play the nature golf

432
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,880
next month at the golf course

433
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,080
in the next golf course in the next month!

434
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:38,960
What?

435
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,840
Even if they don't tell us the nature?

436
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,300
Heads and heels.

437
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,080

His sister Eve is going to Africa.

484
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,700
Honda, be strong.

485
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,400
It can't be helped if you're with your brother.

486
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,180
It's impossible to stand between that ugly father and Eve.

487
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,400
Next time, the Honda family.

488
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,560
Thank you.

489

Next time, the Honda family.
