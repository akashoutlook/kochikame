1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:04,860
"The End"

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,680
"The End"

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,880
When you watch TV

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,760
Make the room bright and try to get away

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,220
It's like someone is calling

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,420
After the rain

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,780
I walked back and forth

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,160
"Mom, please lend me your hand"

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,120
At that time I felt

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,440
A strange feeling

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,340
So I tried to walk

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,200
Only in black

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,220
Everyone was a child once

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,340
But

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,940
Everyone forgets

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,240
Politicians with a big face

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,740
And a blue aunt above their eyes

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,320
Turn around

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,180
That corner

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,800
You can meet everyone

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,080
There is a turtle

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,540
There must be a turtle

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,980
There must be a turtle

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,260
Come on, Come on, Come on

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,540
Everyone come to our town

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,020
to our town

27
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,100
Thank you very much

28
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,420
Thank you very much

29
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,100
Thank you very much

30
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,920
Luke

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,800
Thank you very much

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:38,980
Thank you very much

33
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:47,900
Thank you very much

34
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:56,540
Thank you very much

35
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,840
I can't find it.

36
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,000
I was robbed here.

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,800
Isn't this a serial robbery?

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,420
But the police will be robbed?

39
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:06,780
Right?

40
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,100
So it's an internal crime?

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:09,840
What?

42
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,360
The culprit may have left a clue.

43
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,580
What do you think?

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,920
Hey, what is this?

45
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,120
What is this?

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,420
A huge robbery! Ryochi vs. Crows

47
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,420
Huh? This is strange.

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,500
Hey, Reiko.

49
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,580
You didn't clean up the desk without my permission, did you?

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,560
I didn't.

51
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,060
What happened?

52
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,920
There's not enough parts here.

53
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,340
What?

54
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,160
We promised to deliver the finished product to the company in time.

55
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,460
Why don't you buy the same plastic model

56
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,920
and use that part?

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,440
This is my original plastic model.

58
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,900
I only have one piece of each.

59
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,840
If I lose it, the Crows will be a bubble of water.

60
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,900
Isn't that part this?

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,660
This is it.

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,100
I'm done.

63
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,980
I knew it.

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,180
Everyone's here. What's wrong?

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,460
Ryochi Kankichi is a thug!

66
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:20,960
If you're a thug, why hit him?

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,800
W-What?

68
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,280
HUGGYYyyy!

69
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,860
Don't fool around.

70
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,100
You know how I've always told you not to mess with my dunno.

71
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,860
You know what I'm gonna do, don't you?

72
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,020
I told you so!

73
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,940
It's your problem instead.

74
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,880
You can't make money just by stealing our things.

75
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,400
Yes, I can.

76
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,920
That's not only a charity thing.

77
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,700
I guess it's for Mother's sake.

78
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,760
Then, why is there only one Plum item in this world that has fallen into the

79
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,600
unauthorized locker room?

80
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,440
I don't know.

81
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,020
I just want to hear it.

82
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,800
Be quiet!

83
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,520
Anyway, it's not me!

84
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,380
How about proving your alibi?

85
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,240
Senpai.

86
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,940
That's right.

87
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,840
Well, I went to Shimatsu-shoda City, Katsushika-shou in the morning and ...

88
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,840
My ring was stolen in the morning.

89
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,900
After all.

90
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,880
I don't remember going to a

91
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,840
unauthorized locker room.

92
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,840
That's right.

93
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,980
Even if it's Ryo-chan, that's the case.

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,880
What's wrong?

95
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,940
There's no earring that should have been left here.

96
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,880
Don't look at me!

97
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,780
I don't know!

98
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,940
Huh?

99
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,220
The wristwatch I left here is gone.

100
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,800
So don't look at me!

101
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,600
The corner cigarette shop is gone.

102
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,360
How do you steal that?

103
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,880
I don't know.

104
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,740
Hit me.

105
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,460
Hey!

106
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,020
I'm playing games with you!

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,160
Hey!

108
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,960
You're kidding me, aren't you!

109
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,160
You arrested 5 people, and it's reallyå°– tied up, you two!

110
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,660
It's all white mods.

111
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm going to tighten my sanitary gloves!

112
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,380
It's better if you indicate that you recognize your rights before you feel it!

113
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,880
Shut it!

114
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,640
Is this so?

115
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,380
When this is over, I'll find the real culprit and prove that I have no alibi!

116
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,520
This is for everyone!

117
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,220
Well, I'm going to to the toilet and take a shit.

118
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,240
g g g g.

119
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,860
I'm going to to the toilet and take a shit.

120
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,720
Wow! It's a genius!

121
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,900
It's a genius!

122
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,560
So this is the only way to get in from the outside.

123
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,760
Now even a kid's head won't fit in here.

124
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,680
It's impossible to get in through the outside.

125
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,500
Komachi, what's with him?

126
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,860
He's just being chased around and making fun of us.

127
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,500
There's nothing in the room that looks like the culprit's belongings.

128
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,040
So it's a crime against the inside.

129
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,040
Now it's time for you to investigate the whole family!

130
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,060
What?

131
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,400
Why are we being investigated?

132
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,320
We're the ones who are investigating!

133
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,440
Shut up!

134
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,340
You've been calling us the To-Dai Motokurashi for a long time.

135
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,880
But before you start questioning me,

136
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,040
first prove your innocence!

137
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,380
What?

138
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,660
I'll tell you what,

139
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,460
if you're not cooperative enough with the investigation,

140
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,040
you won't be able to see through this.

141
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,620
Fine.

142
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,740
At this rate, I'll make sure it's all clear.

143
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,060
First, we'll thoroughly investigate

144
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,780
the people who came into the locker room from yesterday to today.

145
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,860
We went to the bathroom at 9:25,

146
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,880
and went back to the locker room at 9:45.

147
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,820
Right.

148
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,460
It's too long.

149
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,400
What were you doing in the bathroom for 20 minutes?

150
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,460
That has nothing to do with it!

151
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,900
You went to the locker room alone at 9:28,

152
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,320
why?

153
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,640
That's because...

154
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
You were in a locker room with no one in it,

155
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,640
and you were doing things that no one could say.

156
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,680
Because the stockings were electric,

157
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,760
I went back to the store.

158
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,960
You're a crazy guy.

159
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,860
The stockings were electric.

160
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,020
That's terrible!

161
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,380
Scumbag!

162
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,880
You're a pervert!

163
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,900
All the alibis have been proven,

164
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,120
but what about the culprit?

165
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,540
What?

166
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,200
Oh, you found the culprit, Detective Me.

167
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,840
It's our turn next.

168
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,860
You also called the guard?

169
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,680
I have a paper for you.

170
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,100
I'm not the culprit!

171
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,800
Ryo-san!

172
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:40,620
Chief!

173
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,080
Actually, it's not just the book,

174
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,020
but the public housing department, too.

175
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,480
I know that there are a lot of

176
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,780
metal theft victims in the neighborhood.

177
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,860
So I'm going to investigate it in earnest.

178
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,820
Even the chief

179
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,100
doesn't suspect me, does he?

180
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,560
I don't want to doubt it either.

181
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,080
I don't want to doubt it, but...

182
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,920
You're suspicious enough!

183
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,460
You're lying, aren't you?

184
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,720
If you're a lie detector, you'll know everything.

185
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,720
You have to answer all the questions with a "no."

186
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,900
Do you understand?

187
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,900
Why am I so annoying?

188
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,700
I'm asking if you understand.

189
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,860
I understand.

190
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,320
Then,

191
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,240
I've sneaked into your locker room.

192
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,500
No way.

193
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,640
I don't object.

194
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,620
What?

195
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,520
What?

196
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:34,520
That's terrible!

197
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,440
I'm the one who stole the metal.

198
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,580
you're the one who stole the metal.

199
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,140
No,

200
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
I don't object.

201
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,400
You're lying!

202
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
You're lying!

203
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,980
You're lying!

204
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,520
You're lying!

205
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,180
What?

206
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,900
Now you understand, right?

207
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,200
The machine is broken, isn't it?

208
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,360
I used the coffee machine.

209
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,540
What?

210
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,420
No,

211
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,320
I objected.

212
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,340
See?

213
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,020
It's not broken.

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,900
That's right.

215
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,080
That's strange.

216
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,120
Stop it!

217
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,160
Stop it!

218
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,700
Stop it!

219
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,040
You're so annoying.

220
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,600
Who is the culprit?

221
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,300
Hmm...

222
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,820
The escape case is all in the time of the empty time when Fukie left the locker room.

223
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,860
Hmm?

224
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,020
Hmm?

225
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,440
Ah!

226
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,140
Damn!

227
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,160
Damn it!

228
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,340
Shit!

229
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,380
Damn it.

230
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,160
He tried to do a lot of hard work.

231
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,640
You do all of them.

232
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,520
Damn it!

233
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,860
Damn it!

234
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,400
Move.

235
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,760
Damn it!

236
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,320
This is the last straw Hat!

237
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,080
It has Ñ‚Ð¾Ð»ÑŒÐºÐ¾ none left, but I have another, you fool!

238
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,340
That's all.

239
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,920
What a waste of time!

240
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,640
It has only made ashire!

241
00:09:59,640 --> 00:09:59,660
That's all!

242
00:09:59,660 --> 00:09:59,820
Now it's yours, you fool.

243
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:00,500
You crow!

244
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,180
My ring!

245
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,580
My necklace!

246
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,140
My key-holder!

247
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,580
My...

248
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,080
What is this?

249
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,160
You still don't get it?

250
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,760
So the owner of this nest is the culprit of the serial robbery case.

251
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,840
The culprit was a crow!

252
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,680
A crow!

253
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,980
A crow?

254
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,980
It's been widely reported in the news.

255
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,380
Crows have the habit of collecting rare things such as light.

256
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,900
So I stole a pair of plums from my desk.

257
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,880
If you think I've been to your locker room, I'll explain everything.

258
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,600
So you're saying all of them stole them?

259
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,980
That's right.

260
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,280
You're doubting me so much!

261
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,020
You're doubting me because you're always the same!

262
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,920
That's right. It's my fault!

263
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,200
You're calling me a criminal.

264
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,360
You're going to be punished for what you did to me!

265
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,720
Why did you do that?

266
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,580
What are you talking about?

267
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,360
The culprit of the serial robbery case is a crow!

268
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,640
What? A crow?

269
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,920
Look! Look!

270
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,620
Look!

271
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,860
There's even this one!

272
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,640
It looks like it's in line with the defense range of someone.

273
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,320
What? What's with that look?

274
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,040
You're blaming the crow for what you did, aren't you?

275
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,820
You're making a big deal out of it!

276
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,040
Is that so, Ryotsu?

277
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm not that kind of person. I'm aiming for the cash first!

278
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,980
That's true.

279
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,680
No one was robbed, right?

280
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,940
So the culprit was the crow!

281
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm convinced.

282
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,760
You're doubting me so much, Chief!

283
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,320
You even used a lie detector.

284
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm sorry. I was a police officer. I'm sorry.

285
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,320
But it was a quick solution.

286
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,820
What's a quick solution?

287
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,240
Ohara, you're in trouble!

288
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,220
The doll you got from the chief is broken.

289
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,060
It's a big deal.

290
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,000
I forgot. My radio was stuck in the window.

291
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,980
I broke it.

292
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,600
If it's your job, you should be ashamed.

293
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,580
If I were to be honest, I wouldn't forgive you.

294
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,160
I'm not going to do anything to you.

295
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,180
If you're going to keep quiet like this,

296
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,000
you need to investigate it thoroughly,

297
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,820
find the culprit,

298
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,340
and get rid of him.

299
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,480
I ran away in a hurry.

300
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,720
There might still be parts of the radio-controlled helicopter on the scene.

301
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,100
I should confess to the police now.

302
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,920
Chief, that doll...

303
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,780
Chief, this could be the crow's doing.

304
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:54,680
Crow?

305
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes.

306
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,780
Actually, there have been many domestic injuries caused by crows in the area recently.

307
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,360
That's right! The culprit is a crow!

308
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,080
I saw it with my own eyes.

309
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,000
Crows that kick and run away with a strong doll!

310
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,400
Is that true?

311
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,300
Yes.

312
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,740
It seems to be exactly what I was looking at, chief.

313
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,720
As expected of the chief, you're a master!

314
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
It can't be helped that it's the crow's doing.

315
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,260
Crow, you're a suspicious return.

316
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,220
W-Who's the provider of the misdemeanor of the spirit medium here?

317
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,260
Crow, I hope?

318
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,180
Hey, Ryo. You're late.

319
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,560
It's a crow! A crow!

320
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,880
It's a crow?

321
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
When I was leaving the town,

322
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,940
the crow attacked me and it ran around.

323
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,140
That's why it came back late.

324
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,580
Do you still suspect me?

325
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,320
It's not like that.

326
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,940
It seems that crows can remember people's faces.

327
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,160
So, you should be careful.

328
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,060
This is convenient.

329
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,940
My bed!

330
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,740
A while ago, a crow sent him to the east sky.

331
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,240
But, it's using chopsticks.

332
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,200
Crows have a good head like a stone man.

333
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,800
Crows have a good head like a stone man.

334
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,860
This is strange.

335
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,720
The number of phone calls this month is so high.

336
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,040
It's a crow.

337
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,180
What's wrong with this?

338
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,540
It's a crow.

339
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,240
A dango is here.

340
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,480
It's a crow.

341
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,620
Who is it?

342
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,200
Our window is full of crows.

343
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,160
It's a crow.

344
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,500
It's a crow.

345
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,360
Ryo said that it's all because of crows.

346
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,420
What do you think?

347
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,960
I told my senior to take off his clothes.

348
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,260
So, I can't say anything strong.

349
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,120
But...

350
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,880
That crow is always staying there.

351
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,440
I think he has something to say to Ryo.

352
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,680
This is bad.

353
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,100
Everyone's starting to suspect me.

354
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,620
I have to investigate this.

355
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,720
The meeting room is under fire!

356
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,940
What's this?

357
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,080
How horrible!

358
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,460
What's this?

359
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,660
Check this footprint.

360
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,320
And this black wing.

361
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,660
It's a crow's wing.

362
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,580
We can't just check it.

363
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,640
It's all a crow's doing.

364
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,360
But can we make the crows move to such a heavy cage?

365
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,880
Certainly.

366
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,360
Have you ever seen crows up close?

367
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,380
They are so big!

368
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,680
But this footprint is very unnatural.

369
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,760
It's like a stamp.

370
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,700
That's the plan of the crows!

371
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,620
You don't know that they are doing it on purpose?

372
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,800
Ah! There is a surveillance camera in that place!

373
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,100
Was there such a thing?

374
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,780
Let's play it again.

375
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,200
Oh! A crows is on the screen.

376
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,700
Then the culprit is a crows.

377
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,460
This is the proof that it doesn't move.

378
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,560
There is no doubt about it.

379
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,580
But this crows...

380
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,180
It moves strangely.

381
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Yes. It's as stiff as a white bird.

382
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,540
That's the plan of the crows.

383
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,960
They are doing it on purpose.

384
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,120
They are the brainwaves who are hiding us.

385
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,040
You can't fool us!

386
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,120
Ah! Ah! Ah!

387
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,280
Ah! Ah! Ah!

388
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:42,760
Ah! Ah! Ah!

389
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,700
Ah! Ah! Ah!

390
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,520
Damn it!

391
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:05,580
Ah!

392
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:05,620
Ah!

393
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:05,660
Ah!

394
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:05,720
Ah!

395
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,200
Ah!

396
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,060
Ah!

397
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,640
"A spreakeple leadership"

398
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,360
"Hai! This is nothing but anåƒ¹."

399
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,800
"Hai! This is nothing but anåƒ¹!!"

400
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,760
Huh?

401
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,620
There's my underwear!

402
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,200
They're twins!

403
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,640
They're twins!

404
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,580
It's a trap.

405
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,280
I'll listen to the order, so don't push it.

406
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
All of them?

407
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,640
Yes.

408
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,740
All the underwear I had been keeping was stolen.

409
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,520
I also bought something, but it was the worst.

410
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,440
My bra was also stolen.

411
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,060
It's a very familiar underwear thief's crime of not seeing the culprit alone.

412
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,660
I don't think it's a German criminal.

413
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,100
There are too many victims.

414
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,300
It's impossible to do it alone.

415
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,380
It's difficult to operate if there's no clue.

416
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,300
Um, this was dropped at the store.

417
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,520
Are you a monster?

418
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,140
The culprit likes to fight.

419
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,640
I picked it up on the balcony, too.

420
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,660
This is a pachinko ball, right?

421
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,820
I also picked it up at the store.

422
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,060
Isn't this a pier?

423
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,340
Senpai, don't you have something similar?

424
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,920
Oh, it's a limited edition of premium.

425
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,400
Of course I have it.

426
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,580
The culprit likes pachinko figures.

427
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,440
There's another person like that here.

428
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,700
Hey, you're doubting me again?

429
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,640
There are a lot of other people like that.

430
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,640
I told you earlier that the culprit wasn't alone.

431
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,420
I'm sorry.

432
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,960
What is this mess?

433
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,040
It's a underwear thief.

434
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,020
Underwear thief?

435
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,440
All of these people were stolen?

436
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,480
Yes.

437
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,700
It seems that they were damaged in this area.

438
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,200
What?

439
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,040
Chief.

440
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,160
They call me underwear thief again.

441
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,340
Did you do it?

442
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,420
What's wrong with the chief?

443
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,620
I'm not doing it.

444
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,260
If you doubt me,

445
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,300
please check the locker until you feel like it.

446
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,160
Okay?

447
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,160
Come on.

448
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,780
What?

449
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,400
What?

450
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,280
What?

451
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,700
Well, where is it?

452
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,360
What's wrong?

453
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,100
Why is my locker broken?

454
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,080
It's broken.

455
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,480
It's broken.

456
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:39,620
It's a uniform.

457
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,860
No, it's not me.

458
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:45,960
It's me.

459
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,420
It's someone's conspiracy.

460
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,460
It's a conspiracy.

461
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,980
It's him.

462
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,720
Listen, everyone.

463
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,300
It's a crow.

464
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,520
This is a crow! This is all a crow's plot!

465
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,740
Ryo, you're still saying such things?

466
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,380
Because crows are...

467
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,260
Whatever you do, you're always pushing crows, crows, crows, crows...

468
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,900
I can't believe you're such a scum!

469
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,940
Because crows are...

470
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,060
You're not allowed to come back until the punishment is decided!

471
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,300
I'll make you pay!

472
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,540
Damn it! That damn crow!

473
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,980
I can't stand it anymore!

474
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,680
In this case, I'll have to face that damn crow!

475
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,120
Honda! Balboa! Shuga!

476
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,880
That's the guy...

477
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,040
Tohoku!

478
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,280
I finally got rid of the crow!

479
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,020
Is that the frowning you made on Senpai?

480
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,380
Yeah, I can't forget that face of his.

481
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,460
He's sleeping soundly.

482
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,420
I'll wake him up!

483
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,540
Fire!

484
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,340
I-I-I-I can't move, Senpai!

485
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,280
That's the only way, don't move!

486
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,040
I-I-I-I-I-I can't look, Ryo!

487
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,540
What the hell did I just see?

488
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,020
We got to go now!

489
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,540
Hm.

490
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,300
But what should I do?

491
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,840
Take this, Ryo!

492
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,340
And this!

493
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,320
And this!

494
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,500
The lights are broken!

495
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,140
What's this road?

496
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,300
I'll kill you!

497
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,760
Ouch!

498
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,820
Senpai!

499
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,100
You're dead!

500
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm scared!

501
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,900
Please change the car.

502
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,320
What?

503
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,620
I'm talking about the handle!

504
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,040
What?

505
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,580
What are you going to do, Porpo?

506
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,880
I'll take you all down!

507
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,760
You should be more careful!

508
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,420
Damn it!

509
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,780
Take this!

510
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,220
What?

511
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:42,840
Ouch!

512
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,160
They're even more fat!

513
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,000
And the number of cars is increasing!

514
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,820
We have to run!

515
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,580
Let's go, Honda!

516
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,080
I don't want to!

517
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,960
I'm glad the crows didn't mess up the garbage.

518
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,900
Yeah.

519
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,980
It's not just Tokyo.

520
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,340
Crows are everywhere.

521
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,340
They're all over the place.

522
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,800
Where are they?

523
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,980
Did they move out of the forest?

524
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,640
I don't think they're here.

525
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,860
Where are they?

526
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,320
I don't know.

527
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,760
They're not here.

528
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,020
Ouch!

529
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,840
Ouch!

530
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,660
Ouch!

531
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,060
Ouch!

532
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,380
Stretch!

533
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:44,920
Ouch!

534
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,820
Ouch!

535
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,320
Ouch!

536
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,800
Ouch!

537
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:48,820
Ouch!

538
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:48,880
Ouch!

539
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,900
Such terrifying violence!

540
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,980
Ouch!

541
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,780
Ouch!

542
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:53,940
Ouch!

543
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,240
Ouch!

544
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,740
Ouch!

545
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,940
Ouch!

546
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,780
â™ª When I brush my eyebrows, I'll dash to the station â™ª

547
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:18,780
â™ª On the main train, I'll sleep on my dad's back â™ª

548
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,540
â™ª This week too, I'll do my best, even if it's not enough â™ª

549
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,940
â™ª I'm putting my bucket in one hand â™ª

550
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,500
â™ª But the beef bowl is so warm â™ª

551
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,400
â™ª I hate the annoying work-to-work routine â™ª

552
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,860
â™ª But I'll get through it easily â™ª

553
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,280
â™ª No problem every day â™ª

554
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,820
â™ª When I pass by the hot shower â™ª

555
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,740
â™ª No problem every day â™ª

556
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,160
â™ª I get well in the sleeping pillow â™ª

557
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,500
â™ª No problem every day â™ª

558
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,820
