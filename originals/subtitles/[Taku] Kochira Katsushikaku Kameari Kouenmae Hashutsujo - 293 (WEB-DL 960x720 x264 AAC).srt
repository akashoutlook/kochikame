1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,080
Back to the Future

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,240
Whenever you're watching the television,

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,880
brighten up your room and try looking far away!

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:23,720
sostilely And those who have no money, come to my place

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,220
Come on!

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,120
I'm not here, but I'm worried

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,700
Look at the blue sky

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,860
White clouds

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,460
It will be alright

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,240
If you don't have a job, come to me

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,460
I'm not here, but I'm worried

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,340
Look at the burning red clouds

13
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,960
It will be alright

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:23,360
I know, I know, I know

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,700
I know, I know, I know

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,140
If you know, then come to me silently!

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,220
Ryo's Love Proclamation

18
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,500
Huh?

19
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,780
You have even written in one screw

20
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:51,900
Yeah

21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,460
It's my radio

22
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,100
I'm trying to make a radio

23
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,600
I'm trying to make a radio

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,000
Ah, good morning, chief

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,940
Good morning

26
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,840
Good morning

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:00,960
Good morning

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,240
Ryo!

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,560
Ah, ah, ah!

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,600
Chief!

31
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,760
Please don't shout suddenly

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,280
What are you doing, Sensha?

33
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,800
I've been making it since yesterday

34
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,220
It's worse to make something like that while you're working!

35
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,760
More importantly, this

36
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,160
What is this?

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,940
This is a photo of our meeting

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,280
Eh?

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,480
I'm not interested in marriage at all

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,420
Shut up!

41
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,740
A man like you should have a wife!

42
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,240
Thank you very much

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,200
I've collected it from my relatives and neighbors

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,000
Just look at it!

45
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,560
You're so persistent

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,020
Did you forget the time when I met you at the chief's recommendation a few years ago?

47
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,180
Huh?

48
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,800
You took me to the meeting forcefully without showing me the photo of our meeting

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,120
You took me to the meeting forcefully without showing me the photo of our meeting

50
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,140
You took me to the meeting forcefully without showing me the photo of our meeting

51
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,380
Do you want to take one with me?

52
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,520
Thank you for waiting

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,500
Thank you for waiting

54
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,260
Let's go

55
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,420
Let's go

56
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,520
Nice to meet you

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,120
This is Ryo. I'm important chief

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,520
Th..Thank you

59
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,920
Then I'll introduce you to my mother

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,900
It's Yasuyo Takahashi

61
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,640
Nice to meet you

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,900
I'm Yoshie, your daughter

63
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,480
I'm Yuka, your grandson

64
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,380
Hello

65
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,560
Hello

66
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,360
Hello. You're a cute young lady.

67
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,180
Boss, you're not a child.

68
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,360
Don't be so courteous.

69
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,880
I'm just grateful that you like me.

70
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,860
More importantly, you're a pretty girl.

71
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,720
That's right.

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,060
You don't seem to be a good girl.

73
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,680
Well, we'll leave it at that.

74
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,800
Now it's time for the other two to leave.

75
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,000
That's right.

76
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,520
Well, take care, Mother.

77
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,300
Yes.

78
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,880
Yuka, let's go.

79
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,800
Yes.

80
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,420
Well, you're the one who's going to be the bride's husband.

81
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
No, I don't want to.

82
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,780
I have a husband.

83
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,800
Then the one who's going to be the bride's husband is...

84
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,200
Jozo!

85
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,360
Boss!

86
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,100
You're laughing, aren't you?

87
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,460
Don't look into the other person's affairs,

88
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,240
and try to be the one who's going to be the bride's husband.

89
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,640
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,880
That's the boss's fault, after all.

91
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,980
I'm really sorry about that time.

92
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,080
I heard that there was only one daughter who was separated from her husband at the age of three,

93
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,260
so I thought that the daughter was young.

94
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,920
My pure heart is fluttering.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
I don't want to think about that again.

96
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,440
I'll return this.

97
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,640
After that meeting, I remembered that I was paid 30,000 yen for a sushi restaurant that was so poisonous to me.

98
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,860
And I remembered that my husband was the one who was going to be the bride's husband.

99
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,540
Did something like that happen?

100
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,480
Shut up!

101
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,340
Anyway, choose one of us and see each other.

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,860
This is an order.

103
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,960
Got it?

104
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,840
Boss!

105
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,400
Don't be a joke.

106
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,180
Who's going to see each other?

107
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,340
Ryo-chan!

108
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,740
The boss is also worried about Ryo-chan, so he's going to see you.

109
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,280
What happened?

110
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,660
Look at this!

111
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,820
What?

112
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,680
What?

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,260
She's so beautiful.

114
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,240
Ryo-chan, take a look.

115
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,540
I didn't expect the boss to bring such a beautiful girl to me.

116
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,680
Ryo-chan, you should definitely meet her.

117
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,200
Really?

118
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,300
Ryo-chan accepted the meeting.

119
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,800
That's good.

120
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,800
But...

121
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,100
Did something happen?

122
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,920
This girl...

123
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,480
Oh, I knew it.

124
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,340
What do you mean, "I knew it"?

125
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,240
Ryo-chan must have thought that she would choose Yoshinaga-san's daughter.

126
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,080
Was she your acquaintance?

127
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,080
Yes.

128
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,880
She often shows up at the flower fair.

129
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,120
She's a very nice girl with a low level of wealth.

130
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,180
That's true, but...

131
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,900
I think it's too much for Ryo-chan.

132
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,580
Is that so?

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,040
I think it suits her.

134
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Hmm...

135
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,640
Ryo-chan's name is on your name card.

136
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,940
She's been dreaming about you for years.

137
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,860
I'm sure you'll be able to get her.

138
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,700
Hmm...

139
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,080
Ah, but I don't think I can.

140
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,380
I'm the head of the Ryo-tsu Kan-kichi Police Station.

141
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,500
Nice to meet you.

142
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,040
I'm Makoto-san.

143
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,420
I'm Yoshinaga Makoto.

144
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm from Futsutsuka, but I'm looking forward to working with you.

145
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,540
I'm looking forward to working with you, too.

146
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,380
Makoto-san, let's stop the formalities here and let's just get to work.

147
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Yes, madam.

148
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,020
I didn't know that Japanese clothes would look so good on you.

149
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,380
Huh?

150
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,840
Uh, um, I don't think that old lady over there is the one you're looking for, right?

151
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,940
Ryo-tsu, that's not true.

152
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,540
But the head of the police station has a good wife who's the right one for you.

153
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,180
Hehehe.

154
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,520
When I was a baby, I was a nanny.

155
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,600
She helped me with the housework.

156
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,220
Ah, thank you.

157
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,140
Ryo-tsu-san, the police station is a wonderful job that protects the peace of the city and our safe lives.

158
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,600
Ah, yes.

159
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,860
M-Makoto-san.

160
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,380
Yes?

161
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,220
What's your hobby?

162
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,360
I'm a music director.

163
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,800
So you're a classical musician?

164
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,560
Yes, I love Mozart.

165
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,440
Oh, is that so?

166
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,820
M-M-Mozart, huh?

167
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,080
Ryo-tsu-san, are you interested in Mozart, too?

168
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,280
No, I just like Mozart's "Katsusandu" at the coffee shop.

169
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,540
Ah, I see.

170
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,580
Ah, no, thank you.

171
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,220
What's your hobby, Ryo-tsu-san?

172
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,620
Uh, well, I like horses.

173
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,300
Horses?

174
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,720
I love horses, too, and I often go on them.

175
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,640
Are you British? Or Western?

176
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,920
I'm from the middle of the country.

177
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,960
I'm from the middle of the country.

178
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,500
I go to the head of the army, but I'm usually a British.

179
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,040
Is that a track and field?

180
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,500
Oh, no, I'm not.

181
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,520
Ryo-tsu-san, you're a humorous person, aren't you?

182
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
No, thank you.

183
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,680
You look like you're having a lot of fun.

184
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,660
Yeah.

185
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,720
Okay, come here.

186
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,980
Wow, so many people are gathering.

187
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,440
Ryo-tsu-san, you're amazing.

188
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,640
Yeah, my relatives often feed me at the pond in the sushi restaurant.

189
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,840
Unfortunately, I don't have any food.

190
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:49,860
Ouch!

191
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,580
Hey, your kimono is going to get wet.

192
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,420
Ryo-tsu-san!

193
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,920
That idiot!

194
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,280
Oh, no, he's a fun person.

195
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,760
Ryo-tsu-san, are you okay?

196
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,900
Ryo-tsu-san!

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,280
Ryo-tsu-san, are you okay?

198
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,400
Oh, my kimono is getting wet.

199
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,280
I don't care about your kimono.

200
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,600
Come on, hurry up.

201
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,640
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,880
This is no good.

203
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,020
It's your turn.

204
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,120
Oof, idiot.

205
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,740
Ryo-tsu-san, how was it?

206
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,080
Huh?

207
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,320
We have a marriage proposal.

208
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,080
Oh, I see, you had a nice girl.

209
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,200
Oh, Ryo-tsu-san, you're so cute!

210
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,740
You said that you were having a marriage proposal!

211
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,040
I was.

212
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,460
I feel like your face never fits?

213
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,460
You can't have a girl who likes a gorilla man doing like this.

214
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,600
Shut up, leave it to me.

215
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,880
Ryo-tsu-san!

216
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,260
What?

217
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,340
It's terrible!

218
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,040
What's wrong, Chief? You're in such a hurry.

219
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,060
Did you get a million yen?

220
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,900
More than that happened.

221
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,100
No way! 100,000, no, a million yen?

222
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,240
You idiot! No, I can't believe it.

223
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,060
I got a message that Makoto likes you and wants to go out with you.

224
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,020
What?

225
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,680
This is a dream, isn't it?

226
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,620
Honda, pinch my cheek as hard as you can.

227
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,720
What?

228
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,020
What?

229
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,940
Then...

230
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,180
Ouch!

231
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,480
Hey, what's wrong with you?

232
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,240
Senior, you're terrible.

233
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,460
You're the one who always said that.

234
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,460
What?

235
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,040
Then, is it possible that...

236
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,580
It's not a dream. It seems that Makoto really likes you.

237
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,980
No way!

238
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,880
All right!

239
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,000
The End

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,660
As expected, those who understand my value can understand it.

241
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,220
Someone who likes Ryochi and Kankichi is definitely a volunteer or a person who likes them.

242
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Well, maybe a gorilla girl more than Ryochi and Kankichi.

243
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,040
What's that?

244
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,600
You don't have to say bad things about me, but don't tell Makoto's bad words.

245
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,720
I'll do it.

246
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,240
Don't be violent.

247
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,120
Let go of me, Chief.

248
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,600
Calm down!

249
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,900
You see, compared to you, Makoto-san is just like Tsuki and Spon, no, Bob Sapp and Benjono Mop!

250
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,920
B-Benjono?

251
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,900
Mop?

252
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,060
I said it again!

253
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,260
I don't want you, the number one man who doesn't want to marry for 20 years in a row, to say that!

254
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,840
What did you say?

255
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,700
Makoto-san is a gentle, wonderful woman who's as kind as Yamato Nadeshiko!

256
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,400
Hey, stop it!

257
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,640
Excuse me while we're in the middle of recording.

258
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,460
Ah, Makoto-san!

259
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,500
Hello!

260
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,420
Hello!

261
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,840
You surprised me.

262
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,260
L-Lies!

263
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,560
T-This is definitely a nightmare!

264
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,700
Ouch!

265
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,420
Why isn't it a dream?

266
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,100
That's why I said you guys are both Sapp and Mop!

267
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,160
You're the same age as us!

268
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,000
You have such a great style!

269
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,380
Hey, Jiro!

270
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,120
Don't look at me like that!

271
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:29,980
How rude!

272
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,600
Makoto-san, what's up today?

273
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,740
I thought I'd be a little bit rude, but I brought a lunch box for you.

274
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,760
Really?

275
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,840
Would you like to eat it?

276
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm so happy!

277
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,900
I'll eat it!

278
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,740
Wow, that looks delicious!

279
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,000
Right, Senpai?

280
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,200
Y-Yeah.

281
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,980
Here you go, please eat.

282
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,000
Y-Yes.

283
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,620
Thank you.

284
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,440
Itadakimasu!

285
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,400
It's delicious!

286
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,240
This saltiness of the tapioca is the best, Makoto-san!

287
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,280
I'm so glad you're happy!

288
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,920
You guys should try it!

289
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,860
Itadakimasu!

290
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,200
Yum, it's delicious!

291
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,240
It really is.

292
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,180
It's like a restaurant dish!

293
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,640
It's like a restaurant dish!

294
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,780
You don't cook, you just eat lunch boxes at the convenience store.

295
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,400
You're different from some girls.

296
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,340
What?

297
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,840
It's really like a restaurant dish.

298
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,320
Yeah, yeah.

299
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,780
It's just that you just put it in a box.

300
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,420
That's absolutely not true!

301
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,400
The young lady has been working hard for the master since early in the morning.

302
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,540
She's been working hard for the master since early in the morning.

303
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,780
This bar shop is swear by the gods that it's true.

304
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,240
Yes, ma'am.

305
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,100
Yes, ma'am.

306
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,380
Ryo-sama!

307
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,760
Maria!

308
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,040
Ryo-sama!

309
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,640
I heard from Meiko-san!

310
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,800
She can't believe that she can have a date while she knows I'm such a jerk!

311
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,900
It hurts!

312
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,320
Please turn into a girl!

313
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,020
Ryo-san?

314
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,180
Are you okay?

315
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,900
I'm fine.

316
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,360
Who is this?

317
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,640
This woman is so used to my Ryo-sama!

318
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,620
Maria-chan!

319
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,520
This is the date for Ryo-tsu Kan Kishi.

320
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:23,860
...is my match.

321
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,940
What did you say?!

322
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,460
Wait a minute!

323
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,720
Ryo and I spent the night together in Ryo-sama's room!

324
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,220
What?!

325
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,920
Is there such a woman?!

326
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,320
Ms. Makoto, you're misunderstanding!

327
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,680
Maria is...

328
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,080
...a woman.

329
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,940
Is that so?

330
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,840
What's with that laugh?!

331
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,400
I won't forgive you!

332
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,140
M-Maria-chan...

333
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,200
I-I'm sorry! I'm a 5th grade Aikido student!

334
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,260
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

335
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,880
I-I lost...

336
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,860
Maria-chan, what's with that Yamato-nadeshiko?!

337
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,860
She's better than us!

338
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,460
I'll give you back your words, but...

339
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,440
...I just became a teacher for you.

340
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm so sorry, Ms. Makoto.

341
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,160
You're a master of the Ikebana, Sado, Nichibu, and Okoto.

342
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
R-Really?

343
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,220
Yes.

344
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,580
From my point of view, you're a lady who can't stand the heat.

345
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,080
Excuse me.

346
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,480
I'll show you.

347
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,160
I'll show you.

348
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,160
I'll show you.

349
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,660
I don't have any feelings for Sado, so I'll drink to my heart's content.

350
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,320
Please enjoy without being offended.

351
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,020
Oh? I thought it was something more sour.

352
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,760
It's surprisingly good.

353
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,460
Reiko, would you like to try it?

354
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,960
Y-Yes.

355
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,260
Please enjoy.

356
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,240
I'll take it.

357
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,240
I'll take it.

358
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,680
I'll take it.

359
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,020
Komachi, Naoko.

360
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,400
I'm still hungry.

361
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:53,700
Are you going to say something bad about Ms. Makoto?

362
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,820
It seems that you've noticed your mistake.

363
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,460
Reiko, listen to me.

364
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,980
What's wrong?

365
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,400
You were taking a break from your work earlier.

366
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,700
Naoko!

367
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,260
Ryo Tsukankichi!

368
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Good job.

369
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,080
I'm sorry for the other day.

370
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,380
I'm sorry for the other day.

371
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:22,780
Thank you.

372
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,200
You should do your best to protect the peace of the city and the safety of the citizens.

373
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,220
Well, let's go, Ms. Makoto.

374
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Yes, Mr. Ryo.

375
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,420
And when you come with the chief...

376
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,820
From Mr. Ryo.

377
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,880
You're showing off as if you're lovers.

378
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,860
I can't forgive you.

379
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,020
Why is that gorilla man so popular?

380
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,380
You think he's strange?

381
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,160
Mr. Reiko?

382
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,240
Mr. Reiko?

383
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,000
What's up?

384
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,320
Mr. Reiko, what's wrong?

385
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,040
Huh?

386
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,440
Oh, the girl who can understand Ryo's lies has finally appeared.

387
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,280
I should make her happy.

388
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,780
I, I see...

389
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,060
You're all right.

390
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,380
But...

391
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,880
But...

392
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,420
But...

393
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,060
But...

394
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,940
Oh...

395
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,420
But...

396
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,040
But...

397
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,460
But...

398
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,600
But...

399
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,940
It's very fast.

400
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,720
It's been modified a lot.

401
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,780
If it's not a large place like this, we can't play.

402
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,600
Yo yo.

403
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,560
You're showing off from the front.

404
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,060
Heh, can you lend me a little bit of your pocket money?

405
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,800
The kids are in the way.

406
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,880
Ryoichi-san.

407
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,260
Makoto-san, no need to worry.

408
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,720
Don't be so cool.

409
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,100
Hey, let's get the money out quietly.

410
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,340
I don't think you guys are talking to me.

411
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,620
What?

412
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,240
Do you want to see me?

413
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,660
Huh?

414
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,020
Ryoichi-san!

415
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,420
I'm sorry!

416
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,160
I like Ryoichi-san more and more because he can get rid of those scary people with one word.

417
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,820
It can't be this good.

418
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,500
It's too good.

419
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,020
I'm sorry.

420
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,540
Makoto-san.

421
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,140
Huh?

422
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,800
You're just a girl with no talent like Makoto-san.

423
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,360
Why do you want to date a man like me?

424
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,840
Don't men around you usually leave you?

425
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,620
Can you tell me honestly?

426
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
You're an adult.

427
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,980
I'll tell you properly.

428
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,240
I...

429
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,980
I had a dream to be a fashion designer since I was a child.

430
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,040
What a wonderful dream.

431
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,640
So I told my parents that I was going to study abroad in Paris.

432
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,080
They were very against it.

433
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,340
They told me to get married without following my childhood dream.

434
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,480
So you don't have any relationship with your parents anymore.

435
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,040
That's right.

436
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,880
That's true.

437
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,760
But I realized it after dating you.

438
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,220
I...

439
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,820
Wait.

440
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,880
Don't say that just because we've met a few times.

441
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,360
I'm sorry.

442
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,880
I'm not seeing you today.

443
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,300
Ryotsu.

444
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,320
I hate people who give up their dreams because they are against their parents.

445
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,860
I'm sorry, but I'm leaving.

446
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,860
Goodbye.

447
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,000
Goodbye.

448
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,400
Ryotsu.

449
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,460
What?

450
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,780
Ryotsu Kankichi was dumped?

451
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,560
She seems to be very depressed.

452
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,380
Right, Reiko?

453
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,120
Yes.

454
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,820
I thought it was strange.

455
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,540
I finally understood the true nature of Ryotsu Kankichi.

456
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,180
He can get rid of the ghostly face of a gorilla man.

457
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,540
Komachi.

458
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,240
Yes?

459
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,600
What'd he say?

460
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:18,740
What?

461
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,900
He looked at you like the protagonist of a comedy.

462
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,600
He told you that she was dumped anyway, so he told you to look away.

463
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,760
Ryotsu.

464
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,220
Don't you touch me even if you've been mistreated.

465
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,420
You should know that she has never accepted any kind of man.

466
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,040
Ser...

467
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,700
Don't say that.

468
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,180
That girl doesn't like me.

469
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,780
I just like her.

470
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,980
I like a woman who's in her thirties, who's fat and has a lot of fat.

471
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,700
Aren't you overreacting?

472
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,520
I'm not overreacting!

473
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,780
Anyway, Honda.

474
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,840
You're done with work, right?

475
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,640
Yeah.

476
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,020
Come with me tonight.

477
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,060
Okay.

478
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,120
That's why I'm here!

479
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,700
Okay, let's go!

480
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,600
Don't drink too much.

481
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,560
Okay, I'll wait.

482
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,220
Here.

483
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,480
Dad, get me two or three more of these.

484
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,920
Ryo-san, shouldn't you stop drinking?

485
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,560
You idiot!

486
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,500
You'll get arrested if you don't!

487
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,600
I can't help it.

488
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,720
Hey, Honda!

489
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,660
Didn't you say you were going to drink with me until morning?

490
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,520
Get up!

491
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,860
I can't drink anymore.

492
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,620
Please forgive me.

493
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,740
You're so annoying.

494
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,420
I'll go with you.

495
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:50,980
Boss?

496
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,380
Dad, I'll take care of him.

497
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,940
Sure, see you later.

498
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,080
I'm glad you're going with me.

499
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,080
Give me a drink, please.

500
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,680
You're so cute, you're making me look like an idiot.

501
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm good.

502
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,900
I'll try some, then.

503
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,260
Here you go, Ryo-san.

504
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:13,820
Here, drink!

505
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,400
Thanks, thanks.

506
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,260
Oh my...

507
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,380
You're such an idiot.

508
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,820
What?

509
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,960
Makoto-san, the address contestant told me what happened.

510
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,940
He was very grateful to you.

511
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,460
He said you were a slut,

512
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,040
then he convinced your parents

513
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,440
and made you study in Paris.

514
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,000
Really?

515
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,480
Oh, is that so?

516
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,860
Well...

517
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,820
You're not even a model, but you're so cool.

518
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,060
Is that so?

519
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,740
Good, good.

520
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,640
Chief, please, please.

521
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,400
Even though you followed me, you're really a big idiot.

522
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,600
Don't call me an idiot.

523
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,400
Oh, she was a good woman.

524
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:01,580
She was a good woman.

525
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,960
I said, "Well, do you have California money?"

526
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,640
Oh, I don't have California money.

527
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,160
I'm not in America.

528
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,100
I'm sorry.

529
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,620
Um, I'm sorry.

530
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,160
Yes, I'm sorry.

531
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,900
Well then, kushi-age, kaki-age, katsu-age, whatever, age-age?

532
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,340
What is it?

533
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,160
What do you recommend?

534
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,800
Just be careful with "katsu-age."

535
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,640
Huh?

536
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,020
That's a father joke.

537
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,120
Yes.

538
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,780
Yes, sorry.

539
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,720
There's no reason.

540
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,240
That's strange.

541
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,840
Really?

542
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:31,040
I didn't find the scar at the peak of the Sumida River

543
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:37,460
The scar found in the wall of the river was the scar when I rode a motorcycle and fell into the river when I was a junior high school student.

544
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,400
The memory of that junior high school time that opened up to fights and pranks is now vividly revived.

545
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,920
Next time, "Asakusa Shonen Guren Tai"

546
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,800
Thank you!

547
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,760
Thank you for watching!
