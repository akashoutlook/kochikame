1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,200
Time"

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,440
"A Little Time"

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:01,880
"A Little Time"

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,000
"A Little Time"

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,240
When you watch TV,

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,780
make your room bright and

7
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,960
try to look away.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,980
"A Little Time"

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,420
Come to me,

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:21,900
if you're broke.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,420
I'm not here,

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,920
but I'm worried.

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,620
I'll get you a drink.

14
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,970
Look at the blue sky,

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,080
the white clouds.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,240
I'll get along with you

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,660
somehow.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,660
"A Little Time"

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,270
"A Little Time"

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,000
"A Little Time"

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,240
"A Little Time"

22
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,340
"A Little Time"

23
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,000
"A Little Time"

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,520
Come to me, you who don't have a home.

25
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,520
I don't have one, but don't worry.

26
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:11,920
Look, the red cloud is burning.

27
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,940
It'll be all right in the meantime.

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,320
I know, I know, I know.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,700
If you know, be quiet and follow me.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,320
Hurry up, Ryo.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,300
I'll buy all the wire and buy it.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,120
Take your time.

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,000
All the wire is a little over 100 yen.

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,280
I'm just wasting it.

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,600
So I'm trying to use it carefully at the end.

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,400
Yes, yes.

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,080
Is this the standard one cup noodle?

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,260
No, ramen and dado are hard to throw away.

39
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,380
Then, the first place in the cup ramen ranking.

40
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,720
What is this program?

41
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,920
It's Mr. Ranking.

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,120
It's quite popular.

43
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,340
The product that won first place will be sold out in no time.

44
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,260
The first place will be decided.

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,220
The cup ramen that I, Kimezo, will be the first to win is this.

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,480
Kusaya Natto Ramen Blue Cheese Flavor.

47
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,240
Now, please check it out for yourself.

48
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,100
Kusaya Natto Ramen Blue Cheese Flavor of Yottoko Food.

49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,100
Kusaya Natto Ramen Blue Cheese Flavor.

50
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,380
Yes.

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,240
Yes.

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,560
Yes.

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:50,640
Yes.

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,820
It looks delicious.

55
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,020
Doesn't it smell strange?

56
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,360
And the color of the soup is eerie.

57
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,600
It doesn't look good.

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,420
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,920
The first place in the ramen ranking.

60
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,620
It can't be bad.

61
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,060
Let's eat.

62
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,460
It's not good.

63
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,580
Can't you eat it?

64
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,920
I think it tastes terrible.

65
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,140
It was terrible.

66
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,380
I saw it in the first time. Why is that the first place?

67
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,640
What's wrong, Sakonji?

68
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,660
I was tricked.

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,140
Actually, I was doing the ranking of the beautiful girl figure at the Mister Ranking last week.

70
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,900
Mister Ranking, the first place is the first place news.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,880
The beautiful girl figure is this.

72
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,600
The second place figure in the second half of the second movement.

73
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:38,920
What?

74
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,360
What? This kind of product came out?

75
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,020
I've been looking for it.

76
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,060
And today I finally got it.

77
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,940
It's a big package.

78
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,860
This is it!

79
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,900
Is this Saori?

80
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
It's like a worn-out Gorgon 13.

81
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,360
And it's big.

82
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,000
I thought it was a half size, but it was a half size.

83
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
This is not my Saori.

84
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,280
There is one victim of Mister Ranking here.

85
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,900
Reiko, is that ranking really accurate?

86
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,860
That's what Komachi and the others said.

87
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,240
It's them.

88
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,120
Komachi, Naogo, I have something to ask you about Mister Ranking.

89
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
Ryo, Tsukankichi.

90
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,440
What does Mister Ranking mean?

91
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,240
When I hear that name, I get very upset.

92
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,440
Did something happen?

93
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,520
Yes.

94
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,440
Are you going to give it to me?

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,400
Try it.

96
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,660
Ryo, Tsukankichi.

97
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,260
Ryo, Tsukankichi.

98
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,020
Ryo, Tsukankichi.

99
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,860
Ryo, Tsukankichi.

100
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,920
What's that? Are you a human?

101
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,600
It's a chocolate that was ranked first in the Mister Ranking a while ago.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,560
I tried to get it.

103
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,420
You're the only one who can trust that ranking.

104
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,960
You're the only one who can trust that ranking.

105
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,240
We were the ones who chose that ranking and were chosen.

106
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,800
That's right.

107
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,380
That's right.

108
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,440
When the program started, it was a pretty reliable ranking.

109
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,020
That's right.

110
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,140
But recently, it's been out of the list.

111
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,760
That's right.

112
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,380
I don't believe what the first-ranked Kimezo says.

113
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,720
The first-ranked Kimezo?

114
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,640
That's the father who ranked the show.

115
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,160
That's why.

116
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,160
If you have any complaints,

117
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,280
go to the first-ranked Kimezo.

118
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,440
Go!

119
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,320
I got it.

120
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,740
Here it is.

121
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,380
Let's go.

122
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,380
Okay.

123
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,480
Then, hello.

124
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,560
Sorry.

125
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,880
Be careful.

126
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:51,720
Yes.

127
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,720
What's wrong?

128
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,000
Excuse me.

129
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,540
I didn't expect such a miscalculated lecture to come.

130
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,820
What's miscalculated?

131
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,060
I'm just saying that something bad is bad.

132
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,540
Do you know when the first time cola was imported?

133
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,360
Cola?

134
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,560
Many Japanese people said,

135
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,720
"It tastes weird. It's not something humans drink."

136
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,180
However, what about now?

137
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,760
Now, it's loved by most Japanese people.

138
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,400
What?

139
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,300
What?

140
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,140
What?

141
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,180
What?

142
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,680
I want to say that Kusaya Natto Ramen is also like that.

143
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,520
My ranking is also looking to the future.

144
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,760
Excuse me, but your sense of taste is quite old.

145
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,680
Then, how about the figure that Sakonji bought?

146
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,820
This is...

147
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,440
This is not a matter of sense.

148
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,500
It's just a strange face.

149
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,640
Stop it.

150
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,140
You happened to get a defective item, right?

151
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,080
For your own good.

152
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,600
I thought so, too.

153
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,920
I bought 10 of them.

154
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,060
Where is this Saori?

155
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,240
You're unlucky.

156
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,420
You got a defective item.

157
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,740
Hey, are you still a Tomogarugi?

158
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,540
Oh, it's time to go.

159
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,800
I have an appointment with someone.

160
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,260
I'm sorry, but please take it.

161
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,800
See you later.

162
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,860
He's a little annoying.

163
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,140
Hey, Yotsu.

164
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,820
That guy.

165
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,200
Huh?

166
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,580
Yes, he's certainly a good teacher.

167
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,520
That guy?

168
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,340
That guy from before...

169
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,420
With this, you can be next week's rank.

170
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,260
I'm sure that our products will come to the top.

171
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,760
How do you know that?

172
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,980
Ah...

173
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,600
What, you?

174
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,080
Would you like to hear the details?

175
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,720
Yes.

176
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,100
What?

177
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
What, a defective item?

178
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,720
It seems that it was done on a daily basis that the Mr. Rank was ranked in the top by giving the defective item to the first place.

179
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,040
So that's why strange products came to the top.

180
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,220
I didn't know you were here.

181
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,420
You really let me eat such a bad chocolate.

182
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,480
I don't make chocolate.

183
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,680
Please.

184
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,220
I wonder if the people in the TV station are not.

185
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,720
I don't think I know for sure.

186
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,420
It's a trust problem.

187
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,020
Of course it will be announced.

188
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,180
It's not just interesting to just announce it.

189
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay, this is decided up to third place.

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,720
The rest is first and second place.

191
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,360
Hmm.

192
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,720
The hungry master has 2 million.

193
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,680
The bad master has 1.5 million.

194
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,620
Gold Nobe.

195
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,520
I'm wondering which one to choose.

196
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,540
Let's put the cash priority here.

197
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,820
Okay, done.

198
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,960
Today's ranking is like this.

199
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,380
Yeah.

200
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,720
Teacher Ichi, it's time.

201
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,240
15 seconds before the show.

202
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,240
Let's get excited today.

203
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,280
5, 4, 3.

204
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,400
What?

205
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,480
Let's hide it here.

206
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,500
Mr. Ranking.

207
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,920
The man who decides all the rankings in the world.

208
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,980
That's me.

209
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,320
I decided first place.

210
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,000
Today's theme is this.

211
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,960
Japanese sake ranking.

212
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,180
Then, the Japanese sake ranking.

213
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,740
It's finally announced first place.

214
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,960
The first place is the Paraguri Shuzo's Seishu Baka Ichidai.

215
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,580
There's a glee in its softness.

216
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,040
It's the Japanese sake from the Japanese sake.

217
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
See you again at the next week's ranking.

218
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,900
All Ball.

219
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,040
There's a reason for that ranking.

220
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,440
Huh?

221
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Don't fool around with that Seishu Baka Ichidai.

222
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,720
When are you going to be the one?

223
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,220
I'll give you a better ranking.

224
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,000
Wait a minute.

225
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,540
Ah!

226
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,500
It's happening.

227
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,780
Turn the camera around.

228
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,860
It's wrong to rank without drinking a single drop.

229
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,920
I'm drinking a bottle of sake all my life.

230
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,980
I'm drinking like I'm drinking juice.

231
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,220
Interesting.

232
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,620
This is the end of the show.

233
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,160
Then, let's have this person rank.

234
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,200
What?

235
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,340
I have to do that.

236
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,220
Hmm.

237
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,680
Hmm.

238
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,240
Hmm.

239
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:26,860
Hmm.

240
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:27,660
Hmm.

241
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,080
Hmm.

242
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,440
Hmm.

243
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,980
That's all.

244
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,500
Well then.

245
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,660
This is my ranking.

246
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,640
Oh!

247
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,040
This is a completely different result from Mr. Ranking.

248
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,200
Ah!

249
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,500
This is weirder.

250
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,740
I just lined them up as it were.

251
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,000
If you have a problem with this result,

252
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,480
you should ask the customers to drink it and decide which is the right one.

253
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,360
They are amateurs.

254
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,580
What do amateurs know?

255
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,760
Most of them are amateurs.

256
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,120
But, they don't drink that much.

257
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,620
Don't worry.

258
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,060
Now, Gonji.

259
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,680
Yes!

260
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,780
We have prepared a lot of alcohol.

261
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,520
Now, everyone.

262
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,360
Drink it and check it yourself.

263
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,600
This is the alcohol that ranked first?

264
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,140
This is good.

265
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,020
This is the alcohol that ranked first.

266
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,840
Now, everyone.

267
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,840
Please raise your cards which you think is the right one.

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,780
Here you go.

269
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,740
What?

270
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,820
This is a conspiracy.

271
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,520
They are trying to trick me.

272
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,180
It's your fault.

273
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,840
Look at that.

274
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,280
Mr. Ranking 200 million.

275
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,460
Bad backlog is 155 million.

276
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,720
I've Trying to hide a hidden camera in your dressing room.

277
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,300
Why do you always feel like

278
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:02,820
a big drunk?

279
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,660
You should prioritize the source money.

280
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,700
He's right.

281
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,080
It means that.

282
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,080
We have made the ranking according to

283
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,940
the amount that Mr. Ranking received.

284
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,220
On the other hand,

285
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,820
they demasiado us.

286
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,600
Anyway,

287
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,200
Go with Mr. Ranking.

288
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,480
There are 2 Mr. Ranking now.

289
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:21,780
Let's run away!

290
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,300
Ahahaha!

291
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,740
See? Justice always wins!

292
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,380
What? You want me to replace Mr. Ranking?

293
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,360
Yes, the last day's broadcast was very popular.

294
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,260
I would like Mr. Ranking to replace Mr. Ranking.

295
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,740
Hmm, it's not a bad story.

296
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,120
I want to give a good response to the program.

297
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,460
Until now, Mr. Ichi has been deceived and leaked false information.

298
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,900
Well, I don't want you to be deceived anymore.

299
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,020
Really?

300
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,200
However, the characters...

301
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,300
No, no, I won't allow the TV show to end.

302
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,640
B-B-chan...

303
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,300
W-W-Wait a minute.

304
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,900
These are the victims who were deceived by such a poor evaluation.

305
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,020
It's very problematic.

306
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,820
That's right. Please help us somehow.

307
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,360
The one who appeared on their show is a person to help.

308
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,400
A person to help.

309
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,440
Then, I'll ask that person.

310
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,720
I won't accept it.

311
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,200
Really?

312
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,480
But, no pay.

313
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,220
What?

314
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,960
No way!

315
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,800
I'm saving people.

316
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,520
I can't get paid by saving people.

317
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,180
Thank you.

318
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,420
Thank you very much.

319
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,040
Ryozu, do it well.

320
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,620
Yes.

321
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,080
Ryozu Daioh's Ranking King!

322
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,140
Ranking King Ryozu Kankichi Daioh.

323
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,600
The man who will decide all the rankings in the world,

324
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,640
has arrived in Japan in the 21st century.

325
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,020
I am the ranking king of justice!

326
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,620
Damn it.

327
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm wearing this kind of outfit, but I can't get paid.

328
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,760
The theme of the first episode to be commemorated is Retort Curry.

329
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,800
Retort Curry.

330
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,060
Retort Curry.

331
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,680
Let's decide.

332
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,060
Ranking King.

333
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,940
Eat as much as you can.

334
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,160
Ryozu Daioh is eating a lot.

335
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,600
I ate it.

336
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,160
He ate 10 curry in no time.

337
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,820
Not yet.

338
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,120
My motto is to eat everything and rank.

339
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,260
Bring more and more.

340
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,340
Now, let's announce.

341
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,100
This is the curry ranking I set.

342
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,080
I see.

343
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,880
I checked everything under me. I checked everything under me.

344
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,420
I will accept any complaints.

345
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,340
I see.

346
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,340
Ryozu was wonderful!

347
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,220
So, about next week's ranking,

348
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,420
I'll be eating in the middle of the week.

349
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,500
Why?

350
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,580
It's the most familiar to the viewers.

351
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,400
I see.

352
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,940
pasarimo bread ranking.

353
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,380
量飲料水ランキング

354
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:04,660
量飲料水ランキング

355
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,420
Convenience store dessert ranking

356
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,340
Daioh is ranking king!

357
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,140
Tonight, theщ.

358
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,040
Let's go to the station.

359
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,340
You're so popular on your show, Senpai.

360
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,680
I heard that the products that Ryo-chan ranked first are very popular.

361
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,340
Oh, is that so?

362
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,160
Ryo-san, aren't you happy?

363
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,000
Of course I'm happy.

364
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,320
Even if the show is popular, I can't get a single one.

365
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,640
Oh, I see.

366
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,600
It's as much as my manju.

367
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,320
I'm tired of eating it.

368
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,800
Then, how about a bath bomb this time?

369
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,440
A bath bomb?

370
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,040
What kind of bath bombs do you think we should use

371
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,600
to make manju?

372
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,400
Hmm...

373
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,720
Well, it's good to take a bath once in a while.

374
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,540
Hehehe...

375
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,560
Um, is that Mr. Ryo-san?

376
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,800
Yeah, that's right.

377
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,780
Please take a look.

378
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,560
What? Manju again?

379
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,540
Please refresh the inside.

380
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,220
Huh?

381
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,580
I can't help it.

382
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,560
I don't need to get so many manju.

383
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,940
Huh?

384
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,820
Whoa!

385
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,380
No!

386
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,840
Manju is not boring no matter how much I eat.

387
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,400
After all, it's this.

388
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,580
It's an honor to be pleased.

389
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,860
By the way, who are you?

390
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,260
Which manufacturer are you from?

391
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,000
Curry?

392
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,160
Or is it bread?

393
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,400
It's a bath bomb.

394
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,680
A bath bomb?

395
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,080
That's scheduled to be recorded next week.

396
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,660
Oh!

397
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,200
Then this is not an orei, but a Wairo.

398
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,020
No, no, no, no.

399
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,760
I can't take this kind of thing.

400
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,600
I have absolute confidence in my own product.

401
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,880
If you evaluate it correctly,

402
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,740
I'm sure we'll be in first place.

403
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,980
Is that so?

404
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,060
Please be assured and take it.

405
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,160
If you win first place on the show,

406
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,400
sales will be greatly increased.

407
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,540
Then I will give you an orei as soon as possible.

408
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,220
So, it's a gift of thanks.

409
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,800
A gift of thanks?

410
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,000
If you say you don't need it,

411
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,620
I'll take it home.

412
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,560
No, no, no.

413
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,780
I'm not a person who refuses thanks.

414
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,960
I'll take it gratefully.

415
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,440
Thank you.

416
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,040
By the way, our product is

417
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,640
Soda Splash Black.

418
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,360
I got it.

419
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,020
It's Soda Splash Black.

420
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,900
Well, the last bath bomb is

421
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,980
Soda Splash Black.

422
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,300
This is it.

423
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,060
It's so wet and disgusting.

424
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,440
Oh, this is wonderful.

425
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,500
Wonderful.

426
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,780
A black bath bath that changes the image of a bath.

427
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,440
The refreshing touch of carbonic acid.

428
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,540
I'll take it without any doubt.

429
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:36,960
This is it!

430
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,900
Soda Splash Black under the sleeve.

431
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,200
Thank you.

432
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,920
But, I never knew that it was the best.

433
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,640
I just said that good things are good.

434
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,300
It was actually a revolutionary bath bomb.

435
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,560
From now on, it may become the standard of bath bombs.

436
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,620
Moreover, what will be the ranking next week?

437
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,240
What will happen to the fridge?

438
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,460
The fridge?

439
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,700
Hello, it's a complete electrician.

440
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,820
I'm Ranking King Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

441
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,060
Actually, I'll be picking up the fridge next week.

442
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,300
That's all I have to say.

443
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,160
By the way, do you know what my future is?

444
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,560
Well, think about it.

445
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,440
Um, Ryo-tsu-sensei.

446
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,200
Ryo-tsu-sensei.

447
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,660
Sensei!

448
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,460
Oh, the power of electricity.

449
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:30,620
Power of electricity?

450
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,080
Yes.

451
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,480
I'm the owner of the new fridge, Sabui-kun.

452
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,900
I've brought you some snacks as a gift.

453
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,540
Oh, thank you.

454
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:42,940
Huh?

455
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,540
A small-sized sandwich?

456
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,280
You're a good actor.

457
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Now I know why small-sized sandwiches are my favorite.

458
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,740
That's because the road to evil is a snake.

459
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,880
This year is the year of the snake.

460
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
The second is the year of the tiger.

461
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,860
Please take care of Sabui-kun.

462
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,440
Leave it to me!

463
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,020
Leave it to me, Sabui-kun.

464
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,640
The first place this week is Sabui-kun, the power of electricity.

465
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,200
That's...

466
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,460
Justice will prevail!

467
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,380
If you keep going like this, you'll make a lot of money.

468
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,500
Hey, Ryo-tsu, Kankichi.

469
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,000
What's wrong, you two?

470
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,820
I bought the bath bomb that this primitive man recommended the other day.

471
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,940
Then...

472
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,520
What's with that Soda Splash Black?

473
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,700
It just feels bad.

474
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,280
That's all.

475
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,400
I don't get it.

476
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,460
What?

477
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,680
When the cola came to Japan, 90% of the Japanese were saying it was bad.

478
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,220
What about that?

479
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,320
There's no one who says that right now.

480
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,600
That's a different story, isn't it?

481
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,440
Um...

482
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,000
Hmm?

483
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,380
Ryo-tsu, it's from the second generation tea.

484
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,900
Oh, that story is over there.

485
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,680
Yes.

486
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,600
The story is not over yet.

487
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,140
I'll ask you later.

488
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,140
Hello.

489
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,740
Oh, hello.

490
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,480
Oh, Ryo-chan.

491
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,620
Recently, there are many customers like that.

492
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,300
To Ryo-chan?

493
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,020
They seem to have brought something.

494
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,980
This is...

495
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,140
This is perhaps...

496
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,540
Hmm...

497
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,300
The second generation tea and the Soda Splash Black are 2 million yen.

498
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,080
But this place is the best Soda Splash Black.

499
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,160
Because the person in charge is a beautiful woman.

500
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,140
Ryo-tsu, it's time.

501
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,300
Oh, I'm going now.

502
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,340
All right.

503
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,580
I'll be right back.

504
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:29,820
Senpai.

505
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,320
Huh?

506
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,300
Oh, Nakagawa.

507
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,680
Senpai, the story is...

508
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,240
It's before the real show.

509
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,440
I'll tell you later.

510
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,980
It's about the file you are receiving.

511
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,700
What is it about?

512
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,120
I don't have a single file.

513
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,680
But...

514
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,760
I don't say that often.

515
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,420
But...

516
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:52,780
Ryo-tsu.

517
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,040
Oh, well.

518
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,500
I'm the ranking king of justice.

519
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:57,860
Well, well.

520
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,480
Oh, yes, yes.

521
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,800
After all it was great to convince him.

522
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,100
Ryo-tsu Daioh's Ranking King!

523
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,420
The man who can decide the rankings of all things in the world came to 21st century Japan.

524
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,820
I am the ranking king of justice!

525
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,120
Well, today's theme is Japanese tea.

526
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,420
Wait.

527
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,520
What?

528
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,660
What are you doing?

529
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,800
What are you doing?

530
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,860
Listen to this.

531
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,880
Senpai.

532
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,100
Oh, Nakagawa.

533
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,020
What?

534
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,880
What is Kei-chan talking about?

535
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,500
It's the conversation with Senpai.

536
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,900
It's about the Wairo that Senpai gave me.

537
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,900
Wairo?

538
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,980
It's Ryotsu.

539
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,320
I thought he would definitely show his tail one day, so I was watching him in secret.

540
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,640
Who are you?

541
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,740
It's me.

542
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,360
Who are you?

543
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,620
That's right.

544
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,600
I'm the number one Kimezo who was fired from this show once.

545
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,280
What do you want from me?

546
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,560
Wait.

547
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,580
It's funny.

548
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,440
Let's continue.

549
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,480
What?

550
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,160
I'll show you something funny.

551
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,620
Two cups of green tea and a big cup of tea cost 2 million yen.

552
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,480
But this is a big cup of tea.

553
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,200
The person in charge was a beautiful woman.

554
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,720
In the end, you're a pretty woman.

555
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,840
You're doing the same thing as me.

556
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,200
No.

557
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,780
This is a mistake.

558
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,980
It's a conspiracy.

559
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:31,780
It's a fraud.

560
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,340
Senpai.

561
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:33,640
Oh.

562
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,940
Ryo-chan.

563
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,420
Don't look.

564
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,020
Stop it.

565
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:42,900
Stop it.

566
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,840
Stop it.

567
00:22:59,460 --> 00:22:59,900
Now it's all over.

568
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,060
And I'm a man.

569
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,160
You're doing this all for your own good!

570
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,480
Don't be ridiculous!

571
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,680
It's my show.

572
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,740
You don't have to bring it up.

573
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:10,820
You're my host.

574
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:10,940
You're the host.

575
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,340
Unstable Fast.

576
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,980
Unstable Fast.

577
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,020
Unstable Fast.

578
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,540
Unstable Fast.

579
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,780
Unstable Fast.

580
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,060
Don't look.

581
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,720
Unstable Fast.

582
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:21,800
You don't know what you're talking about.

583
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,540
Useless.

584
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:22,720
Unstable Fast.

585
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:22,960
I'm on the list of fireworks!

586
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,520
What?!

587
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:39,740
Hey, Reiko!

588
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,880
This ranking magazine is very popular right now.

589
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,580
Well, it's not going to work for me.

590
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,240
But you can trust this magazine, right?

591
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,780
Because Ryo Tsukankichi is the top of the list of unreliable men!

592
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,360
Damn it! I hate rankings so much!

593
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,840
If this must end now,

594
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,880
it's not a big deal.

595
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,100
See you later.

596
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,240
I was a child once, but everyone has forgotten

597
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,120
A politician with a great face

598
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,700
A blue aunt above my eyes

599
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,600
Turn around and see

600
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
I'll see that kid

601
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,700
I'll see everyone

602
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,380
There is a wall there

603
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,260
There must be money

604
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,080
Everyone come to the city of parents

605
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,520
Thank you!

606
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,800
What, the magic nightclub?

607
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,600
Hey! Wate is a magical nightclub.

608
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,820
What kind of magic can you do?

609
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,060
It doubles the money included.

610
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
I did it! Now has big money!

611
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,060
Why do I only have 5 yen at times like this!

612
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,280
Next time,

613
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,360
Magic nightclub

614
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,460
I'm looking forward to working with you!
