00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,520
Komatsu - Rosen

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,140
"When you watch TV, bright the room and try staying away!"

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,440
"Would you like to be a guest?"

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,760
Those who have no money, come to my place!

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,400
Even if I'm not here, they worry.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm so worried

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,980
Look at the blue sky

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,960
and the white clouds

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,680
I'm sure they'll be alright

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm sure they'll be alright

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,300
you jobless guy

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not here,

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,520
but I'm worried

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,120
Look,

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,320
the red moon

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,660
is burning

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm sure

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,260
they'll be alright

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,420
I'm sure

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:21,440
they'll be alright

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:21,580
You know that, right?

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,160
You know that, right?

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,680
If you know that,

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,680
then shut up and follow me!

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,520
I'll teach you how to buy a ticket!

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,880
I see

27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,420
Don't stand behind me!

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,540
I'm sorry,

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,360
I want a cup of tea from Mr.Volvo

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,540
Mr.Reiko...

31
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,220
Mr.Volvo is so big

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,840
that he has a heart of a drunkard

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,940
I'm not scared

34
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,980
I'm just not used to the Greenberry era

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,660
Are you a chicken or a chicken?

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:11,920
You're a Alpine

37
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,360
You're a999

38
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,280
You're a999

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,800
You're a999

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:41,640
You're a88 1 00:01:48,001 -- 00:01:48,000 Isn't it about time I was fired?

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,180
Oh, it's a mail from Jody!

42
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,940
"You're already in Japan?"

43
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,000
"My dear Bobby, I have a favor to ask of you today."

44
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,140
"I'm going to go there from now on."

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,420
"But Ryo-tsu, what is Jody's favor to me?"

46
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,200
"Ugh, I don't know about that!"

47
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,860
"I've known Jody for a long time..."

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,480
"It's about time for us to make a decision."

49
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,200
"I don't know if I can make it..."

50
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,720
"Bobby, I made a Japanese-flavored meat and potato dish. Would you like to try it?"

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,440
"Aaahhhm!"

52
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,960
"Aaahhhm!"

53
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,180
"It's delicious, Jody!"

54
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,700
"Welcome, Bobby!"

55
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,760
"It's Jody!"

56
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,900
"He's just making a noise."

57
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,220
"He's going to die if he gets married, for sure."

58
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,120
"Bobby!"

59
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:32,820
"Yes?"

60
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,240
"Bobby, wait!"

61
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:34,920
"Yes?"

62
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,000
"Hi, everyone!"

63
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,380
"This is Jody."

64
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,160
"He's the one you've been waiting for!"

65
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,000
"Jody..."

66
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,440
"I missed you, Bobby!"

67
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,720
"Jody..."

68
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,740
"Huh? Is this Jody's Doberman?"

69
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,460
"Yes, I recently started to buy it."

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,660
"It's a two-year-old male, and it's called Bobby."

71
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,580
"Huh?"

72
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,180
"Yes, I named it the same name."

73
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,960
"It's not lonely when you don't see Bobby, is it?"

74
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,540
"Jody..."

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,260
"He's happy to be named by a dog."

76
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,440
"He's happy to be named by a dog."

77
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,220
"He's happy to be named by a dog."

78
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,140
"He's very well-behaved, isn't he?"

79
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,360
"He's a very good boy!"

80
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:12,820
"He's a very good boy!"

81
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,340
"Look at him, Bobby."

82
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,900
"He's a good boy."

83
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,200
"He's a good boy."

84
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,860
"This time, I brought him here because I thought he could take a long break."

85
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,920
"But suddenly, he's going to join a month-long public training."

86
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,680
"What? Then, what do you mean by asking him to join us?"

87
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,900
"Actually, while I'm doing the training, I want you to take care of him."

88
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,360
"Take care of him?"

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,180
"Take care of him?"

90
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,540
"I'm sure he's well-behaved, so I don't think I'll bother you."

91
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,480
"Can you do me a favor, Bobby?"

92
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,240
"I got it, Jody. I'll take care of him."

93
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,100
"Thank you, Bobby!"

94
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,820
"Thank you, Bobby!"

95
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,680
"I've already sent his luggage to Bobby's apartment."

96
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,820
"Then, please!"

97
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,500
"Then, please!"

98
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,380
"Then, please!"

99
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,400
"Bye-bye, Bobby!"

100
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,000
"Bye-bye, Bobby!"

101
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,800
"Hey!"

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,360
"You know, the meat-jjajangmyeon place is a long way away from here!"

103
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,560
"Jody..."

104
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,540
"Seeing his happy face, I couldn't tell him that my apartment is banned from pets."

105
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,320
"Bobby, stop!"

106
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,060
"Stay!"

107
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,100
"Sit down!"

108
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,740
"Ah! It's the manager!"

109
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,900
Ah!

110
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,520
Hello.

111
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,640
Ah, Mr. Bulbo, welcome back.

112
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,920
What is that?

113
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,140
I received a nice pot of rice from my friend.

114
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,300
That much?

115
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,540
Yes, it's from a fisherman.

116
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,880
Ah, Mr. Bulbo.

117
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,140
I have something for you.

118
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,640
It's like a moving luggage.

119
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm sure the local people have sent something.

120
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:10,520
I'm sure the local people have sent something.

121
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm sure the local people have sent something.

122
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,480
Thank you very much.

123
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,720
Thank you very much.

124
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,380
Bobby.

125
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:23,760
Bobby.

126
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,120
I'm sorry for making you feel so awkward.

127
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,480
But I had no choice but to do this.

128
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,980
This is a pet-free apartment.

129
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,660
I'm sorry for making you feel so awkward.

130
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,020
Please be quiet.

131
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,940
If the neighbors find out, I won't be able to stay here.

132
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,700
If the neighbors find out, I won't be able to stay here.

133
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,880
Oh, it's a food.

134
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,380
You must be hungry, Bobby.

135
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,460
Okay, wait a minute.

136
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,400
Well, where is the food?

137
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,900
Well, where is the food?

138
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,880
Hey, Bobby.

139
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,760
Doesn't it look delicious?

140
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,580
What's wrong?

141
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,360
What's wrong?

142
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,380
Aren't you hungry?

143
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,540
What's wrong?

144
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,080
I don't know.

145
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,960
What do you want to say?

146
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,340
Oh, I see.

147
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:16,800
It's hard to eat it if it's in a can.

148
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,560
See, this is good.

149
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,900
Do you still need something?

150
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,320
Do you still need something?

151
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,140
Do you still need something?

152
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,100
Do you still need something?

153
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,340
I was just trying to eat it.

154
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,120
Oh, it's time to eat.

155
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,540
Oh, you're eating with this plate.

156
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,680
Oh, you're eating with this plate.

157
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,360
I'm sorry for being rude to you.

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,300
You finally ate it.

159
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,900
But this is a good place to sleep.

160
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,560
But this is a good place to sleep.

161
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,300
You have a bed for the dogs, too.

162
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,240
Okay, you're ready to go to bed, Bobby.

163
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,520
Okay, you're ready to go to bed, Bobby.

164
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,520
Hey, Bobby!

165
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
Toby, your bed is here.

166
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,140
Get off. This is my bed.

167
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,340
What are you doing? This is my bed.

168
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,580
You said it's my bed again.

169
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,040
Damn it.

170
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,920
What are you doing?

171
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,620
I told you to protect it.

172
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,440
What are you doing?

173
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,940
I got it.

174
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,660
I'll just sleep tonight.

175
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,540
Tomorrow, I'll go to the bottom.

176
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,820
What are you doing, Bobby?

177
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,200
You're a bad boy.

178
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,500
Jody will be sad, Bobby.

179
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:53,640
Bobby.

180
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,480
Mr.Borobo?

181
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,920
Mr.Manager?

182
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,960
The neighbors are saying that dogs will cry.

183
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,320
Yes.

184
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,120
I'm weak.

185
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,220
I'll be finished if they see me like this.

186
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,640
Bobby.

187
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,240
Bobby, that's dangerous.

188
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,660
Let's exchange it.

189
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,980
Do you like the ball?

190
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,420
Bobby.

191
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,100
It warms me up.

192
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,680
Winter is not the end.

193
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,840
Come in, Sagonji.

194
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,500
Borobo.

195
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,360
Hati !

196
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,040
It hurts !

197
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,120
Bobby thought it was a toy.

198
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,460
It wasn't my fault that I forgot to pack all the weapons.

199
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,980
But, he's so cheeky.

200
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,640
He was so sympathetic.

201
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,460
Mr. Shoji.

202
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,220
Please, hurry up.

203
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,060
Hey, don't walk around, and sit down.

204
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,120
Sit down.

205
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,140
You bastard! You think you can't sit in a dirty seat?

206
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,560
Huh?

207
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,480
Get out of my way!

208
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,140
Bobby!

209
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,500
Sit here.

210
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,140
Listen, Bulbo.

211
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,040
When you see a dog that is weaker than you,

212
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
you misunderstand that you are the boss.

213
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,120
If you are a owner, be a good owner and be firm.

214
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,820
Sorry.

215
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,520
But I thought he was lonely because he broke up with Jody.

216
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,180
I can't be strict with him.

217
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,980
That's not the point.

218
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,920
Let him do whatever he wants.

219
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,880
After all, the pet is the one who has to suffer.

220
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,620
Yeah.

221
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,760
Senpai, I'm not good at dogs.

222
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,880
I'm sure it's forbidden to pet here.

223
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,500
I'll run away.

224
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,240
Bobby!

225
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm not allowed to pet in Nico Nico Ryo.

226
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,200
Hold it!

227
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,860
Bobby!

228
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,500
Hold it!

229
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,120
Bobby!

230
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,400
Which way should I go?

231
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,540
This way!

232
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:45,560
This way!

233
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,280
This way!

234
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,740
This way!

235
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,260
It's Jody's dog.

236
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,200
You're right.

237
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,520
I knew it.

238
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Ryo.

239
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,420
What's wrong?

240
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,780
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

241
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,880
Nothing.

242
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,200
Bobby.

243
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm scared.

244
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm scared.

245
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:14,860
I'm scared.

246
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,000
So it was like that.

247
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,080
You see, you've got a flying pet.

248
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,440
You do have a flying pet, too.

249
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,380
Jody will be gone for a while, Bobby.

250
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,540
Yes.

251
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,000
Jody!

252
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,660
Hello, Bobby.

253
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,640
You two are so nice.

254
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,060
Yeah.

255
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,840
I miss you.

256
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,340
Yeah.

257
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,080
I should be okay with you.

258
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,280
Don't worry.

259
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,960
Keep practicing...

260
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,920
Wait. Bobby, it's Jody.

261
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,080
Oh, I see. See you later, Jody.

262
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,300
What are you talking about? You're not even a tenant.

263
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,260
Gyoza! What should I do?

264
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,340
Don't ask me.

265
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,420
Um, how about this place?

266
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,040
It's a mansion where you can live with your pet in front of the station.

267
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,380
Pet... mansion?

268
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,740
Um, where's the owner's room?

269
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,220
Oh, here.

270
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,120
Yes.

271
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,400
What can I do for you?

272
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,240
Actually, I'd like to move into this mansion, but...

273
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,420
I see. I can't let go of your hand right now, so can you come to my room on the top floor?

274
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,340
Come on, let's go together.

275
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,460
Okay.

276
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,940
What a luxurious house.

277
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:52,920
What's wrong, Bobby?

278
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,220
Look, there are a lot of friends here.

279
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,140
There's even a pet food convenience store in the pet shop.

280
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,480
It's a mansion for pets.

281
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,220
You can relax here.

282
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,540
I'll buy Bobby.

283
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,760
Bobby, look.

284
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,200
What are you scared of?

285
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,420
This...

286
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,240
It's a horse!

287
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,040
It seems that the pets that are bought in this mansion are not just dogs or cats.

288
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,000
Stop it!

289
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,560
You're way too dangerous.

290
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,780
Oh, Mr. Shingao.

291
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,960
What are you doing here?

292
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,960
Um, um...

293
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,920
Where's the elevator?

294
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,960
There's none.

295
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,680
If the pets get in the way, it'll be a big deal.

296
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,280
There's no elevator.

297
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,620
Even though it's such a big mansion.

298
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,900
Huh?

299
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,720
Then you're going to live on that slope.

300
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,700
Above all, it's a mansion designed with the best idea in mind for animals.

301
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,980
Wonderful.

302
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,480
By the way, where's Bobby?

303
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,400
Huh?

304
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,900
Oh, he's over there.

305
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,800
He said that the pets will be like the owner, but isn't that too fast?

306
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,100
Huh?

307
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,000
That's great.

308
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,980
If we don't go out now, the pets will be able to walk for a long time.

309
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,100
What's the use of Doberman being so interested in Chihuahua?

310
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,460
He's becoming more and more like the owner of the zoo.

311
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,620
Huh?

312
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,200
He's just excited just by looking at a lot of animals, right, Bobby?

313
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,600
*A dog is barking*

314
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,000
Bobby!

315
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,560
*A dog is barking*

316
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
*A dog is barking*

317
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,140
*A dog is barking*

318
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,920
Oh, Bobby ran away.

319
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,660
*A dog is barking*

320
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,080
*A dog is barking*

321
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
*A dog is barking*

322
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,300
*B súper chihuahua*

323
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,640
Ah! Sayori-chan!

324
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,320
*B súper chihuahua*

325
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,340
*B súper chihuahua*

326
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,260
Who's there?

327
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,440
Who put a dog on the second floor?

328
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,840
Ah, ah, ah!

329
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,060
Sorry!

330
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,600
That's my dog.

331
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,400
It's a rule to have one dog and a cat at a time.

332
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,120
Hey, are you okay over there?

333
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,120
It's suddenly getting hot.

334
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,380
It's a tropical animal area ahead.

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What is this?

336
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:28,840
What is this?

337
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,620
The corridor on the third floor is a river for the animals living in the water.

338
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,580
Tell me that first.

339
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,460
I see. It's the right slope.

340
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,100
Sayuri ran to the fourth floor.

341
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,060
What is this?

342
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,100
Grandpa!

343
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,420
So that dog was also a pet.

344
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,940
I was saved for the time being.

345
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,300
I thought so, too.

346
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,960
It's a waterfall!

347
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,880
What's going on there?

348
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,300
No, I'm just...

349
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,260
Oh, right.

350
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,840
There's a lost Doberman on the fourth floor.

351
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,980
It's not a dog from your house.

352
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,180
It's Bobby!

353
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,220
It's the fourth floor!

354
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,640
Don't worry about me!

355
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,600
Bobby!

356
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,580
Bulba, this way.

357
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,120
It's a heavy door.

358
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,360
It's a heavy door.

359
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,320
It's a heavy door.

360
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,100
What the hell is this place?

361
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,080
Is it the North Pole?

362
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,100
Is it the South Pole?

363
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,120
It's so cold.

364
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,900
The air conditioner is too strong.

365
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,420
It's too much to make a pet in a place like this.

366
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,440
Be alive, Bobby!

367
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,900
Someone's down.

368
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,440
Hey, are you okay?

369
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,560
It's Tsurukamaken's dog.

370
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,560
Hey, get a hold on yourself.

371
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,900
If you sleep, you'll die.

372
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,060
Ryo, if you come to deliver a message...

373
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,780
I'm going back to Tsurukamaken.

374
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,200
Suzuki.

375
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,380
You're so annoying.

376
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,420
It's frozen ramen.

377
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,640
Then let's eat it.

378
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,040
This is no time for jokes.

379
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,960
If you keep doing this, I'll die.

380
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,340
I'm sorry.

381
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,580
Are you Suzuki?

382
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,420
Yes.

383
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,720
I'm going to the convenience store downstairs to buy penguin food.

384
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,440
The ambulance is ahead of the penguin food.

385
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,360
Really?

386
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:48,720
Yes.

387
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,780
Bobby!

388
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,640
What's next?

389
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,440
I'm going to get caught up in this.

390
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,240
What's wrong with you guys?

391
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,020
I'm going to the convenience store.

392
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,360
I'm not your father.

393
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,360
Don't leave me.

394
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,900
Something's coming.

395
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,780
It's an elephant!

396
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,220
It's going to be crushed!

397
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,200
I was saved.

398
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,340
What's this?

399
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,320
What's this?

400
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,500
I'm glad you're safe.

401
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,940
Were you there just now?

402
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,900
Did you see my Bobby?

404
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,760
I don't know.

405
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,640
I don't think you've come any higher.

406
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,260
What's on the top?

407
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,600
This is a tree.

408
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,600
Tree?

409
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,520
Bobby?

410
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,520
Wait, Porvo!

411
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,640
You better ask for help again.

412
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,980
I'll look for Bobby.

413
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,540
I'll find Poppy. If you want to go home, go home alone!

414
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,820
I'll listen to you.

415
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,160
Ryo!

416
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,900
If you go or go back to hell, you'll fall down.

417
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,860
Is this Safari Park?

418
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,560
What the hell is this place?

419
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,260
It's a monster, but they're all pets.

420
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,980
Okay, they're all good kids.

421
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,940
They're good kids.

422
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,420
It's not a pet, it's an invincible adventure.

423
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,680
Poppy!

424
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,480
Bulba!

425
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,220
Zeke & Versus

426
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,240
Run, Poppy!

427
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,220
Run, Poppy!

428
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,880
Poppy!

429
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:59,200
I haven't bathed for a month, and I don't care if I do guys.

430
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,820
Hello.

431
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,220
It'll be canceled if you're Sr. Jirozami.

432
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
Needle...

433
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,380
Is it your lion?

434
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,500
I've been raising it since I was a kid, so I'm used to humans,

435
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,820
but I've been trying to make it bark at strange guests.

436
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,660
I can't get close to an Akihito.

437
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,980
Bobby, will you accept me?

438
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,880
You crossed the border with the Hundred Beast King.

439
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,040
Of course.

440
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,600
Ryotsu, how did you do it?

441
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,240
You're eating all the good stuff, aren't you?

442
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,100
You poor guys.

443
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,380
If you're not salesmen, what have you come all the way here for?

444
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,280
Oh, I forgot.

445
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,880
Where's the owner's room?

446
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,280
This is again...

447
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,860
Where's the owner?

448
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:03,940
Where's the owner?

449
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,620
Where's the owner?

450
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,480
Welcome.

451
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,680
Did you like my pet mansion?

452
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,020
No, I mean...

453
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,040
It's a dream to have come all the way here alive.

454
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,700
You still have to like it.

455
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,120
Then let's show you the roof of pride.

456
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,860
This is my ranch.

457
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,220
This was my childhood dream.

458
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,240
You don't have to force it into the middle of the city.

459
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,520
You can live in the countryside.

460
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,780
I was born and raised in Tokyo.

461
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,400
I can't throw away the convenient city life.

462
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,780
Ryotsu, I'm sorry for taking so long to take care of you,

463
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,360
but I think it's good for you and Bobby to live in a place with real nature.

464
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,740
I think that's the best thing for Bobby.

465
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,040
I think that's the best thing for Bobby.

466
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,340
I think that's the best thing for you, too, Bulbo.

467
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,640
You've become Bobby's great owner.

468
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,360
Aaaaah!

469
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,600
Aaaaah!

470
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,280
A disaster-stricken animal-saving escape shooter!

471
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,260
What's this?

472
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,660
Aaaaah!

473
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,080
Aaaaah!

474
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,560
Aaaaah!

475
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,180
Aaaaah!

476
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,100
Aaaaah!

477
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,180
Aaaaah!

478
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,860
Aaaaah!

479
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,440
Aaaaah!

480
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,340
Hi, Bobby!

481
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,580
J-J-Jody, how did you come here?

482
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,380
The engine trouble on the ship made the departure delay.

483
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,200
That's why you need to have her on leave.

484
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
Huh? Are you sure, Jody?

485
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,900
Bobby!

486
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,720
Well then, Bobby, let's go on holiday!

487
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,000
H-H-Holiday?

488
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,960
Uh, J-Jody!

489
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,300
Bobby!

490
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
Where are you going?

491
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,680
L-Listen to me, sheep!

492
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:33,320
At that time, I felt a strange feeling

493
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:42,080
So I tried walking on the black tile of the arcade

494
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:52,640
Everyone was a child once, but everyone forgot

495
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,800
A politician with a great face

496
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,580
A blue aunt above her eyes

497
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,000
Turn around and look at that corner

498
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,620
You'll see everyone

499
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,600
Let's go!

500
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,360
There's a turtle over there

501
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,160
There must be a turtle

502
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,300
Everyone, come to our town

503
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,380
Thank you!

504
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,920
He's a goodiam

505
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,420
Isuteru

506
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,480
Isn't Tetsuo Nishizu an old man in a armor?

507
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,820
Ah, he took the정을播

508
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,240
To the city of the future!

509
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,940
Thank you!
