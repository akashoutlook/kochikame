00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,340
I walked while looking back at the other side of the road

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,920
I was drawn to my mother

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,520
At that time I felt a strange feeling

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:54,940
So I walked only in the dark place of the Ake-dogai Tile

10
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,840
Everyone was a child once, but they all forget

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,800
A politician with a big face and a blue aunt above their eyes

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,080
Turn around and see that corner

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,820
You can meet everyone

14
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,060
You can meet everyone

15
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,060
There is a wall

16
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,620
There must be a wall

17
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,520
Everyone come to our town

18
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,660
Thank you!

19
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,440
I'm hungry

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm hungry

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,640
I'm hungry

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,680
When I hear the sound of Senpai's stomach, my stomach is getting empty

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,600
I agree

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,720
I feel like I'm going to die

25
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,900
Don't say anything

26
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,460
You're not the only one

27
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,660
Everyone here hasn't eaten anything since last night

28
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,360
It can't be helped, Ryo

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,700
Because it's a health diagnosis

30
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,800
Because it's a health diagnosis

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,100
Why don't you eat?

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,000
There are various purposes for testing

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,080
Please be patient

34
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,140
When the test is over, you can eat a lot

35
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,600
Then let's go to eat delicious food for dinner

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
Let's do that

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,620
We'll treat you

38
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,520
How about all-you-can-eat grilled meat?

39
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,100
Grilled meat?

40
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,920
Oh!

41
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,760
Oh!

42
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,860
Chief

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,920
Let's go

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,860
Health diagnosis

45
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,360
All-you-can-eat Valium

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,740
Don't you feel happy all-you-can-eat?

47
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,900
Then let's take a picture of health statement

48
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,460
All together

49
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,620
"They're not freaks"

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,220
Hmm

51
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,000
Anyway, let's go early and go to the полез

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,280
Are you happy?

53
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,100
Ruotsu

54
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,620
If you find something wrong in your health diagnosis, what do you do?

55
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,200
Huh?

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,540
That's not true for me

57
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,540
which is absolutely true

58
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,720
This body is healthy

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
You don't know

60
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,340
You can't tell

61
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,880
Because you're moving to a place where you can't see the disease.

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,020
I heard that the most dangerous thing is to overestimate your body.

63
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,780
Yeah.

64
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,760
In Senpai's case, he has a terrible diet.

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,240
He always eats ramen, katsu-don, and curry rice for lunch.

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,120
When he has no money, he only takes a week off.

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,420
He eats grass growing on the roadside.

68
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,180
He's thinking about the balance of nutrition.

69
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,500
He might be in a department store with an adult disease.

70
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,920
It might be a department store with an adult disease.

71
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,960
It's okay.

72
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,100
If you look it up, you'll find out.

73
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,760
Okay.

74
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,540
Then, Ryotsu.

75
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,860
If you find any abnormalities in the test results,

76
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,700
you won't be allowed to eat grilled meat.

77
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,240
That's not fair, chief.

78
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,700
Why am I the only one?

79
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,560
Then, the chief is with us.

80
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,900
Everyone is with us.

81
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,060
If something happens to him during the test,

82
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,660
he won't be allowed to eat grilled meat.

83
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,460
Okay?

84
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,480
We'll have to go see the doctor.

85
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:12,780
Right.

86
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,700
I'll go to the hospital now.

87
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,520
It's okay.

88
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,180
I'll take care of it.

89
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,820
The doctor is here.

90
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,020
You're not going to die?

91
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,620
Go back to the hospital.

92
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:27,700
You're in a lot of pain.

93
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,340
Say something.

94
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,480
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,560
I'm really sorry.

96
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,220
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,760
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,280
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,820
I'm sorry.

100
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,140
A man who has lived a life of a vending machine like a monk suddenly goes crazy.

101
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,380
No way!

102
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,480
Hey! Don't say stupid things!

103
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,700
A man who gets angry like a manager suddenly goes crazy.

104
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,120
Don't scare me!

105
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,040
That's right, senpai.

106
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,580
Nakagawa, you're a little bit of a glutton.

107
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,300
That kind of eating life is the most dangerous.

108
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,260
There may be a lot of diseases going on before you realize it.

109
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,640
You've lost weight recently.

110
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,600
No, I haven't.

111
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,080
You look pale.

112
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,500
The chief said you don't have appetite.

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,160
Apparently, I'm the only one who's healthy.

114
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm not like those sick modern people.

115
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,640
I can't do anything bad.

116
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,960
Except for the head.

117
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,880
The head is the main thing.

118
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,920
I got drunk last night and rode a bicycle.

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,720
I hit a block with my head.

120
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,240
I got drunk last night and rode a bicycle.

121
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,160
I got drunk last night and rode a bicycle.

122
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,280
I'm talking about the inside.

123
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,620
I'm not drunk and riding a bicycle.

124
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,400
Please be quiet.

125
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,360
I'm sorry.

126
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,200
Please be careful.

127
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,940
The chief can't make a big voice at the hospital.

128
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,720
You're a jerk!

129
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,380
Hey, wait.

130
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,400
My pulse is getting faster.

131
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,220
I'm praying too.

132
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,960
Despite his

133
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,040
When do I get an injection?

134
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,840
I don't know. don't know?

135
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,560
Go all the way to the back.

136
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,260
I think I can do it. I think I can do it.

137
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,560
I don't want to go all the way to the back.

138
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,120
I wonder what's going to happen.

139
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,980
Teacher! Are you okay?

140
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,940
Teacher!

141
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,740
Teacher!

142
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
What's this white lump?

143
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,760
Teacher!

144
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,540
It's okay. It's a fat.

145
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,460
The monitor!

146
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,900
I just blew it as I was told.

147
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,520
It's not a human technique.

148
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,420
I'm not good at drinking this.

149
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,420
No one is good at drinking barium.

150
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,440
No one is good at drinking barium.

151
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,100
No, I think I was alone.

152
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,600
Wow!

153
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,900
It's a snack!

154
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,260
Snack?

155
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,300
Is it that good?

156
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,000
Anything is delicious if you're hungry.

157
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,740
As expected, there are times when you only eat the weeds on the roadside.

158
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,660
Do you eat weeds?

159
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,380
No, it's not just that.

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,940
When I'm hungry, I'll grab the insects flying around and eat them.

161
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,260
If you try to eat it, you can't eat it.

162
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,920
I heard that there is no such thing in this world.

163
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,360
That's right, I've seen someone eat beef eggs.

164
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,440
It's a lie!

165
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,300
No, he can't do it.

166
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,120
By the way, I also saw him hanging on the tree in the park.

167
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,280
You do not believe me.

168
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:48,680
You're wrong.

169
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,660
Move to the next room.

170
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,380
Move to the next room.

171
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,800
I do not believe you.

172
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
I do not believe you.

173
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,320
Heading to the Patient's Kit

174
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,420
Here you go.

175
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,960
Where'd Senpai go, I wonder?

176
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,940
Leave him alone!

177
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,580
He'd much better off staying healthy.

178
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,480
How about that!

179
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,760
This is terrible.

180
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,460
What?

181
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,620
Oh, me too?

182
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,380
Three people together, and you're leaving me like this.

183
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,840
Doctor, what's wrong with you?

184
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,240
Is it that terrible?

185
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,620
It's my time. Please be clear.

186
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,880
I'm not ready for this yet.

187
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,040
You should listen to me, Mr. Tenai.

188
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,560
No, wait, Nakagawa.

189
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,000
If you tell me that clearly,

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,200
I'll be in trouble, right?

191
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,220
Let's investigate this carefully and thoroughly.

192
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,740
Yes, sir.

193
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,100
Doctor, what's going on?

194
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,840
It's dangerous to go wild.

195
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,340
What's going to happen next?

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,780
That's...

197
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,700
What?

198
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,200
What's going to happen next?

199
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,920
It's a trap!

200
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,500
You made me feel better earlier.

201
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,700
You should feel better too.

202
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,760
It's a trap!

203
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,360
It's a trap!

204
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,040
It's a trap!

205
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,920
It's a trap!

206
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,680
It's a trap!

207
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,960
It's a trap!

208
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,740
It's a trap!

209
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,580
What's that?

210
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,940
It's a trap!

211
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
It's a trap!

212
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,380
It's a trap!

213
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:08,580
Eh~?

214
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,440
Ryotsu...

215
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,640
What do you think this is?

216
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,500
I'm so sorry!

217
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,360
You're an adult.

218
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,720
Why do you do that?

219
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,720
I'm so sorry!

220
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,600
Unbelievable.

221
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:26,600
Professor.

222
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,400
What happened?

223
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,240
Well, it's because of the treatment by Mr. Kanji.

224
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,200
Well, it's because of the treatment by Mr. Kanji.

225
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,340
I can't believe this is real.

226
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,720
This is a big discovery!

227
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,860
Look! This is the skull of a modern man.

228
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,540
This is the skull of a chimpanzee.

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,460
And this is the skull of a lion.

230
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,860
It's like seeing the evolution process.

231
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,860
It's similar to the real human.

232
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,040
Myra, you're a real chimpanzee.

233
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,040
I tried to make the skull three-dimensional.

234
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,520
This is scary.

235
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,220
Is it a Jaua genji?

236
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,020
No, it's a European genji from 500,000 years ago.

237
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,720
Chromanion?

238
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,320
No, Neanderthal genji.

239
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,240
No, Chromanion has evolved even more than Neanderthal.

240
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,040
This is a living fossil.

241
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,400
We have to investigate this man thoroughly.

242
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,280
Are you done?

243
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,880
All we have to do is wait for the result.

244
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,680
I'm sure it won't be a problem.

245
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,760
Let's go to the grill.

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,580
What happened to the three of you?

247
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,500
I'm worried about the result.

248
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,900
Me too.

249
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,700
We have to do a re-check.

250
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,220
Hey!

251
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:34,840
My name is Luce.

252
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,980
Is that right?

253
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,300
We have still a test left.

254
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,060
Let's take a break!

255
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,340
What is this?

256
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,220
I can't believe it.

257
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sorry, but it's enough for me to see him again.

258
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,440
Don't be mad at me!

259
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,700
That's why I came to you.

260
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,120
What were you thinking?

261
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,480
The End

262
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,800
Where are we?

263
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,660
Are you awake, Ryo Tsukankichi?

264
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,220
W-What's going on?

265
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,960
Welcome to my laboratory, Ryo.

266
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,220
I am the head of this laboratory, Serizawa.

267
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,240
This is a laboratory!

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,440
What's going on?

269
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,300
I never thought I'd get a call from Kameari Hospital.

270
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,440
I've been looking into your body from end to end.

271
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,580
And I found out a surprising fact.

272
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,520
What?

273
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,940
Is there something wrong with my body?

274
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,100
Is there something wrong with my body?

275
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,360
I'm in trouble!

276
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,900
I have to eat meat after this!

277
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,600
I'll give you a more detailed test.

278
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,920
Here's the first test.

279
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,500
Yes, sir!

280
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,680
What?

281
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,200
A banana?

282
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,220
What?

283
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,920
Use the fire to pick a banana.

284
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,580
What?

285
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,060
That's easy.

286
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,300
What? That's easy.

287
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,140
I'll do this.

288
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,720
Oh, my God!

289
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,320
It's so easy!

290
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,820
It fell off!

291
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,540
Clearly, it fell off!

292
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:38,860
Pull your gun!

293
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,760
What do I know now?

294
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,480
Now here's the next test!

295
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,440
Eh?

296
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:47,760
Huh?

297
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,400
Can you peel an apple?

298
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,320
That's how much you can do.

299
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,420
See? Is this enough?

300
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,480
I'm going to use a knife!

301
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,260
It looks like you're a good cook!

302
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,740
What the hell is this?

303
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,900
What the hell is this?

304
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,540
Then I'll move on to the next set.

305
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,260
Are you still going to do it?

306
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,760
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

307
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,080
Why did you do that?

308
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,160
See? I told you!

309
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,400
You're making fun of me!

310
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,560
I told you!

311
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,940
You're making fun of me!

312
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,500
You're making fun of me!

313
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,620
I'm finally done!

314
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,800
I'll do the next test!

315
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:24,860
Yes, sir!

316
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,900
What's this?

317
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,760
T-this is...

318
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,740
This is my real simulation system, which I think is the pride of the research institute.

319
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,700
Now then.

320
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,280
For the next test,

321
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,480
Go and grab that torch there,

322
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,580
What?

323
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:11,700
Huh?

324
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,280
What does this have to do with the health exam?

325
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,140
This is the most important test.

326
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,460
What time is it now?

327
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,600
If you don't finish it quickly, I won't be able to eat yakiniku.

328
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,960
It's a miracle that you have a time concept.

329
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,880
Then let's finish this test as soon as possible.

330
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,840
Come on, do it.

331
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,340
Okay, I'll say no.

332
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,500
This is the last one.

333
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,620
I'll definitely get it back when it's over.

334
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:37,980
I'll get it back.

335
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,720
Yakiniku, yakiniku, yakiniku, yakiniku.

336
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,760
I'll throw it away in the trash.

337
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,200
This is a human banana.

338
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,320
Why are you preparing a lion?

339
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,420
Shin-chan climbed.

340
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,300
He's did it with a human banana.

341
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,400
Ready?

342
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,620
No, no, no, no, no.

343
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,280
Amazing! He's a real man, defeating the Thunder Dragon!

344
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,600
Amazing! He's a real man, defeating the Thunder Dragon!

345
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,220
Grilled meat! Grilled meat!

346
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,740
If this goes up, it's grilled meat!

347
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,640
Grilled meat!

348
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,220
Wow!

349
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,900
Amazing!

350
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,840
Wonderful! Perfect!

351
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,040
Now, the examination is over, so give me back my horse!

352
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,920
Wonderful!

353
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,160
Kimiko,

354
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,320
I'll give you the fossil of life!

355
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,000
Look! This is your whole body.

356
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,680
This is mine?

357
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,340
Yes.

358
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,520
Your head is very similar to the human ancestor, the real man, more than 550,000 years ago.

359
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,180
The real man?

360
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,940
Not only the head, but also the whole body.

361
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,080
Furthermore, the muscles are developed abnormally,

362
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,940
and the body is as light as a gorilla and as light as a chimpanzee.

363
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,600
This was revealed in the test.

364
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,680
You!

365
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,580
You didn't have a medical diagnosis after all!

366
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,420
So what the hell are you talking about?

367
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,380
There's a process called the restoration of the fossil skull.

368
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,660
The skull is made of clay, and muscles are attached to it.

369
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,760
The height of the nose and the position of the eyes are calculated and the facial expression is added.

370
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,000
In modern times, it can be restored close to the real person.

371
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,460
So this is what was restored from your skull!

372
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,320
This is what was restored from your skull!

373
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,980
This is what was restored from your skull!

374
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,340
What?

375
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,940
Don't be silly!

376
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,840
How is it similar?

377
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,320
It's totally different from me!

378
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,580
That's the strange part.

379
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,560
It would be strange if it wasn't like this.

380
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,920
My face is like this!

381
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,040
This is the mystery of evolution.

382
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,620
It's a miracle.

383
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,060
You are classified by the evolution chart of humanity.

384
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,320
You are not compared to modern people, but to me.

385
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,640
In other words, you are evolving at your own pace.

386
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,620
You bastard!

387
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,200
If I let you say it, you'll be in a good mood.

388
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,640
You evolved at your own pace and you're a one-man army.

389
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,140
Stop talking!

390
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,860
I'm going home!

391
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,580
Hold it!

392
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,640
Don't let them escape!

393
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,880
A burglar has appeared!

394
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,860
It's a strong attack, so be careful!

395
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,720
I'm sorry.

396
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,660
What is this place?

397
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,360
I'm sorry for the trouble.

398
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,560
Ouch!

399
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,260
Ouch! Ouch!

400
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,980
I'm going to the back.

401
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,080
I did it!

402
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,520
The ultimate medicine of the 35th year of the year of the season is finally complete!

403
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,440
The 35th year of the year of the season has also passed.

404
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,400
It seems that the sword man has escaped to Aichi.

405
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,840
I see.

406
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,540
I ran away into Aichi.

407
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,040
He will have a good time.

408
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,800
I'm now going to hand you hacechiku to Aichi.

409
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,460
Yes sir!

410
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:12,960
Oh.

411
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,100
The battle has begun.

412
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,200
Oh no.

413
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,400
I'm a little upset.

414
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,600
Achi, you guys, take this!

415
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:30,980
Why did you bring me to such a place?

416
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,380
I missed you, princess.

417
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:45,060
8th

418
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,860
10th

419
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm falling apart!

420
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,660
Time for bed!

421
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,620
Excuse me?

422
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,220
Why don't you go to bed?

423
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,360
Why don't you go to bed?

424
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,860
But what happened to Ryo-chan?

425
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,620
He was looking forward to the yakiniku.

426
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,900
Yeah, he's always the most lively one, but he's strange.

427
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,720
Is he still being examined?

428
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,200
As expected, he's been eating and drinking.

429
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,700
It doesn't matter. Let's start by ourselves.

430
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,280
What do you want to eat?

431
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,240
Yes!

432
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,920
We're on the way to the show, but we have news.

433
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,960
The real person who woke up from the sleep of 55,000 years has escaped.

434
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,940
Mimmy Mimmy Mimmy...

435
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,520
Mimmy!

436
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,240
Mimmy Mimmy Mimmy...

437
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,280
Mimmy!

438
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,900
Mimmy Mimmy Mimmy...

439
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:11,580
Nico Nico Nico Nico Nico Nico...

440
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,180
Nico!

441
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,620
Nico Nico Nico Nico Nico Nico...

442
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,640
Nico!

443
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:19,760
Nico Nico Nico Nico Nico Niro

444
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,540
Nico Nico Nico Nico Nico, Nico!

445
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,280
The message about Genjin in the 55 years ago has now come in!

446
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,640
According to the speculated story,

447
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,300
It seems that the current person is running while mumbling "meat! meat!"

448
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,240
It is said that it is in a very dangerous state. Please be careful enough!

449
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,100
Found the current person! Found the current person!

450
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,460
Running towards the Kameari direction! Running towards the Kameari direction!

451
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,020
The current person is currently heading towards the Kameari direction!

452
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,200
Please evacuate the nearby residents immediately!

453
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,560
Please!

454
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,100
Phew!

455
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,600
Well, I ate it!

456
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,180
Finally, Senpai didn't come.

457
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,100
I wonder what happened.

458
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,260
See? Hey, look!

459
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,840
What's wrong? No one's here.

460
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,760
Somehow, the outside is noisy, isn't it?

461
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,180
Um, what's going on?

462
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,360
It's a genjin!

463
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,600
A genjin?

464
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,360
It's growing and it's very dangerous!

465
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,520
Ugh, meat!

466
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,800
Let me eat meat!

467
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:42,680
Meat!

468
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:43,920
Go!

469
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,980
Meat!

470
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,700
Get ready to drink!

471
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,920
Meat!

472
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,300
Let me eat my own yakiniku!

473
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:29,600
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

474
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,040
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

475
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,960
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

476
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,500
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

477
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,440
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

478
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,380
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

479
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,260
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

480
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:57,640
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

481
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,560
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

482
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:11,360
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

483
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,480
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

484
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,460
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

485
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,920
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

486
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,200
The track that used to be so bright when I was little!

487
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,720
The sweet memories, and also the promised home run

488
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,100
Tokyo Stadium!

489
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,360
It was a dream and light for me

490
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,120
Next time, "The Light's Curse"

491
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,360
See you next time!

492
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,760
There is a turtle over there

493
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,500
There must be a turtle

494
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,640
Everyone, come to our town

495
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,700
Thank you!
