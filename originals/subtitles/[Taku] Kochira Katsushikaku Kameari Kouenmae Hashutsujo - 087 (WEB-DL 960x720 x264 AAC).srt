The Two Dangerous People

26
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,300
The Two Dangerous People

27
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,580
Did you see that, Nagagawa?

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,500
It sticks perfectly in 0.4 seconds.

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,680
It's wonderful, isn't it?

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,080
I see.

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,760
It's thanks to Super Cement X.

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,260
This adhesive is too strong to be sold in Japan.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,460
It's a great product.

34
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,480
So I got it from the United States.

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,380
It's 30,000 yen a piece.

36
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,500
It doesn't matter what kind of material it is.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:06,860
I don't have to choose.

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,220
If you apply a little bit of this,

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,940
Even a heavy object like this...

40
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,900
It's just like this.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,440
It's amazing.

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,920
It doesn't come off at all.

43
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,680
It's too strong and scary.

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,740
So you have to use it.

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,040
You can only get it at the supermarket.

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,280
What if you put it on by mistake?

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,420
There's a set of neutralizers.

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,280
If you don't have this, it's a big deal.

49
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,500
It's really a modeler's specialty.

50
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,340
Kei, wait a minute.

51
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,680
Yes, sir.

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,300
Excuse me.

53
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,440
The work is fast.

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,480
There's little protrusion.

55
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,240
It's all about Super Cement X.

56
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,660
What?

57
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,640
What?

58
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,920
You idiot.

59
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,620
Hey, don't steal Super Cement X.

60
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,620
You idiot.

61
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,100
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

62
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,960
Let go, let go.

63
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,380
What are you doing?

64
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,760
Nakagawa.

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,120
Help me.

66
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,580
What happened to you?

67
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,200
Nakagawa, take this off with neutralizers.

68
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,760
I thought there was a kotatsu on the front of the kotatsu.

69
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,960
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

70
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,380
Please take your time.

71
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,620
Please take your time.

72
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,600
Oh, the neutralizers are gradually decreasing.

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,080
Idiot. Use it carefully.

74
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,820
What's going on?

75
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,820
Oh, sir.

76
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,100
I spilled the strong adhesive and the kotatsu got stuck.

77
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,680
I keep doing that all year round.

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,800
If you peel it off at once, it will come off.

79
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,340
Stop it.

80
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
The meat will come off.

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,920
Well, I have to peel it off with neutralizers little by little.

82
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,900
It's better to leave it for a while.

83
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,060
I think it's better to leave it for a while.

84
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,820
I finally became a free man.

85
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,240
Well, I'm going to get a bottle next time.

86
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:00,880
Yeah.

87
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,840
Oh, it's almost done.

88
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,360
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

90
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,180
Super Cement X.

91
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,720
What's that?

92
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,660
What's that?

93
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:16,860
It's in my pants.

94
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,420
It sticks when you touch it, chief.

95
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,360
What's with you?

96
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,960
Do something about it.

97
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,200
You won't let me do that.

98
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,100
Ouch.

99
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,700
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

100
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,500
Super Cement X.

101
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,740
It's working.

102
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,600
I don't know what will happen.

103
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,700
What?

104
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,020
Huh?

105
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,620
Huh?

106
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:42,640
Huh?

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,440
Huh?

108
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,000
Huh?

109
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,840
Huh?

110
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,740
What the...

111
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,340
What is it?

112
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,020
Let go of my hand!

113
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,200
You're a disgusting bastard!

114
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,820
No, I mean, sir.

115
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,220
I'd like to talk to you, but...

116
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,140
The glue is stuck on the wall...

117
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,220
Idiot! Get rid of it!

118
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,500
I know...

119
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,280
Hey, Nakagawa.

120
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,260
The neutralizing agent.

121
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,800
Oh, that's right.

122
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:09,920
Well, well...

123
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,140
Ow, ow, ow!

124
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,240
Sir, it hurts!

125
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,760
It hurts!

126
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:18,960
It hurts!

127
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,340
You idiot!

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,920
I told you we'd have a meeting at noon,

129
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
but you're...

130
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,320
Well, well, sir.

131
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,800
Senior,

132
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,840
do you have any other models

133
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,860
with Super Cement X?

134
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,480
Oh, that's Nakagawa for you!

135
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,640
Are you going to get rid of it?

136
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,800
Well, I think he's...

137
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,140
Oh...

138
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,540
I'm sorry, sir.

139
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,840
I was thinking about it,

140
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,720
and I'm going to Tibet to train.

141
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,800
You idiot!

142
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,900
Sir, you can't fight in a place like this!

143
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,360
Nakagawa,

144
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,480
will you get rid of it?

145
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,360
I can't do anything about it...

146
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,960
Do something, Nakagawa!

147
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,460
You're going to spill the neutralizing agent,

148
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,960
so this is what's going to happen!

149
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,260
No way!

150
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,980
No, you have to be careful.

151
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,980
You can't pull out Super Cement X

152
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,660
from my hand.

153
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,380
You're the one who didn't seal the lid properly,

154
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,960
and I'm going to say you're amazing,

155
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,000
so I'm going to get in trouble

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,160
and get beaten by a cat while I'm showing it to you.

157
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,880
That cat's going to come to the station

158
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,460
because you're the bait.

159
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,740
That's why I'm in trouble with growing up a cat.

160
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,780
If you think it's bad,

161
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,240
do something about it right now!

162
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,020
Are you listening? What are you doing?

163
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,140
I'm going to kill you!

164
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,660
0.4 seconds.

165
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,600
I'm going to kill you!

166
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:42,740
I'm going to kill you!

167
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,400
I'm going to kill you!

168
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,340
Then you're coming to the meeting.

169
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,220
Why are you bringing me here?

170
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,720
Sir, are you really going to the station like that?

171
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,720
I don't want to walk around the city in this outfit.

172
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't want to walk around the city in this outfit.

173
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,280
You're not going to join the meeting.

174
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,240
Anyway, I don't want to.

175
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,260
That's right.

176
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,980
I'm going to get the culprit and put on a handkerchief.

177
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,620
I'm going to get the culprit and put on a handkerchief.

178
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,180
Reiko, you're rude.

179
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,960
You're going to be the culprit.

180
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,340
You're stupid.

181
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,420
Whoever sees you will think you're the culprit.

182
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,420
Then,

183
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,780
how about you hold this old fridge?

184
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,100
Well, it's a natural style.

185
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,220
Is that so?

186
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,120
Then I'm going to the meeting,

187
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,620
so I'll leave the rest to you.

188
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,680
Please be careful.

189
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,640
...

190
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,040
Kei-chan,

191
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,640
why don't you eat some Soka-senbei instead of being angry?

192
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,720
...

193
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,380
...

194
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,820
...

195
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,760
...

196
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,360
Why isn't this heavy stuff in the box?

197
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,640
You're an idiot!

198
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,900
Whose responsibility is it?

199
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:49,920
...

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,320
Sir, stop!

201
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,940
What? There's no time?

202
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,860
I want to pee.

203
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,660
...

204
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,920
I don't think you can do it.

205
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,260
I can't. I'll do it in the back.

206
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,000
You idiot! The police are going to take care of it!

207
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,120
I have to hurry.

208
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,960
Welcome.

209
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,780
Sorry, can I use the bathroom?

210
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,000
No, it's in the back.

211
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,620
Chief, hurry up!

212
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,880
Be careful.

213
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,920
It's here! Hurry up!

214
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,620
Wait, Ryozu!

215
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,940
What is it?

216
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,620
It's not fair for two men to go to the bathroom.

217
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,300
There's no way. We're connected.

218
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,860
It's leaking!

219
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,680
Ryozu, wait!

220
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,600
It's leaking!

221
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,480
This is my social status.

222
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,480
What are you doing?

223
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,500
Don't touch it.

224
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,980
I have to open the zipper and pull it out.

225
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,300
Shut up! I have to touch your dirty stuff too!

226
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,300
What should I do?

227
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,320
The chief invited us.

228
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,640
I didn't invite you.

229
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,900
If you come this far, the chief will be okay.

230
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,840
I understand. Don't shout.

231
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,700
Put your pants down and get ready.

232
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,360
This is my way!

233
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,620
You're still here?

234
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,260
Yes.

235
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,580
Chief.

236
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,440
What?

237
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,420
This is the situation, so you seem excited about it.

238
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,240
N-no way. Hurry up!

239
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,280
Oh, no!

240
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,540
What do you want this time?

241
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,620
I want a bigger one.

242
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,120
I want to visit you.

243
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,080
Don't be stupid.

244
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,900
I'm already at the exit.

245
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,920
Shut up!

246
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,980
Don't pull me.

247
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,040
I'll leave with that stimulus.

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,520
I'm leaving.

249
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,660
Let's go, Ryokun!

250
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,540
Wait a minute, chief.

251
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,840
Just a little more.

252
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,180
I forgot the fridge.

253
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,000
It's okay.

254
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,220
I'm too tired to carry it.

255
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,020
I'll leave it.

256
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,700
Wait a minute, chief.

257
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,880
I haven't put on my underwear yet.

258
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,240
Chief!

259
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,420
No wonder you're sticking out like a log after all the time you've been flying around.

260
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,500
Well, this middle-aged man is walking holding hands closely, though.

261
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,340
Well, this middle-aged man is walking holding hands closely, though.

262
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,320
This middle-aged man is walking holding hands closely, though.

263
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,640
Don't know why you're doing it this way.

264
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,360
It's not unnatural to walk while dancing like this.

265
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,060
Like that.

266
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,620
Quick, quick, slow!

267
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,860
Not unnatural at all, is it, chief?

268
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,500
Don't point your finger at me!

269
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,580
He hit my hand.

270
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,120
Hey, Ryo-san!

271
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,700
Huh?

272
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,300
I've been looking for you, Ryo-san!

273
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,420
Everyone's been waiting for you since noon!

274
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,460
Why aren't you coming today?

275
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,700
What are you talking about?

276
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,420
I won't die!

277
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,420
What?

278
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,600
You're going to make a fool of yourself

279
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:18,980
for losing yesterday, aren't you?

280
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,360
Fine!

281
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,020
I won't invite you.

282
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,160
I won't!

283
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,980
If you keep acting like this,

284
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,120
you won't understand what you're doing.

285
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,400
You're completely different from everyone else!

286
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,340
You're lying to me.

287
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:35,760
Ouch! Ouch!

288
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,340
What are you doing?

289
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,700
My joints are breaking!

290
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,160
I won't see your ugly face anymore!

291
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,640
You're so annoying.

292
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,460
Oh no!

293
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Today was the day of the Kue Kue!

294
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,280
What did I do?

295
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,080
Hey, where are you going?

296
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,720
Oh, chief, I'm sorry.

297
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,080
Today was the day of the Kue Kue!

298
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,580
Kure Kure?

299
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,400
What is that?

300
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,080
It's not Kure Kure.

301
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,300
It's Kue Kue.

302
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,380
I don't care about that.

303
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,200
I'll do it after I'm late for the meeting.

304
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,460
It's popular, so it'll be sold out.

305
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,620
Shut up!

306
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,640
Get out of my way!

307
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,880
Ryo, get out of my way!

308
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,580
How can I get out of your way?

309
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,100
Oh, chief, it hurts!

310
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,980
It hurts! It hurts!

311
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,440
It hurts! It hurts!

312
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,720
It hurts, Ryo!

313
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,040
It hurts!

314
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,920
It hurts!

315
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:27,880
It hurts!

316
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,120
It hurts!

317
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,260
Don't fall over, you idiot!

318
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,240
Why, chief!

319
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,960
Speaking of which, you're the one who...

320
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,740
But you're in this position.

321
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:36,840
Chief!

322
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,740
You!

323
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,200
Why did this happen?

324
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,020
That's my line.

325
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,920
Oh, god...

326
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,160
Listen, Karin.

327
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,040
He is so bullied, doesn't he?

328
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:15,780
Chief is ville.

329
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,680
It doesn't matter if Chie had a good mind about me, or if I'll get exposed to a girl.

330
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:16,700
The invitation was a shame, but I'm happy to be here.

331
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,840
The invitation was a shame, but I'm happy to be here.

332
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,220
If you disobey me, I'll kill you.

333
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,720
If you disobey me, I'll kill you.

334
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,560
But you always say...

335
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,000
That's right.

336
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,040
Keep quiet during the meeting!

337
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,920
Ouch!

338
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,520
Yes, yes, I understand.

339
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,280
You keep on hitting me, I remember.

340
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,760
Ohara-kun, what's wrong?

341
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:42,400
Well, Ryotsu said he wanted to hold a meeting to study.

342
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,560
I understand Ryotsu-kun's intention, but that's what we want to say.

343
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,420
That's what we want to say.

344
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,480
Oh, wait, what?

345
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,560
When did he become like this?

346
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,540
Right, Ryotsu?

347
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,500
Ehehehe...

348
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,500
Next, it's about the "Hittaguri Incident" that has been happening in the city.

349
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,700
The possibility of the victim being the same as the witness is high.

350
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,620
Hey, Ryotsu, Ryotsu!

351
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,260
Wake up!

352
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,080
Ouch!

353
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,840
What's wrong, Ryotsu-kun?

354
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,180
Oh, I'm sorry!

355
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,320
I was just so nervous...

356
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,600
Damn it, Ryotsu-kun.

357
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,540
You've made me come to this ridiculous meeting, but you can't make me do anything, right?

358
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,940
That's right.

359
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,960
W-what's wrong, Ryotsu-kun?

360
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,040
Why are you suddenly taking my hand?

361
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,560
Huh?

362
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,940
Oh, it's you, Daijirou-chan.

363
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,140
You've come to the Hancho meeting, because you don't want to leave me.

364
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,240
If you do something like this in front of everyone, we'll be exposed, right?

365
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,760
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

366
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,880
W-w-what's wrong with you two?

367
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,980
I-it's a misunderstanding!

368
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,280
Oh, that's fine, Daijirou-chan. We've been exposed, so we're in love.

369
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,100
By the way, you've been holding hands for a long time.

370
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,460
When I came, we were hugging in strange clothes.

371
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,720
No, no, no! This is...

372
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,100
Daijirou-chan's hands are so plump and lovely!

373
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,980
Hey, stop it, Ryotsu!

374
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,180
Ohara-kun, I understand you well.

375
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,420
But we're in the middle of a meeting right now.

376
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,700
Don't overdo it.

377
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,240
Chief!

378
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,260
Oh, I see. I'm glad, Daijirou-chan.

379
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,940
Damn it, Ryotsu!

380
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
It ended unexpectedly early.

381
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,220
Idiot! It's all because of you that I got promoted next week!

382
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,380
Nehehehehe!

383
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,500
Oh, Chief!

384
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,220
Don't you feel hungry?

385
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,900
I'm not hungry!

386
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,680
Huh?

387
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,060
Well, you're hungry, aren't you?

388
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,080
Here, I'll have the curry.

389
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,080
Sure.

390
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,040
I'll have...

391
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,420
Let's see...

392
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,360
I'll have the Kitsune Udon.

393
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,460
Yes, curry and udon.

394
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,560
Thank you.

395
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:13,840
It's hot.

396
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,720
I'll have my own.

397
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,140
It's hot!

398
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,960
No, thank you.

399
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,800
It's hot!

400
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,560
It's hot!

401
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,100
Damn it, you did it on purpose.

402
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,820
It's hot!

403
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,720
Chief, look at this.

404
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,600
Huh?

405
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,960
It's hot.

406
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,180
It's hot.

407
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,220
It's hot.

408
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,480
It's hot.

409
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,400
Chief, you're not going to eat?

410
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,260
I told you I'm not hungry.

411
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,340
I'm sorry I ate all of it.

412
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,320
I didn't think about the chopsticks.

413
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,800
I didn't think about the chopsticks.

414
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:53,860
I ate it.

415
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,360
I ate it.

416
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,920
Chief, what are you going to do today?

417
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,460
The work hours are over.

418
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,120
I'm going home.

419
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,000
What?

420
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,520
Are you going to the countryside?

421
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,020
I've been rolling around all day today.

422
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,480
I want to take a bath.

423
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,320
Ryo has a bath, too.

424
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:11,380
I'll take a bath.

425
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,700
I just want to stay in my room.

426
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,800
I don't want to stay in your messy room.

427
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,600
I'm going home anyway.

428
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,020
I'm going home anyway.

429
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,100
Are you serious?

430
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,480
He drives a fine train like this and goes home every day, right?

431
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,240
Shut up.

432
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,980
You're walking for 15 minutes right now, and you're late.

433
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,760
You don't understand my suffering.

434
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,680
I don't know.

435
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,760
Ouch! What did you do?!

436
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,040
I didn't do anything!

437
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,440
How dare you touch my butt and give me a fling?!

438
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,960
Well, you're a police officer, aren't you?

439
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,820
R-Ryozu, did you really touch it?

440
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,260
How can you touch it in this state?

441
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,620
I-I see...

442
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,260
Hey, are you a member of the police?

443
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,220
You're a two-member police?

444
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,900
What do you mean?

445
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,340
Miss, you must be mistaken.

446
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,420
This man has been in this state for a long time.

447
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,420
Oh, come on!

448
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,080
What do you mean I'm such an over-conscious woman?

449
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,580
I'll be rude!

450
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,900
What?

451
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,900
You're holding hands with men, aren't you?

452
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,540
You pervert, pervert police officer!

453
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,800
Pervert...

454
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,880
Pervert...

455
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,760
Police officer!

456
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,800
Police officer!

457
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,380
Daijiro Ohara.

458
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,880
I'm a first-time police officer in front of Kameari Park in Katsushikaku.

459
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,140
I've been a stupid subordinate, but I've been loving people for ten years,

460
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,300
aiming to become a police officer loved by people.

461
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,660
But, but...

462
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,040
I'm a pervert police officer!

463
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,220
Ryozu!

464
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,640
I-I'm so frustrated!

465
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,160
I'm not a pervert!

466
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,040
Shut up!

467
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,920
It's terrible!

468
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,260
It's too terrible!

469
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,200
I'm a pervert!

470
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,740
I'm a pervert!

471
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm a pervert!

472
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,880
I'm a pervert!

473
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,040
Chief, we're in a real danger.

474
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,540
Chief, we'll be home soon, so cheer up!

475
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,920
What?

476
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,600
It hurts!

477
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,740
Ouch.

478
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,780
Ryozu.

479
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,000
You bastard.

480
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,800
I'll get you!

481
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,600
Ouch.

482
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,000
What?

483
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,140
Come on, Ryozu!

484
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,540
Yes.

485
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,040
That's right.

486
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,400
Auntie, I want to borrow a bicycle.

487
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,660
What?

488
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,800
Ryozu, are you okay?

489
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,940
I just put my luggage there to harvested things.

490
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,200
You can't see ahead, chief, give me an order.

491
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,960
Alright, got it!

492
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,740
Go, Ryotsu!

493
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,660
Let's go!

494
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
It's pretty good.

495
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,720
I'm a professional on a bicycle.

496
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,040
Anyway, look ahead.

497
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,420
I know.

498
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,600
Watch out! There's a obstacle ahead!

499
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,080
Turn left!

500
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,760
Turn left!

501
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,620
Yes, sir!

502
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,920
I turned left!

503
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,580
You idiot! I turned left!

504
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,900
You should have told me!

505
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,600
You just need the tools. I'll handle the handle.

506
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,180
I thought you were a craftsman.

507
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,840
It hurts!

508
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,680
Wait! I can't run anymore! Stop!

509
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,780
You idiot!

510
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,580
You idiot!

511
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,540
I'll teach you a lesson!

512
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,800
Ryotsu! Brake! Brake!

513
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,720
Brake!

514
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,080
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

515
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,720
I'll catch you!

516
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,580
What? How can you catch me when both of your hands are blocked?

517
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,400
Huh?

518
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,180
Oh, this is it!

519
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,280
What are you doing? What are you doing?

520
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,820
I took off my eyebrows!

521
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,160
I've been a model for 28 years!

522
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,200
I'll catch you!

523
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,500
Don't underestimate me!

524
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,360
I'll catch you!

525
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,760
Help me!

526
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,920
That's it.

527
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,280
It's amazing how you guys can catch a frog in that state.

528
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,580
If you get me, any kind of impossible will be possible.

529
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,700
Thanks to you, my body is damaged.

530
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,380
But you should thank Kei-chan.

531
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,060
He's been trying to help you.

532
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,920
He got a day's worth of food from the US.

533
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,840
Hey, idiot!

534
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,200
Sorry about yesterday.

535
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,640
It's okay.

536
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,700
I was so angry about that, too.

537
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,120
I was the only one who was angry.

538
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,140
I caught you!

539
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,000
I caught you! I caught you!

540
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,960
Now I can finally be free.

541
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,720
Anyway,

542
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,260
I'm going to go to the bathroom, go to the bathroom, go to bed, go to sleep, and everything will be the same as you.

543
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,180
It was the worst day.

544
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm so glad I was able to return to normal.

545
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,140
I happen to be able to arrest a criminal with this.

546
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,020
Okay.

547
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,760
I'll take this to prevent you from making models while you're on duty.

548
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,040
What?

549
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,040
No, sir.

550
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,180
Give it back.

551
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,600
It's 30,000 yen per model.

552
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,760
I don't know about that.

553
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,120
Get away, you little!

554
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,360
No way, I don't know about my modeling life.

555
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,380
I made models while I was on duty!

556
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,640
You're the one who made this!

557
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,820
Senpai, move!

558
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,980
No, Ryo!

559
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,700
Ouch!

560
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,740
It's not my fault!

561
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,700
Senpai!

562
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,860
Let me go!

563
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,820
Hey, hey, wait a minute!

564
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,880
Chihuahua! Chihuahua!

565
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,400
Someone take me!

566
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,920
What? Was Uncle Borubo a ninja?

567
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,140
And that ninja uncle

568
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,860
is taking a look at you and telling you you're a ninja school?

569
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:10,900
That's no good!

570
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,600
You have Jody, don't you?

571
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,720
Wait a minute.

572
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,620
A skinny, fat, sexy ninja.

573
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,760
This might work!

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,680
