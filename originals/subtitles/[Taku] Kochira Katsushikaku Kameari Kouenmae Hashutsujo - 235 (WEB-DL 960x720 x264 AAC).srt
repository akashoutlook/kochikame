1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,120
"When you watch TV, light up your room and watch it from a distance."

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,580
"The Little Cat"

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,760
"The Little Cat"

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:17,960
"The Little Cat"

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,880
"Come to me, the one without money!"

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,280
"I'm not there, but I'm worried."

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,400
"Look at the blue sky and the white clouds."

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,880
"It will be all right somehow."

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:57,600
"The one without a job."

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,740
"Come to me, the one without money."

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,360
"I'm not there, but I'm worried."

12
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,700
"Look, the red clouds are burning."

13
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,300
"It will be all right somehow."

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,620
"You understand, don't you?"

15
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,560
"You understand, don't you?"

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,040
"If you understand, then follow me!"

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,040
"If you understand, then follow me!"

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
"If you understand, then follow me!"

19
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,980
"If you understand, then follow me!"

20
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,620
"If you understand, then follow me!"

21
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,800
"Finding without a break!"

22
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,700
"Hmm..."

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,440
"How is it, Ryotsu?"

24
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,120
"This is terrible. I'm about to get my nails on the pedestal!!"

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,760
"Eh? W-Will you heal me, Ryotsu?"

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,700
It's an important ring I bought to celebrate my 30th wedding anniversary.

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,980
I believe the wedding anniversary is the day after tomorrow, right?

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,280
That's right. I was going to give it to my wife in secret and make her happy, but I accidentally dropped it and got caught in a fight.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,620
Until the day after tomorrow, you have to repair it immediately.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,100
If you ask the company, please prepare a repair fee of 100,000 yen.

31
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,420
Huh? Does it take that long?

32
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:29,800
This kind of technology is expensive, but I'll ask my acquaintance's workshop and let him do it for 30,000 yen.

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,880
30,000 yen? Oh, that's good. Your face is also useful sometimes.

34
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,420
Then I'll do it.

35
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,640
I asked you, Ryotsu. Whatever happens, please be in time for the day after tomorrow.

36
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,480
I know. Please trust me, Yobu-chan.

37
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,840
I can't trust you, but I'll ask Nakagawa.

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,260
I'll ask Ryotsu.

39
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,640
Please keep your promise to me.

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,560
I see.

41
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,020
Well, Ryotsu, I'll leave it to you.

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,200
Leave it to me.

43
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,300
You can't trust me?

44
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,060
That's right. I'm not asking the company.

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,420
I'll repair it myself and make a 30,000 yen profit.

46
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,860
Are you trying to trick me again?

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,720
It's okay. The director is happy that 100,000 yen is 30,000 yen.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,160
I'm coming.

49
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,180
What's wrong?

50
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,360
Reiko is making a teddy bear in the back.

51
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,940
A teddy bear?

52
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,380
Good job!

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,320
Don't you mess with that, Ryo-chan.

54
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,400
But why is she making a stuffed bear?

55
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,300
She seems to be selling it at the charity bazaar at Katsushika-cho tomorrow.

56
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,680
Cool.

57
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,400
It's even cheaper at the charity bazaar than at the charity bazaar.

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,200
How many are you going to make?

59
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,760
I'm planning to make 200.

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,680
200?

61
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,780
Reiko-san's teddy bear is very popular.

62
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,140
It's always sold out quickly.

63
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,980
Teddy bears are

64
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,560
loved all over the world.

65
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,740
There are competitions

66
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,700
where you compete with your proud teddy bear every year.

67
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,600
Hmm...

68
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,100
What's that?

69
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,920
It's a bear from a friend in France.

70
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,560
It looks old.

71
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,060
It's worn out.

72
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,220
It's worn out.

73
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,540
We'll buy it and make a new one.

74
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,820
Why would you do that?

75
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,080
In Europe,

76
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,880
when a baby is born,

77
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,600
they give a teddy bear as a present.

78
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,040
At first,

79
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,180
the teddy bear is bigger.

80
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,920
But they chase it

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,120
and share a lot of memories with the bear.

82
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,500
And when they get married,

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,620
they take it with them

84
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,620
and let the baby play with the bear.

85
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,780
I see.

86
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,320
you're going to take one teddy bear

87
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,080
with your children?

88
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,120
Isn't it cotton inside?

89
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,740
It's called a "pain-ya."

90
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,360
It's a fiber

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,420
that is wrapped in a plant called "kapok."

92
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,100
Hmm...

93
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,140
What is this?

94
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,960
It's a pellet.

95
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,720
It's to balance the weight.

96
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,180
You put it inside with the "pain-ya."

97
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,560
Oh, I see.

98
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,220
Hmm...

99
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,580
It's the same as the jewel in the manager's ring.

100
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,540
If you replace it,

101
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,820
you won't know, right?

102
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,440
The manager's eyes are like a hole.

103
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,100
Hey,

104
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,760
you're being noisy.

105
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,660
To be clear,

106
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,660
it's a nuisance.

107
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,660
It feels like there's a beast in a place

108
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,400
Hmm...

109
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
I'm sorry for the beast.

110
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,260
But you guys are not beautiful at all.

111
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,800
What did you say?

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,140
Let's go, Nakagawa.

113
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,880
Yes.

114
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:46,880
What?

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,900
Am I the only one in the way?

116
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,180
Of course.

117
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,820
Ryo-chan, if you help me,

118
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,340
you can stay.

119
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,520
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

120
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,260
I have more work to do.

121
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,760
See you.

122
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,140
Nakagawa, don't take me.

123
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,300
No, I don't want to.

124
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,220
Beep.

125
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,800
You're so annoying.

126
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,000
Thank you.

127
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,860
Thank you.

128
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,160
Thank you.

129
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:18,900
Thank you.

130
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,340
Please take care of it.

131
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,300
Yes.

132
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,100
Thank you, Saki-chan.

133
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,680
Oh, it's you, Aunt.

134
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,500
Thank you.

135
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,180
How many are left?

136
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,100
Ten left.

137
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,080
One more station.

138
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,500
You can sell it in an hour.

139
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:35,920
Thank you.

140
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:40,980
Thank you.

141
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,020
Thank you.

142
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:42,720
You guys are doing great.

143
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,040
Yes.

144
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,080
Mr. Hatsumura.

145
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,220
Ah, Mr. Saki-chan!

146
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,240
Is the ring okay?

147
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,720
Eh? Ring?

148
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,260
Oh, ring.

149
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,580
Don't tell me you forgot it.

150
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,340
Yes, I did.

151
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,680
I'll go to the jewelry store.

152
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,640
Will the repair be okay by tomorrow?

153
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,060
Well, the head of the club is worried.

154
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,160
Leave it to me.

155
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,220
What's wrong, Ryotsu?

156
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,360
No, nothing.

157
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,780
Ah, my cell phone battery is out.

158
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,780
Senior, what happened to your finger?

159
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,020
I don't know.

160
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:19,980
I thought I'd do it tonight,

161
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,240
but I didn't get it out of the box.

162
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,980
Where did it go?

163
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,460
Oh, once.

164
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,520
Senior, maybe when Reiko was making teddy bears yesterday...

165
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,100
I think there's a beast in a place full of beauties.

166
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,020
It's in that bucket.

167
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,560
Hurry up.

168
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,660
It's Reiko's teddy bear.

169
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,080
Yes, sir.

170
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,340
Thank you very much.

171
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,940
What is it?

172
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,580
Reiko, where is the teddy bear?

173
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, you want a teddy bear, too?

174
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,580
It's not that.

175
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,740
Where is it?

176
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,440
Where is it?

177
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:56,660
It's here.

178
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,740
Too bad.

179
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,940
One of the last ones just sold out.

180
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,900
You're late, Kusu.

181
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,320
What are you going to do, Senior Su?

182
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,000
There's a finger ring in there.

183
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,220
I don't know what it is,

184
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,460
but if you bought the teddy bear,

185
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,560
it's in the address of all of us.

186
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,020
Really?

187
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,280
Yes, I did it.

188
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,260
That's Reiko.

189
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,220
Hey, stop it, Ryo-chan.

190
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,060
What a fool.

191
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,640
There are 200 people in this computer.

192
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,080
What?

193
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,560
I'm trying to do my best.

194
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,280
It seems I'd do just fine.

195
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,020
No need to worry.

196
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,920
Yes, my name is Taipei.

197
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,800
Oh, when will you change?

198
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,360
- carpeting. - I don't know.

199
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,000
The shop will be jaki one month later,

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,080
but the company's going to be too tight.

201
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,600
Don't worry about it.

202
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,240
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

203
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,040
I got the shopping list!

204
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,000
There should be a ring in this teddy bear!

205
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,640
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

206
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,060
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

207
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,080
Yes?

208
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,360
It's from the police.

209
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,300
Yes... What is it?

210
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,900
Madam, you bought a teddy bear from the book bazaar.

211
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,700
Yes, what is it?

212
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,520
In fact, there is information that the drug is hidden in it.

213
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,000
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

214
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,640
What?

215
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,280
Senior, would you like to see it?

216
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,360
Yes, I'm on my way.

217
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,480
Are you sure? You can't say the truth by saying that.

218
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,820
Did you find it?

219
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,380
No, it's just a piece of junk.

220
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,060
Next! Hurry!

221
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,880
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

222
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,060
I cut the teddy bear!

223
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,580
We are the doctor of animals.

224
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,960
We will fix it right away.

225
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,400
Did you find it?

226
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,560
No, I didn't.

227
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,180
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

228
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,880
Yes?

229
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,860
It's from the police.

230
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,420
In fact, there is information that the drug is hidden in the teddy bear.

231
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,160
What?

232
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,960
But I bought this 15 years ago.

233
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,680
What?

234
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,960
Is there another teddy bear?

235
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,400
Yes.

236
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,540
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

237
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,200
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

238
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,100
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

239
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,580
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

240
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,240
About 3000.

241
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,280
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

242
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,300
By the way, there is something that I bought somewhere in here.

243
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,320
*Teddy Bear is in the shopping list*

244
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,540
I think we should find such things from this inside.

245
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,140
Yes.

246
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, it took us an hour.

247
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,180
Hurry!

248
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,820
Nakagawa!

249
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,760
Can you see me?

250
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,680
At my sense, it is suspicious here?

251
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,320
Yes.

252
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,920
Huh?

253
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,700
Yes.

254
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,680
Hi, I'm Sayuri!

255
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,940
This is my favorite!

256
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,620
What do you want?

257
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,760
Nakagawa, hurry up and get that beer!

258
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,580
I can't stand this jari-jari head!

259
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,780
Nakagawa!

260
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,840
Yes?

261
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,340
Nakagawa, hurry up and get it!

262
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,780
I can't stand it.

263
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,960
How many have we got?

264
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,360
We've only got 7.

265
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,240
We've only got 7.

266
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,540
There are 193 left.

267
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,760
Anyway, let's hurry up and get it!

268
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,820
Oh, about that stuffed animal...

269
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,560
Well, come on up.

270
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,180
That stuffed animal was bought by your grandson, right?

271
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,880
Y-Yes...

272
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,260
I think he really liked it.

273
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,400
And what about that grandchild?

274
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,940
Oh, she just left with her son and her husband.

275
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
They're so lonely that they're going to die.

276
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,000
Where did she go?

277
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,380
By bullet train.

278
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,820
By bullet train?

279
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
To Atami.

280
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,880
Atami! Nakagawa!

281
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,180
Yes!

282
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,140
And then we'll take the ferry to Oshima.

283
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,240
Hey, you!

284
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,340
To Oshima!

285
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:17,820
Yes!

286
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,540
Do you have a photo of your grandchild?

287
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,160
I don't have any photo.

288
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,960
You're just looking for a photo, but you're making me wait for 30 minutes!

289
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,980
Oh, this is bad. I'm going to die!

290
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,700
Y-You...

291
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,040
Just go full power and get to the bullet train!

292
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,460
Yes!

293
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,440
We have to hurry up...

294
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,540
Let's hurry...

295
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,820
What is it?

296
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:54,880
This isn't a good time to waste our time...

297
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
A close shot of the bullet train...

298
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,520
Is that it?

299
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:00,700
That's right.

300
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:00,940
That guy seems to have gone too far.

301
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,700
Hey, wait a second!

302
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:01,960
I think he's too tired.

303
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,500
If you keep fighting like this, you'll fall asleep!

304
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,460
Just go full power.

305
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,660
The Gate

306
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:15,960
The gate is closing!

307
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,120
Get in!

308
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,200
To think Senpai would be so reckless!

309
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,180
More importantly, it's Teddy Bear!

310
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,480
To think Senpai would be so reckless!

311
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:42,840
Where is Teddy Bear?

312
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,400
Senpai, over there!

313
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,960
It's that ferry over there!

314
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,040
Damn it! I can't let them get away!

315
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,380
Senpai!

316
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,880
Hey, that ferry over there! Wait for me!

317
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,040
It's a true obsession.

318
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:18,020
It's not here! It's not here! It's not here!

319
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,300
W-what the heck!

320
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,400
There's nothing here.

321
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,620
Damn it! Next!

322
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,140
I can't get through.

323
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,160
I can't get through.

324
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,660
We've got 199 points.

325
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
That means...

326
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,040
We've got one Teddy Bear left.

327
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,480
We've got one Teddy Bear left.

328
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,960
Minatoku Aoyama M. Christie

329
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,500
She's a foreign woman.

330
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,220
She's not the French friend Reiko was talking about.

331
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,320
She's not the French friend Reiko was talking about.

332
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,520
I have a bad feeling about this.

333
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:05,960
A bad feeling about this?

334
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,550
Did she go to France?

335
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,340
Did she go to France?

336
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,900
Her first flight was at 4:00.

337
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,820
She'll be Nari!

338
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,580
Hurry up!

339
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,260
It's time for departure!

340
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,360
It's not getting there in time!

341
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,540
Let's see whether we make it or not!

342
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:22,960
Let's see whether we make it or not!

343
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,700
How fast can we get to Moscow City!

344
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,120
Louis!

345
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,560
Captain!

346
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,120
We've received a message from Mars that the ship is being bombarded!

347
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,800
What?

348
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,260
Captain Kick!

349
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,260
We apologize for the inconvenience.

350
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,120
The ship is now in a state of emergency.

351
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,960
Please wait for a while while the customer is on the other side.

352
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,480
Are you sure you're going to do this?

353
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,940
It's a state of emergency.

354
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,540
If we don't find the ring, the captain won't be able to see it.

355
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,380
Everyone, please follow our instructions.

356
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,020
What do you mean by "explosive"?

357
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,660
Calm down.

358
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,060
There's a teddy bear in here.

359
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,240
There's a bomb in there...

360
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,280
What is this?

361
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,440
Well...

362
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,940
This is a special tour ticket for the Teddy Bear World Tour.

363
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,140
Why are you making it so complicated?

364
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,980
What should we do?

365
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,900
I know whose teddy bear it is.

366
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,980
Find the Frenchman Christy!

367
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,900
It's interesting.

368
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,760
Ah!

369
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,300
Who is it?

370
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,640
Ah!

371
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,360
Reiko was repairing it at that time!

372
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,860
I'm saved!

373
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,200
Bring that teddy bear here!

374
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,860
Damn it!

375
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,960
Why did you understand it?

376
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,120
What?

377
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,260
Senpai!

378
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,580
If you move, you'll turn on the bomb switch!

379
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,160
I told you not to move!

380
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,440
If you turn on the switch, this bomb will explode in 10 seconds!

381
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,220
No way!

382
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,420
It can't be true!

383
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,080
If you're a real tumor, there's gonna be a bomb...

384
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,200
I will show you a real one!

385
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,640
Break off!

386
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,800
We have to do it or we'll be dead meat!

387
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,520
You worked hard on your flight.

388
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,540
But it doesn't matter to you!

389
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,600
Reito!

390
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,160
Ha!

391
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,420
Reito!

392
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,400
What?

393
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,780
Ha!

394
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,680
Let's get out of here!

395
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,400
They'll have to make it so easy!

396
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,320
Senpai!

397
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,520
This is bad!

398
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I found the teddy bear for my purpose, but it's not even attached!

399
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,600
Ken-chan!

400
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,760
Nakagawa, what's going on?

401
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,880
Chief, Senpai is on that plane.

402
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,360
Ryo-chan is?

403
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,940
What does the culprit want?

404
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,560
What is he asking for?

405
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,960
That is...

406
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,640
I hate teddy bears!

407
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,340
So, gather all the teddy bears you have in the cargo room!

408
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,000
Throw them into the sea!

409
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,560
What the hell!

410
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,300
He's on that plane for that!

411
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,500
But why is he a teddy bear?

412
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,740
I don't know.

413
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,380
Ryo-chan will be the one to tell him.

414
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,980
But Senpai isn't on that plane.

415
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,920
He's on that plane!

416
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,520
My hands are numb...

417
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,680
Hurry up!

418
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,400
I'm going to throw away your teddy bears!

419
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,500
My teddy bears!

420
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,460
Don't be silly!

421
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,040
Why do you have to throw away my teddy bears?

422
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,380
I'll tell you then.

423
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,660
My name is Teddy Kumao!

424
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,520
So cute!

425
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,360
Shut up!

426
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:28,960
Shut up!

427
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,820
I don't want you to know how I feel!

428
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,500
Teddy bears, teddy bears!

429
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,700
I've been made a fool of since I was a kid!

430
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,000
If only teddy bears were not like this,

431
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,220
my life wouldn't have been like this!

432
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,100
It stinks!

433
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,160
That was my 4th birthday.

434
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,460
My relatives gathered and gave me a present.

435
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
It was all teddy bears!

436
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,080
They all gave me presents on my name!

437
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,640
Since then, I've failed in everything I do!

438
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,960
I can't marry, I can't go to college, I can't marry!

439
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,420
It's all Teddy bear's fault!

440
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,140
No, I was cursed by Teddy bears!

441
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,260
Even if I die, I can't get married!

442
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,080
You're crazy!

443
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,020
Shut up!

444
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:21,960
Captain!

445
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,400
Open the luggage room!

446
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,800
Hurry up!

447
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,020
Shut up!

448
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,280
I can't help it.

449
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,780
Now is the time to revenge!

450
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,560
Damn it!

451
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,880
Now I'm in trouble!

452
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,500
I'll get you!

453
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,220
This teddy bear is mine!

454
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,320
What's wrong?

455
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,060
It's here!

456
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,340
I've got it back!

457
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,580
The real one is here.

458
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,420
No, I was looking for here!

459
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,040
You shouldn't say that!

460
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,900
If you do anything strange, I'll activate the bomb switch!

461
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
Wait, calm down!

462
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,560
Ryotsu!

463
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,040
Don't make the culprit excited!

464
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,500
I won't let you die!

465
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,240
Ryo, hang in there!

466
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,820
Senpai!

467
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,440
Sh*t! I have to do something!

468
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,780
Take this!

469
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,440
Hurry up!

470
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,300
What's this?

471
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,560
What the hell?

472
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,240
Look at this!

473
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,440
The teddy bear with the bomb is...

474
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,740
The switch is...

475
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,160
Hey, wake up!

476
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,380
This is not the time to be in a hurry!

477
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,660
Sh*t!

478
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,480
I don't have time!

479
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,520
My ring is...

480
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,920
Thank goodness!

481
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,340
Huh?

482
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,560
This is not good!

483
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,940
Ryo!

484
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,640
Senpai!

485
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,340
Ryo! Ryo! Are you okay?

486
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,120
Look!

487
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,180
I'm safe!

488
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,460
I'm safe!

489
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,440
I'm safe!

490
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,540
I'm safe!

491
00:22:59,540 --> 00:22:59,780
Well done!

492
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,660
Well done, Ryo!

493
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,180
The ring...

494
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,780
The ring...

495
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,860
Now, I have to find it in this sea!

496
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,520
Now, I have to find it in this sea!

497
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,060
Oh!

498
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,520
It's all right!

499
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,180
I'm glad, Captain!

500
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,940
You did a great job, Ryo!

501
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm glad I found the ring, Nakagawa!

502
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,020
You did a great job!

503
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,600
Nakagawa Salveiji did his best to find the ring in that sea!

504
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,460
Nakagawa Salveiji did his best to find the ring in that sea!

505
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,560
And, you earned a lot of money!

506
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,080
But, what I found in a day was a miracle.

507
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:48,880
But, what I found in a day was a miracle.

508
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,720
A ring worth a million, huh...

509
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,220
You only become a leader because you don't know it.

510
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,440
You only become a leader because you don't know it.

511
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:28,060
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

512
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:52,800
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

513
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,940
Turn to the side with a nice breath

514
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,500
Don't get crazy, there is something to do

515
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,560
With a cute, heartfelt breath

516
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,140
What is hard to understand

517
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,360
I want to show you

518
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,100
Better than the beginning

519
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,140
It's better than starting over

520
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:24,800
Na na na na na na na na na na na na

521
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:31,120
March 3rd is my birthday

522
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,480
However, my body is in trouble on this day

523
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,960
I thought I could have a day off today

524
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,940
But why am I running around the North country with a truck on my hand?

525
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,840
Next time, March 3rd, my birthday again

526
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,200
Thank you for watching!

527
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,820
There's a turtle over there

528
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,780
There must be a turtle

529
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,760
Everyone, come to our town

530
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,860
Thank you!
