1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,080
"When you watch TV, make your room bright and try to look away!"

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,760
"I'm a little worried about my mom..."

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,200
"I'm a little worried about my mom..."

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,640
"Come to me, you poor thing!"

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,860
"I'm not here, but I'm worried about you."

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,380
"Look at the blue sky and the white clouds!"

7
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,160
"It'll be all right eventually!"

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:57,540
"I have no job!"

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,840
"I have no job!"

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,460
"Come to me!"

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,720
"I'm not here, but I'm worried about you."

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,000
"Look at the burning red clouds!"

13
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,180
"It'll all be all right eventually!"

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,540
"Do you get it?"

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,560
"I get it! I get it!"

16
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,980
"If you do, just come to me!"

17
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,120
"Come and follow me!"

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,500
The End

19
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,900
Lemon, what's wrong?

20
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,920
Why are you looking at me like that?

21
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,200
Oh, Kankichi.

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,560
When I came with my family,

23
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,800
they said that the summer vacation was coming to an end,

24
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,940
so they brought me somewhere.

25
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,280
What? Is that so?

26
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,000
It's not like that. Look at this.

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,540
Oh, it's a picture diary.

28
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,140
I was drawn to it when I was a kid.

29
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,860
It's nostalgic.

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,020
Which one?

31
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,620
Huh? I went to the pool.

32
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,660
It was fun.

33
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,580
I took a walk with Mikan.

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,320
It was hot.

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,160
I went to the pool. It was fun.

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,240
And the rest is the same.

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,800
Hahaha.

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,320
There's only one different one.

39
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,460
What's this?

40
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,700
My relative Kankichi came to help the store.

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,460
He was drunk and

42
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,000
danced naked with the customer.

43
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,180
It was embarrassing.

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,540
Don't write such a thing!

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,500
It can't be helped.

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,940
He didn't take me anywhere for the summer vacation.

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,700
Geppardo, take him.

48
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,480
Well, that's right.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,880
Kankichi, take him somewhere.

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,040
Me?

51
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,840
I'm counting on you, Kankichi.

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,600
I can't take him anywhere.

53
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,340
But he's the one who comes first.

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,460
You don't have a good friend,

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,140
but you have a good friend.

56
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,920
Then I can't go.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
It's better to work part-time here.

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,280
Grandpa.

59
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,200
I got it.

60
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,140
I'll pay for my part-time job and transportation.

61
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,900
I'll pay for my part-time job and transportation.

62
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,940
Remon, I'll work for you.

63
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Okay, okay.

64
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,220
You're not as cute as you are.

65
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,880
So, where are you off to?

66
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,320
A mountain or a beach?

67
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:34,940
It is.

68
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,960
Remon's into the love of the people.

69
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,100
The love of the people?

70
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,360
A female ninja of the new princess.

71
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,360
Oh, the old کےのお銀 .

72
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,780
Well, I'm a strong ninja and

73
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm pretty cool.

74
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,740
Hey, Kankichi, I wanna see the real ninja.

75
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,880
The real ninja...

76
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,020
Yeah, then we have a friend.

77
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,040
Really, Kankichi?

78
00:03:59,440 --> 00:03:59,680
Yeah.

79
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,540
Grandpa Borubo is running a library in Kagoshima that has a ninja mansion.

80
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,440
Sounds fun.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
I want to go there too.

82
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,820
Kyushu...

83
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,300
There are nice hot springs there, so I want to go there too.

84
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,640
Let's go, let's go.

85
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,580
The more you travel, the more fun it is.

86
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,620
Lemon will become a ninja.

87
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,800
The End

88
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,760
It's like a historical drama.

89
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,280
There's no transition.

90
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,680
There must be a ninja in this place, Kankichi.

91
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,840
Yeah, we'll be able to meet a real ninja soon.

92
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,140
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

93
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,520
Hmm, I'm a little worried if you expect too much.

94
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,360
Well, whatever.

95
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,580
Oh, it's a ninja-like house.

96
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,140
Yeah!

97
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,400
Hmm, this is pretty serious.

98
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,200
Stop it, Gesbro!

99
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,880
Hm?

100
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,240
What is it, Kankichi?

101
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,620
You hear me? This is, in fact, a house for ninja.

102
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,460
Look carefully.

103
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,220
Ah~!

104
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,080
It 테ke about the trap to prevent intruders from the outside.

105
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,300
I won't set such a dangerous trap!

106
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,460
Ouch!

107
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,300
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch...

108
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,280
If you miss one step, you'll hurt Lemon to hell.

109
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm just set it up.

110
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,780
I'm not!

111
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,080
Kankichi, how do you get in the house?

112
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,200
Hmm? Ah...

113
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,800
Well, I think...

114
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,820
Oh, I know, I know.

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,320
Here we go.

116
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,480
Hmm?

117
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,180
Hmm...

118
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,140
Huh?

119
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,080
Wow!

120
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,560
Amazing! It's a real deal!

121
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:51,660
It's so nice!

122
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,120
Old Man Goldbeard, are you there?

123
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,660
Are you free?

124
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,680
Well, I've informed you that you're coming.

125
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,640
I'll wait for you up there.

126
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,360
Hmm?

127
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,260
Yeah.

128
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,760
Oh, I see.

129
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,760
Oh.

130
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,560
Hey, Kankichi! It's Shuriken!

131
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,920
Well, it's a ninja mansion after all.

132
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,460
Amazing!

133
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,560
Huh? What is it? You're here.

134
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:19,640
What's wrong?

135
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,500
You look like you're asleep.

136
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,620
It's not a big deal that the guests are coming all the way here, but they don't notice.

137
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,940
Well, it can't be helped.

138
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,260
All right.

139
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,080
All right.

140
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,100
All right.

141
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,100
Hmm?

142
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,220
Hmm?

143
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,380
Hmm?

144
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,820
Hmm?

145
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,260
Hmm?

146
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,300
Hmm?

147
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,060
Oh, I'm not sleeping!

148
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,820
Oh, wait, wait, it's 3:00, I should have just woke you up already.

149
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,580
I still have half an hour.

150
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,700
Oh, it's Ryotsu.

151
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,220
What are you doing?

152
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,820
Flash mode?

153
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,100
Huh?

154
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,900
Hey, hey.

155
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,440
This Otsugi wants to meet with a ninja.

156
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,260
A fire flower?

157
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:08,540
A lemon?

158
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,240
I'll buy the fire flower.

159
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:09,680
Huh?

160
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,380
Oh, sure.

161
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, sure.

162
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,980
Mmm...

163
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,120
Do you eat or talk?

164
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,300
I don't know which one to talk about.

165
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,240
I thought you were a little shy.

166
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,420
You're a naughty kid.

167
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,200
I've been watching a lot of historical dramas.

168
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,580
That's why I'm talking like this.

169
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,440
I'm interested in the people who like historical dramas at that age.

170
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,100
Let's all do ninja training together.

171
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,540
Yeah! I want to be a ninja!

172
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,400
You look good, Lemon.

173
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,960
You're cute.

174
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,120
Is that so?

175
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,520
That's strange, Debalt.

176
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,940
Shut up! I'm going to calm down.

177
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,360
I don't want to get in the way of your movement.

178
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,440
Why am I the only one in this costume?

179
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,940
That's the special version of Kunoichi.

180
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,760
Big ears to find enemies.

181
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,040
Chain shoulders to protect yourself.

182
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,140
Can you wink?

183
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,780
Like this?

184
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,100
The way you look when you confuse enemies is exactly what Kunoichi looks like.

185
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,200
I see.

186
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,520
That's not strange at all.

187
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,680
Wow, that's great.

188
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,480
That's a new kind of ninja style.

189
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,960
Yeah, it's pretty good.

190
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,860
This old man can't use that kind of ninja style.

191
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,640
What? Is he wearing a mask?

192
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,600
And he's got a good kick.

193
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,500
I guess you should stop.

194
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,100
Where's Kogane-maru?

195
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,680
He's sleeping over there.

196
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,480
He's more like a ninja than Kogane-maru.

197
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,700
Master...

198
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,420
I'm gonna...

199
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,240
Don't make such a rough sound in front of me, you idiot!

200
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,280
Master, I'm terribly sorry.

201
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,040
Thank you for your help, but I have to go out of here today.

202
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,940
What? You're going to go out of here too?

203
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,540
Go ahead!

204
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,120
Go ahead!

205
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,060
There's no one here, and my apprentice won't let me go.

206
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,300
This is the end of the line.

207
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,760
This is all because of the Ninja Land we built next door.

208
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,780
Ninja Land?

209
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,840
What's that?

210
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,500
That's the Ninja Land.

211
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,040
There are so many buses and cars!

212
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,440
And I'm gonna go home, I think.

213
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,360
Isn't that a theme park?

214
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,440
Right, it is.

215
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,560
The theme park was recently abolished due to lack of pay for my apprentices' expenses.

216
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,520
I think you should have run away.

217
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,380
If I do, I'll become like an offender, too.

218
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,820
Can I somehow bring another tourist back over here, Lyotsu?

219
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,400
I don't know!

220
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,880
I'm not interested in you.

221
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,560
Let's go!

222
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,760
Wait, Kankichi!

223
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,720
What?

224
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,780
You're watching people in trouble,

225
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280
and you're leaving without doing anything.

226
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,740
Are you a man?

227
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,060
Lemon.

228
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,860
Lemon, you shouldn't be involved in this.

229
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,200
Grandma, I'll definitely save you if you're a police officer.

230
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,880
That's a TV story.

231
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,760
Even if everyone goes home, Lemon will save this old man.

232
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,100
Lemon?

233
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,120
As expected of you, Princess Lemon.

234
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,560
Princess Lemon?

235
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,320
For seven years of labor...

236
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,200
So cute!

237
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,560
Princess Lemon, I'll risk my life to protect you.

238
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,320
Hey! We're talking about something else!

239
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,120
Don't use the child as a tool!

240
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,700
You're kidding, right?

241
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,100
That's a very good trick.

242
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,420
What?

243
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,520
What?

244
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,440
What?

245
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,780
It's a trick to replace the child.

246
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,300
Damn it, I'm a little frustrated.

247
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,240
I can't help it.

248
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,200
Let's take a break for Lemon.

249
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,900
Hey, stop it!

250
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,400
You're mean!

251
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,780
That's not what I'm doing.

252
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,980
I'm going out to kill you.

253
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,820
Extremely annoying.

254
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,660
I still haven't llegaed to my needs at all.

255
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,500
Just let me go.

256
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,160
Do you need help?

257
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,360
What you're doing is not fair.

258
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,720
I'm worried you'll get sick.

259
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,060
I'd better not.

260
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,420
Is there ever going to be a time when you're a fairy like this?

261
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,620
I'm leaving!

262
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,140
Now, what are you looking at?

263
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,580
I just want to see that beautiful complex.

264
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,040
Amazing!

265
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,460
Ugh...

266
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,160
There are so many people here.

267
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,460
No matter how you think about it, you won't win.

268
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,560
Ryo-tsu, don't say it so easily.

269
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,080
It can't be helped, it's the truth.

270
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,740
Hankichi!

271
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,100
Huh?

272
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,840
It can't be helped.

273
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,940
How about a sandwich and juice?

274
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,300
Huh?

275
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,920
Please give me one.

276
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,100
Yes.

277
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,880
Aha!

278
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,080
Hey, don't be so serious!

279
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
That's why I'm a man.

280
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,300
How about tea and lunch?

281
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,920
One Ninja lunch.

282
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,660
Hey, hey.

283
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,420
Hmm.

284
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,620
I just saw this, but I knew it wouldn't be possible at a ninja house.

285
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,480
I wonder if Sanada-style ninja land is something that can't be helped.

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,920
Ryo-tsu, Hime.

287
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,960
Hmm.

288
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,700
Huh?

289
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,680
Ah!

290
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,380
Huh?

291
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,620
Who are you?

292
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,260
Ryo-tsu, Hankichi!

293
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,780
Who is this flashy woman?

294
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,520
When I was looking for Tokugawa's hidden treasure at the spring party last year,

295
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,420
I found a female boss of a thief from Sanada Yukimura's descendants who was trying to take a side trip.

296
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,500
Give me the treasure!

297
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,580
Take this!

298
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,560
Take this!

299
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,180
Take this!

300
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,220
Oh yeah!

301
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,180
Huh?

302
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,900
Oh yeah!

303
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,100
What?

304
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,560
What's up with this girl?

305
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,760
She's the owner of Ninja Land.

306
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,940
What?

307
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,180
Huh?

308
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,860
I didn't think you were a friend with the owner of that crappy ninja house next door.

309
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,580
Shut up!

310
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,240
What are you doing here?

311
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,100
You were arrested along with your friends and sent to jail.

312
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,420
I'm a ninja.

313
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,020
If you're interested in me,

314
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,440
gonyogonyogonyo.

315
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,180
Ah?

316
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,220
Hey!

317
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,400
Hey! I'm sorry for the poor, messy, shabby ninja house!

318
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,840
I-I didn't mean to say that...

319
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,060
Well, I'm busy! Excuse me!

320
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,920
I have to make money to rebuild the house!

321
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,260
Wait, Meitsune!

322
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,480
Now that you know you're the president here, you're getting motivated!

323
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,400
That's right, Ryotsu!

324
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,100
Come on, let's have a game!

325
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,560
Huh? A game?

326
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,860
A game?

327
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,340
Who's stronger, my Saigo-ryu ninja or your Sanada-ryu ninja?

328
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,440
Let's have a match between the ninja!

329
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,020
Interesting!

330
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,340
I'll take it!

331
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,380
If I win,

332
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,980
I'll destroy this annoying ninja house right away!

333
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,180
Sounds good!

334
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,020
Then if I win, I'll have you leave right away!

335
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,080
Heh, that sounds good!

336
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,840
Sanada-ryu ninjutsu can't beat the local ninjutsu!

337
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,460
Right?

338
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:50,840
Right?

339
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,080
When's the match?

340
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,400
Tomorrow at 12:00.

341
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
The venue is here.

342
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,360
That's great!

343
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,620
Grandpa, you should be ready to move out today!

344
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,620
Ahahaha!

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,480
Grandpa, you're okay with that kind of promise?

346
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,720
That's right!

347
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,480
A ninja match...

348
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,340
No way!

349
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,760
What?

350
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,300
If you're a decent ninja, you'll be a good match for Ryotsu!

351
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,400
What?!

352
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,180
If you're a coward, no one can beat you!

353
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:17,940
Hahaha!

354
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,000
Right, that's right!

355
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,900
You're the same as me!

356
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,300
There's no way you can beat me here!

357
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,400
Let me do this for you.

358
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,740
Of all things, I'll definitely beat you!

359
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,700
Ok!

360
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,660
Off to the Great Manga!

361
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,940
Where's the national media?

362
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,380
What's going on here?

363
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,280
Kankichi, is that you?

364
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,460
I don't know.

365
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,840
Then who is it?

366
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,920
Huh?

367
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,900
Ah...

368
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,240
Hahahaha!

369
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,580
My phone's ringing!

370
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,600
It's a good opportunity to promote our Sanada-style ninja and Ninja Land.

371
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,980
That woman ninja is pretty good.

372
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,340
Damn, Houei-ken, did you have that plan?

373
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,100
The game is whether to make the opponent say "Maita" or "Kizetsu".

374
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,780
Also, if you fall on the ground, you lose.

375
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,860
Kunoichi has two of them, and Yoboyama has two of them.

376
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,800
There is a chance to win.

377
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,420
No, even if they are in love, they are the descendants of Sasuke Sarutobi and Saizo Kirigakure.

378
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,940
You shouldn't underestimate them.

379
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,540
Then, the first ninja to the center!

380
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,260
I won't stop you because you are a woman!

381
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,340
I hope so.

382
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,460
Matoi, do your best!

383
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,120
Fight!

384
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,360
Take the Naginata that the dog trained you!

385
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,180
Take it!

386
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,480
You're really good, Chii-chan!

387
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,120
Now it's my turn to attack.

388
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,140
Big Chou Kabo!

389
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,520
Kamagaeru!

390
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,920
I give up!

391
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,440
No!

392
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,280
You must endure it and somehow escape!

393
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,220
I will endure it, Matoi!

394
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,040
No way!

395
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,520
You are a bad girl. You can't escape!

396
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,900
Get up!

397
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,140
Get up!

398
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,700
Matoi!

399
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,520
Oh, no!

400
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,640
Now, I'll give you a hard time!

401
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,480
Hey, Renma!

402
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,920
This is my last blow!

403
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,600
But, it's still not over, Matoi!

404
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,040
Take a blow!

405
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,560
No, you were right!

406
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,860
Don't feel sorry to accept her!

407
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,480
Oh!

408
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,540
Don't think that you can defeat me!

409
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,460
You are the worst!

410
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,940
No way!

411
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,100
How dare you!

412
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,800
Don't give up!

413
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,340
No, you don't!

414
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,820
Oh, no!

415
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,840
That was a good one, Matoi!

416
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,780
Now, it's the next match.

417
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,500
Kamako Yuri vs. Kankichi Ryo.

418
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm counting on you, Kamako.

419
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,820
Alright, it's my turn.

420
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,860
That's wrong.

421
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,460
It's the last one, Kanemaru.

422
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,780
Is it alright to change it?

423
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,000
Oh, really?

424
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,700
I understand. Go ahead.

425
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,900
Is it alright?

426
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,040
Wait a minute.

427
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,880
You're the champion, aren't you?

428
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,580
You should beat the opponent and take the lead.

429
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,700
I thought the opponent was a woman.

430
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,180
You're a scumbag old man.

431
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,180
One of the Sanada Jyu-Yu-Shu.

432
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,860
Kamakosuke Yuri's grandchild's grandchild's grandchild's grandchild's grandchild's grandchild's grandchild's

433
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,740
Kamako Yuri.

434
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,440
Now, let's have a fair match!

435
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,000
Now, come at me from anywhere.

436
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,900
NINPO.

437
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,880
I'll give it to you!

438
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,120
Oh, no!

439
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,960
Damn it.

440
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,640
What a hopeless old man.

441
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,980
It can't be helped.

442
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,320
I'll go next.

443
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,000
Grandma, I'm counting on you.

444
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,380
If you don't beat me, I'll beat you to death.

445
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,100
Grandma, use that NINPO right now.

446
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,700
Put it on, Kanakichi.

447
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,380
Yes, ma'am.

448
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,740
What are you doing?

449
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,800
I'll treat you to a super Kanda sushi made by Kanda Myojin.

450
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,660
What's your favorite story?

451
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,020
T-Take it.

452
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,640
Here you are.

453
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,040
Wait a minute.

454
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,060
It's delicious.

455
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,600
Next, I'll give you octopus and kohada.

456
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,900
Here you are.

457
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,160
Yes, ma'am.

458
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,160
Next, I'll give you sea urchin and salmon.

459
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,740
Yes.

460
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,020
Eel and sea urchin and salmon.

461
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,360
Next, I'll give you hawthorn and squid.

462
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,220
One more time.

463
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,120
Wasabi.

464
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,680
Wasabi.

465
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,820
Here you are.

466
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,240
You want to fight me?

467
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,820
Wasabi!

468
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:25,780
Water.

469
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,180
Water.

470
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:26,760
Water.

471
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,180
The team of Saigo and the team of Sarutobi and Sasuke is the winner!

472
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,600
We did it!

473
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,060
Grandma.

474
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,340
NINPO can't eat sushi!

475
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:37,580
I'm not eating!

476
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,120
Both of them!

477
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,500
I won't lose anymore! I can fight easily!

478
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,640
I can't give up on Ninja Land, which is so popular.

479
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,380
I'll win no matter what and take it to the draw!

480
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,660
Saito!

481
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,400
Take this!

482
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,560
Ha ha, what a shame!

483
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,860
It seems like my sword skills are better than that of a police officer!

484
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,000
Even without a sword, I can use Ninja Land!

485
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,820
Take this!

486
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,720
Wow, it's a full-fledged kill!

487
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,240
-I can't! -Now!

488
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,200
Kankichi, watch out!

489
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,860
That was close!

490
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,460
You used your dirty hands!

491
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,260
What's Ninja Land?

492
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,500
Ninja Land, the killer form!

493
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,560
Ah, full-fledged kill!

494
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,080
Damn, you tricked me!

495
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,380
I didn't trick you.

496
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,700
I told you, it's a form-fledged skill.

497
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,320
There's a real one inside.

498
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,240
What? Where? Where?

499
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,640
What about this?

500
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,040
Ninja Land, the killer form!

501
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,420
Take this!

502
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,300
Take this!

503
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,760
Take this!

504
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,500
Take this!

505
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,240
What? I don't know which one is real!

506
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,180
Kankichi, it's a shadow!

507
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,760
The real one is in the shadow!

508
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,600
Shadow?

509
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,760
That's it!

510
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,520
Yeah!

511
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:02,660
Okay!

512
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,640
Kankichi, this is a real one!

513
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,240
-A real one! -We can't get to anybody else!

514
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,360
A…

515
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,020
The real one!

516
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,380
That's it!

517
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,260
Here.

518
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,400
That's it!

519
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,200
Take this!

520
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,320
Okay!

521
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,560
That's it!

522
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:17,700
It's a ghost!

523
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,380
What happened?

524
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:31,860
It's a real one!

525
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,160
Everyone, arrest them for the purpose of exorcism!

526
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,120
Exorcism? Haruka, you!

527
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,880
Wait, you're not going to stop!

528
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,360
You bastard, where did you go?

529
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,880
Over there!

530
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,060
It's a shame.

531
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,760
Farewell!

532
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,820
They're...

533
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,920
Ryotsu, use this!

534
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,760
Stop!

535
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,560
Stop!

536
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,040
Alright!

537
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,440
My mansion...

538
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,880
will be destroyed!

539
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,460
Ryotsu!

540
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,180
What's that?

541
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,220
Why don't you get it?

542
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,340
I'm the same as you, you!

543
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,980
Look at you, you!

544
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Don't try to talk back!

545
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,300
You're so bad, you'll pay for it!

546
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,860
The water soon went out!

547
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,760
The lanterns may not be around anymore.

548
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,860
They're still there.

549
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,840
Spare me a while!

550
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,680
California, do you have a macchiari?

551
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,060
California, no macchiari.

552
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,240
This is not America.

553
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,500
I'm sorry, sir.

554
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,500
Excuse me.

555
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,040
Yes, sir.

556
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,540
Then, kushiage, kakiage, katsuage, whatever, age, age, what was it?

557
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,260
What do you recommend?

558
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,560
Be careful with only katsuage.

559
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,100
Huh? Is that a father joke?

560
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,240
Soon?

561
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,160
Yes, I'm sorry.

562
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,840
I have no idea.

563
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,600
Huh? Huh? Huh? What? What? What? Really?

564
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,020
Yes, please come in.

565
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,400
Yes, please.

566
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,180
Yes, please.

567
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,180
Yes, please.

568
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,500
Welcome.

569
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,300
Welcome.

570
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,640
Welcome!

571
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,680
Welcome!

572
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,080
Welcome!

573
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,460
Wow! I was surprised!

574
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,980
I thought it was someone else from elementary school

575
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,740
but it was Omaari Sensei!

576
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,240
He's still alive!

577
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,240
It's been decades but he hasn't changed at all!

578
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,400
Eh?

579
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,740
The secret to his youth is because he's in love?

580
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,360
Next time!

581
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,540
"The Sensei is a Hachamecha Grandpa!"

582
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,180
Please watch!

583
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,260
Next time!

584
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,160
"The Sensei is a Hachamecha Grandpa!"

585
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,460
Please watch!

586
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,540
"The Sensei is a Hachamecha Grandpa!"

587
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,480
Please watch!

588
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:00,920
Thank you!
