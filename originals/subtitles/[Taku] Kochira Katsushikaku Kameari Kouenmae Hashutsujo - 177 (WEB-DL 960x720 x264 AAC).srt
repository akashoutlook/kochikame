1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,340
The End

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,900
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,900
Make the room bright and try to get away

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:25,220
It's like someone is calling

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,180
After the rain

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,580
I walked with a look back

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,080
At the end of the rain

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,200
I held your hand

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
I felt

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,500
A strange feeling

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,120
So I tried to walk

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,060
On the black tile outside the arcade

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,740
Who is it?

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,560
Once I was a child

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,020
But everyone forgets

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,260
A politician with a big face

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,820
And a blue aunt above my eyes

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,340
Turn around

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,000
That corner

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,800
I can see everyone

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,020
There is a wall

22
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,960
I know that there is a wall

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,180
It's a vastiiit

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,380
There is a place

25
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,740
I can see

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:32,900
Over there

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,340
There is a wall

28
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,820
There is a wall

29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,220
And behind me

30
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,320
There are several values

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,340
There are manyي

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,680
And there is no down

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,960
And I can see

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:53,160
There are two environment

35
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,600
Genki High School is heading toward Matsudo with a red Ferrari.

36
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,040
Damn it! He's so stubborn!

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,700
Chidan, it's my turn!

38
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm going to lose!

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,680
Yes!

40
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,380
Big brother, there's still one left!

41
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,320
What?

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,480
I'm going to beat him.

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,380
But I'm also a man called Akagi Yama's red water student.

44
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,680
Can you catch up with me?

45
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,180
I won't let you chase me to a place like this!

46
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,920
What on earth is this place?

47
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,200
I think it's in between Chiba and Ibaraki.

48
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,460
What?

49
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,640
It's gone!

50
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,420
Ouch...

51
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,820
It's over!

52
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,680
It's the last one!

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,080
Damn it! It's the gas!

54
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm going to run away, Chidan!

55
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:09,940
Wake up!

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,720
No, no, no!

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

58
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,620
No, I can't!

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,740
I can't get inside!

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,460
I can't!

61
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,220
They're running away!

62
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Pull forward!

63
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,020
Yes, sir!

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,480
It's a trap!

65
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,140
Trust me!

66
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,300
What?

67
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,920
What's wrong with him?

68
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,120
Did he pull the trigger?

69
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,240
No, he didn't hit me.

70
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,660
Are you all right?

71
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,660
Please be strong.

72
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,120
Where's the criminal?

73
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,720
I don't think he's gone far yet.

74
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,160
But where on earth is this place?

75
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,980
I'm sure he knows.

76
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,560
It looks like the uniform of the former Japanese army.

77
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,300
I think he played survival games.

78
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,040
He used a model gun with a old-fashioned gun like this.

79
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,880
Get up!

80
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,380
I'll shoot you when you wake up!

81
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,900
Like this.

82
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,600
It's a real gun!

83
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,700
Give me back my gun!

84
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,640
It's dangerous.

85
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,600
Guns are the soul of the police officer.

86
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,940
Police officer?

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,220
Don't be surprised!

88
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,620
You two, come out slowly.

89
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,400
Who are you talking to?

90
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,620
I don't know.

91
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,820
No matter how much you hide, you can't.

92
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,060
I can see it.

93
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,980
Your body looks like a balloon.

94
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,300
It's an airbag.

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,040
Is that so?

96
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,900
Don't come out!

97
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,820
Airbag!

98
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,060
You don't even know the airbag?

99
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,480
It's dangerous to get close to the police.

100
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,340
They are the most evil people who committed a terrible crime.

101
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,800
What's that?

102
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,440
What crime did you commit?

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,660
Speed violation.

104
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,840
Idiot.

105
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,820
This is how it is.

106
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,860
What's this?

107
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,180
You used a strange technique.

108
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,840
By the way, you look at it with one eye.

109
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,920
Who are you?

110
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,100
I'm the chief of the Ryotsu-Kakichi police station in the Katsushika prefecture.

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,220
Chief of the police station?

112
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,080
I'm sorry for not knowing that.

113
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,660
I'm the chief of the Imogashira police station.

114
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,360
Imogashira?

115
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,320
Actually, we were in this car.

116
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,160
What?

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,300
What?

118
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,640
Even though you are the chief of the police station, you can't commit a crime.

119
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,800
We were chasing the criminal.

120
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,100
Chasing the criminal?

121
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,840
That's right.

122
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,000
We chased the criminal who stole 50 million yen in cash and came from Tokyo.

123
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,800
50 million yen?

124
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,800
You suddenly jumped out of the car and ran away.

125
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,180
This car looks like a patrol car.

126
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,980
What's this car?

127
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,520
What do you mean?

128
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,980
I'm sorry for dying.

129
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,720
Idiot, stop it.

130
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Let me go.

131
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,500
I have something to ask you.

132
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,240
I can't let you die here.

133
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,060
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,240
Don't be so harsh.

135
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,220
I'm an officer.

136
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,780
Tell me what to do from now on.

137
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,220
If you catch the criminal, you can be punished.

138
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,320
You can be punished.

139
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,360
Please help us.

140
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:53,980
Yes.

141
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,380
First of all, tell me where this is.

142
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,460
Is it Chiba Prefecture?

143
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,220
Or Ibaraki Prefecture?

144
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,260
No, this is Doinaka Prefecture.

145
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,780
Doinaka Prefecture?

146
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,460
I don't know.

147
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,080
I got in touch with the Japanese government last week.

148
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,400
Now I'm applying to be on the Japanese map.

149
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,420
What do you mean?

150
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,800
I don't know.

151
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,620
So you were in the situation of Shouichi Yokoi?

152
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,700
Is this Japan?

153
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,440
Even if you say Yokoi or Onoda,

154
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,240
your children wouldn't understand me.

155
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,620
Even if you tell me?

156
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,140
I would like to ask this question.

157
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,080
What year is this year?

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,920
This year is Showa 75.

159
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,740
Showa ended over ten years ago.

160
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,580
This year is Heisei 12.

161
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,100
Really?

162
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,300
Really?

163
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,340
Yeah.

164
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,960
Oh, by the way, we were following the culprit.

165
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,600
I'll put the contact information in the book.

166
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,360
No, it looks like it's broken.

167
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,360
Huh? Where's the cell phone?

168
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,660
Outside the prefecture.

169
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,460
It's not impossible in a place like this.

170
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,940
Oh, is there a phone somewhere?

171
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,100
I think it's somewhere in the village.

172
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,560
Okay, guide me.

173
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,880
This week is the traffic control week.

174
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,360
How many people have you been looking for?

175
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,900
There are no criminals in the last 50 years.

176
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,280
It's a tricky case.

177
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,780
Dog? No, it's not.

178
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,180
It's a wolf.

179
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,400
It's a wolf that was supposed to be extinct.

180
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,060
If you get close, you'll hit it.

181
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,740
There's a wolf herd around here.

182
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,320
What a place.

183
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,280
That's a land.

184
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,520
There's a military base nearby.

185
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,720
There's so much.

186
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,320
If the director of the environmental department sees it, he'll cry and be happy.

187
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,340
No way, is this a mountain cat with a mouth?

188
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,420
It's just a stray cat.

189
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,020
Oh, I see.

190
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,040
I saw it.

191
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,540
You saw it, right?

192
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,380
That's Doinaka Prefecture, Doinaka Village.

193
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,460
Wow.

194
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,740
Grandma.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,940
Marry me.

196
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,860
Over here, please.

197
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,120
Thank you for coming.

198
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,360
Do you know anyone?

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,740
People from Tokyo.

200
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,360
Tokyo?

201
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,940
That's quite a long-winded phone call.

202
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,020
I suspected it.

203
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,860
I was thinking, but I can't believe it's this far...

204
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,220
Here's the telephone exchange certificate.

205
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,620
Exchange certificate? Isn't it a direct connection?

206
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,920
What? Direct connection?

207
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,160
No way, senpai.

208
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,060
I've seen it. It seems that the level of civilization has stopped 20 years ago.

209
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,000
I see.

210
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,480
Excuse me, which way do you want to connect?

211
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,980
I'll take a long distance to Tokyo.

212
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,080
Tokyo?

213
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,080
I'm sorry, but I can't make long distance calls right now.

214
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,780
What? That's not helpful at all.

215
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,960
No, it's not.

216
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,000
I can't run the electricity line to the house in the village.

217
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,100
I want to call Tokyo.

218
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,420
They're negotiating with the power plant to get a telephone line.

219
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,300
NTT, right?

220
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,400
That's right.

221
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,680
I can't understand foreign language.

222
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,960
What should we do, senpai?

223
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,620
It's dangerous to return to that mountain road.

224
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,920
Then, we should stay at our house tonight.

225
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,440
There are many mountains.

226
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,860
We don't need to hold back.

227
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,680
Let's eat.

228
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,880
It's delicious.

229
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,240
The old cucumber tasted like this.

230
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,640
What are you talking about?

231
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,080
The old cucumber is the old cucumber.

232
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,360
I see.

233
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,000
It's good that it's from the past.

234
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,120
What?

235
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,200
I've been wondering about it for a while.

236
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,420
What is it?

237
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,300
It's a side dish I bought at the convenience store.

238
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,180
I'll make it for myself.

239
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,940
This is a side dish of a person from Tokyo.

240
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,020
Please give me some hot water.

241
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,340
I'll make it so that you can eat it.

242
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,820
Please.

243
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,180
Here you are.

244
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,980
This is Chinese soba.

245
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,120
It's very convenient.

246
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,980
Do people in Tokyo eat this every day?

247
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,580
It's not every day.

248
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,160
I eat it almost every day.

249
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,600
What's this?

250
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,500
Coke.

251
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,560
This is a drink that I bought after the war.

252
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,360
Try it.

253
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,160
It's a black liquid.

254
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,360
It exploded in my mouth.

255
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,940
It's a drink like that.

256
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,920
What is it?

257
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,940
Next.

258
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,680
This is a Tokyo soba.

259
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,940
It's the first time I've seen people from other villages.

260
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,880
It's not fake.

261
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,680
It's the first time I've seen people from Tokyo.

262
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,260
It's the first time I've seen people from other villages.

263
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,900
Is it true that Tokyo is bright and bright all night long?

264
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,780
Is it true that everyone speaks English?

265
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,780
Is it true that everyone is dressed like this?

266
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,720
No way.

267
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,200
Only a small number of girls in Tokyo do this.

268
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,940
This is how Tokyo is misunderstood.

269
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,100
I see.

270
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,860
It's interesting, so let's take a picture.

271
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,440
Oh.

272
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,840
There was a disposable camera.

273
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,440
A photo?

274
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,660
Then I'll take it.

275
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,400
Cheese.

276
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,940
What's wrong?

277
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,140
If you take a picture, your soul will be pulled out.

278
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,340
There's nothing stupid.

279
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,640
I don't want to die yet.

280
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,700
I don't want to die yet.

281
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,200
I don't want to die yet.

282
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,340
I don't want to die yet.

283
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,300
I don't want to die yet.

284
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,400
I don't want to die yet.

285
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,840
Brother...

286
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,120
Good morning.

287
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,960
Mr. Secretary, I'm ready.

288
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,600
What?

289
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,540
I'm preparing for a ceremony.

290
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,540
For a ceremony?

291
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,780
Is it going to be fireworks?

292
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,180
What is this tank squad?

293
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,580
It's a local Keira car.

294
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,100
Is it a patrol car?

295
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,020
It's using the tanks from the war.

296
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:18,600
It's a warm welcome.

297
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,180
I feel good.

298
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,060
Thank you.

299
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,900
I salute the commander of Ryotsu Kankichi.

300
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,300
I have brought another person.

301
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,000
Good work, commander.

302
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,600
There are a lot of soldiers.

303
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,240
I'm sure they are better than the chief.

304
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,240
Maybe they are more experienced.

305
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Welcome to the countryside.

306
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,880
I'm Wadasu.

307
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,320
I'm the chief of the countryside.

308
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,660
I'm Yonesuke Omaeda.

309
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,380
Chief?

310
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,260
Why are you a chief?

311
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,540
I've been a police officer for 58 years.

312
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,240
I'm not lucky enough to have a chance to serve.

313
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,080
Anyway, the incident that happened in this year is only a 30-year-old thievery.

314
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,580
A thievery?

315
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,060
That was an incident handled by the former chief.

316
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,680
The former chief was killed.

317
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,220
It was a case that was handled by the former chief.

318
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,620
The activities of the previous generation.

319
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,720
I still remember now.

320
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,960
I feel hot in my eyes.

321
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,460
The previous generation was the chief at that time,

322
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,980
but since then, the incident has not happened,

323
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,160
so everyone is still in the same rank.

324
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,440
Really?

325
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,420
Then what is that medal for?

326
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,860
This is the medal for the 10th year of the metal.

327
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,440
The 15th year of the metal.

328
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,840
The 20th year of the metal.

329
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,460
And this is the rank of the summer festival.

330
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:47,760
The prime minister of the sports competition.

331
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,320
And you are the 25th year of the metal.

332
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,780
And you participate in the national体育 competition.

333
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,240
But that's enough.

334
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,380
What's this?

335
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,420
A flock of birds.

336
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,840
I don't know.

337
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,620
Let's get out of this mountain and fly somewhere.

338
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,060
I don't care if it's a car or a lucky charm.

339
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,740
Let's steal the car.

340
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,020
Stop!

341
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:17,740
Stop!

342
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,720
It's a strange machine.

343
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,580
Idiot! It's a vehicle!

344
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,920
I have no choice but to do this.

345
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,040
Stop!

346
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,080
I'm dying!

347
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,880
Dragon Blade!

348
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,140
It's easier than I thought.

349
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,020
But why is this car for villagers?

350
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,360
It doesn't matter.

351
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,860
Anyway, let's get out of here.

352
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,600
What?

353
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,220
Two men with guns stole a car?

354
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,480
They were farming in the field.

355
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,920
It's been 30 years since the incident.

356
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,660
They must have stolen the cash we got.

357
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,320
Yes, I'm sure of it.

358
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,320
Mr. Colonel, I'll give you five orders.

359
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,480
Okay.

360
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,040
All cars, go!

361
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,920
You, Colonel.

362
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,180
What's the suspect's expected route?

363
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,460
Yes, sir.

364
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,580
It's a road that leads to the next farm.

365
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,580
Okay.

366
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,070
All cars, wait there!

367
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,460
Damn it.

368
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,380
Where the hell is this place?

369
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,160
I can't find the map.

370
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,860
Brother, there's a car ahead!

371
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,920
Idiot!

372
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,180
You're gonna get kicked out.

373
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,700
We're driving here.

374
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,620
I see.

375
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:41,720
I see.

376
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,180
What's the problem?

377
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:50,580
Okay, here we are.

378
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,280
Damn it, this road is...

379
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,720
Mr. Colonel!

380
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,420
You did it.

381
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,940
It's a counterattack.

382
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,520
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

383
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,620
What's with those tanks?

384
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,560
They might have got lost in the Self-Defense Force's training ground.

385
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,460
No! They're after us!

386
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,180
They're shooting! They're shooting!

387
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,320
I did it! It's a motorcycle!

388
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,620
It's scary!

389
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,160
Damn it! The culprit stole the motorcycle!

390
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,720
That's the only tank in the village.

391
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,180
It's the

392
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,000
Damn it.

393
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,980
I can't catch up with a tank that has slow legs.

394
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,800
Don't worry.

395
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,040
There is an Air Police Division in the village.

396
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,240
An Air Police Division?

397
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,900
Yeah!

398
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,020
Hiyenni, Hayabusa, Hayate,

399
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,360
Raiden, Shidenkai, and Zero-sen.

400
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,900
Those are all planes during the war.

401
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,320
Yeah, if the maniacs see us, they will be furious.

402
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,760
Mr. Colonel, which one are you going to take?

403
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm going to take the Zero-sen.

404
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,320
Where did he go?

405
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,000
Mr. Colonel!

406
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,580
It's the direction of the left-hand center!

407
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,580
What?

408
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,300
Is that it?

409
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,820
All right, let's start the attack!

410
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,340
Yes, sir!

411
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,780
It's a panic!

412
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,920
Be prepared!

413
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,900
The 될er of the zone!

414
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,080
What? It's the Zero-sen, isn't it?

415
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,340
Why is it the Zero-sen?

416
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,420
How stupid of him to think I'm the 0-sen!

417
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,960
Anyway, get out of here!

418
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,080
What did you do to me?

419
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,480
Wow!

420
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,740
Hahaha!

421
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,340
I thought you'd run away, so I sent the police to the water.

422
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,500
There's such a battleship!

423
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,260
What a place!

424
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,680
I saw it!

425
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,600
The lightning!

426
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,160
I don't like this life anymore.

427
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,300
It's hot.

428
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,860
Hey, give up. It's still too early.

429
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,240
You're giving me gas from a broken car?

430
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,360
As expected of you, brother!

431
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,680
If I get on this, I won't be afraid!

432
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,540
You still haven't found the culprit?

433
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,000
Yes! I still haven't found him!

434
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,020
The police are here!

435
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,720
The culprit is near the police station!

436
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,140
The culprit is near the police station!

437
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,000
He's found the car!

438
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,780
He's running at an unbelievable speed!

439
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,660
It's the Ferrari that he was riding at first!

440
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,080
It's going to be 300 kilometers.

441
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,140
If we keep going, he'll run away.

442
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,280
I have no choice.

443
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,420
We have to get that out.

444
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,160
Is there still something?

445
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,320
This is the train law of the Toinakasho Railway Police Force!

446
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,580
That's ridiculous!

447
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:22,820
That's ridiculous!

448
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,580
Now, Chief Inspector, your orders.

449
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,700
Don't care about it!

450
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,320
I'll fire it!

451
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,740
Roger that!

452
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,540
Train law, ready!

453
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,980
Toinakasho Railway Police Force No. 07, set off!

454
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,860
Distance 22.25 km!

455
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,740
Wind from the north-east island! Wind power 2!

456
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,540
The target speed is...

457
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,360
.2!

458
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:52,660
Wind power 2!

459
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,460
Wind power 1!

460
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:54,640
The target speed is...

461
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,540
Fire, 10 second!

462
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,640
6 .

463
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
5 .

464
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
4 .

465
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,600
3 .

466
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,740
2 .

467
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,420
1.

468
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,380
Fire!

469
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,660
If you cross the mountain, you'll have to leave this stupid village;

470
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,080
Farewell!

471
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,640
Yay! It's a masterpiece!

472
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,620
I can't take it anymore.

473
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,480
Please, just catch me normally.

474
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,740
Yay!

475
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,820
A masterpiece!

476
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,060
Banzai!

477
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,520
Banzai!

478
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,660
Banzai!

479
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,140
The culprit has become pitiful.

480
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,740
That's true.

481
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,420
Huh? I can't believe it.

482
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,920
There's such a police station.

483
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,660
We don't want to believe it either.

484
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,320
But Kei-chan never lies.

485
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,760
The culprit is saying the same thing.

486
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,100
It's like a strange story for the four of us.

487
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,860
Ryotsu.

488
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,100
Did you write something about the countryside?

489
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,160
Yes.

490
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,500
I don't say it's impossible to believe.

491
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
The countryside's potato head.

492
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,500
There's a wire in it.

493
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,500
What?

494
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,580
From the potato head?

495
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,220
This is Ryotsu from the Katsushika office.

496
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,040
Mr. Chief.

497
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,460
What's wrong with the potato head?

498
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,960
It's a terrible crime again.

499
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,620
What?

500
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,640
It's a terrible crime.

501
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,320
It's a thievery.

502
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,100
The culprit is heading toward Tokyo, beyond the prefecture.

503
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,080
We are also following him with our full strength.

504
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,160
Please cooperate.

505
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,620
With your full strength?

506
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,980
No way.

507
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,280
Stop!

508
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,700
Mr. Chief.

509
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,320
But I'm very serious.

510
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,860
Mr. Chief.

511
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,800
What are you talking about?

512
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:52,900
That's how things are.

513
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,540
We are under threat.

514
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:53,620
Major Step.

515
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,500
He's gathering us here.

516
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,580
No offense.

517
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
We're innocent.

518
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,080

Monday

539
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,040
Monday Monday Good morning

540
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Huh?

541
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,540
Are Honda's childhood friends playing circus?

542
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,760
I used to come to see them when I was a kid

543
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,260
What? The debtor is about to get a circus?

544
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,020
Leave it to me

545
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,940
I will do something about it

546
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,480
Next time, Circus Symphony

547
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,700
Thank you

548
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,760
There is a turtle there

549
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,700
There must be a turtle

550
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,700
Everyone come to our town

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,780
Thank you
