1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,920
"Ryo-chan's Money"

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,360
Hey, Reiko, please!

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,540
Give me 1,000 yen!

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,700
No, just 500 yen!

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,240
But, the head of the department told me not to lend money to you.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,540
You're so annoying.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,520
I told you I wouldn't lend you money, but you didn't!

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,220
I'm not asking you to do it.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,540
I'm asking Reiko to do it.

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,000
We're going to eat lunch now.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,740
It's in the way, so go over there.

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,140
Wait a minute.

13
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,460
Please, Reiko.

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,660
If you can't afford 500 yen, you can pay 300 yen.

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,120
No, if you can afford 150 yen, you can buy ramen.

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,280
I'll go around three times and say "one".

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,080
Kankichi.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:44,920
Lemon.

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,440
What are you doing?

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,880
I'm imitating a dog.

21
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,400
There's a hide-and-seek competition outside the school this time.

22
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,360
It's more like a practice.

23
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,580
I have about 150 yen.

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,000
Huh?

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,340
Are you sure, Lemon?

26
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:57,820
Yes.

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,780
I'll lend you the money for your lunch.

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,860
Reiko's so sweet.

29
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,760
If you saw it, tell her that from the beginning.

30
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,660
By the way, what are you doing here?

31
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,220
Actually...

32
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,500
A baby is born.

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:15,780
What?

34
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,320
A baby is born?

35
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,640
A baby is born?

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,460
When watching TV, make your room bright and look away.

37
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,020
Try walking and couldn't find a baby?

38
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,260
Go away, too.

39
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,840
Look where you're going.

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,560
You have no money to sleep.

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,240
Come near me.

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,740
Please.

43
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,600
Don't be scared.

44
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,640
What are you doing?

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:45,900
Listen.

46
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,080
Look at his face.

47
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,940
He has more scum than I do.

48
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,180
A friend.

49
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,680
What?

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,840
I wonder if it'll work out somehow

51
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,260
Those who have no job, come to me

52
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,520
I don't have one, but I'm worried

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,540
Look, it's on fire

54
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,280
I wonder if it'll work out somehow

55
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,060
Those who have no job, come to me

56
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,560
I know, I know, I know

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,720
If you do, just come to me

58
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,640
Eh? You're gonna give birth?

59
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,440
I-I didn't know you...

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,400
W-what are you doing?

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,500
You don't give birth when you're in kindergarten, do you?

62
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,340
I-I didn't know that

63
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,280
That means the baby is...

64
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,820
I didn't know that!

65
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,660
I didn't know that! I didn't know that!

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,480
I didn't know that!

67
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,980
Matoi-chan, are you okay?

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,880
Eh?

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,160
I'm okay, I'm just a little bit sick

70
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,540
Huh?

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,620
M-Matoi-chan!

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,640
I-I thought...

73
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,400
Why are you staring at me?

74
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,380
Eh?

75
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,480
No way!

76
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,420
Matoi-chan!

77
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,240
Eh? What are you talking about?

78
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,680
Matoi, I can't help it if I can't do it

79
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,220
Huh?

80
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:54,800
So?

81
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:54,900
Why?

82
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,460
When will you give birth?

83
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,200
Eh? Why do I have to give birth?

84
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,060
Eh?

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,760
Kankichi, are you okay?

86
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,260
Oh, Reimu, why are you here?

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm here to tell Kankichi about the baby

88
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,680
Oh, so...

89
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,660
Matoi-chan didn't give birth to a baby, did she?

90
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,080
I don't remember saying that

91
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
But...

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,980
I was touching my belly

93
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,520
That's because...

94
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,120
When Matoi-chan ate 50 dumplings for 10 minutes,

95
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,700
she just ate them and ate them all

96
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,160
Eh?

97
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,440
Hehehe

98
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,800
Then, who gives birth to a baby?

99
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,720
My mother

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,840
What?

101
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,980
Then, Matoi and Reimu have a brother or a sister?

102
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,880
That's right

103
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,780
I see, that's good, Reimu

104
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,160
Kankichi, please give birth to a baby

105
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,880
I'm embarrassed

106
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,020
Hahaha

107
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,660
I see, I see

108
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,420
You're going to be a big sister soon, aren't you?

109
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,100
Big sister?

110
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,640
Heh

111
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,960
Lemon will be a big sister

112
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,560
Now, come in

113
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,500
Reiko-san, Nakagawa-san, welcome

114
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,020
Good evening

115
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,620
Sorry for suddenly interrupting you

116
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
No, it's okay

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,500
It's no big deal that you're in the way

118
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,580
You came here often

119
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,160
No, Matoi and Lemon's mother

120
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,900
didn't notice that you were pregnant

121
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,380
It has nothing to do with Kankichi

122
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,920
Mom?

123
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,080
Hehehe

124
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,760
As usual

125
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,220
This is boring

126
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,760
From us

127
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,340
Please

128
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,200
Kankichi's boring things are really boring

129
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,900
Sorry

130
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,740
I'm grateful to you two

131
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
Thank you

132
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,880
Seriously, I'm just getting more and more hungry

133
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,300
Hehe

134
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,480
Are you going to give birth at your home?

135
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,640
Matoi and Lemon are also giving birth at home

136
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,800
Hmm, if you ask me, when I was a child, it was normal to give birth at home in the city of Chita

137
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,700
But is there any Samba-san now?

138
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,680
There is

139
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,760
The veteran is quite old, though

140
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,080
It's Samba-san who took me up

141
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,560
Huh?

142
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,760
Grandma is 101 years old

143
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,580
How old is that Samba?

144
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,100
Tome-san is 119 years old

145
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,960
Are you an ambulance?

146
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Even if it's Matoi, the neighborhood people put most of the Samba-san in the top

147
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,720
There are 10,000 babies who were adopted by the Samba family in the 114th year of the Samba era

148
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,060
Come to think of it, I'm also going to give birth at home

150
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,700
What? Nakagawa too?

151
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,940
The rich Nakagawa is the same as me

152
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,980
I feel a sense of intimacy

153
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,400
Really?

154
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,940
I think that 50 doctors and 100 pregnant women came to my house

155
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,900
There are so many doctors of hope that I'm going to give birth

156
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,220
It's so close

157
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,240
There's TV broadcast used in this hospital

158
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,820
There are also the broadcasts broadcast in the United States

159
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,120
We don't have a lot of lives

160
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,300
Right, there are no Linda

161
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,560
I feel a little bit of intimacy

162
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,420
But I made a mistake

163
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,780
Did you change your name?

164
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,560
Is it still?

165
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,240
Yes, I'm just going to think about it

166
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,520
My father and my stepson are depressed

167
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,200
My step-daughter is Matoi

168
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,820
So I can't take off the clothes

169
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,320
What about this?

170
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,620
"Giboshi-bara"

171
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,540
"Bara" huh. Cute.

172
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,980
There's more.

173
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,820
"Shouyu-kikai-kirin"?

174
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,920
It's not like the letters have too many "kakushu" letters!

175
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,340
Why is it "shouyu"? Are you stupid?

176
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
You're trying to fit in with your brother, aren't you?

177
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,980
I get it.

178
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,980
Then, since you're a sushi restaurant kid, what are these names?

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,980
"Saba", "Tako", "Maguro", "Kisu", "Shimaji", "Surumeika"?

180
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,660
Kankichi, you're not just a sushi restaurant kid!

181
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,960
What kind of name is "Giboshi-Surumeika"?

182
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,200
They're all so noisy.

183
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,980
Then, what are "Rommel", "Tiger", "Leopardo", "Melkaba", "Challenger", and "Kyuji-shiki"?

184
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,520
Why did you name your grandchildren after me?

185
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,560
I get it, I get it!

186
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,920
Then, what are "Giboshi", "Karugustaf", "Mako", "F", and "Beradonna"?

187
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
Which country are you from?

188
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,720
What's your name, Lemon?

189
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,020
I don't know yet. I'll think about it after I see your face.

190
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,680
I hope you're born healthy.

191
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,180
I'll be fine, Lemon.

192
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,180
Oh, Lemon, what's wrong?

193
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,320
You're born again?

194
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,880
No, I'm not.

195
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,780
Where's Kankichi?

196
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,300
He's on patrol.

197
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,160
I see.

198
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,440
He'll be back soon, so you should wait.

199
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,080
If he's not here, then it's fine.

200
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,240
See you.

201
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,400
Oh, here they are!

202
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,240
It's been a while since I've seen so many of them!

203
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,020
Huh?

204
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,860
Lemon, what are you doing here?

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,700
Huh?

206
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,720
How long have you been on patrol, Kankichi?

207
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,860
Oh, there's a lot.

208
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,920
Anyway, what's wrong?

209
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,300
Hmm...

210
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:30,860
Hm?

211
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,400
Kankichi...

212
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,480
What?

213
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,640
But, can you really be my sister?

214
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,620
Huh?

215
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,220
Actually...

216
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,400
What?

217
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,080
Well...

218
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,740
I'm here!

219
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,960
Master Nakoto!

220
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,160
Well, what are you working on here?

221
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,880
I'm taking care of my little sister.

222
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,420
Talk about cute.

223
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,140
You're really cute.

224
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,880
Should I give you a hug?

225
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,300
Are you sure?

226
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,020
Yeah.

227
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,220
Ah!

228
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,980
Oh, what do I do?

229
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,560
He puked and started crying.

230
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,400
Makoto, do you know that?

231
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

232
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,260
Oh, Mako, you're so great.

233
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,460
You're really like your brother.

234
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,820
But I don't think I can be his sister.

235
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,260
You were depressed because of that?

236
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,020
It's okay. You can be a good sister.

237
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,380
Really?

238
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
Of course. I guarantee it.

239
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,820
That's not true.

240
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,840
You can have a younger family for the first time.

241
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,600
You have expectations and concerns, don't you?

242
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,100
You're confident.

243
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,780
To point out opportunities,

244
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,900
you have to get yourself a partner to support your child's birth.

245
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,840
How?

246
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,600
How.

247
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,320
How.

248
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,440
What?

249
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,620
You want Lemon to come here?

250
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,580
I'm a home-born, so I must go and get Miso.

251
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,520
To raise a baby.

252
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,760
Has Miso been here recently?

253
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,700
Yes.

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,280
I have to talk to you at this hour.

255
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,200
Here you go.

256
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,780
Okay. I'll do my best.

257
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,420
Happy, Lemon asked me to do a job.

258
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,440
It's an important job.

259
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,780
You say good things sometimes.

260
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,060
Oh, right.

261
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,740
Hello?

262
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,500
Oh, Geppardo.

263
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,320
I see. You got the job.

264
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,280
I think it's okay.

265
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,240
But sometimes I have to say yes.

266
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,620
Then you'll take responsibility and look after me.

267
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,580
Don't worry. I'll get more.

268
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,900
It's a useless job.

269
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,200
I understand. I'll follow you.

270
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,640
See you.

271
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,900
This is the right way.

272
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,180
Oh, right.

273
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,820
You should remember the characteristic buildings.

274
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,700
Yes.

275
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,600
Be careful because the traffic is intense.

276
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,720
Okay.

277
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
Turn the alley next to this post office.

278
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,020
The second building is Sanba's house.

279
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:51,980
Okay.

280
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,020
I'll go see.

281
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,820
Is it here?

282
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,560
Yes.

283
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,700
Okay.

284
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,500
Thank you.

285
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,080
Wow.

286
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,280
You came, Lemon.

287
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,800
You're here.

288
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,640
Are you still okay?

289
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,560
No, it is in deep pain.

290
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,920
I'm fine.

291
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,500
That's great.

292
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,120
I thought you wouldn't make it in time.

293
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,220
Even today is scheduled...

294
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,280
huh ...

295
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,480
uh ...

296
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,300
Is it okay?

297
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,040
Ah ah...

298
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,240
I-it's tough.

299
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,140
What!? The X-ray started!?

300
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,060
Where's the lemon!?

301
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,140
I see. All right. Leave the rest to me!

302
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,800
Yup.

303
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,840
Did you catch him?

304
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,340
I'm in a bit of a trouble.

305
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,740
Is it alright if I take a left and turn right?

306
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,300
I wonder if it's okay.

307
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,620
This is too much traffic in Tokyo.

308
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,600
There's too much road construction.

309
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,480
This is the right.

310
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,240
Okay, I'm ready.

311
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,420
Is this also under construction?

312
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,420
Here too?

313
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,100
Here too?

314
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,220
It's probably this way.

315
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,680
Lemon, no.

316
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,320
The other traffic light is on the left.

317
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,000
Damn it!

318
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,300
Lemon, notice me!

319
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,560
This is strange.

320
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,840
I should be able to find a post office.

321
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,500
But I'm getting further away from Samba-san's house.

322
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,420
I should tell him as soon as possible.

323
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,100
Listen, Kankichi.

324
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,300
You can't find it even if you try.

325
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,440
It's important to do it by yourself until the end of the year.

326
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,760
Damn it!

327
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,180
Okay, I can do it!

328
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,120
No, I completely got the wrong way.

329
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,000
What should I do?

330
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,020
You seem to be lost and in trouble.

331
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,740
Huh?

332
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,400
Yup, yup.

333
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,620
How did you know?

334
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,380
I'm a good reporter.

335
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,420
I can tell everything just by looking at my face.

336
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,780
A reporter is a person who makes fortune-telling about the times, right?

337
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,600
In short, it's a job that helps people in trouble.

338
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,160
Perfect!

339
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,020
But I'm really in trouble now.

340
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,780
How should I go to Samba-san's place?

341
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,320
You're going to Samba-san for your mother?

342
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,740
Of course, I'm a good reporter.

343
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,160
I'll tell my daughter the truth just for free.

344
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,600
Huh?

345
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,980
Alright, alright!

346
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,140
Here!

347
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,380
Here!

348
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,400
I found it.

349
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,260
Turn the way you're going now and turn the first signal to the left.

350
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,600
If you go about 50 meters, you'll find a post office on your left hand.

351
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,320
If I know the post office, I'll know the rest.

352
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,420
Thank you, reporter-san.

353
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,080
Phew...

354
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,020
Mr. Omawari, are you done?

355
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,300
Oh, sorry.

356
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,280
I'm saved.

357
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:07,140
*Pant, pant, pant*

358
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,680
*Sigh*

359
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,160
If you've come this far, you'll be fine.

360
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,960
*Pant, pant, pant*

361
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,980
That's strange.

362
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,400
It's been five minutes.

363
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,580
*Pant, pant, pant*

364
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:24,980
What?

365
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,060
What?

366
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,020
Tome-san is on leave?

367
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,500
There's a housekeeper at my home in Nezu.

368
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,180
She's been going to that house since last night.

369
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,420
Didn't a girl come a bit earlier?

370
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,560
Yeah.

371
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,760
I wrote down the address of the house in Nezu,

372
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,320
and I ran to pick her up.

373
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,680
Oh, no.

374
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,840
Grandpa, tell me the address, too!

375
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,020
*Pant, pant, pant*

376
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,920
Ugh, damn it.

377
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,020
*Pant, pant, pant*

378
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,340
*Pant, pant, pant*

379
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,260
*Pant, pant, pant*

380
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,500
*Pant, pant, pant*

381
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,040
*Pant, pant, pant*

382
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,760
*Pant, pant, pant*

383
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:58,860
*Pant, pant, pant*

384
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,420
Ugh, I left it at home.

385
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,100
*Pant, pant, pant, pant*

386
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,840
Ugh, damn it.

387
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,300
Where is it?

388
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,000
This way?

389
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,780
No, maybe this way?

390
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,620
*Pant, pant, pant*

391
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,260
No, this way!

392
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,160
*Pant, pant, pant*

393
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,780
*Pant, pant, pant*

394
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,480
*Pant, pant, pant*

395
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,860
Oh, Lemon!

396
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,020
Where are you now?

397
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,020
Ugh, what the heck?

398
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,360
It's Gepard.

399
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,360
Is Lemon lost?

400
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,520
What are you doing?

401
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,760
*Pant, pant, pant*

402
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,480
What's wrong, Tome-san?

403
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,740
What?

404
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,040
What? Are you going to another pregnant lady?

405
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,080
*Pant, pant, pant*

406
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,120
*Pant, pant, pant*

407
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,580
What do we do?

408
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,940
I'll make you guys feel better.

409
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:27,980
Hurry up!

410
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,980
*Pant, pant, pant*

411
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,740
*Pant, pant, pant*

412
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,920
Turn the next, next signal to the right.

413
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,180
You're at Kurihara-san's house on the third stop.

414
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,000
Thank you.

415
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,540
What?

416
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,080
*Pant, pant, pant*

417
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,600
*Pant, pant, pant*

418
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,640
What? Did you just leave?

419
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,400
Then, didn't the girl from kindergarten come to visit you?

420
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,340
No, she went home alone.

421
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,960
Oh no, did you go the wrong way?

422
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,180
If the girl comes back, I'll ask for a message to call her home.

423
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,020
Oh...

424
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,260
Hey, Lemon!

425
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,320
Where are you?

426
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,580
I'm here!

427
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,840
Answer me if you can hear me!

428
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,860
Answer me if you can hear me!

429
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,600
Hey...

430
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,380
I'd like to ask you something.

431
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,620
I'd like to ask you in the back yard.

432
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,660
You're the one who's around here, aren't you?

433
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,380
Oh, I see.

434
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,540
Where do you want to go?

435
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,120
Well...

436
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,340
You're still here, Samba-san?

437
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,120
You're going to be born soon.

438
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,820
I have no choice.

439
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,000
I'll pick you up.

440
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,880
Are you sure?

441
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,220
I have no choice!

442
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,320
Grandma!

443
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,940
I'm back.

444
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,320
Sorry for being late.

445
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,720
I'll leave it to you.

446
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,520
This way!

447
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,660
You have a nice face.

448
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,060
I'm sure you'll have a good child.

449
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,060
Now, it's all right.

450
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,640
Take a deep breath.

451
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,480
You brought me here.

452
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,460
I'm not worried anymore.

453
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,700
Now, leave the rest to Tome-san.

454
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,180
We'll be leaving.

455
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,620
Oh...

456
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,240
You're finally born.

457
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,800
You sound so happy.

458
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,320
What?

459
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,900
Hiya!

460
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,960
Yes, I am.

461
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,240
I'm sorry I can't be with you.

462
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,840
your sister is coming.

463
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,880
I'm sorry, but I can't come her.

464
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:02,960
More me:

465
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,120
I want to talk to you in my space.

466
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,480
Holy crap!

467
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

468
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,420
You're so small and cute.

469
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,660
I've been waiting for you to come home.

470
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,360
Oh, I see. You've been waiting for me.

471
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,660
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

472
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,760
Ah...

473
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,700
...

474
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:25,800
...

475
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,100
You're so strong, Lemon.

476
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,180
Hmm?

477
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,440
Really?

478
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,460
Yeah. You came alone to call me to bed.

479
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,260
You're really strong.

480
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,020
Lemon, Tome praised you.

481
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,580
You're my big sister from today.

482
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,880
...

483
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:53,960
...

484
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,840
...

485
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,680
...

486
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,720
"You look like a grownup."

487
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,620
...

488
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,680
You're so confident, huh?

489
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,360
...

490
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,620
"You're a grownup."

491
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,020
You have a cute name!

492
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,780
Out of the many candidates I had in mind,

493
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,400
Lemon chose you.

494
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:13,900
Wow!

495
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,620
So, you're the chef.

496
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,160
Hahaha.

497
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,120
...

498
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,520
Hankichi?

499
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,520
Ryo-chan...

500
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:24,660
...

501
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:24,700
...

502
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:24,940
...Senpai!

503
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,260
...

504
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,480
Where have you been all this time?

505
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,420
Well, it's been a long time.

506
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,960
Lemon is safe, and so are the babies.

507
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,180
Lemon, how do you feel? Hold this for a bit.

508
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,020
Huh?

509
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,920
Yeah.

510
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:55,700
What?

511
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,020
Lemon, can you hold it for me too?

512
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,420
What the?

513
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,760
Take it. Leave the rest to me.

514
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,620
Okay.

515
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,060
What? Why?

516
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,460
Take it. Lend it to me.

517
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,000
It's called "a mandarin orange."

518
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,860
"A mandarin orange?"

519
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:24,320
Ryou-chan's amazing, right?

520
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,960
Hehehe, an orange has eyes that look at men.

521
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,840
Here, a lemon.

522
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,660
Yes.

523
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,940
Kakishi!

524
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,400
Huh?

525
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,520
I won't forgive you for even eating an orange, not just a lemon!

526
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,940
Hey, hey, hey!

527
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,980
You're a newborn baby, there's nothing to eat!

528
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,760
Hey, Kikumi-mimoto!

529
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,840
Stop it!

530
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,520
You're making it hard for me!

531
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,380
What is this?

532
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,340
Stop it!

533
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,740
You're so annoying!

534
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,920
Show me your mouth!

535
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,440
Come on!

536
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,240
Come on!

537
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,460
What are you doing?

538
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,900
Huh?

539
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,020
You're really cute.

540
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,900
I don't want to be the one to be loved

541
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,280
If I make a road on the corner

542
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,600
The moon will run away

543
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,480
Because now is not everything

544
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,900
Don't worry too much

545
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,880
Even if you lie and cheat

546
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,600
Sometimes you help someone

547
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,340
Sometimes

548
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,420
Baby do you know me

549
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,360
I'm going to tomorrow

550
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,840
Nice breathing

551
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,180
Don't be rotten

552
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,420
I'll do what I do

553
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,500
Cute breathing

554
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,120
What's hard to understand

555
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,440
I want to show you

556
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,680
It's better than seeing

557
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,100
the moment

558
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,260
I'm sorry

559
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,860
If you're Japanese,

560
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,340

I eat 3 kinds of watermelon.

Next,

563
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,480
you can eat 300 watermelon in a week.

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,560
I'm looking forward to the next.
