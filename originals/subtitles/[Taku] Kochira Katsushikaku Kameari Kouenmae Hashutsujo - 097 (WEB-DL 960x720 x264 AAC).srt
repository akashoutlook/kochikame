1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,340
Dette! When you watch the TV

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,140
Dette! When you watch the TV

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,740
move your room a little bit

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,060
and try to make it separate

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,720
epidemiology

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:26,540
you'll be watching

7
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,800
The cityscape that never changes is so kind

8
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,740
From the waterfront of Tongari-boshi

9
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:16,420
To Taishakuten, the sunset falls

10
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:24,760
Tomorrow will end like this

11
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,340
If I win this time, will I still be happy?

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,640
I realize it's because I'm stupid

13
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,180
Another

14
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,480
Oh, that's unbelievable, with those hair spoons.

15
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,980
This is good, isn't it?

16
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm impressed with you guys!

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,760
No...

18
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,220
I'm sorry, one more time!

19
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Here's 100 yen.

20
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,220
You also won in the goldfish rescue with me.

21
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,720
It's ten years too early to compete with me.

22
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,540
The golden fish is saved carefully and bravely.

23
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,980
Well, I've done this 10 or 20 times, so this secret is...

24
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,860
Kei, you're amazing!

25
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:32,820
What?

26
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,540
If you get the hang of it, you can save as many as you want.

27
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,240
Kei, you have a good sense.

28
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,400
Mr. Nakagawa, bravo!

29
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,500
Jody!

30
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,020
That's ridiculous.

31
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,720
The secret I've been seeking for years has been destroyed in a few minutes.

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,560
How could I lose it in a few minutes?

33
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,120
Here, Jody.

34
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,540
Thank you, Mr. Nakagawa.

35
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,780
That's great, Jody.

36
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,800
You're cute.

37
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,580
Mr. Nakagawa is the king of the lower town.

38
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,560
The king of the lower town.

39
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,760
The king of the lower town.

40
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,120
The king of the lower town!

41
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,760
I didn't know he was the king.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,460
It's so nice to have a sunny day.

43
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,680
Last year, the typhoon hit directly.

44
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,840
In Tokyo, around here,

45
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,500
there were foquinnas.

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,920
What's all this time?

47
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm okay.

48
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,880
How cute.

49
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,640
Hey, where can I get this?

50
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,480
I want a souvenir.

51
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,900
Eh, Ojizou?

52
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,860
No souvenir shops.

53
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:46,980
I know.

54
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,740
Ryo-chan!

55
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,780
Well, you know King Nakagawa of the underground town.

56
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,260
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,860
If you don't sell it, I'll take it home.

58
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,020
I'll take one that has a lot of things.

59
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,200
Oh, no!

60
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,680
I can't buy this.

61
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,780
It's small but cute.

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,120
Thank you, Mr. Nakagawa.

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,440
Recently, there are many things in the souvenir shop.

64
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,620
I thought maybe.

65
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,480
As expected of Kei-chan.

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,040
As expected of the King of the underground town, Mr. Nakagawa.

67
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,780
Oh, no!

68
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,640
I love the underground town of Japan.

69
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,940
Where are you going next, Mr. Nakagawa?

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,620
Well, next to Shibamada Taishakuten is Asakusa Kaminari-mon.

71
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm going to a famous tourist spot that nobody knows in Japan.

72
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,380
I'm going to take a tour of the underground town.

73
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,600
If you're going to be so stubborn, Ryo-chan will escort you.

74
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,120
Oh, Mr. Ryotsu will guide you this time.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,800
All right.

76
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,280
There is a place where you have to go to know the charm of the underground town.

77
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,680
That is here!

78
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,400
I have to go to the underground town without entering the castle!

79
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,400
Wow, I wanted to go to a Japanese bathhouse once.

80
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,220
I don't think Nakagawa, who grew up in New York, has ever entered the underground town.

81
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,440
Yes, I have.

82
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:14,800
I'm going to enter the underground town once.

83
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,100
Anyway, there's a problem when I enter.

84
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,620
There are many places that are counter-shaped in the near future.

85
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,160
The first battle of the underground town was a great progress.

86
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,500
No, it's not.

87
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,600
Mr. Ryo, the business is from 3 o'clock.

88
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,240
It's still 2 o'clock.

89
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,300
It's still open. Don't say something so hard.

90
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,160
But I have to keep the time.

91
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,940
Senpai, let's go out again.

92
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,800
Oh?

93
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:40,920
Oh?

94
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,460
Where are you?

95
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,580
What's wrong, Ryo?

96
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,840
Are you going to go in, too?

97
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,760
Yes.

98
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,460
Oh, that's too bad.

99
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,540
No, I didn't put the foreigner who came here to put it in the bath.

100
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,400
It's a turtle bath.

101
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,360
Come on, let's go.

102
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,960
Please go in slowly.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,180
Thank you, Mr.

104
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,760
This is the charm of the underground town.

105
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,500
It's the charm of Japan.

106
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,200
That's how the old man makes a fool of himself.

107
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,960
Tte.

108
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,840
1st bath is the best.

109
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,160
Oh, right.

110
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,500
Yes.

111
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,200
Oh.

112
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
Is the turtle bath closed?

113
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,860
Mr. Reiko and Mr. Jody are here, too.

114
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,860
It seems to be fun.

115
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,880
I'll be there soon.

116
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,580
See you later.

117
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,520
I see.

118
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,500
You're still wearing heavy armor.

119
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,200
You're not rusty because you put it in the water?

120
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,720
There are many guards in the hot springs.

121
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,320
I'm using an all-stenless revolver that doesn't rust even in the water.

122
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,580
Don't shoot! It's just a water drop!

123
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,880
Sorry.

124
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,320
My body reacts to the reflection.

125
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,040
What's wrong, Takagawa?

126
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,580
Why are you putting a towel around your waist?

127
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,160
No matter how much you're a senior, you don't want to be forced into the bath.

128
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,660
When I was a kid, there was a guy like that.

129
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,480
How did you deal with him?

130
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,840
Watch me.

131
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,560
Stop it, senior!

132
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,260
I'll tell you, you'll be worried about it.

133
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,960
If you don't take it off, you'll think it's something ridiculous.

134
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,280
That's not true.

135
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,540
Then show me your pocky and come in.

136
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,460
Exactly.

137
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,020
It's natural for a man to come in while showing his balls.

138
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,320
Pocky?

139
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,440
That's amazing.

140
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,040
I'm more particular about one hand.

141
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,700
Senior.

142
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
The bath feels good.

143
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,020
See, I know you don't hide your Honda at all.

144
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,180
What?

145
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,560
Nakagawa is discriminating against us, the small citizens who raise pocky.

146
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,040
What?

147
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,800
No way.

148
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,940
You're making fun of pocky.

149
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,980
You're making fun of pocky.

150
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,220
That's not true.

151
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,620
Then try it like I did.

152
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,300
Put your hands on your shoulders.

153
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,780
Show your front.

154
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,840
Hey!

155
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,260
How's the cake?

156
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,360
It's good.

157
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,180
And then...

158
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,920
...and then.

159
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,920
Okay, now we're even.

160
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,580
You have to try, when I tell you.

161
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,680
That's a no.

162
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,920
Don't forget...

163
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,900
Look here.

164
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,300
This is a real pie.

165
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,220
You have to show your balls at all times.

166
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,540
A real pie?

167
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,760
What?

168
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,640
I'll show you.

169
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:57,960
I'll show you, too.

170
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,740
Show me your balls.

171
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,240
No.

172
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,780
Noooo!

173
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:09,460
He is making a much bigger trusted example than expected.

174
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,200
I have great expectations.

175
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,400
What is he expecting?

176
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,880
I'll place it here.

177
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,880
Welcome.

178
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,060
Mr. Toyama,

179
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,520
how are you doing?

180
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,620
How are you feeling?

181
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,100
I'm not feeling well, but I'm not feeling bad.

182
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,000
Instructor Honda, I'm going to shampoo.

183
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,700
Okay.

184
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,560
Here you go.

185
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,580
Thank you.

186
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,820
You're welcome.

187
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,100
This is a great idea, Mr. Honda.

188
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,100
It's a common sight in the downtown.

189
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,820
What a great idea.

190
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,040
This is a great idea.

191
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,780
This reminds me of my childhood.

192
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,600
I went to the bathhouse after school and played for hours.

193
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,860
Momoko, wash your body.

194
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,300
Okay.

195
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,180
We're in the same bathhouse because we're neighbors.

196
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,620
I was excited when I saw a naked classmate on the other side of the wall.

197
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,820
It's a sweet memory in the downtown.

198
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,780
I grew up in New York.

199
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,740
I don't know the world.

200
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,680
I can't believe I'm in the town.

201
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,020
I can't believe I'm in the town.

202
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,900
It's okay.

203
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,420
It's about the town.

204
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,540
Please sit down.

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,640
Jordy has a big chest.

206
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,940
Amazing.

207
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,300
No, Miss Reiko is bigger.

208
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,940
His nose is different.

209
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,700
No, it's long.

210
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,060
It's Seigo.

211
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,780
Seigo is bigger.

212
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,000
You know how he talks.

213
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,720
I was told how I feel and I'm lying like a man now.

214
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,300
What do I do?

215
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,380
I must vent my heart into the women's bathhouse.

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,480
It's in the boiler room.

217
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,960
The men's and women's bathrooms work in that room.

218
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,680
I'm going to meet my crush, Jordy and Nana.

219
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,640
What?

220
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,400
Senior, the nose is the opposite.

221
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,600
I don't understand you growing up in New York.

222
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,020
You, the one who grew up in the country, can't understand it.

223
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,720
It's a greeting like a low town.

224
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,360
Get lost.

225
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,440
Ah, is that so?

226
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,660
Please do it yourself.

227
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,440
Don't make a sound alone!

228
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,760
Ah, everyone is so shy.

229
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,300
Can't you go, brother?

230
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,300
Huh?

231
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm so nervous.

232
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
Let's go.

233
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,500
Excuse me.

234
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,720
There's no one here.

235
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,980
Ryo-chan.

236
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,740
I knew you would come.

237
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:57,920
You're all dirty.

238
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,940
Don't put on a bath towel and go to the bathroom.

239
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,840
Ready?

240
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,840
Wait a minute, Yose.

241
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,580
Again!

242
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,620
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,300
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,460
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,380
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:20,820
Do you need anything?

247
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,420
I knew it.

248
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,520
Kokichi!

249
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,320
Kokichi!

250
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:30,780
What are you doing?

251
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,640
Stop it.

252
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,960
Kokichi!

253
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,380
Stop it.

254
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,820
Nagagawa, you have such a hobby.

255
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,860
No.

256
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,080
Kokichi!

257
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,460
Kokichi!

258
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,180
What are you doing?

259
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,660
Please be firm.

260
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,500
Please be firm.

261
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,140
I don't understand why New York kids are doing that.

270
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,980
It seems that he calmed down, but it is very dangerous if his blood pressure rises again.

271
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,600
Don't let him get too excited.

272
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,380
Yes.

273
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,660
I'll come back to see you later. Take care.

274
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,800
I don't know what New York adults do when they open their eyes.

275
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,960
Right, Bulbul?

276
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,720
Yes.

277
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,740
I want you to not shout in front of the patient.

278
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,560
Right, Mr. Honda?

279
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,140
Yes.

280
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,600
Mr. Toyama seemed to be fine when he came to the bath.

281
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,920
What happened?

282
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,860
When he saw my face, he called me Koukichi.

283
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,760
Koukichi?

284
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,500
I see.

285
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,440
I thought he looked like someone when I saw you.

286
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,460
Who is that Koukichi?

287
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,180
He is Mr. Toyama's only son.

288
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,140
Son?

289
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,780
Yes, he is.

290
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,820
He is the son of Mr. Toyama.

291
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,420
Oh, he looks just like Nakagawa.

292
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,220
Mr. Toyama was a skilled carpenter in the old days.

293
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,060
However, due to the times, he lost his job and started drinking alcohol.

294
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,000
On the contrary, he never followed after his son, so he had a quarrel with his only son Koukichi.

295
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,420
I don't want to see your face.

296
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,460
Go away!

297
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,760
I don't want to see your face.

298
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,500
I don't want to see your face.

299
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't want to see your face.

300
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,800
The child is notano.

301
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,040
What's your story?

302
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,020
Now that you've seen Nakagawa, did you think your son came back?

303
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,560
Woo!

304
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,040
You're not so terrible.

305
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,580
My blood pressure is rose already.

306
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,440
After all, we fought a lot, but have been weak-willed lately.

307
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,620
I feel I did something wrong ...

308
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,920
Stング!

309
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,780
Yes, it is a great chance based on Makagawa.

310
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,200
Yes, it is a great chance based on Makagawa.

311
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,380
Yes, it is a great chance based on Makagawa.

312
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,140
If you knew it was a misunderstanding, you would be disappointed, right?

313
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,240
Yes.

314
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,980
He noticed.

315
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,820
What do we do?

316
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,980
Where is this place?

317
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,080
I'm glad, boss! Your precious son, Koukichi, is back!

318
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,880
Senior! Koukichi! Koukichi!

319
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,400
I'm glad, Koukichi. You finally met your father, whom you've wanted to meet for years.

320
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,120
Koukichi!

321
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,180
Koukichi!

322
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,900
Then we'll leave without water for the rest of the day.

323
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,600
Is that okay, Ryo-san?

324
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,880
-No, no, no! -No, no, no!

325
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,340
Senior!

326
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,920
Maybe he still remembers that he lost the goldfish scoop.

327
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,820
What?

328
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,600
Dad, I'd like to ask Ryo-san to stay.

329
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,840
I want to give him a small reward.

330
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,060
Oh, I see.

331
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,420
As you can see, I can't do anything good in my life,

332
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,600
so please take it easy, Ryo-san.

333
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,240
That's what I'm trying to say!

334
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,700
If you erase my son's identity, I'll have to face the dead Kakao!

335
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,740
Then we'll go first.

336
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,980
Hey! Don't leave me behind!

337
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,100
Wait!

338
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,520
Koukichi!

339
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,360
Dad is also free, so please take it easy, Senior.

340
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,240
Yes.

341
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,140
I'm sorry I didn't notice.

342
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,520
I'm thirsty.

343
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,980
-Thank you for the food. -Thank you for the food.

344
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,660
What the hell is this?

345
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,200
It's a special bancha with Koukichi's favorite natto, miso, and sugar.

346
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,900
I wonder if there was less natto.

347
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,920
I see. Koukichi's.

348
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,400
It's delicious. It's delicious.

349
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,540
I don't think there's anything else to eat.

350
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,960
I only have the croquettes I bought this afternoon.

351
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,960
This one looks delicious.

352
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,540
I'll take one word from you.

353
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,680
Koukichi likes to stretch the croquettes and pour the sauce until they turn black.

354
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,760
No, just like that.

355
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,480
If you're a man, you should not be stingy.

356
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,640
You should pour the sauce all at once.

357
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,600
Now, Koukichi, eat up.

358
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,520
Wow, it looks delicious.

359
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,220
It's good.

360
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,700
Oh, it's good.

361
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,580
I'm sorry to eat such a delicious thing alone.

362
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,760
Senpai, have a bite.

363
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,960
No, I'll take it.

364
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,580
Yeah, you're the one who likes spicy food.

365
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,040
So stand up the chili pepper.

366
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,780
Hey, you're not wearing your mittens.

367
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,340
Now it's just the spicy taste of your taste.

368
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,740
Now it's your favorite spice.

369
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,100
Who would be happy about that?

370
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,460
To be able to meet a good brother like you now.

371
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,220
I couldn't say anything about the way it was in the old days.

372
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,800
I couldn't say anything even if I was silent.

373
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,920
Let's drink.

374
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,280
Damn it! That bastard!

375
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,380
Then, Koukichi, are you also a boss?

376
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,260
Yes, well...

377
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,800
I see.

378
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,600
Koukichi has become a boss.

379
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,480
I was thinking that you were working somewhere bad again.

380
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,100
I was worried about you.

381
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,080
Senpai, are you still awake?

382
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,460
Yes.

383
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,260
I came all the way here with the intention of staying with you.

384
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,380
But we're doing a good thing, aren't we?

385
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,020
I used to fight with my father and left Tsukudaniya.

386
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,320
I thought that my father was lonely, too.

387
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:35,180
I've only met my father five times before.

388
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,600
Then, have you ever had a fight with your parents?

389
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,020
Yes.

390
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,420
Your family has changed a lot.

391
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,420
What should we do from tomorrow, senpai?

392
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
Yes, we have to do it for a while.

393
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,180
What's wrong with you?

394
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,920
I'm so tired.

395
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,620
Your father is really strong.

396
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,640
I can't stand it.

397
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,540
Koukichi, you've become a very polite person.

398
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,980
Koukichi, you've become an adult, too.

399
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,280
What's wrong with you?

400
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,080
In the past, you called me a bad father and a stubborn old man,

401
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,060
but now you've become a stubborn old man.

402
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,520
Stubborn old man?

403
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,160
I'm afraid you're not like me.

404
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,980
After a long time, you've become a good person.

405
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,020
Actually, I'm...

407
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,460
Koukichi, I'm sorry.

408
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,800
The doctor said you were excited.

409
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:35,980
I'm sure you're excited.

410
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,940
If you talk about the truth and your blood pressure goes up again,

411
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,660
I don't know what's going to happen next.

412
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,660
Senpai, I can't deceive Mr. Tayama anymore.

413
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,020
Do it.

414
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,840
If you tell me about your red-haired old man's son,

415
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,860
I'll be in trouble.

416
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,160
Father!

417
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,560
What are you doing?

418
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,060
I'll go and clean up the room.

419
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,220
That's how you talk in the past.

420
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,080
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,560
Listen to your son.

422
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,300
That's right!

423
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,320
I'm not like my father.

424
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,160
I can't lose to my son.

425
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,200
You're a good-for-nothing boy!

426
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,620
Mr. Tayama seems to be healthy.

427
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,760
I feel good today.

428
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,680
What a good night.

429
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,220
I will never forget him no matter what.

430
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,680
What are you talking about?

431
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm not that stupid.

432
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,720
What did you say?

433
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,440
I'm tired of being a servant.

434
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,620
What's wrong, Kokichi?

435
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,360
Are you going to take a bath?

436
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:58,640
What?

437
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,560
You're always so excited when you come to the bath.

438
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,660
Look, Ko-chan!

439
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,780
I'm coming!

440
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,490
He's coming...

441
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,080
Show me what you got, Kokichi.

442
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,520
What?

443
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,260
No?

444
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,440
Well...

445
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,600
I see...

446
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,940
You're still not used to it.

447
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,340
You're still not used to it.

448
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,120
You only care about the tip of your tongue and the bottom of your heart.

449
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,640
Boss!

450
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,300
Hey, what's going on?

451
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,040
What's wrong?

452
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,760
Calm down.

453
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,100
Hey!

454
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,720
Kokichi...

455
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,300
When did you come here?

456
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,520
I'm the real Kokichi.

457
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,880
Sorry, Dad.

458
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,760
Kokichi...

459
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,500
Kokichi!

460
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,060
Dad...

461
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,540
I thought I'd have to go home before you gave me a bath.

462
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,460
But I still feel dizzy.

463
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,280
But...

464
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,360
I'm sorry.

465
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,240
Don't say that.

466
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
You're the best.

467
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,100
I'm...

468
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,980
I'm...

469
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,360
I'm glad you came, Dad.

470
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,340
I'm glad.

471
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,900
I'm glad you came.

472
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,520
I'm glad you came.

473
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,080
It's...

474
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,900
It's not your fault.

475
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,420
Dad, look!

476
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,120
Look!

477
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,420
Look!

478
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,000
Look!

479
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,860
Look!

480
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,940
Look!

481
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,680
Then who is that?

482
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,640
Hey, it's me!

483
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,760
What? It's real!

484
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,620
Hey, it's me!

485
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,400
Well, it's fine.

486
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,120
Look, Aito-chan! Look!

487
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,220
That old man's heart easily took the Nagagawa Tenegui that we couldn't even take by force.

488
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,120
It's a good story like the north wind and the sun.

489
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,020
The north is great!

490
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,980
We meet again, Professor Tondemo.

491
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,940
What? You're going to the moon this time?

492
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,660
So why do I have to go to space with you?

493
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,840
Next time on Unspeakable Stories: Ryo's Journey to the Moon.

494
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,580
See you!

495
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,640
Surprised.

496
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,260
Quiet.

497
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,780
Shaking.

498
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Warmth.

499
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:39,800
And ...

500
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,260
Sudden.

501
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,000
and flicker.

502
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,980
Shake.

503
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,040
and gather.

504
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,080
and take action!

505
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,440
And fly.

506
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,780
It feel like they have more power than anything.

507
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,520
With everyone being together!

508
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
If we eat here,

509
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,680
Like a dream, the final energy

510
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,460
Looking at tomorrow, believing in yesterday

511
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,880
Drawing the universe, if you stand on the ground

512
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,100
The planet of the turtle will spin and draw a circle

513
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,860
Isn't this good?

514
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,400
There's no good reason!

515
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,980
Thanks for watching!
