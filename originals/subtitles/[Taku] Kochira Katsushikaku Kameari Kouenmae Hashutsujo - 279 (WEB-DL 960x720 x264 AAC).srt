1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,060
"Hand in Hand"

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,860
When you watch TV, light up your room and look away.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,680
"Hand in Hand"

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,200
Come to me, you poor thing.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,940
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

6
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:35,900
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

7
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,120
You'll be alright eventually.

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,000
You know it, don't you?

9
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,700
You know it, don't you?

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,120
If you know it, then stay quiet and come to me.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,360
"Hand in Hand"

12
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,780
"Hand in Hand"

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,060
Here is the Yuki-guni Expo.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:08,680
"Hand in Hand"

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,820
"Hand in Hand"

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,540
"Hand in Hand"

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,820
"Hand in Hand"

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,480
"Hand in Hand"

19
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:34,920
"Hand in Hand"

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,220
"Hand in Hand"

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,080
"Hand in Hand"

22
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,140
"Hand in Hand"

23
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,400
"Hand in Hand"

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:53,800
"Hand in

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,480
I'm glad you're here.

26
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,680
Who's there?!

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,800
Oh, Ryo-chan!

28
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,380
You were there?

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,200
I wasn't there.

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,320
Make sure you check before you drop me!

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,060
You idiot!

32
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,860
I'm late, so don't say that!

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,840
Master...

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,640
With your enormous stamina,

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,140
why don't you center yourself for people?

36
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,400
Go on, what do you mean?

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,600
From snow.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,720
Go help snowman around town.

39
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,820
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,320
haupt!

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,980
Ryo-san, you saved me.

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,880
You need to work on snow best.

43
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,180
Shit!

44
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,000
Damn it! I'm not a bulldozer!

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,600
Well, don't say that.

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,220
I'll treat you to lunch later.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,580
What? Really?

48
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,420
Yeah.

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,460
Okay, then I'll do it!

50
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,080
Ouch!

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,580
Who's there?

52
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,620
Strike!

53
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,020
You guys!

54
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,420
I'm sorry!

55
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,400
My butt hurts!

56
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,440
Damn it!

57
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,420
Wait!

58
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,320
Yeah!

59
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,520
Come here!

60
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,820
Come here!

61
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,080
Wait!

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,140
I'm sorry!

63
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,400
I did it!

64
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,680
Great success!

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,700
You guys!

66
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,680
Damn it!

67
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,180
Look at them!

68
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,940
Leave them as they are.

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,220
If you make a hole here, they'll get caught.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,740
Okay.

71
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,840
Okay, it's done.

72
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,140
It's a perfectly done hole.

73
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,140
You did a good job.

74
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,240
Of course.

75
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,040
If you get caught, I'll do it again.

76
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,760
I've lived like this since I was a child.

77
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,100
Ryo-tsu.

78
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,840
Yes, sir!

79
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,720
Stop snowboarding and do something stupid!

80
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,480
What are you talking about?

81
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,040
I snowboarded on the surface and brought it here.

82
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,660
Help me!

83
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,740
It's your own fault!

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,280
You idiot!

85
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,200
What are you doing?

86
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,500
You're going to be buried in there forever.

87
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,460
Please stop.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There's no point in making a fool of yourself.

89
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,740
It's a joke, Ryo-tsu.

90
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,920
You're not stopping, are you?

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,900
We just finished the patrol.

92
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,460
Thank you for your hard work.

93
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,500
Thank you for your hard work.

94
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,000
It's raining again.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,680
Yes.

96
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,720
It's going to be raining again tonight.

97
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,360
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

98
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,500
Yes, sir.

99
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:31,800
Okay.

100
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,320
There was no other problem.

101
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,880
But you're poor, Ryo-chan.

102
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,900
You shouldn't have taken a night shift.

103
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,640
Shut up.

104
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,860
I'm not really poor.

105
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,280
I'm just being with you.

106
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,060
You're so stupid.

107
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,120
If you're with me on a day like this,

108
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,980
I'm sure I'll be left with a lot of meals.

109
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,680
Damn it.

110
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,820
Well, I'm so lucky that I give up.

111
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,540
Excuse me.

112
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,860
See you.

113
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,500
Damn it!

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,960
This is going to be serious.

115
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,540
Come on, let's hurry back.

116
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,740
They're all so arrogant.

117
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,160
Then, Ryo-san, I'll be leaving at 8:05.

118
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,580
Wait.

119
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,660
What is it, Ryo-san?

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,820
Your house will take three hours from here, right?

121
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,260
That's why if you don't go soon, you won't make it to the last train.

122
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,980
I said wait.

123
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,300
You're missing out on something important.

124
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,720
What if you get on the train and you can't move on the way?

125
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,400
No way.

126
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,360
You'll be locked up in the snow on the train.

127
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,720
You won't be rescued until tomorrow morning.

128
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,020
The electricity will stop, the heating won't work, and you'll freeze.

129
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,980
Poor thing.

130
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,080
No way.

131
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,800
It's already 8:00.

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,220
You won't make it on time.

133
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:51,960
You'll be late.

134
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,180
That's terrible, Ryo-san.

135
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,560
So you're going to be with me until tomorrow morning, right?

136
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,460
Ryo-sama.

137
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,020
Oh, Maria.

138
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,540
Ryo-sama, I heard you're on a night shift tonight, so I brought you some drinks.

139
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,580
Oh, I'm so happy. I'll welcome you.

140
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,920
Oh, are you with me, too?

141
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,500
Well...

142
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,480
Then let's have a hot pot party tonight.

143
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,320
Hot pot? Sounds good.

144
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,500
Sounds good.

145
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh, this looks delicious.

146
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,540
Ryo-sama, don't stick your tongue out.

147
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,500
Sorry, sorry.

148
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,640
Oh, that's right.

149
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,280
Let's call Honda.

150
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,900
Oh, Honda.

151
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,480
Actually, there's someone who really wants to meet you at the station.

152
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,500
Who is it?

153
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,060
He's so plump and slimy.

154
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,320
Oh, is that so?

155
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,120
Are you coming soon?

156
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,940
I'll be waiting.

157
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,420
OK.

158
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,220
So there are four of us.

159
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,380
I think we'll be able to spend a good night with this many guys.

160
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,380
I'm sorry to upset you.

161
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,440
The train is stopping in the direction of Shinko for some reason.

162
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,580
Please wait for a moment.

163
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:03,780
What?

164
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,720
Are you kidding me?

165
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,600
That's terrible.

166
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,500
I came to this place after all that snow.

167
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,460
That's not true.

168
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,000
What's wrong with that meat?

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,700
What's wrong with beef?

170
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,220
It's a plump, slimy, and plump female cow meat.

171
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,360
I thought you were saying in a troubled voice, "Honda-san, eat it!"

172
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,940
Don't joke around! I'm really going home!

173
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,400
Would you like to eat a little?

174
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,720
It's okay!

175
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,000
You're so ridiculous. I'll let you eat it later.

176
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,960
Ryo-san, I don't want to eat beef no matter what.

177
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,020
I thought it was interesting.

178
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,220
Senpai, something's going on!

179
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,060
So, let's eat it!

180
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,820
Let's eat it!

181
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,140
The concentrated wire that attacked Kameari district in Katsushika has finally exceeded one meter and is starting to damage.

182
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,380
Yes, this is Katsushika.

183
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,560
Ten houses in the third district?

184
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,940
I understand. I will leave immediately.

185
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, no! Two houses in the third district!

186
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,160
It's a flood on the first hill!

187
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,920
We can't handle it alone.

188
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
I just got a call from the head office.

189
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,340
I need to contact all the office workers.

190
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,280
Roger that.

191
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,520
Katsushika

192
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,360
Hey, Honda, hurry up!

193
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,720
Hmm...

194
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,200
Then, I'll use this...

195
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,580
Hehehe...

196
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,400
By the way, the other day, my bike...

197
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,980
Oh, Honda, what's up with changing the topic suddenly?

198
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,120
It's nothing.

199
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
There are terrible people in the world.

200
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,300
The other day, a garbage bag was placed on the seat of my bike.

201
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,060
And it was a garbage bag.

202
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,520
That's terrible.

203
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,960
Speaking of terrible, the manju I put in the refrigerator was gone before I knew it.

204
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,840
I was going to eat it with Ryo-sama.

205
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,560
But...

206
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,860
That's true.

207
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,620
That's terrible.

208
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,100
By the way, the luggage I received from my family is gone.

209
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,740
What?

210
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,620
What's wrong, Honda?

211
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,440
No, no, no.

212
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,340
This is also said that there are terrible people.

213
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,540
Hahaha...

214
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,460
Well, we just want to avoid that kind of thing.

215
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,360
That's right.

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,300
Ryo-san says good things sometimes.

217
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,480
Sometimes it's unnecessary...

218
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:35,820
What?

219
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,440
Hehehe...

220
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,500
Hehehe...

221
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,220
Hehehe...

222
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,460
Hehehe...

223
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,240
Hahaha...

224
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,120
Hahaha...

225
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,280
Citizens!

226
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,120
The weight of the snow is afraid of the collapse of the house!

227
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,560
The caravan will turn, so please evacuate calmly!

228
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,720
Chief!

229
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,020
Nakagawa, how are the residents evacuating?

230
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,260
It's fine.

231
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,320
I'm fine.

232
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,860
I'll be done in about 30 minutes.

233
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,040
I see.

234
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,660
By the way, I don't see Ryotsu.

235
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,720
Komachi-chan and the others contacted the evacuation center many times, but no one came out.

236
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,500
That's him.

237
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,440
He probably skipped it anyway.

238
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,240
He's a completely useless guy.

239
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,400
Ah...

240
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,380
Ouch!

241
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,180
Ouch!

242
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,340
Ouch!

243
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:28,940
Ouch!

244
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,580
I did it!

245
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,740
I beat them all!

246
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,480
Senpai, it's unfair.

247
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,560
It's unfair.

248
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,320
You gathered so many pillows.

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,860
That's right.

250
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,120
Why do you have so many pillows?

251
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,560
But I remember the pillow throw of the school trip.

252
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,320
Yeah, I enjoyed remembering my childhood.

253
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,920
That's right.

254
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,020
All right.

255
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,520
What should we play next?

256
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,140
Eh?

257
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,220
Are you still doing something?

258
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,040
Of course!

259
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,020
I'll do it until I get sick!

260
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,800
I'll do it until I get sick!

261
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,120
I'll do it until I get sick!

262
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,020
Six days later

263
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,200
Whaaa!

264
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,120
It's pitch black!

265
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,800
Could it be too early to wake up?

266
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,460
It's past 8 o'clock already, and it's still dark.

267
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,280
Huh?

268
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,100
It's weird.

269
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,300
It's power cut.

270
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,680
Huh?

271
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,520
It's not open.

272
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,260
Ugh!

273
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,420
What's up?

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,800
There is no light?

275
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,400
And it doesn't open the window.

276
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,500
It's weird.

277
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,340
Ugh.

278
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,760
It's still late at night, so it's not a big deal.

279
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,100
It's already past 8 in the morning.

280
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:36,960
What?

281
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,120
That's so weird!

282
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,320
Ryo-san! What have you been up to?

283
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,680
R-Ryo-san, look at this!

284
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,800
Oh, come on.

285
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,320
What's this?

286
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,060
Oh, no. It's completely covered in snow.

287
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,920
What's going on outside? Maria, turn on the TV.

288
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,080
Yes.

289
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,820
Honda, contact the office!

290
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,680
Yes!

291
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,180
No, it's not working.

292
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,300
It's still off.

293
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,500
What about the phone?

294
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,400
No, it's not working.

295
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,700
Damn it.

296
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,340
The water pipe is frozen or broken.

297
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,440
What?

298
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,880
My phone is not connected.

299
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,460
What should we do? It's completely broken.

300
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,700
What if it gets stuck like this while I'm asleep?

301
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,160
What should we do?

302
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:37,000
At last, the concentrated around Kameari was recorded as the biggest in Tokyo, so it was more than 5 meters in the winter.

303
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,080
But for some reason, the area around it is only limited to Kameari.

304
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,560
We can't even get an idea what's going on outside at this rate!

305
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,540
Anyway, let's dig into the snow and see what's going on!

306
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,260
I'm counting on you, Ryo-san!

307
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,840
Senpai, please get help quickly!

308
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,120
Please call me.

309
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,220
I'm looking forward to it.

310
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll be back.

311
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,300
No!

312
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,660
The door won't open!

313
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,340
You guys, lend me your hands!

314
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,720
I-I got it.

315
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,800
Ouch!

316
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
What is it?

317
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,660
Ryo-sama, please close the door!

318
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,680
Hurry up!

319
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,920
What is it?

320
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,460
It stopped.

321
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,720
Maybe the exhaust pipe is in a very poor condition.

322
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,660
The weight of the snow is balanced on the entire building.

323
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,760
So the exhaust pipe is in its current shape.

324
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,800
But if the door is opened and the balance is broken, the exhaust pipe will not be able to withstand the weight.

325
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,080
We are in a bad time.

326
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,560
What the hell!

327
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
We can't escape when we're completely isolated!

328
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,140
Damn it!

329
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,020
What should we do?

330
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
This is a serious matter.

331
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,380
Yeah.

332
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,480
It was correct to launch an evacuation plan as soon as possible.

333
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,280
I didn't expect a 5-meter stone wall.

334
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,280
Nakagawa, you lead the carousel and the gun.

335
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,180
Go to the carousel in the town.

336
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,580
Got it.

337
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,540
Reiko, patrol the town to see if anyone has run away.

338
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,800
Roger.

339
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,040
But what is Ryo-san doing?

340
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,740
What is he doing?

341
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,640
He is late even at this time.

342
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,280
The carousel is closed.

343
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,520
Senpai, let's put the stove on.

344
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,960
Idiot!

345
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,260
If we put the stove on when it is closed, it will become a cold.

346
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,920
But if we do not do it, we will freeze to death.

347
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,320
I'm not sleepy.

348
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,480
Hey, don't sleep.

349
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,540
If you sleep, you will die.

350
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,180
I'm very sleepy.

351
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,040
Please wake up.

352
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,100
Please wake up.

353
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,980
Hey, Honda, don't sleep.

354
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,160
You are not going to sleep.

355
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,220
Ryo-san, wake up.

356
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,720
Don't fall asleep.

357
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,840
It was really snowing beside Kameari District.

358
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:03,920
It seems so.

359
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,540
Here, this is the stuffing.

360
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,220
Reiko, good work.

361
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,280
Thank you.

362
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:11,920
We will change it.

363
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,100
Thank you.

364
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,860
It really helps us.

365
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,400
By the way, didn't you see Maria-chan, Reiko?

366
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,560
No.

367
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
No, he didn't come here.

368
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,500
Is that so? I haven't been able to contact him since last night.

369
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,740
Anyway, it seems that Honda and Terai didn't go home.

370
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,920
Is something wrong?

371
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,300
I'm not sleepy anymore, but my face feels a little tight for some reason.

372
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,040
Oh, is that so? It's your imagination.

373
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,080
I see.

374
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,160
I'm hungry.

375
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,380
If that's the case, I should have left some of the pot yesterday.

376
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,980
I used up all the ingredients I brought.

377
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,500
I want to eat yakiniku, nabe yaki udon, curry dashi ramen.

378
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,280
Stop it! If you imagine it, you won't be able to bear it anymore.

379
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,500
What's wrong?

380
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,880
Nothing.

381
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,340
That's suspicious.

382
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,580
Terai, take off your blanket.

383
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,220
Why?

384
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,420
Take it off.

385
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:19,960
It's cold.

386
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,280
It's chocolate.

387
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,180
Terai, you're mean. You were going to eat it by yourself.

388
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,840
I just realized it.

389
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,800
Shut up. I won't let you eat this chocolate as punishment.

390
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,760
Instead, I'll eat it.

391
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,580
Senior, that's unfair.

392
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,560
That's right. We should share it.

393
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,300
That's right. It's mine.

394
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,980
What are you talking about?

395
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,920
If you eat it, the fight will continue.

396
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,440
That's why I'm going to punish you.

397
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,280
I'll eat it too.

398
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,820
Me too.

399
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,140
I won't let you eat it.

400
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,740
Owie.

401
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,100
Take it.

402
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,760
There's no chocolate.

403
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,480
What?

404
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,940
I'm sorry.

405
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,500
It's not good.

406
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,760
If this is the case, we should have eaten together.

407
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,800
No.

408
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,060
Oh, it's okay. I can still eat it.

409
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,800
It's a little dusty, but it's delicious.

410
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,680
Ryo-sama.

411
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,880
Please put the snow from the city down here for now.

412
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,220
But even if we collect the snow from the city,

413
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,880
I don't know if we can make it in time with just the park space.

414
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,620
Oh, that's...

415
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,040
This is a light bulb in front of the exhaust.

416
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,740
That means...

417
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,780
Senpai, you didn't expect...

418
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,580
I was too hungry because I used up all my energy.

419
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,280
No one's coming to help me.

420
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,360
I wonder if we're going to die like this.

421
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,740
That's right.

422
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,820
I want to die so that I don't have to think about it.

423
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,800
Mr. Honda, I'm sorry.

424
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,920
I was wrong.

425
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,660
What's wrong?

426
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,040
I was the one who put a trash bag on Mr. Honda's bike yesterday.

427
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,780
I was the one who put a trash bag on Mr. Honda's bike yesterday.

428
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,820
I'm sorry.

429
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,300
I'm sorry.

430
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,360
I was the one who ate Mr. Honda's buns.

431
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,100
I was the one who ate Mr. Honda's buns.

432
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,240
It looked so delicious that I ate it without thinking.

433
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,020
I'm sorry.

434
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,580
I'm the one who opened Mr. Honda's luggage without permission.

435
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,040
I'm the one who opened Mr. Honda's luggage without permission.

436
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,020
Is that so?

437
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,700
Yes.

438
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,000
I opened it by mistake without seeing where it was sent.

439
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,760
I'm really sorry.

440
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,520
No one makes mistakes like that.

441
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,960
That's right.

442
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,780
I didn't do anything wrong.

443
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,020
I can't go to the bathroom.

444
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,960
What?

445
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,240
Then will you forgive me?

446
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,380
Of course.

447
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,200
I don't really care about trash.

448
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,400
Mr. Honda.

449
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,360
Ms. Maria.

450
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,060
Ms. Terai.

451
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,120
Thank you.

452
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,320
You guys are great.

453
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,200
It's wonderful to talk about the truth and deepen friendship.

454
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,460
Mr. Ryo.

455
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:58,680
Mr. Ryo.

456
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,080
I thought about it.

457
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,960
I said to open Mr. Terai's luggage.

458
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,120
I'm sure it was a senior.

459
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,310
What?

460
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,060
By the way, Mr. Ryo said that he could eat the manjuu in the refrigerator.

461
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,180
Was that so?

462
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,820
At that time, I was going to throw away the trash when I went out to eat with Mr. Ryo.

463
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,360
That's right.

464
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,900
I don't have time, so I'll put it on a motorcycle and clean it up later.

465
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,460
Is that so?

466
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,520
Calm down, everyone.

467
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,500
Calm down.

468
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,420
Cool your head with this.

469
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,100
Calm down.

470
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,300
What ...

471
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,200
You're waiting for help in such a place?

472
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,180
If it's like this, you'll get out of here at once.

473
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,720
This is the escape site?

474
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Is Ryotsu really also in here?

475
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,060
Yes.

476
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,880
After all, Ryou hasn't returned, so maybe he'll stay in the snow.

477
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,840
Ms. Maria said that she couldn't reach you because of last night's afraid.

478
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,860
Maybe ...

479
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,120
Temporarily, there is a possibility that you won't be able to contact Mr. Terai and Mr. Honda.

480
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,540
If we can't contact them, it's highly likely that they're with us.

481
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,420
Yes. If we don't hurry, the exit might collapse due to the heavy snow.

482
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,520
Ryotsu...

483
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,600
Listen, I'll go alone and open the door.

484
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,840
So dig up the snow and escape before the exit collapses.

485
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:19,940
Roger!

486
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,340
Alright, let's go!

487
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,100
Yeah!

488
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,440
Go!

489
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,260
What's going on?

490
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,960
This is bad! It's collapsing!

491
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,120
Ryotsu!

492
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,500
The exit...

493
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,460
Now there's no place for us to go back!

494
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,680
We have no choice but to go to the ground!

495
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,800
Are you alright, Ryotsu?

496
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,580
I'll never see a man like you again!

497
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,720
You're in trouble!

498
00:20:59,500 --> 00:20:59,980
Nope.

499
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,580
It's only three or four meters down when the exit's collapsed.

500
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,720
It's a good time to go outside.

501
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,360
What's happening?!

502
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,700
Master Ryo, let's dig in another direction!

503
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,500
That's right.

504
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,660
There's a lot of heavy snow here.

505
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,640
It might be piled up.

506
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,180
Alright, then I'll go this way!

507
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,680
There's so much snow!

508
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,380
It's snowing everywhere.

509
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,080
How many meters did it pile up?

510
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,040
It's no good.

511
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,560
It's snowing all over the world.

512
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,320
We're going to die here.

513
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,540
Don't say that.

514
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,860
We'll be saved.

515
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,700
We can't die here.

516
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,940
If this happens, we'll have to go up.

517
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,020
Where is it?

518
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,800
Give me an answer.

519
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,080
Mr. Tera, Mr. Honda.

520
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,240
Maria.

521
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,680
It's up.

522
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:54,880
It's up.

523
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,480
We have to go up.

524
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,940
Senpais aren't here.

525
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,660
Let's look around.

526
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes.

527
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,280
Look.

528
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,820
It's bright outside.

529
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,280
It's out.

530
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,160
We're saved.

531
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,700
What's this height?

532
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,880
The chiefs are there.

533
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,780
It's me.

534
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,820
Ryotsu.

535
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
Why are they there?

536
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,620
Idiot.

537
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,240
I'm worried about you.

538
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,180
Chief.

539
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,820
Don't worry about me.

540
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,540
Chief.

541
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,680
What's this sound?

542
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:35,700
Chief.

543
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,140
Good.

544
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,700
The whole world is covered in snow.

545
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:40,800
Yes.

546
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,680
Ryo.

547
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,420
Hasn't it been shaking?

548
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,600
It's a high place.

549
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,180
It's shaking.

550
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,680
Ryo.

551
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,100
The ground is strange.

552
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,160
It seems to be moving away.

553
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,580
Ryotsu.

554
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,420
We're going to the rescue team right now.

555
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,280
Stay still.

556
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,800
What?

557
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,600
Please say it louder.

558
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,480
No.

559
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,880
Don't say it loud.

560
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,300
What?

561
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,280
What?

562
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,380
I told you.

563
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,360
If you say it loud, the snow...

564
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,780
I can't hear you at all.

565
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,720
Please say it louder.

566
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,080
I told you to say it loud.

567
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,040
It's going to flow.

568
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,660
You'll be sorry.

569
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,000
Well, it's dangerous.

570
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,660
It's dangerous.

571
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,620
Ryotsu!

572
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,420
I thought I was dead.

573
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,940
Hey, Ryotsu!

574
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,480
Chief...

575
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,720
How much trouble can you bring yourself to do this?

576
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,360
You're going to be snow-capped for the rest of your life!

577
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,820
That's not my fault!

578
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,140
Chief!

579
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,900
Help me!

580
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,240
Why?

581
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,520
Why is Ryo-san's...

582
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,120
Ryo-san's eyebrows are black?

583
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,600
Why does he look so pale?

584
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,540
Why?

585
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,300
Why does he run so fast even though he's wearing sandals?

586
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,140
Why?

587
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,500
Why?

588
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,920
Why does Ryo-san always have his arms around his neck?

589
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,780
Why?

590
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,400
Why does he look so flabby but still be loved by everyone?

591
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,140
Why?

592
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,060
Why?

593
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,460
It doesn't matter, but...

594
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,520
The title of this anime has been going on for so long...

595
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,740
"Katsushikaku Kameari Kouenmai"

596
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,240
I wonder why?

597
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:03,960
Why?

598
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,100
I wonder why?

599
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:09,920
Why?

600
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,000
Why?

601
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,160
Why?

602
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:11,840
Why?

603
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:11,900
Why?

604
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,560
Why?

605
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,220
"Tenkyoku Oyaji"

606
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,040
What's up, Tenkyoku Oyaji?

607
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,660
Are you selling new products again?

608
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,760
A car with automatic control function connected to the canopy?

609
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,000
Sounds interesting!

610
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,500
"Put it on!"

611
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,260
Where did this car go?

612
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,240
And it doesn't stop!

613
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,980
It can't be a defective product!

614
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,980
Next time, "Where is this place, Tenkyoku Oyaji?"

615
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,580
Please watch!

616
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,880
Thank you!
