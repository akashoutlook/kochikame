Don't lie to me.

No matter how much I ask, you don't tell me.

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,780
I'm so tired.

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,040
Ryo, are you ready to go home?

32
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,660
It's about time to go.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,640
Oh, you're on the way to the station?

34
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,500
Go straight ahead.

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,300
Sorry, go ahead.

36
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,020
I'll be there soon.

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,540
Ryo, what's going on?

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,180
Huh?

39
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,900
Isn't that Shuzaburo Himeji?

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,220
I don't think so.

41
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,040
Is that famous archaeologist Shuzaburo Himeji?

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,020
I think he was trying to dig up the

43
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,580
Tokugawa buried gold by

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,220
It was a failure, after all.

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,520
Well, it's about time to go on patrol.

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,900
Ryo, you're not going to go

47
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,160
find that guy's buried gold, are you?

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Buried gold?

49
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,460
Are you planning something so stupid again?

50
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,860
What do you mean stupid?

51
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,740
I'm a man.

52
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,840
I want you to call it a man's dream.

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,420
A man's dream.

54
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,680
What's a man's dream?

55
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,500
The most important thing is for humans to work and live on their own.

56
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,980
Looking for buried gold is not something a man would do for that kind of money.

57
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,760
Senior, buried gold is not something you can find so easily.

58
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,980
Well, you'll have to see.

59
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,240
Well, gentlemen, I'll be in your care.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,060
Wait, wait, Ryo.

61
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,900
That guy is...

62
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,720
I can answer for money myself.

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,980
That's a�eI...

64
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,540
I've never found any place like this.

65
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,060
I've never found any place like this.

66
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,840
College is guess what?

67
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,500
Yes!

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,560
Hello!

69
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,580
Well, hello.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,440
Hello!

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,140
Look, this man is here.

72
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,120
Look, this man is here.

73
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,120
That's why people call it the Man's Day.

74
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,960
Some people come to this castle

75
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,320
because they know that城 is the people's land.

76
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,100
Some people come to this castle

77
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,300
because they know that it's their home.

78
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,140
"Man's Day Tokugawa"

79
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,600
That's why people call it the Man's Day Town.

80
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,540
And to make it look like a real one, they used a golden scale.

81
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,820
The real one doesn't have a scale, but the scale was originally made by a monster.

82
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,840
If you put it on the both ends of the building, it protects you from fire.

83
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,080
No matter how bad it is, the scale is made of pure gold.

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,980
Yes, because there was a golden scale in the sea.

85
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,640
They made it by melting a large amount of gold.

86
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,860
I'm not interested in the amount, but the scale is two and it costs 100 million yen.

87
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,640
What? 100 million yen?

88
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,020
Tell me that first. If you know that, I'll be in a daze.

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
Hurry up and find the castle.

90
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,760
I just want to find the hidden castle of Takeda Shingen.

91
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,720
There's no way out of the navigation.

92
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,020
Which way?

93
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,960
This way.

94
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,640
Is this really the right way?

95
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,740
There's no doubt. It's the way to the library.

96
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,420
What is this?

97
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,420
This place looks like a hidden castle of Shingen.

98
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,100
Hey, we're not looking for the Tojima Castle.

99
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,720
What?

100
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,360
Chachihogo, you're not talking about that, are you?

101
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,600
No, no.

102
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,400
It's strange. This Tojima Castle is not on the map.

103
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,780
Well, well, we'll have to think about the future.

104
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,660
Oh, look. There's a proper way.

105
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,100
After all, there's no doubt that it's the library.

106
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,820
It's a dead end.

107
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,900
It's a good old library.

108
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,420
Hmm, maybe...

109
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,160
Is it like this? Or...

110
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,740
Hey, let me try.

111
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,520
Hey, stop. What are you doing?

112
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,760
This is a valuable document I found after all the trouble.

113
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,060
Just give it to me.

114
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,340
No.

115
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,780
Give it to me.

116
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,280
No.

117
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,460
No.

118
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:01,560
No.

119
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,200
No.

120
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,500
No.

121
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,860
No.

122
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,040
No.

123
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,020
No.

124
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,500
No.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,340
No.

126
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,060
Ow!

127
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:26,440
Ow!

128
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,480
Ow!

129
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:26,640
Ow!

130
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:26,980
I'm short of money.

131
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,380
Don't be ridiculous!

132
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,540
Oh, there's a house over there.

133
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,200
It looks like a tea shop.

134
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,680
Hey, I'm taking a break.

135
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,960
Welcome.

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,700
I'll have some tea and dango.

137
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,440
Where are you going?

138
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,760
Actually, I'm looking for something around here.

139
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,080
What are you looking for?

140
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,540
What is it?

141
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,280
I was walking in the mountains,

142
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,240
and I was a little lost.

143
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,820
Yeah, that's right.

144
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,020
But what is it?

145
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,840
No one will come to a tea shop in such a place.

146
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,540
What?

147
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,000
There are some customers who are lost like you.

148
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,980
Don't worry.

149
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,480
Oh, I see.

150
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,080
Hey, if you eat dango,

151
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,420
you have to go down here.

152
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,960
If you go for a while,

153
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,000
you'll run into the mountain road.

154
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,640
What are you going to do, Ryo?

155
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,540
It's definitely here.

156
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,860
It smells like gold.

157
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,880
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,980
I just got lost.

159
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,200
What?

160
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,780
Grandpa, I'll leave the tea in here.

161
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,240
I don't need the fishing rod.

162
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,540
Wait a minute.

163
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:56,860
Huh?

164
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,780
What are you trying to do with this 1000 yen?

165
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,500
What? Is it too much?

166
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,960
Don't you dare say such nonsense!

167
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,960
One cup of tea, 500 yen.

168
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,600
Three dango, 1000 yen.

169
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,580
For two, 3000 yen.

170
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,240
Pay me properly.

171
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,600
Th-3000 yen?!

172
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,100
Damn it!

173
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,500
What an old man!

174
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,360
He's looking at the customer's feet!

175
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah.

176
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,300
It's in this mountain where there's no electricity, gas, or water.

177
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,240
It's in a mountain like this where there's no water.

178
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,100
Even 3000 yen won't be enough.

179
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,240
I get it. I get it.

180
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,080
I'll pay. I'll pay.

181
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,320
Anyway, let's hurry.

182
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,500
Yeah.

183
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:32,920
Hey!

184
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,700
Thank you for coming again.

185
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,780
You're not coming again!

186
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,440
No, no!

187
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,380
You're not going!

188
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,780
I told you the mountain road is over there.

189
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,560
It's a snowy road ahead.

190
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,660
If you enter without permission, there will be a dead end.

191
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,920
Dead end?

192
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,020
Dead end?

193
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,220
Huh?

194
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,900
You idiot.

195
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,080
Get out of the way.

196
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,340
It was a real snowy road.

197
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,460
Yeah, as that stupid old man said.

198
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,680
I'm sure there's an illusion castle nearby.

199
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,160
Yeah.

200
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,900
I can't climb this rock wall.

201
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,040
Yeah.

202
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,480
I'll take a shower while I can.

203
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,740
Yeah.

204
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,680
I'm so frustrated that I have no choice but to return it.

205
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,240
Huh?

206
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,740
Huh?

207
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,960
What's wrong?

208
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,280
Come here for a second.

209
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,220
Yeah.

210
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,420
Can't you take a shower by yourself?

211
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,260
I can.

212
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,040
But not like that.

213
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,240
Try pouring water here.

214
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,300
Pour some sand too.

215
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,060
I'm not a cat.

216
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,000
Like this?

217
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm a cat.

218
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,920
It sounds like water's flowing down.

219
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,080
I think there's something down there.

220
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,160
But I can't move a big rock like this.

221
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,640
Oh!

222
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,440
It's moving.

223
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,340
What's that?

224
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,200
A stone of light weight?

225
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,020
Ryo, I knew something's going on.

226
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,320
'A stone of light weight'

227
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,780
'A stone of light weight'

228
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,740
'A stone of light weight'

229
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,480
'A stone of light weight'

230
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,940
'A stone of light weight'

231
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,620
Look.

232
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,940
Look, the exit is open.

233
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,440
It's the castle!

234
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,540
It's the illusion castle!

235
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,480
I did it! The golden carousel!

236
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,400
I found it! I finally found it!

237
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,440
But you're standing there looking down on the sky, aren't you?

238
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,100
This looks like a secret garden.

239
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,920
That's why it's the illusion castle.

240
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,460
The master who was the master of the Shin'en Palace was a very good person.

241
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,620
He built this castle for the coward who left his family.

242
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,560
Well, I can understand that he didn't find it until now.

243
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,320
But how do you get that?

244
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,360
There are no bridges all over the place.

245
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,860
You have to use the bridge and the bridge from the main gate to enter.

246
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,420
That's right.

247
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,000
There are two bridges.

248
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,820
Bridge and bridge?

249
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,600
Maybe that's it.

250
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,520
What? I can't reach it.

251
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,460
How about using the other one?

252
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,120
The length is the same.

253
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,360
It's the same thing if you use the other one.

254
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,040
Wait.

255
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Use the bridge and the bridge...

256
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,580
I got it!

257
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,580
This is how I can cross.

258
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,160
I see.

259
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,520
So you used the bridge and the bridge from the main gate.

260
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,380
You can't open this gate.

261
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,020
Damn it! I can't open it!

262
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,140
It's a secret garden.

263
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,220
Damn it! You set up an meaningless sign!

264
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,780
This is a big iron gate.

265
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,340
I'm not scared even if I push it or pull it.

266
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,060
"When Tatsumi meets a horse, it becomes a gate."

267
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,300
It's a code.

268
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,420
Then this statue is probably the clue.

269
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,320
But that's strange. There's no horse.

270
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,860
Isn't the horse a direction?

271
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,100
In the Edo period, the horse was the southern direction.

272
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,960
That's it.

273
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,300
Tatsumi's statue is facing south.

274
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,020
So what is Tatsumi?

275
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,740
Tatsumi is the Tatsu and the snake of the Edo period.

276
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,100
Okay, so the Tatsu and the snake are in the south.

277
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,500
Which is the south?

278
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,240
I can't get a signal to the navigation.

279
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,520
Okay, I'll go with that hand.

280
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,020
What are you going to do with the tree?

281
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,560
I'm going to see the cut.

282
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,520
The one who grows up in the forest is the south.

283
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,980
That's it.

284
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,960
I'm going to see the Tatsu.

285
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,300
I saw the Tatsu too.

286
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,320
And the snake.

287
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,040
It's not a snake. It's a mole.

288
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,180
Ahhhh!

289
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,160
You made a detail picture!

290
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,400
I must be more careful.

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,440
The gate is open, so no complaints.

292
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:34,620
"Tatsumi"

293
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,620
"Tatsumi"

294
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,440
"Tatsumi"

295
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,600
That man has finally come this far.

296
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,880
It's finally my turn.

297
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,380
After 400 years of years of

298
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:50,460
suffering,

299
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,580
we have been protecting this castle forever.

300
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,080
Our phantom clan.

301
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,600
Shin Genkou...

302
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,840
Now I'm all alone,

303
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,560
but what?

304
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,060
I won't lose to the young ones yet.

305
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,800
Let's show them something.

306
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,420
This is almost like a haunted mansion.

307
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,120
It's been hundreds of years since we were born.

308
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,760
I don't have any complaints

309
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,500
if I enter the Shachihoko temple.

310
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,000
Anyway,

311
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,660
we have to climb to the top.

312
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,040
If we go that way...

313
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,860
There's a fishing ceiling,

314
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,480
so be careful.

315
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,620
Then hurry up and tell me!

316
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,500
I'm still alive,

317
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,260
but I still have a lot of tricks up my sleeve.

318
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,820
I don't know what tricks there are.

319
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,740
All right, let's go upstairs.

320
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,980
It's like a comedy.

321
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,840
We haven't done this before.

322
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,640
This is a good way to get in.

323
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,420
I'll deal with you later.

324
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,720
Now let's go upstairs.

325
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,300
I don't feel like I'm still alive.

326
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,300
Get lost.

327
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,660
What the heck?

328
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,700
Huh?

329
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,060
Hold on a second!

330
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,500
Is this enough?

331
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,440
The numbers just got better!

332
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,360
It'd be funny if they weren't 10 gold feathers.

333
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,180
That's a lot of money!

334
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,400
I'm a fool.

335
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,020
If that's the case, I'll use my next move.

336
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,460
Finally we're on the third floor.

337
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,540
The top floor is the fifth floor, so it's still half way there.

338
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,620
Anyway, let's look for the stairs.

339
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,280
Huh? What's that?

340
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,200
There's something written inside.

341
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,820
"To the top floor of the Angel Square."

342
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,040
Oh, is this an elevator?

343
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,100
Hey, isn't that a trap?

344
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,860
Oh, there's an old gold coin here.

345
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,440
What?

346
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,220
I thought it was just a brass plate.

347
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,720
It won't open.

348
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,700
Who is it?

349
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,540
I thought it had bones, but it's still blue.

350
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,160
Hey, you're the old man who stole the tea shop!

351
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,220
Who's the old man who stole it?

352
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,360
I'm not a fool to be deceived by greed!

353
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,280
Enough! Get out of here!

354
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,940
We're the Maboroshi clan.

355
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,940
Since we entered this castle without permission, we can't let you out of there.

356
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,980
The Maboroshi clan?

357
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,140
It's an illusion!

358
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,920
Hmph! Your goal is the gold coin!

359
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,740
But as long as I'm here, I can't touch it with one finger!

360
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,300
Really?

361
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,080
I can't even hold it with one finger!

362
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,660
Oh, you're very confident.

363
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,640
Then if I can touch it, I'll give you a gold coin.

364
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,200
But only if you can get out of there.

365
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,120
Damn it!

366
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,380
Don't forget what you just said!

367
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm a god of hell!

368
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,720
What the hell!

369
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,700
This is it!

370
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,240
What?

371
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,060
That's enough!

372
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,520
Damn, I'm back at full throttle again.

373
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,620
Ryo, will you give up already?

374
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm not giving up!

375
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,800
That old man said he'd give it to me if I could touch it!

376
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,400
I'll reward you with a million-yen tea shop!

377
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,520
Did you get to this point?

378
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,440
It's impossible to get to this point.

379
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,380
I don't know if it's an illusion or something.

380
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,780
If you don't get inside, you get up from the outside.

381
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,880
I should have done this from the beginning.

382
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,100
Ryo, be careful.

383
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,960
Okay, one more breath.

384
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,120
I'm glad you came all the way here.

385
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,220
I'll praise you.

386
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,400
You showed up again.

387
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,600
Good work.

388
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,520
That's all for the game.

389
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,620
I can't return it like this.

390
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,140
My sword can't be removed.

391
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,180
Is my body stiff?

392
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:21,960
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,680
Hey, wait!

394
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,220
It's about time.

395
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,780
Ninpo Katon no Jutsu.

396
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,520
It's over.

397
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,260
Don't put it in front of me.

398
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,880
Damn it.

399
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,780
That guy's not good at all.

400
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,900
Is he Uesugi's ninja?

401
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
You're great!

402
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,060
The Gold Shachihoko!

403
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,600
Stop it!

404
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,740
Don't you dare touch that!

405
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,640
What do you mean?

406
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,920
I promise you it'll heal once I touch it!

407
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,980
D-d-don't.

408
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,960
Shut up!

409
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,640
You want to do anything to me!

410
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,900
Sorry, I said no!

411
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,260
Come, here you are.

412
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,760
Oh, wow!

413
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,260
I can't make it!

414
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,500
It's over.

415
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,560
I know you're upset, but...

416
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,100
There's a great castle even without the Shachihoko.

417
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,600
What?

418
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,900
If you take the Shachihoko, the castle will be destroyed.

419
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,200
What?

420
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,620
So that no one can get the golden Shachihoko.

421
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,840
So that no one can get the golden Shachihoko.

422
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,300
What's going on?

423
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,160
No one can stop me now.

424
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,540
I promise you I'll give you the golden Shachihoko.

425
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:06,880
What?

426
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,740
I promise you I'll give you the golden Shachihoko.

427
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,180
It was you who took the golden Shachihoko!

428
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,720
Do you mean you hid it from me?!

429
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,900
Are youchter?

430
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,180
Just give it a little rest.

431
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Here, I'll show it to you.

432
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,840
There you go!

433
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,820
Don't tell him.

434
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,360
You're telling him?

435
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,000
You're telling him?

436
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,380
You're telling him?!

437
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,500
You're telling him?!

438
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:45,940
What the诺

439
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,260
What the诺

440
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,280
What the诺

441
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,600
Where did you come from?

442
00:21:47,620 --> 00:22:00,540
To be continued

443
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,180
This is such an illusion.

444
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,380
Nobody will believe this anymore.

445
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,580
What is this?

446
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:09,700
I have one.

447
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,480
How is it?

448
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,660
I told you.

449
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,280
This is a whole one of mine.

450
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,280
Everyone, please take good care of it.

451
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,620
Especially you, Bujo.

452
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,160
You can't live a life that's too hard.

453
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,200
I bought it at a souvenir shop.

454
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,740
It's a fake one.

455
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,620
I don't want to, you poor thing.

456
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,260
This is the real one.

457
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,820
Look at it.

458
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,320
It's so shiny.

459
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,820
What's so special about it?

460
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,320
I hit you.

461
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,260
You're blushing.

462
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,240
What?

463
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,640
This is a fake one.

464
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,000
It's not that big of a deal.

465
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,640
You're the real one.

466
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,600
You're the real one.

467
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,500
You're not the fake one.

468
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:08,980
You're the fake one.

469
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,160
Well, you know...

470
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,620
I got it!

471
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,040
I've finally found him.

472
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,700
I'm not an old man.

473
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,520
Call me an old man.

474
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,220
I think it's better to have an older one.

475
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,360
I can't let you.

476
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,580
Yeah.

477
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,720
You can't have an older one.

478
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,280
I see.

479
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,020
Then, can I keep this for myself?

480
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,360
Hi! Hi! Hi!

481
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,080
Brother!

482
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,420
The castle is gone, and I'm so happy.

483
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,440
Living a good life is the best.

484
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,260
Do you want this?

485
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,280
Yes!

486
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,920
I want this!

487
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

488
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,160
When you're done cleaning, buy me some beer and sukiyaki.

489
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,360
What? What?

490
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,160
Are you sure you want to eat this while training?

491
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,880
It's okay! It's okay!

492
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,800
Leave it to me, the leader of the Ryotsu.

493
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,900
Next time, "I'm just training in Ryotsu!"

494
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,600
See you!

495
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:57,240
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

496
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,460
Even if it's a dream, tomorrow will be clear

497
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,700
Bye bye, let's wash our hands

498
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,020
Goodbye, the things we hate

499
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,980
Oh yeah, let's live as we like

500
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,480
There's something good

501
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,180
outside the door

502
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,660
The sun is calling
