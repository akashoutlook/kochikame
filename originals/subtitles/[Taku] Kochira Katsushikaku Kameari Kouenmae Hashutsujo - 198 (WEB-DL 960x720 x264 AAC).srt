do

72
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:53,960
well ?

73
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,840
Ryo, who always rests on his own, is giving us a vacation.

74
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,940
Senpai, what's going on?

75
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,300
I don't care.

76
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,500
I'm curious.

77
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,980
Today is March 2nd. So tomorrow is March 3rd.

78
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,200
Oh, the Hina Festival.

79
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,480
I see. The peach festival.

80
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,180
But I feel like there was something other than the Hina Festival on March 3rd.

81
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,620
Oh, that reminds me.

82
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,760
That's right.

83
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,720
March 3rd was Ryo's birthday.

84
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,460
That's right.

85
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,100
Oh, I see.

86
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,580
You were born on the day of the girl, Ryo.

87
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,000
It would have been great if you were a girl.

88
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,820
Don't say things that people care about.

89
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,480
Sorry.

90
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,580
Come to think of it, Senpai.

91
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,320
Something bad didn't happen on your birthday on March 3rd, did it?

92
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,940
Yes, that's right.

93
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,020
On March 3rd, four years ago, I went to the Hina Doll's security on the 500 million yen.

94
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,420
I went to the Hina Doll's security on the 500 million yen.

95
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,060
I went to the Hina Doll's security on the 500 million yen.

96
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,820
I went to the Hina Doll's security on the 500 million yen.

97
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:58,840
And I was the third one.

98
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,000
Two years ago, they put a flyover in the big dump during a patrol, didn't they?

99
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,420
Last year, there was a gas explosion accident at the gas station in the last year.

100
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,420
Not only that.

101
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,300
After he was born, he always sees a terrible person on March 3rd every year.

102
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,060
But what does it have to do with taking an emergency leave?

103
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,240
Since I became a police officer, I've been faced with terrible things at work.

104
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,100
If you stay at home, there's a lower probability that you'll meet a bad person.

105
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,980
There's nothing good about staying at home.

106
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,860
That's right, senpai. You have to meet a bad person.

107
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Is that so?

108
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,380
Then...

109
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,740
It can't be helped.

110
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,520
Anyway, no matter what big event happens tomorrow, don't leave the house.

111
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,100
Tell the chief that too.

112
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,240
I will.

113
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,480
What? Ryo-san is off today?

114
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,820
I'm sending him a message that he's on leave.

115
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,480
Oh, I see. But I'm in trouble.

116
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,580
Chief, what's wrong?

117
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,700
Nothing serious, but Ryo-san is busy.

118
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,000
Ryo-san said he'd be at home all day today.

119
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,980
If he's busy, why don't you ask him directly?

120
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,500
Oh, that's right. Let's do that.

121
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,280
Do you have any AV devices or computers that you don't need?

122
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,380
You don't have to move your AV device.

123
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,920
Here is the...

124
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,760
Shut up! You can't sleep with this!

125
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,040
I'm gonna complain!

126
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,640
Do you have any AV devices or computers that you don't need?

127
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,880
Come to think of it, it's similar to what happened on March 3rd 10 years ago.

128
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,320
The speaker in the kirigami hall was too loud, so I had to complain.

129
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,300
But when I went to the hospital, there was a guy who threw cigarettes away, and it was almost completely burned out.

130
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,280
It's dangerous! It's dangerous!

131
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,480
I decided not to go outside for a day today!

132
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,480
I'll sleep quietly.

133
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,600
You don't have to move your AV device.

134
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,400
This is a car from Tokyo.

135
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,240
Recently, there have been damage to the ax.

136
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,180
The person who went out is a professional who is now the 2nd best in Kyushu.

137
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,460
It was discovered by a camera man!

138
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,220
It was discovered by a camera man!

139
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,600
The first master of the Yoka Nisei, Sakurajima-dono-ponkichi will be the champion!

140
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,300
The first master of the Yoka Nisei, Sakurajima-dono-ponkichi will be the champion!

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,980
Everyone, don't miss it!

142
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,360
Everyone, don't miss it!

143
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,760
You can't sleep!

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,880
All right, let's play a game.

145
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,520
Hey, it's me, Ohara.

146
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,440
Are you still sleeping, Ryotsu?

147
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,760
The fact that the chief came here must be a big deal.

148
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,620
But I don't remember anything that made the chief angry recently.

149
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,440
Ryotsu!

150
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,820
I know what you're talking about.

151
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,800
Hurry up and open it!

152
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,900
I know what you're talking about.

153
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,180
He's pretty angry.

154
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,620
What the hell did I do?

155
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,320
Oh, by the way, it's March 3rd, 5 years ago.

156
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,800
He misunderstood the mistake of the monk as my mistake.

157
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,600
He miscalculated the mistake of the monk as my mistake.

158
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,300
He pulled the tire and made me run around the city.

159
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,420
He pulled the tire and made me run around the city.

160
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,940
There's no way he will this time.

161
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,740
Is the key on?

162
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,160
I will get in.

163
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,100
I'm not joking.

164
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,600
It was an unrecognizable thing that made me scolded...

165
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,820
Ryotsu!

166
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,300
There's no one here, huh?

167
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,460
Oh, no.

168
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,140
I'm going to stay out here for a while.

169
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,840
I got a little worried out there.

170
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,220
It was March 3rd, 3 years old at high school.

171
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,700
I came out in the announcements.

172
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,880
I was drinking milk in my underwear.

173
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,100
The editor who was in the neighborhood was mistaken, and the police chased him.

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,180
I had committed about 20 murders before.

175
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,240
This outfit is not good.

176
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,980
I'll borrow it.

177
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,780
This is Ryo's aunt's clothes.

178
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,580
I can't help it. I'll go to the library in this outfit and borrow clothes from Sakonji.

179
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,540
Sakonji

180
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,640
I found you.

181
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,240
Sakon...

182
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,760
I visited Sakonji on March 3rd, 4 years ago.

183
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,920
Sakonji was in invincible mode.

184
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,780
I'm going to kill you.

185
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm going to kill you.

186
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,720
Cobra Twist!

187
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:39,900
Cobra!

188
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,900
Space Triangle!

189
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,880
I've been beaten up.

190
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,700
I'll wait until the practice is over.

191
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:50,820
Huh?

192
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,600
It's so clean today.

193
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,840
I'll wait until Sakonji's practice is over.

194
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,100
Where is it?

195
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,120
That's right.

196
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,480
Today's practice was hard.

197
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,040
If you keep waking me up, you won't get across with the criminal.

198
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,980
It's hot!

199
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,500
Huh?

200
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,120
That's someone.

201
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,660
I think it's the cleaning lady.

202
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,040
It looks like he's sleeping, so let's leave him alone.

203
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,620
Okay.

204
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,440
He's sweating.

205
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,060
Me too.

206
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,140
This is...

207
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,440
But why are Komachi and the others in the boys' room?

208
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,140
Come to think of it, they came here on March 3rd.

209
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,600
They happened to fall down the stairs...

210
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,740
They got a letter from the police officer.

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,040
I saw that.

212
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,920
They're all wet.

213
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,280
If they see us in this outfit, they won't let us go.

214
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,200
We have to run away as soon as possible.

215
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,380
Take a shower first.

216
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,160
Okay.

217
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,380
Hey, lady.

218
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,820
It looks like the drain is full. Can I have a look?

219
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,180
I'm a bit tired...

220
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,320
You were taking a nap. You'll be fine soon.

221
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,240
Stop it.

222
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,880
It's a man!

223
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,280
No!

224
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,680
No!

225
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,860
No!

226
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,040
No!

227
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,700
Where did the man go?

228
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,100
Komachi?

229
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,200
What?

230
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,140
Damn it.

231
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,440
I can't wear this outfit anymore.

232
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,260
Sorry, lady.

233
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,720
What?

234
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,740
Lucky, I have something to change.

235
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,820
This is nice.

236
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:27,960
I like this one.

237
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,240
Is it someone from the Wanderers?

238
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,860
Oh, speaking of Wanderers...

239
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,440
That was March 3rd, when I was in the first year of high school.

240
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,320
I was walking around the town with Kawajan,

241
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,300
who was a friend of my older brother's senior.

242
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,420
I was involved in a fight between the Wanderers,

243
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,500
and I was arrested together.

244
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:52,600
I've been arrested.

245
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,460
If I wear this, I'm sure I'll be in trouble.

246
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,520
This is the most reasonable way.

247
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,520
If this is the case, I won't be arrested by mistake.

248
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,180
If you run away this far, you'll be fine.

249
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,320
Why is this a tunnel?

250
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,400
But the Wanderer is a member of the Wanderers.

251
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,740
After all, March 3rd is a good thing.

252
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,560
Hey, what are you doing?

253
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,580
What am I doing?

254
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,920
It's a special training for newcomers.

255
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,980
I'm doing a marathon to the Edo River.

256
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,760
Didn't you explain it to me first?

257
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,360
It's a special training for newcomers?

258
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,760
Oh, this is...

259
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,520
The 99th Mobile Unit of the Demon.

260
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,480
The 99th Mobile Unit of the Demon.

261
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,860
It's a high-quality training and an iron record.

262
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,760
99th Mobile Unit of the Demon.

263
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,440
99th Mobile Unit of the Demon.

264
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,080
But there are many members of the Demon that are losing their jobs regardless of their training.

265
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,860
99th Mobile Unit of the Demon.

266
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,400
Stop joking around!

267
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,200
Can I go with them?

268
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,100
Hey, newbie!

269
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,820
Hey!

270
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,560
It's you!

271
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,100
What?

272
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,020
What's this?

273
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,240
Don't run away!

274
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,840
I'll kill you!

275
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,160
What's wrong with you!

276
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,640
Damn it!

277
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,660
You're a man who can't escape the training of a newcomer.

278
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,360
I'm not a mobile unit member.

279
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,940
What are you talking about?

280
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,700
Everyone thinks you're 100% a mobile unit member.

281
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,380
Or what?

282
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,780
Are you a mobile unit comedian?

283
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,220
You're not a mobile unit otaku of a cosplayer, are you?

284
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,260
I'm a retired police officer.

285
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,240
But I didn't become a policeman to join the mobile unit.

286
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,800
Most of the people who are assigned here are like that.

287
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,960
But...

288
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,780
From today, you're a member of the 99th Mobile Unit!

289
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,220
Do you think that kind of cry will work?

290
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,660
Don't say anything.

291
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,460
Go back to the line quickly.

292
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,620
No.

293
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,780
No matter what I say, it doesn't seem to work.

294
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,780
If this happens, I'll steal his eyes and run away.

295
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,140
By the way, I'm still a policeman.

296
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,500
I was in elementary school on March 3rd.

297
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,980
I happened to be watching the training of another class.

298
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,100
The instructor misunderstood that I was in the same class.

299
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,280
I was forced to participate in the training.

300
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,720
When I tried to escape, I was forced to run five times as fast as the other people.

301
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,900
I was taken to Hakkodasa, where there was still snow.

302
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,660
I was even sent to the private school.

303
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,020
I was even sent to the public school.

304
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,000
Tomorrow, I'll be able to solve the misunderstanding.

305
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,820
If I work hard today, I'll be able to do it.

306
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,200
It's better than fighting against the enemy and being in a terrible situation.

307
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,960
Left there!

308
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,280
Let's run only in front of the station.

309
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,380
Why do they let us run like this?

310
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,660
We're the "Movement Corps" who protects the safety of Shuto.

311
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,720
The criminals often run into this kind of place!

312
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,340
Do you understand?

313
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,060
I understand.

314
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,660
I understand.

315
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,660
Don't move.

316
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,640
Fine!

317
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,340
If you lose, you all have to start over!

318
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,920
Damn, I can't help it!

319
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:53,240
You're taking a break, huh?!

320
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,800
From here, swim and return to the other side!

321
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,220
Everyone, swim with a 20kg backpack and a metal board!

322
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,440
That's so crazy!

323
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,540
What if the culprit is good at swimming?!

324
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,140
What are you going to do?!

325
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,980
If you don't train with this much of a handicap, it won't be a match!

326
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,420
I understand!

327
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,680
Are you ready?

328
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,980
All right! Jump in!

329
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,820
All right!

330
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,220
Jump in!

331
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,980
Hey, we'll finish this kind of training quickly and go back to the dorm!

332
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,940
What are you doing, you idiots?!

333
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,760
You think you understand?!

334
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,380
If you fall down even by yourself, you'll have to start over from the beginning!

335
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,280
Hurry up and swim!

336
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,460
Nobody's following us!

337
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,660
Wait, wait, wait!

338
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,460
Get me!

339
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,460
You're next!

340
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,480
He's pretty good.

341
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,100
Now, let's start the next training.

342
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,100
You have to stretch your body to stop the enemy coming towards you.

343
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,660
Your opponent is that thing!

344
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,060
Stop the car!

345
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,240
Come on!

346
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,320
You don't understand!

347
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,220
The criminals often run away using their cars!

348
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,820
What are you going to do if you can't do that?!

349
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,500
I can't do it normally!

350
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,640
You think you know?!

351
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,860
If you fail, you'll have to start over!

352
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,400
All right!

353
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:19,980
Start!

354
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,300
You idiot!

355
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,420
You'll have to stretch your body to stop the enemy coming towards you!

356
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,900
Stop the car!

357
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,720
Stop the car!

358
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,320
You idiot!

359
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,660
Okay!

360
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,520
Dama! Dama!

361
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,620
Dama!

362
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,820
Next is that!

363
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,440
What!?

364
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,100
Next!

365
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,780
Okay, I'll stop the engine now!

366
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,000
Rieee!

367
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,760
What's going on?

368
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,300
It's a big one!

369
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,980
Even the 99th Mobile Task Force of the Oni is not that big.

370
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,600
Hey, what's your name?

371
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,180
Ryo-tsu Kankishi.

372
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
Ryo-tsu, huh? Okay, I'll remember that.

373
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:33,980
Captain!

374
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,240
Let's go!

375
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:35,580
It's a big one!

376
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,280
It seems that the man who is a bomb maniac is hiding in the office building.

377
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay, I got it.

378
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,280
No more training!

379
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,340
The new crew members will go back to the dormitory and wait!

380
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,880
Good, good.

381
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,300
Finally, they're free.

382
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,660
However!

383
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,700
Ryo-tsu!

384
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,320
You come with us and join the main force!

385
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,100
Huh? Me?

386
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,820
Follow me without saying anything!

387
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,340
Don't come!

388
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,920
If you get any closer, I'll kill you!

389
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,820
Calm down!

390
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,540
What is your request?

391
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,840
I'm telling you not to come!

392
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,900
This bomb can easily blow up one or two of these buildings!

393
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,320
It seems that he's very excited.

394
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,800
Captain, the 99th Mobile Task Force is heading this way.

395
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,240
Yes, that 99th Mobile Task Force of the Oni.

396
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,380
Sorry to keep you waiting.

397
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,660
Ah, that's...

398
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,360
The 99th Mobile Task Force, protecting the safety of the capital, is here!

399
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,200
What's going on?

400
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,540
Why are you guys here?

401
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,700
Thank you for your hard work.

402
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,000
From now on, leave it to my 99th Mobile Task Force.

403
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,040
Even the director is here.

404
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,820
We should keep our distance as much as possible.

405
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,380
Then, I'll give you a plan.

406
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,940
The first unit will try to enter from the front.

407
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,860
However, this is a trap.

408
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,060
The second unit I command will enter from the back entrance.

409
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,900
Secure the culprit.

410
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,480
The rest will wait here.

411
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,620
I'm...

412
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,400
Wait!

413
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,460
Guard the first-class police force.

414
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:24,840
Wait?

415
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,240
If you keep wandering around like this, the chief and Komachi will find you.

416
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,820
Damn it.

417
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,520
Captain, let me join the invasion force too!

418
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:35,860
What?

419
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,880
I joined the invasion force not to wait for the rear.

420
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,280
I'm here to protect the capital by myself.

421
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,720
I want to work in the front line!

422
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,440
Ryo-tsu...

423
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,720
You...

424
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,320
You!

425
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,860
Put it on my back!

426
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,100
Yes, sir!

427
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,440
Thank you!

428
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,240
It looks like they're finally going to do it.

429
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,340
Yeah.

430
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,900
The second unit arrived at the back entrance.

431
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,120
The first unit starts the invasion operation.

432
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,340
Enter!

433
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,800
Don't come!

434
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,460
Don't come!

435
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,720
Can't you die, you idiot?

436
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,180
I'm serious!

437
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,840
Damn it!

438
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,800
It's a trap!

439
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,200
You're going to win a big bomb!

440
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
You're not going to believe that kind of drama!

441
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,160
I'll kill you!

442
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,100
I'll kill you!

443
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,540
The culprit is ready!

444
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,120
The culprit is ready!

445
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,460
Yay!

446
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,520
That's our 99th mobile force!

447
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,400
Hey, Tadei!

448
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,180
Get out of here!

449
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,240
That's right.

450
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,960
In this situation.

451
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,460
There was a locker room in a nice place.

452
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,960
I borrowed the other clothes.

453
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,260
I'll say goodbye here.

454
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,380
It's a dimensional bomb!

455
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,020
Did he really set it up?

456
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,020
And there are only three minutes left.

457
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,400
If this happens, I have to cut the cord and stop it!

458
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,340
I'll cut it!

459
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:23,900
I'll cut it!

460
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,000
So which one?

461
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,920
Red or blue?

462
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,200
Red!

463
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,400
Wait.

464
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,800
By the way, on March 3rd, I was in the sixth grade of elementary school.

465
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,940
My father asked me which candy I liked, red or blue.

466
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,020
When I ate red, it was extremely spicy candy.

467
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,180
After that, my mouth was so swollen that I couldn't eat anything.

468
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,040
Okay, this time it's blue!

469
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,280
It's getting faster!

470
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,800
What should I do?

471
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,900
I have to get out of here.

472
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,920
That's it!

473
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,340
I wonder if it's safe to come this far.

474
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,100
.

475
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,200
.

476
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,420
.

477
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,720
.

478
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:16,760
.

479
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:16,780
.

480
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:16,820
.

481
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:28,880
It's time to make a move.

482
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,920
There were other bombs?

483
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,520
But who did it?

484
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,160
Where's Ryotsu?

485
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,480
Well...

486
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,400
Captain!

487
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,900
In the first place, Ryotsu wasn't assigned to my squad.

488
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,180
What?

489
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,400
Ryotsu wasn't assigned to my squad.

490
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,020
Then who is he?

491
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,340
Ryotsu's clothes were in the other room.

492
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,780
Everyone was watching the entrance.

493
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,280
But no one went outside.

494
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,420
He disappeared like smoke.

495
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,560
Ryotsu...

496
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,700
Maybe he was a man God made use of to solve the case.

497
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,720
No one would believe this.

498
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,880
But I'll keep it in my heart.

499
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,760
I'm home.

500
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,840
Thank you for your hard work.

501
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,800
By the way, Reiko.

502
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,780
Did you get in touch with Ryotsu?

503
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,620
No, not yet.

504
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,420
I see.

505
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:37,000
Since Daisuke made a birthday present for Ryotsu, I thought I'd give it to you.

506
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,760
So cute!

507
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,340
Ryo, he's not at home.

508
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,760
Where did he go?

509
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,260
Isn't he playing some online games?

510
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,860
He must have to go back and forth everywhere.

511
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,480
I'm sure he's not in a hurry.

512
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,460
I think so.

513
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,020
Now it's time to go back.

514
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,700
Suddenly I think about her.

515
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:53,960
Well then, Ryotsu.

516
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,820
It's this!

517
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,660
Oh, I got it!

518
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,700
Congratulations!

519
00:23:59,700 --> 00:23:59,760
I'll make you happy!

520
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,000
I got it!

521
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,860
Make this a present.

522
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,520
Thank you so much.

523
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,740
Isn't it pretty?

524
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,400
"The End of the World"

525
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,620
"The End of the World"

526
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,120
"The End of the World"

527
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,140
"The End of the World"

528
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,640
"The End of the World"

529
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,220
"The End of the World"

530
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,740
"The End of the World"

531
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,380
"The End of the World"

532
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,940
"The End of the World"

533
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,440
"The End of the World"

534
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,420
"The End of the World"

535
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,440
"The End of the World"

536
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,800
"The End of the World"

537
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,360
"The End of the World"

538
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:00,780
"The End of the World"

539
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,400
"The End of the World"

540
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,460
"The End of the World"

541
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,420
"The End of the World"

542
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,340
"The End of the World"

543
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,580
Let's go!

544
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,460
Thank you!

545
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,200
Kanda Hijiribashi has hidden Matoi's memories

546
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,340
Matoi was still a high school student, but on rainy days and snowy days, he waited for her on the bridge

547
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,040
Next time, "Hijiribashi Hakusen Nagashi"

548
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,820
By the way, my turn

549
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,800
There is a turtle over there

550
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,600
There must be a turtle

551
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,780
Everyone come to our town

552
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,840
Thank you!
