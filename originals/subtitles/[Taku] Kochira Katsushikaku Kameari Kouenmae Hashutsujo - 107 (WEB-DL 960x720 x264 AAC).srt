00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
YoR меня共和国

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,340
When I was watching TV

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,980
I Republic the room, say look at the next door

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,060
English Translation w/ peace

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,380
I just perfectly!

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,000
Look at a beautiful etching

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,900
When I kicked the stone, it flew to my shoes

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,940
I wonder if it's going to be a joke

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:48,380
I laughed and said it was a good thing

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,880
Even if I try to cheer up, I can't help but laugh

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,240
The cityscape that doesn't change even a single yawn is strangely kind

12
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:14,360
From the fountain of the Tongari Boshi to the Kaishaku Tengen

13
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,260
The sun sets

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,860
Tomorrow will end like this

15
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,860
I'm sorry

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,960
If I let win again

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,180
I've lost happiness

18
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,280
Because I noticed

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,520
"It's because a silly me."

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,800
Ryou, you're becoming smaller!

21
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,300
Hey, Konaida

22
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,580
Speaking of the eatie,

23
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,720
TENPACHI!!!

24
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,520
Tenpachi desktop!

25
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,000
That's so annoying! What if my boyfriend does that?

26
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,540
Tenbatsu!

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,200
Tenbatsu Dekimen!

28
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,140
Tenbatsu!

29
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,600
Tenbatsu Dekimen!

30
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,900
Hanayama Security Department!

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,940
Tenbatsu!

32
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,000
Tenbatsu!

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,940
Tenbatsu!

34
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,900
Tenbatsu!

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,700
Tenbatsu!

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,100
Tenbatsu!

37
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,020
Tenbatsu!

38
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,080
Tenbatsu Dekimen!

39
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,160
Wonderful!

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,620
Gentlemen, we have the answer to the mystery.

41
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,420
Don't let your eyes go!

42
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,340
Yes sir!

43
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,800
Tenbatsu!

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,220
What a suspicious man.

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,400
I don't know who it is, but I'll take it.

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,800
Don't let him go!

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,400
Yes sir! Tenbatsu!

48
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,180
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,800
Tenbatsu Dekimen!

50
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,260
What's wrong, Ryo?

51
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,280
My stomach hurts! I can't take it anymore!

52
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,360
No, Ryo! Did you eat this?

53
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,380
This is sushi from a week ago.

54
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,960
Don't take anything!

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,660
I'm done.

56
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,660
If you're done, I'm off for a day in the office.

57
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going out now.

58
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,980
Let me make sure you move to a more nutritious place.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,100
I'll drop by your house.

60
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,260
Okay, I'll do it right away.

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,540
Using the Tenbatsu!!

62
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,780
What a man!

63
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,560
Tenbatsu!!

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,640
I think I'm getting a bit hungry.

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,260
I'm hungry!

66
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,460
And another clearly hungry tasted one!

67
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,140
And another clearly hungry tasted one!

68
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,840
And another clearly hungry tasted one!

69
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,500
Arrrrgh!

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,000
Gyaaaah!

71
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,920
I'm saved...

72
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,860
You're still too young to be a hero!

73
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,320
Tenmaaaaaaah!

74
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,560
Huh?

75
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,480
Aaaaaah!

76
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,360
My hair's gone!

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,940
Chief General!

78
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,280
Well, I'll go to the bathroom later.

79
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,680
I got better after I took out the eggplant.

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,400
You're a tough guy.

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,140
I'll show you what I've got!

82
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,360
Tenmaaaaaaah!

83
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,160
Gyaaaaaah!

84
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,480
Gyaaah!

85
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,460
Gyaaah!

86
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,780
Gyaaah!

87
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,960
Gyaaaah!

88
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,680
Gyaaah!

89
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,660
My Pramo-chan!

90
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,020
Gyaaah!

91
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,400
I bought this for 100 yen at the grocery store.

92
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,980
What the...

93
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,640
Huh?

94
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,000
Gyaaah!

95
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,580
Gyaaah!

96
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:14,640
Gyaaah!

97
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,460
Senior, are you all right?

98
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,080
What's up, Honda?

99
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,820
I heard you were starving, so I brought you some hot water.

100
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,860
I don't want to!

101
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,460
Mito, I'll show you!

102
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,360
Tenmaaaaah!

103
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,140
Gyaaah!

104
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,840
Gyaaah!

105
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,240
Gyaaah!

106
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,800
Gyaaah!

107
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,460
Gyaaah!

108
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:30,660
Gyaaah!

109
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,100
Gyaaah!

110
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,100
Gyaaah!

111
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,480
Hey! Honda!

112
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,900
Excuse me!

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,680
This is the Pramo-chan I bought.

114
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:38,700
Huh?

115
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,420
What?

116
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,560
Ah! It's broken!

117
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,020
I'm sorry, Senior!

118
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,820
Give me back my money!

119
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
I bought this for 50,000 yen.

120
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,720
50,000 yen?

121
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes, 50,000 yen.

122
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,400
It's 10 yen.

123
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,340
Please give me a discount.

124
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,300
It's a big profit with a 100 yen promo.

125
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,500
You liar, fraud, and pervert!

126
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,540
Tenba! Tenba! Tenba! Tenba!

127
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,180
Chief Hanayama, he's not going to give you the punishment no matter how much you give him.

128
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,500
You unworthy scum!

129
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,420
I'll throw you out!

130
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,320
I'll call the Chief of the Underworld Security Division!

131
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,420
I'll throw you out and make you pay a thousand times more!

132
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,000
It's so refreshing.

133
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,380
What's wrong, old man? Are you lost?

134
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,420
You don't know where to go home?

135
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,760
I'm Hanayama, from heaven.

136
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,200
You're not here, you're going to go now.

137
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,520
What are you doing?

138
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,180
I'm busy right now.

139
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,300
I'll come back next time.

140
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,360
Come back when I'm bored and dying.

141
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,040
I'm the Chief of the Underworld Security Division from heaven to turn you into a human being.

142
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,920
Yes, yes.

143
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,080
I'm going to turn you into a human being from now on.

144
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,560
I'm the Chief of the Underworld Security Division from heaven.

145
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,280
I see.

146
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,300
You little!

147
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,280
You little!

148
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,300
This is even more interesting.

149
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,900
I won't forgive you!

150
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,140
Go to the land of justice, you wretched boy!

151
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,160
How's this?

152
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,740
I'm a child!

153
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,380
Remember your pure heart when you were a child

154
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,640
and reflect on your actions and be reborn!

155
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,860
Lucky.

156
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,500
What?

157
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,120
Buses, trains, movies, all these are the children's allowance.

158
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,200
Besides, there are many children.

159
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,940
I can play with you all day long.

160
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,820
It's like a dream.

161
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,180
Thank you, old man.

162
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,260
What are you doing?

163
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,460
I'm a poop.

164
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,500
Poop.

165
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,240
I'm a poop.

166
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm a poop.

167
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,480
I'm a poop.

168
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,780
I'm a poop.

169
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,360
I'm a poop.

170
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,400
Are you still going to do it?

171
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,580
You're old, so you should not overdo it.

172
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,740
I will never forgive you this time.

173
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,000
I will make you suffer even more.

174
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,280
I will make you suffer even more.

175
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,980
TENPATU SPECIAL

176
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,060
What do you think?

177
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,220
Do not bother me.

178
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,340
I'm a poop.

179
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,620
I'm a poop.

180
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,220
Hanayama is going to be destroyed.

181
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,960
Hanayama is going to be destroyed.

182
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,660
I'm back.

183
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,680
Senior.

184
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,280
Senior?

185
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:44,960
Ryo!

186
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,480
He's not here.

187
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,620
Ryo, you're going somewhere again.

188
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,700
You're so annoying.

189
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,980
Did you say something?

190
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,260
No.

191
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,980
Did you say something?

192
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,560
No.

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,700
We didn't say anything.

194
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,540
That's strange.

195
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,780
I'm here.

196
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,740
I'm here.

197
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,240
I'm here.

198
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:12,840
Ryo.

199
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,000
He's hiding.

200
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:18,740
Senior.

201
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,140
There's a bug on your shoulder.

202
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,460
I thought it was Ryo's voice.

203
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,680
I'm here.

204
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,740
Here he is.

205
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,240
Good morning.

206
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,320
Good morning.

207
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,560
What's wrong with the three of you?

208
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,260
You are getting on my feet.

209
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,360
No, Reiko.

210
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,780
Under Ryo's feet.

211
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,380
Ryo.

212
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,620
What... what are you doing?

213
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't know. A weird old man came and said something about magic or something.

214
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,000
Magic?

215
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,720
Rather than that, please lower it quickly, chief.

216
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,980
I... I got it.

217
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,760
This... this is happening in reality...

218
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,460
It's like a magic girl anime.

219
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,200
But it's small and cute.

220
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,020
What are you talking about?

221
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,460
If it came, I wouldn't even look at this.

222
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,740
It's not!

223
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,640
Don't hesitate, Mr. Muzo, put your things on the desk.

224
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,540
Eh?

225
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,780
Hey, I'm not going to take it from you anymore!

226
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,140
Mr. Ryo!

227
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,320
But how am I supposed to eat this?

228
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,520
If it's food, I'll feed you.

229
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,720
Hey, don't treat me like a pet!

230
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,240
Oh, I'm sorry, I just...

231
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,760
Here, open your mouth.

232
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,520
It's hot! It's hot!

233
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,380
I'm sorry, it was hot.

234
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,680
What kind of word is that for a pet?

235
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,920
I'm sorry, I just...

236
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,780
Reiko.

237
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,860
Reiko, you're working, do your job.

238
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,880
Yes!

239
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,800
Then what about the food?

240
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,860
What about my food?

241
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,900
Don't be so spoiled!

242
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Take care of yourself!

243
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,460
Everybody's busy!

244
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,900
I'm sorry.

245
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,260
It's hot...

246
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:53,940
This...

247
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,620
It's like a volcano eruption.

248
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,660
I should wait until it cools down.

249
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,260
Ryo!

250
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,100
It's hot!

251
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,680
It's hot!

252
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,080
It's hot!

253
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,060
Chief, here's your tea.

254
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,080
It's hot!

255
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,300
Oh, wait!

256
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,040
It's so hot!

257
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,240
Hooray!

258
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,600
Don't!

259
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,800
Get off, Kein-chan!

260
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,200
W-what?

261
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,920
Get off already!

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,500
If you'll excuse us.

263
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,400
Okay...

264
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,840
Did something happen?

265
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,220
Ryotsu, you free to take a Exit?

266
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,180
Can I ask you a favor?

267
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,660
Your job?

268
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,600
I'll take out the change and you can use it and work with me.

269
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,900
Oh, you're playing a show!

270
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,940
Keep it in mind.

271
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,840
-Go away! -What?!

272
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,560
Looking for a trap is a policeman's job.

273
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,920
I understand. You can just go.

274
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,260
How big is it?

275
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,720
Damn it! It's a heavy 500 yen coin.

276
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,160
Good work.

277
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,100
This is my treasure. I'll take 10% off.

278
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,540
10% off?

279
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,700
10% off?

280
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,640
Oh, it's heavy.

281
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,100
Hey, even if you get smaller, you'll still be strong.

282
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,220
You'll be strong even if you get smaller.

283
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,080
He might be able to make a good money.

284
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,220
I'd like to have one of these 36 figures colored.

285
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,040
Three figures colored?

286
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,720
One is 1000 yen.

287
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,140
It's 3000 yen per figure.

288
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,120
It's the only thing in the world that can make that little doll look good.

289
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,380
Ryo is the best at using the little things to start a business.

290
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,360
I can't take the fish bones that are stuck in my throat.

291
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,580
I want my Mi-chan to drink it.

292
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,940
My hands are not in the way.

293
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,820
A big profit! A big profit!

294
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,700
It's not bad to make this money in just a few hours.

295
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,520
As always, you are a rich man, Senpai.

296
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,760
Besides, your body is enough to live on a hundredth of what you have so far.

297
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,040
You don't have to pay rent.

298
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,160
I envy you.

299
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,520
Senpai, I bought it.

300
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,200
Mika-chan House.

301
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,220
I've been waiting.

302
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,960
Hurry up and show me my new home.

303
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,080
Yes.

304
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,800
It's nostalgic.

305
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,120
I used to play with this when I was a child.

306
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,920
I'm a little worried about my girlish hobby.

307
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,900
It's pretty luxurious, isn't it?

308
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,320
This is big enough.

309
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,220
Senpai, I've prepared the bath.

310
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,200
How's the water temperature?

311
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,780
It's just right.

312
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,720
It's like the father of the eye of the Gegege no Kitaro.

313
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,640
How about the food?

314
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,360
That's perfect, too.

315
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,460
I've collected all of your favorites from the high-class desserts.

316
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,340
Thank you for your hard work.

317
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,540
I'll deduct the amount of work from the last Promo's money.

318
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,160
Yes, thank you.

319
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,720
Well, everyone, I'm leaving.

320
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,200
Thank you for your hard work.

321
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,240
Thank you for your hard work.

322
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,840
Well, then, let's eat.

323
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,340
He's living a much more luxurious life than I do.

324
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,940
Uchiyo.

325
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,660
Ryotsu, what's this?

326
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,540
Well, I'm on a part-time job.

327
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,200
On a part-time job?

328
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,660
You idiot!

329
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,940
You're not going to be spoiled because you've become small.

330
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,780
You're not going to be spoiled because you've become small.

331
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,040
You have to get a good job as a policeman.

332
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes, sir.

333
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,040
Don't spoil me, everyone.

334
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,620
I'm going to treat you as a person.

335
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,460
Are you all right?

336
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,200
Yes, sir.

337
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:41,920
Well.

338
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,280
Is it around here?

339
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,860
That's right.

340
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,300
Nagagawa!

341
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,080
It's a phone call.

342
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,140
It's a phone call.

343
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,720
You get out, Ryotsu.

344
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,180
What?

345
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,260
Don't force me.

346
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,800
I can't get out.

347
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,520
It's okay.

348
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,480
Get out now.

349
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,200
I understand.

350
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,880
I can get out, right?

351
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,200
Get out.

352
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,640
Ready.

353
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,180
Hello?

354
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,880
This is Hachijo Koenmae.

355
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,460
What?

356
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,380
This is Hachijo Koenmae.

357
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,240
I can't hear well because the park is small.

358
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,600
This is Hachijo Koenmae.

359
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,420
Yes, I can hear you.

360
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:29,960
What?

361
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,840
What is the case?

362
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,480
What's wrong with you?

363
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,560
It's the Tokuda-sensei-tachi.

364
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,300
Oh, that's right.

365
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,620
It's the Tokuda-sensei-tachi.

366
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:41,920
Oh, that's right.

367
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,180
That's right.

368
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,360
What?

369
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,860
You hate the presence of "Hachijo Koenmae"?

370
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,500
What should I do with you?

371
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,020
The pouvait profile picture is from the tube card.

372
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,500
What?

373
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,640
What should I do?

374
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:51,980
What is the profile?

375
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,340
What is the profile?

376
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
It says, what is the profile?

377
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,100
What is the profile?

378
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,840
What the profile.

379
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,740
Right.

380
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,560
How many people are there?

381
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,000
The weapons that have the number of people are...

382
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,080
They are very bad. We can't get close.

383
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,640
If we don't do anything, the hostages will be in danger.

384
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,480
I can't do anything.

385
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,320
By the way, where is Ryo-chan?

386
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,000
Hey, Kitaro!

387
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:20,920
What?

388
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,940
Hey, Ryo-chan!

389
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,300
Yes, what's up, Chief?

390
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,660
It's hard to do something.

391
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,580
Nakagawa-kun, lower your head a little.

392
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,300
Y-yes, sir. Is this good?

393
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,120
Hey, Ryo-chan, you can't be joking.

394
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,180
Now we have to figure out how to get to know each other without being noticed by the culprit.

395
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,800
Oh, I see. So this is the way.

396
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,800
You are ignoring human rights! You are terrible, Chief!

397
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,820
Only you can do this task.

398
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,940
I don't want to go!

399
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,900
We are filling the holes that we are skipping every day.

400
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,740
Listen, check the situation inside.

401
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,520
And report to us.

402
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,840
Senpai, be careful.

403
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,380
Do your best, Ryo-chan.

404
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,660
Now, you guys are useless!

405
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,300
Let's go, Ryo-tsu!

406
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,020
Ouch!

407
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,500
You bastard!

408
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,680
Ouch!

409
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,880
The Territory Chisel Chisel

410
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,640

411

Chisel Chisel Chisel

412
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,680
"30 years old, and he's a real villain."

413
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,660
"The weapon is AUG and Smith & Wesson's two guns."

414
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,660
"The host is a young man."

415
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,960
"He looks fine, so he'll be fine for another 10 hours."

416
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,500
"He even has a room map."

417
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,960
"The weapon is not available, so he was sent to the prison after an hour."

418
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,060
"But how do I give this memo to him?"

419
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,380
"I'm going to give this memo to him."

420
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,880
"What's that?"

421
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,420
"Looks like a dagger."

422
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,840
"What are you looking at?"

423
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,800
"Someone used that to shoot something."

424
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,480
"No! It's not me!"

425
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,320
"It's not me, either!"

426
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,040
"Hey!"

427
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,000
"Yes?"

428
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,460
"Yes?"

429
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,460
"Is there a problem?"

430
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,480
"Someone should be in the room. Search!"

431
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,340
"There's no one but host."

432
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,960
"There's no way! Just search!"

433
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,800
"What?"

434
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,740
"I don't think there's anyone here."

435
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:16,060
"Use this to cut the rope by yourself."

436
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,380
"This is... this is... this is..."

437
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,140
"What does it say?"

438
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:23,480
"What is it?"

439
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,360
"The letter is too small to read!"

440
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,000
"What?"

441
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,120
"Someone, bring the microscope!"

442
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,100
"Is someone hiding?"

443
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,120
"Hey!"

444
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,840
"If you were, you wouldn't know."

445
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,780
"Damn, it's so hard!"

446
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,180
"I finally got it out."

447
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,780
"You're so cute."

448
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,380
"Hey, you!"

449
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,560
"Yes?"

450
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,940
"Isn't he hungry?"

451
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,620
"No, he hasn't eaten anything since morning."

452
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,080
"That's not good!"

453
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,360
"I can't wait to give him a meal!"

454
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,900
"I'm so sorry, I'm going to have to feed him now."

455
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,060
"Hey, I think I can eat something, too."

456
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,280
"I'm saved."

457
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,140
"I found some cabbage, bro!"

458
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,280
"You idiot, I'm a rabbit!"

459
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,280
"I'll give you something to eat to fill your stomach again!"

460
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,240
"Yes, anything."

461
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,120
"I'll eat it, but it won't work!"

462
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,040
The food is coming, so wait!

463
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,560
Oh, what a bad boy. You went outside.

464
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,900
Here, the cabbage is for you.

465
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,620
Is it good?

466
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,420
One of these will fill your stomach.

467
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,860
Then, I'll leave the rest to you.

468
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,300
Let's leave it here.

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,180

Hey, open it!

What is this?

472
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,120
Is this a sign of Egypt?

473
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,120
Even though the letters are from Japan,

474
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,640
only a few people can read them.

475
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,360
It's the same as the code.

476
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,980

484

I'm worried about Ryo's trust in your orders.

00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,200
I was so scared...

562
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,900
Okay, fine.

563
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,460
Good, good.

564
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,800
*chaos*

565
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,400
Chief!

566
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,200
Okay, okay.

567
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,760
*chaos*

568
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,020
Okay, okay.

569
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,360
That was good.

570
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,420
Everything is fine.

571
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,780
Well done, Chief!

572
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,280
By the way, where is Ryo-chan?

573
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,480
He may just get broken down in this situation.

574
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,180
I made it!

575
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,760
What do you think, Ryosu Kan-Kichi?

576
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,500
You must have thought that your existence was small!

577
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,280
You...

578
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,720
Yes, that's right, completely.

579
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,120
Then, after reflecting on your deeds up until now,

580
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,900
will you continue to live with a humble mind?

581
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,820
Yes, I have completely reconciled myself.

582
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,340
I have been reflecting on what I have done up until now,

583
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,260
deeper and deeper than my heart.

584
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,700
I see, I see.

585
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,240
I see, I see.

586
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,260
Then, let's return to your original form.

587
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,860
Tenbatsu-Baba-chan!

588
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
-Ryo-chan! -Ryo-chan!

589
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,660
I'm glad! You've returned to your original form!

590
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,780
Give me back my strength!

591
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,700
If you don't, I'll be...

592
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,520
You're a waste of time!

593
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,340
Sakamoto! Remember your smallness!

594
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,060
You're a waste of time!

595
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,600
Help me!

596
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,420
But I can definitely....

597
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:16,500
No!

598
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,700
Now it will be the last time!

599
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,740
That's right!

600
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:21,920
I hope this isn't your last time!

601
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,340
You're one ofител isoulm...

602
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,680
I'm not...

603
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,120
I'm not like you.

604
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,440
I'm Hiyoshi Yamazaki.

She's got a boyfriend named Jody.
