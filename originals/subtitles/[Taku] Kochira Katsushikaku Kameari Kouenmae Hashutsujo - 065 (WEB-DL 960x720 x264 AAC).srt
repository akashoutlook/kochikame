00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:18,620
I looked at the proportions from a long-legged horizontal grid ♪ ♪

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,720
Then topstruck by love, I even jumped into my shoes ♪

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,320
I wonder if I should go to the gym where I used to work out.

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,880
I was laughed at for being a crybaby.

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,480
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere,

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,840
I can't help but make a fuss.

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,720
The cityscape that never changes even when I yawn is strangely kind.

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,960
From the tapestry of a cap,

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,980
the sun sets to Taishakuten.

11
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,420
Tomorrow, it's already over.

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,120
If I win, I'll be happy again.

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,960
I'm not sure if I'll lose.

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,700
I'm not sure if I'll lose.

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,540
I'm not sure if I'll lose.

16
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,280
Because I'm such a fool.

17
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,240
Luslax Syndrome

18
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,600
Enomoto...

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,380
No more discussion is necessary.

20
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,980
I'll go by myself, okay?

21
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,160
Hijikata!

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,940
The flowers we sowed in the end of the explosion...

23
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,140
...will have to fall in the new era.

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,780
Sorry.

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,980
Hijikata, wait!

26
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,420
What will you do if you die?

27
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,740
Next time on the Flower of the End of the Explosion...

28
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,780
Please look forward to the final episode.

29
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,520
I can't watch it again.

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:17,680
I'm going to cry.

31
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,660
Even if I go against the flow of time...

32
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,280
...I will live without losing faith in myself.

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,920
I will not be led astray by the flow of time...

34
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,600
...and I will have to learn from the recent young people...

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,320
...who are always hanging out at night.

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,720
This...

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,180
No.

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,060
If it was this way...

39
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,400
This is it.

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,480
No!

41
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,220
Ouch!

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,220
That's it!

43
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,780
Hey!

44
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,940
Calm down!

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:11,160
This is it!

46
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,680
It's here!

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,480
What's up?

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,140
It can climb.

49
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,460
How long will it take?

50
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:41,520
How old are you?

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,200
How did you go into our town?

52
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,920
Are you afraid?

53
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,500
I've made friends a lot.

54
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,320
There's nothing else to do...

55
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,560
Oh crap...

56
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,900
Don't worry.

57
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,920
We don't know how to use these anymore!

58
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,640
We wet our pants.

59
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,020
Harry, you need to do something!

60
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,340
Why don't you take out the cordless electricity?

61
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,020
Hey, look!

62
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,280
-Wait! -Teacher, can I be a pilot?

63
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,960
Please do your best!

64
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,580
That show's ratings went over 30%!

65
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:41,760
Over 30%?

66
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,400
It's Bakumatsu no Hana, isn't it?

67
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,680
Komachi and the others said they were watching it.

68
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,320
My god is into it too,

69
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,860
and he watches all the TV shows.

70
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,040
The chief always makes sure to record it,

71
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,780
and he watches it at least three times.

72
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,240
Huh?

73
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,580
The chief is a huge fan of the historical dramas.

74
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,840
What are you two talking about?

75
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,040
It's about the historical dramas on TV.

76
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,160
I've never seen Bakumatsu no Hana, Ryo.

77
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,620
Bakumatsu no Hana? What's that?

78
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,200
No, Ryo.

79
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,420
You really don't know?

80
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,260
It's rare for a senior to be so loud.

81
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,640
I don't know!

82
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,360
I only watch TV, documentaries, and variety shows.

83
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,900
All I do is watch videos or play games.

84
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,140
Action!

85
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,560
Good morning.

86
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,000
That's why your head is always like a elementary school student.

87
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,520
Chief...

88
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,580
You're getting old, and you're making a railway model while working.

89
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,080
You're an idiot.

90
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,700
I'm not!

91
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,800
You're lying!

92
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,000
You're watching a video?

93
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,480
I bet you're a professional.

94
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,660
You're a completely newbie.

95
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,000
It's fine.

96
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,440
I don't care what people think.

97
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,000
Chief,

98
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,320
tonight is the last day of Bakumatsu no Hana.

99
00:05:59,460 --> 00:05:59,860
I see.

100
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,920
I'm sorry about that, but I have a favor to ask.

101
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:04,960
Me?

102
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,460
Today's night shift is for the temple and the ryo,

103
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,400
but I can't make it.

104
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,780
I can't help you.

105
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,260
What?

106
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,760
Chief!

107
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
What do you want me to do?

108
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,140
I'm sorry to bother you,

109
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,260
but can you make a video of the last day of Bakumatsu no Hana?

110
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,180
My video is broken, so I'm fixing it.

111
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,080
That's easy.

112
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,900
I'm sorry, but I can't watch it tonight.

113
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,880
I'm sorry, but I can't watch it tonight.

114
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,280
I'll leave it to you, Chief.

115
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm tired.

116
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,960
I'll take a break.

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,940
The one with the dragon.

118
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,620
Starts at 10:00 on December 7th,

119
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,180
and ends at 10:56.

120
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm sure of it.

121
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,560
But I'm worried about whether it will fit.

122
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,500
I'll watch it here.

123
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,880
The low pressure is approaching the Kanto region,

124
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:10,880
which has developed like a typhoon.

125
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,140
What are you doing?

126
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,280
I'm recording the Bakumatsu no Hana asked by the chief.

127
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,480
If it's a recording, you can set it with a timer.

128
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,240
Don't touch it.

129
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,040
I set the timer,

130
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,500
but if it doesn't work, it won't be recorded.

131
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,260
I have a responsibility asked by the chief.

132
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,720
I have to make sure.

133
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,840
You're so worried.

134
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,940
Then, look at the screen and record it until you feel good.

135
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,060
I will.

136
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,500
Don't worry about me.

137
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,540
It starts in 10 minutes.

138
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,620
What's the timer for?

139
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,580
Let's continue.

140
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,680
It's strange.

141
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,300
The power is out.

142
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,920
I don't know which one is which.

143
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,700
I don't know which one is which.

144
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:02,880
It's all right.

145
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,880
I did it.

146
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,660
Ryo, it's terrible.

147
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,840
The power is out.

148
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,300
I used too much electricity.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,920
That's not true.

150
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,000
It's going to start in 5 minutes.

151
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,820
The breaker has fallen and the fuse has flown.

152
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,400
Don't worry.

153
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,820
One minute is enough.

154
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,640
It's not good.

155
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,480
The power is completely burnt.

156
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,420
I broke it. It's impossible to repair.

157
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,140
Why would it be like that?

158
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,700
By the way, when the fuse was cut off, it was not good to use the wire.

159
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,160
What are you going to do? The program will start!

160
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,800
If this happens, I will give up.

161
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,920
It's not like that. The chief asked me to do it.

162
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,260
I'm not asked.

163
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,980
You're so white. I'll tell you that it's because of Ryo's railway model.

164
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,960
That's not good!

165
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,220
I'll tell you even if it's not good. If this happens, Ryo and Shinju will be in trouble.

166
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
Wait, wait, I understand.

167
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,720
If there is no electricity, we can go to a place with electricity.

168
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,800
Eh? Where?

169
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,780
I don't have time anymore!

170
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,340
There it is. Let's get it from there.

171
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,780
What should we do?

172
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,820
What's wrong with the vending machine?

173
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,520
We have to turn off the power.

174
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,840
Eh? Are you okay, Ryo?

175
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,820
That's good.

176
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,800
How many minutes left?

177
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,860
Only 3 minutes left, Ryo.

178
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,820
Okay, 3 minutes is enough.

179
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,440
Ryo, you can't see anything.

180
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,640
That's strange.

181
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,820
I forgot the antenna.

182
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,720
Eh? What should we do?

183
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,680
I don't have an antenna.

184
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,340
Only 2 minutes left.

185
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,740
Okay, find something that will replace it.

186
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,120
Even if it's replaced...

187
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,040
Okay, that's it.

188
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,060
No, Ryo, only 1 minute.

189
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,020
Don't give up.

190
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,160
Connect the cable.

191
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,240
Okay.

192
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,060
Ryo, what are you doing? Hurry up!

193
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,980
Damn it. I didn't mean to do it.

194
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,660
How's that?

195
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,660
No, Ryo. Don't shoot it.

196
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,000
How's this?

197
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,260
No, no.

198
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,360
How about this?

199
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,460
Just a little more.

200
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,700
How about this time?

201
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,200
It's going to fall.

202
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,200
It's going to fall.

203
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,900
It's going to fall.

204
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,040
That's great, Ryo. It's going to fall.

205
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,260
What's the big deal?

206
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,820
It's not impossible for me.

207
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,680
Are you okay, Ryo?

208
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,300
No, I almost died.

209
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,600
Ryo?

210
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:24,720
Ryo?

211
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,240
No, I'm okay.

212
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,480
Good job.

213
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,760
Thank you.

214
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,660
How was it, Ryo?

215
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,420
There is no antenna.

216
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,340
No way.

217
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,820
How should I tell the director?

218
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,860
It's not good, Ryo.

219
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,480
You've improved it.

220
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,660
It can't be helped.

221
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,760
I'll have to turn it off.

222
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,640
It's an accident.

223
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,080
There's no choice.

224
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,340
It's not an accident.

225
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,000
The director came to enjoy it.

226
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,220
Calm down.

227
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,580
I'm not!

228
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,220
Ouch!

229
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,080
You should just say you got the video.

230
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,280
I'll know right away.

231
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,520
No one will know if you play it.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,360
What?

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,180
In other words, you should get angry before the chief sees it.

234
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,120
The End

235
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,800
I'm home.

236
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,140
Chief, please leave.

237
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,860
Thank you.

238
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,300
What should I do? The chief is finally back.

239
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,260
Don't be so nervous.

240
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,060
Leave this to me.

241
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,400
Chief, thank you for your hard work.

242
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,120
It must have been tough in this cold weather.

243
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,080
Well, yes.

244
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,680
By the way, where's the temple?

245
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,440
The temple?

246
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,760
Oh, about the video from last night.

247
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,200
The video was...

248
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,540
Here, it's right here.

249
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,860
The video from last night?

250
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,640
Yes.

251
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,780
You took a good picture of it.

252
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,600
I don't want to, chief.

253
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,780
Of course I do.

254
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,100
I can't forget the earthquake, the storm, or anything else.

255
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,200
Hey, Terai!

256
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,900
Hey, Terai!

257
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,380
Terai!

258
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,140
Yes?

259
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,480
I see.

260
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,360
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,760
No, thank you.

262
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,060
Then I'll give it to the chief.

263
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,800
Here you go.

264
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,320
Please give me a lesson, chief!

265
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:22,840
What?

266
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,700
Please, chief!

267
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,600
He...

268
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,960
Chief!

269
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,780
What are you doing?

270
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,040
The tape...

271
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,660
The tape...

272
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,160
Please don't do that.

273
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,660
The tape!

274
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,460
The fireworks...

275
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,020
What are you doing?

276
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,720
You took a video from last night.

277
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,440
I see.

278
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,860
The chief hated me and got mean.

279
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,240
I'm sure he did.

280
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,840
N-No, that's not true! That was just a flash of a moment...

281
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,720
You're a devil, you devil!

282
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,040
That's why I said no, Ryo-tsu!

283
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,360
Ryo-chan, did you really record the last episode of "The Flower of the Eternity"?

284
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,600
Of course!

285
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,880
That wonderful last scene...

286
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,780
Even now, when I think about it, I feel so moved that my heart is pounding.

287
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Don't stop me, Mother.

288
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,600
Meiji, call me!

289
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,680
I have to go!

290
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,320
I have to go!

291
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,760
That last line was wonderful!

292
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,900
Ryo-chan, Ryo-chan!

293
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,920
The "The Flower of the Eternity" that aired last night was canceled due to a special broadcast.

294
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,320
The final episode will air next week.

295
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,540
The final episode will air next week.

296
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,460
What?

297
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,900
Oh, is that so?

298
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,780
You idiot!

299
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,780
I won't forgive you for trying to hide your mistakes by making excuses!

300
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,420
Your life is always full of lies!

301
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,280
You'll regret it!

302
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,360
Oh, my EF-58!

303
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,940
You don't know that!

304
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,440
Chief, I'm really sorry.

305
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,740
Yeah, it's fine.

306
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,340
Ryo-tsu is to blame for everything.

307
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,560
The hero isn't to blame.

308
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,520
Damn it.

309
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,360
How can I leave him with such a grudge?

310
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,600
Look at this.

311
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:27,720
Look at this.

312
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,420
Look at the horror of making me the revenge demon!

313
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,000
I risked my life to climb up the elevator in the wind for the chief.

314
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,700
This is what happens when the chief is a mecha-ghost.

315
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,060
He must not know how to use the deck.

316
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,820
Well, for me, that's more convenient.

317
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,000
All right.

318
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,000
This is done.

319
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,160
Father, call Chief Ohara!

320
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,680
Hehehe.

321
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,800
Hehehe.

322
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,880
The curtain of revenge has been cut off here.

323
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,840
Yes, yes, yes.

324
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,820
I'm coming out now.

325
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,300
Yes, this is Ohara.

326
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,500
Yes, is that so?

327
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,220
I understand.

328
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,700
What's wrong?

329
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,220
It's from the electrician.

330
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,980
He said the video he put out will be tomorrow.

331
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,980
What did he say?

332
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,060
The last episode of the EF-58 is tonight.

333
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,420
I can't help it.

334
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,400
Oh...

335
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,540
Oh...

336
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,660
I see!

337
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,860
What's wrong?!

338
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,820
What's going on?

339
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,000
Where have you been?

340
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,640
Chief, I have video !

341
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,760
Huh?!

342
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,040
What did you say?!

343
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,620
Video?

344
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,280
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,980
I'm sorry about the other day I didn't come out pretty.

346
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,780
Well, well!

347
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,960
It's actually a good timing.

348
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,200
The video and the TV I put out for the repair have to come back by tomorrow.

349
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,780
Have you been there yet?

350
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,940
It's a video with audio reservation.

351
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,960
Even the chief of the Mecha-Onchi can easily operate this.

352
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,980
Anyway, all you have to do is talk to this TV.

353
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,180
You've made something useful.

354
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,720
Well, thank you.

355
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,920
How about you, Ryotsu?

356
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,440
Why don't we eat dinner together and watch the fireworks?

357
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,420
No, I have to go back to the station and get on the night shift.

358
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,860
So, today I'll do this.

359
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,220
Wait a minute!

360
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,940
It's strange that you refuse to invite me for a meal.

361
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,400
Is there something wrong with this?

362
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,160
No, I don't think so.

363
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,760
I'm going home to complete my duty as a police officer.

364
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,460
Like exploding when you turn on the video switch?

365
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,140
No way.

366
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,380
That's not going to happen.

367
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,620
Listen, like this.

368
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,380
Open your mouth.

369
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,640
Today's guest is Mr. Suzuki Emil.

370
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:54,680
Mr. Emil.

371
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,220
All you have to do is tell him to come here.

372
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,160
Today, you can watch the new movie that will be released next week.

373
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,080
When you're done, you can do this.

374
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,820
Open your mouth and clap your hands.

375
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,940
I see.

376
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,800
It's easy.

377
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,760
Right?

378
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,500
Then I'll do this.

379
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,200
Are you sure?

380
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,560
Ryotsu, I have to go.

381
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,980
It's time for the bus to come.

382
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,000
No, it's really okay.

383
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,000
Really?

384
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,640
Excuse me.

385
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,180
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

386
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:36,180
I'm looking forward to this one.

387
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,660
Look at this, chief.

388
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,280
Okay, done.

389
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll test it.

390
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,200
I'll try it.

391
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,420
I was surprised.

392
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,740
My heart isn't in good shape, chief.

393
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
What is he doing?

394
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,580
What?

395
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,900
Are you ready to see it now?

396
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,200
I don't know what's going to happen.

397
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,380
Like this.

398
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,100
Which one?

399
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,140
I'll try one.

400
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,440
Well...

401
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,300
I'll put it here.

402
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,620
And then I'll put the ojigi.

403
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,920
You're doing it, you're doing it.

404
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,060
Good.

405
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,200
Stop!

406
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,900
The ojigi doesn't feel right.

407
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,000
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

408
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,240
No, don't say that.

409
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,360
Then show me your righteousness.

410
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,800
Awesome.

411
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,100
You're here.

412
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,940
Do you want to book a program?

413
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,580
Would you like to make a reservation for the club?

414
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,660
Yes, please.

415
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,200
A cherry blossom...

416
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,420
Then take off your clothes.

417
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,460
No, clothes?

418
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,100
And dance.

419
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,840
If you don't do that, you can't make a reservation.

420
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,360
No...

421
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,300
Huh?

422
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,420
Yes. I took it off and danced.

423
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,280
Don't lie!

424
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,100
Why?

425
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,840
You'll know right away by the sound of dancing.

426
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,840
If you're not motivated, you can't record.

427
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,220
I got it. I'll do it.

428
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,620
Ah, ice, ice.

429
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,420
Ah, ice, ice.

430
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,260
I'm dying. I'm dying.

431
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,860
The rhythm is bad, but it's okay.

432
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,220
Now let's put on our pants.

433
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,260
What did you say?

434
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,520
Take off your pants and drink water in the garden.

435
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,720
If you don't, you can't record.

436
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,280
This is for the cherry blossom.

437
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,800
What are you doing?

438
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
You'll catch a cold.

439
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,860
Don't stop me.

440
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,200
I have to do this.

441
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,120
Oh, it's cold.

442
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,720
Okay, now it's the real show.

443
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,240
Oh...

444
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:14,900
Hey.

445
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,760
Hey.

446
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,840
If you're so worried, father,

447
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,120
why don't you just turn on the TV?

448
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,320
I had a reservation.

449
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,780
I don't want to play dumb and break again.

450
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,720
Oh, forever.

451
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,880
Because you're still a child.

452
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,160
The news at nine o'clock.

453
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,100
I'll finish it.

454
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,780
Oh, it's working properly.

455
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,980
No matter what, it's the latest type.

456
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,880
This music is so good.

457
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:56,280
I'm looking forward to the last scene.

458
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,860
Izukata, wait!

459
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,240
What will happen to you if you die?

460
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,240
Why has Ryosu...

461
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
Good evening, captain!

462
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,380
In the next episode, I will be the lead actor

463
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,920
for the final episode of

464
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,120
"Bakumatsu no Hana."

465
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,240
What are you talking about?

466
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,480
Please move.

467
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,000
I can't see you.

468
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,620
That's not the point.

469
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,600
Hey, Ryosu.

470
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:24,980
Get back!

471
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,300
If I think about it,

472
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,740
you're going to turn on the switch with a big hit, right?

473
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:30,880
What should I do to turn off the video?

474
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,340
Oh, right.

475
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,600
I got it.

476
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,920
It's a lie!

477
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,400
Damn! You're a fool!

478
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,160
Oh, I see. It's a power outlet.

479
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,760
This time you tried to unplug the power outlet.

480
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,360
It's useless. If you unplug it, it will switch to the internal power.

481
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,020
It's called a backup function.

482
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,180
What the hell is that?

483
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,980
Well, here's a video of the chief's favorite performance.

484
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,940
It's called "The Sound of the Eclipse".

485
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,600
Oh, that's good!

486
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,360
Enjoy the music at high volume for eight hours until the morning.

487
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,440
That's good!

488
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,820
The Chief's Favorite Performance

489
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,000
The Chief's Favorite Performance

490
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,460
Where's the big idiot of Ryo-tsu?

491
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,000
Ryo-tsu, come out!

492
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,920
He went to see a white bear in the south pole.

493
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,660
He went out earlier, but...

494
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,320
What?

495
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,880
Ryo-tsu!

496
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,000
What?

497
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,340
Ryo-tsu!

498
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,500
I know some people say that I'm one of those women who can't even fall in love,

499
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,960
but I can't resist the desire to try a few things.

500
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,020
I want to ride through the desert on a motorcycle

501
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,620
I want to be free more than anyone else

502
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:48,020
The ready dream changes at the speed of a telescope

503
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:54,500
Love heart, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

504
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,000
Dive into the future of the panorama

505
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:09,680
You know, right? I'm sorry, wait for me
