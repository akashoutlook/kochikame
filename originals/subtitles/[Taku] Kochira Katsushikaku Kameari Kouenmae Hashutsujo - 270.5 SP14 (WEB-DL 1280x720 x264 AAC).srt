1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,640
Come on, let's go!

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,500
Next is this turtle!

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,380
Come to me, you poor thing!

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm not here, but I'm worried

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,600
Look at the blue sky

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,680
The white clouds

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,260
It'll be all right

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,100
You know what to do, right?

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,400
You know what to do, right?

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,000
If you know what to do, just come to me!

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:10,960
I'll be right back!

12
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,860
Hey, turtle!

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,840
What are you doing!

14
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,300
Cheer up!

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,420
It's Kankichi!

16
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,500
What the hell is going on?

17
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,160
You're imitating a thief like this!

18
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,300
I've already seen that you're a thief, Kankichi!

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,880
Hey, there's a deep reason for this!

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,900
Deep reason?

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,240
Do you know a TV show called "Tetsujin Baka Ichidai"?

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,480
Yeah, it's a show where macho men who show off their strength compete to the limit.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,340
I watch it often with my grandma.

24
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,460
And when I applied, I won.

25
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:53,680
You won!

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,940
Oh, that's great!

27
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,380
Maybe Kankichi can win.

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,420
Right? Tomorrow is the real show.

29
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,760
But I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

30
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,780
I can't get any strength.

31
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,020
Even if I asked the chief, no one would lend me a meal.

32
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,800
I can't help it.

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,480
Even so...

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,820
I'm really sorry!

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,640
But if I win tomorrow's TV show, my family will invite me to Hawaii.

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,440
Yeah!

37
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,140
If you let me eat sushi, I'll definitely win and take all the Ghibosh family to Hawaii.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,560
I'm talking about you, so why don't you take me with you and make money later?

39
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,900
I won't do that.

40
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,660
I'm always taken care of by everyone here.

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,780
I just want you to welcome the New Year in Hawaii.

42
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,340
But I want to go to Hawaii.

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,460
Me too.

44
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,460
Mom wants to go too.

45
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,340
Well, if you can go for free.

46
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,280
Don't be fooled by everyone.

47
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,160
I'm a man of the Ryotsuke family.

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,120
There must be something behind me.

49
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,620
No, no.

50
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,480
Sometimes you have to believe me.

51
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,580
I can't believe you just by looking at what you do every day.

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,320
That's right.

53
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,320
How about making a branch shop for Chokanda Sushi in Hawaii?

54
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,160
What?

55
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,880
Branch shop in Hawaii?

56
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,900
Yeah, I think you'll definitely win sushi here.

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,860
I see.

58
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,860
I'm sure you can really win.

59
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,700
Yeah.

60
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,600
As long as I'm hungry, it's easy.

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,940
Alright, I got it.

62
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,780
Thank you.

63
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,960
Yes.

64
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,380
Make him eat sushi.

65
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
Okay, Mom.

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,240
Yay!

67
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,260
I did it!

68
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,320
Let's eat!

69
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,700
You're really full.

70
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,100
You must be really hungry.

71
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,560
I ate a lot of sushi here, but it's still delicious.

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:47,660
It's delicious.

73
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,720
You're gonna win for sure.

74
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,140
Leave it to me.

75
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,340
Hey, last battle, this arm wrestling.

76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,660
It's going to be serious.

77
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,120
Both have won over 2000 times.

78
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,040
Both have won, and they have great records.

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,200
Don't lose!

80
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,060
Just a little more!

81
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,180
The enemies are resilient.

82
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,080
Do your best, Kankichi!

83
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,300
Hey!

84
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,680
Oh! Kanaka is finally down!

85
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,820
The number is 2,009 times!

86
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,760
The winner is Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

87
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,900
Yay!

88
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,760
That's a lot!

89
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,640
He's an idiot, but he has a lot of stamina!

90
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,740
It's all thanks to my sushi!

91
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,920
A new iron idiot has been born!

92
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,740
His name is Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

93
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,740
He's got a Hawaii trip!

94
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,220
Everyone, let's watch!

95
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,960
The first place is Hawaii!

96
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:41,980
The first place is Hawaii!

97
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
The first place is Hawaii!

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,220
The first place is Hawaii!

99
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,860
He's a great person!

100
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,980
I'm not saying he's bad, but there are quite a few rich people who are trying to spend New Year overseas.

101
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,020
Huh? That's a producer and staff of an iron idiot.

102
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,820
Yo! What are you doing here?

103
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,740
Oh, Ryo-tsu-san.

104
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,240
What?

105
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,380
Of course, I'm going to Hawaii with all the champions and my family.

106
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,400
What?

107
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:18,980
Look.

108
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,400
Huh?

109
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,540
W-What?

110
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,620
Wasn't my family the only ones who went to Hawaii?

111
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,040
Oh, come on.

112
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,360
Didn't I tell you that there was a TV show about an iron idiot who was against his family?

113
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,660
What?

114
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,380
I didn't hear that!

115
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,840
I told you at the beginning of the show.

116
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,800
Didn't you hear me properly?

117
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,760
Huh?

118
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,880
I-Is that so?

119
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,760
Anyway, please do your best with the help of your family.

120
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,460
It's a waste.

121
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,740
I can't tell everyone just because I said it.

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,340
If I did...

123
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,980
Look!

124
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,680
As I thought, there's a reason behind it.

125
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:01,720
Yes.

126
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,300
Did you go to Hawaii to compete in the first place in New Year's Eve and make such an iron idiot race for this old man?

127
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,800
You idiot!

128
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,160
You idiot!

129
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,940
You idiot!

130
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,160
I hate you!

131
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,340
I guess it's supposed to be so.

132
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,060
I have to participate in the race all alone.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,400
Hey, Takahashi!

134
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,480
What are you doing?

135
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,840
Oh, sorry.

136
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,320
Sorry.

137
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,040
I just go.

138
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,440
It's the first time to travel abroad with your family.

139
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,540
It's my first time seeing a fish.

140
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,320
That's right.

141
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,180
But you can take off your belt.

142
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,580
Sorry.

143
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,600
Kanchi, is everything really free?

144
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,380
Of course.

145
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
We're going to have an indoor meal from now on.

146
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,240
The main dish is meat, and I'll ask for chicken or beef.

147
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,160
I'll ask for whatever you like.

148
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,120
I prefer fish.

149
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,920
Don't be selfish.

150
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,740
This is what beginners of overseas travel are.

151
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,000
Everyone, please announce your schedule after you arrive in Hawaii.

152
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,740
Oh, no.

153
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,940
Yes, yes.

154
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,560
Pay attention to this.

155
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,300
What is it, Kanchi?

156
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,440
Everyone is a beginner of overseas travel, so I'll explain the rescue equipment.

157
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,000
That's what Mr. Stewardess explained to us earlier.

158
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,460
No, it's a matter of life and death, so it's a matter of life and death.

159
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,500
All right.

160
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,920
I'm explaining right now, so please be quiet.

161
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,720
Yes, sir.

162
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,060
I see.

163
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,220
I can't help but feel I'm in a hurry.

164
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,380
That's right.

165
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,720
Huh?

166
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,820
What?

167
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,220
You can hear music.

168
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,140
What are you doing?

169
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,320
Wow, it's Hawaiian.

170
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,220
Isn't it lovely?

171
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:44,760
Nice.

172
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,320
I've been able to trick it.

173
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,160
Great.

174
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,460
I can see the sea.

175
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:58,960
I can see the sea!

176
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,740
The wife and husband are in this room.

177
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,820
Here's the key.

178
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

179
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,420
Oh, sorry to keep you waiting.

180
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,360
Grandma and Lemon are in room 703 next door.

181
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,260
Here you are.

182
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:17,920
Hey!

183
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,180
Hey, what about me?

184
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,500
You will be staying in this room 704 with me.

185
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,260
Why are you with me?

186
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,820
I'm with you!

187
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,860
Wow!

188
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,780
What a beautiful view!

189
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,080
Damn it.

190
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,080
It's the same room as Grandma's.

191
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,700
I don't want to stay in it.

192
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,500
I'm a little busy.

193
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,680
Let's decide the location.

194
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,380
I'm going there now.

195
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,480
I've rented three cell phones.

196
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,640
If you need anything, contact me.

197
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,400
I understand.

198
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,620
See you.

199
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,600
Bye-bye, Kankichi!

200
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
I'll be back by dinner.

201
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,340
From now on, it's going to be tough!

202
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,000
Hey, everyone, pay attention!

203
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,920
The first-class passengers will start off on their bikes.

204
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,680
We're leaving by bicycle!

205
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,320
Huh? My family won't come!

206
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,700
Everyone's sick...

207
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,260
Then, is it dangerous?

208
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,900
No, I'll do everything by myself!

209
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,860
Eh? Are you sure?

210
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,300
It's a harsh race where you have to ride a bicycle and a water bike!

211
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,340
It's fine!

212
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,760
But what will you get if you win?

213
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,960
Well then, everyone!

214
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,480
Please do your best to get the prize money of 100 million yen!

215
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,400
Wow!

216
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,700
What? 100 million yen?

217
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,840
In addition, we have prepared a very luxurious prize for the families up to the third place!

218
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,020
Is what you're saying true?

219
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,040
Yes, of course.

220
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
100 million yen?

221
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,720
All right! I'll definitely win!

222
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,660
Now, the start of Hawaii, where one iron man is the king!

223
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,080
The third place champion, No. 30 Ryosu Kanki!

224
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,680
Let's hurry and go!

225
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,260
Polly idol!

226
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,560
Well, what's the matter?

227
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,160
Oh, is it Kanki?

228
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,880
I don't know how to use the safety box, though.

229
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,160
Ah?

230
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,420
I can't pay the cash!

231
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,360
Oh, I got it! I'll be right there!

232
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,440
The course is different!

233
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,680
Oh! No. 30 Ryotsu, who is the lead, has left the course for some reason!

234
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,040
It says here, you know!

235
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,620
I don't understand.

236
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,180
I don't know.

237
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,460
You have to put in the number of the secret code.

238
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,020
It doesn't matter how many you put in.

239
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
Even if you tell me.

240
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,780
There are phone numbers and date of birth.

241
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,480
There are phone numbers and date of birth.

242
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,060
What is the number of the store?

243
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,640
It's 8810.

244
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,640
That's all.

245
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,980
That's good.

246
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,160
When you want to open it, press the number.

247
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,620
I got it.

248
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:16,640
I got it.

249
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,800
Is it a hotel?

250
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,760
It's a very long way.

251
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,960
Now, the second race.

252
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,660
It's a race.

253
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,340
The second runner's family is touched.

254
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,780
The players who rode the oaf on a bicycle.

255
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,160
The players who rode the oaf on a bicycle.

256
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,440
They are all very tired.

257
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,500
Oh, my.

258
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,320
Ryoji, who was out of the course while running the top, is back.

259
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,880
Ryoji, who was out of the course while running the top, is back.

260
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,940
He joined the second race.

261
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,200
He joined the second race.

262
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,220
It's the second time.

263
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:46,920
I will lead all of you in one go.

264
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,080
What are you doing?

265
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,060
Kanki-Kichi.

266
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,280
The TV paid for.

267
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,800
I want to put it back.

268
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,460
I got it. It'll be quick.

269
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,520
I got the oaf on the bikes.

270
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,480
Pay mode is paid movie.

271
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,840
If I do this, I'll go back to my normal channel.

272
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,660
Can't you see this guy?

273
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,780
Oh, it's an historical drama, isn't it?

274
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,360
Oh, I see.

275
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,420
Thank you.

276
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,160
I've only stayed in a hotel, so I don't know anything about hotels.

277
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,700
Read the explanation.

278
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,960
It's written in Japanese.

279
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,020
I'll be late for 20 minutes.

280
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,720
All right, if this is how it is...

281
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,160
What?

282
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,900
Kankichi, the historical drama in Hawaii is also in Japanese.

283
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,260
Huh?

284
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,040
Kankichi, where did you go?

285
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,260
It costs 100 million yen.

286
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,720
I'll pay you back!

287
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,980
Oh, Ryoichi is the best!

288
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,040
Ryoichi is the best!

289
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,160
He's entering the third race, the marathon!

290
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,080
He's the best without a replacement!

291
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,100
What a strength!

292
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,660
Again? What's going on?

293
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,380
Kankichi, come here.

294
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,240
I found a good store, so I'll decide.

295
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,620
Wait a minute.

296
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,940
Isn't it too early to buy anything?

297
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,880
That's a pretty good property.

298
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,320
Grandma, you don't speak English, do you?

299
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,140
You're the same!

300
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,440
Anyway, don't make a contract yet.

301
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,580
I'm going over there now, so tell me where you want to go.

302
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,260
Huh?

303
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,080
Huh?

304
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:49,860
Huh?

305
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,340
Okay, I got it.

306
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:55,960
Whoa!

307
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,220
Ryoichi is the best!

308
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,380
He came here and he's down!

309
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,180
Yeah.

310
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,300
It's tough.

311
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,760
He's the only one out of all 30 groups

312
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,280
who's been participating alone.

313
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,560
He's been cycling, swimming, and running.

314
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,040
He's been doing this all by himself.

315
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
I guess he's almost exhausted!

316
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,620
Hm?

317
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,140
All right, I'm done charging!

318
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,680
What kind of man is he?

319
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,000
He came back in just 20 seconds!

320
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,520
Huh?

321
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,320
What's going on, Ryoichi?

322
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,500
He suddenly started going backwards!

323
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,620
But, English?

324
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,140
What should I do?

325
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,140
Oh, right.

326
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,960
There's supposed to be a company in Hawaii called Nakagawa Group.

327
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,960
I'm going to ask the employee there.

328
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,620
I'm going to ask the employee there.

329
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,620
I'm going to ask the employee there.

330
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,120
I'm going to ask the employee there.

331
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,000
This contract is good, right?

332
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,300
Yeah, it's a very good property.

333
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,880
I'm glad I found it.

334
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,520
I see.

335
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,160
Grandma, you can leave the rest to the people in Nakagawa.

336
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,540
I see.

337
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,940
Sorry for the trouble.

338
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,520
Yeah, that's fine.

339
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,280
Then I'm going.

340
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,240
I'm going.

341
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,660
He's a busy guy coming all the way to Hawaii.

342
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,460
Well, he's giving me a nice job.

343
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:03,940
He's a busy guy coming all the way to Hawaii.

344
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,160
So, he's doing a pretty good job.

345
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,780
He's doing a very good job.

346
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,420
All right.

347
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,700
Then, Light, come here.

348
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,180
Light, come here.

349
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,240
Light a hug.

350
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,760
Light a hug.

351
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,980
Light a hug.

352
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,840
Light a hug.

353
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,340
He's good!

354
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,400
How did I get through the secret sciences race of the first day?

355
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,120
The marathon had 75 points,

356
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,340
the swimming gave 100 points in the top,

357
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,100
and the bike gained 0 points as the fastest.

358
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,220
Which makes it the fifth!

359
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,640
Wow, I can't believe it.

360
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,020
I can't believe I'm going to be like this for three days.

361
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,160
Ah, I'm going to die.

362
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,780
Wow, it's delicious.

363
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,840
Sometimes meat dishes are good.

364
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,680
Oh, what's wrong with you, Kankichi?

365
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,600
You love steak, don't you?

366
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,560
You don't have an appetite.

367
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,760
No, I'm fine.

368
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,020
I'm fine.

369
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,600
I don't want to die if the competition goes on for three days.

370
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,760
I'm going to put in an option from tomorrow.

371
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,080
I need to get more strength.

372
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,640
All right! I'm going to eat!

373
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,000
Wow, Kankichi!

374
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,480
You don't have to eat like that.

375
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,120
Shopping and a cruise to the Western City.

376
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,520
The Hanauma Bay One-Day Course.

377
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,260
Are we going to this today?

378
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,740
If you come to Hawaii, it's an optional tour.

379
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,740
I have to enjoy the tour.

380
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,940
It will cost money, but if I win, I'll be able to do something.

381
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,840
Thank you for waiting.

382
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,640
Look, the shopkeeper is here to pick us up.

383
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,900
Please take care of everyone.

384
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,960
Yes, everyone, please get on the bus.

385
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,500
Can't Kankichi go?

386
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,280
Yeah, I have some business today.

387
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,140
Oh, it's boring.

388
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,080
Have fun!

389
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,320
Hmm, I can't be called out today.

390
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,540
I had better put in an option from the beginning.

391
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,320
Now, let's find out how they can get on a train or a train from Hawaii!

392
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,320
The second day's first activity is sky-diving.

393
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,980
Diving from an area of 1,000 meters above sea level,

394
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,260
how can you get off near the top of that surface?

395
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,420
The center is 100 points.

396
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,800
It's scary.

397
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,960
The flying order is,

398
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,060
Let's start with the top family from yesterday!

399
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,840
Oh, the fifth start.

400
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,060
But I'm good at diving.

401
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,900
I'll get my sense back from yesterday.

402
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,660
Well then, everyone,

403
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,620
let's get this party started!

404
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,980
All right! I'm in good shape!

405
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,080
I'm in good shape!

406
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,460
He's not just a simple transformation.

407
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,020
He's wearing the moon's energy on his back!

408
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,780
Seri's stick is in the dark.

409
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,300
If it's a sky incident, I'll leave it to you.

410
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,000
The master of the moon,

411
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,440
Moon Dekka!

412
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,800
I'm here!

413
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,980
Same goes for Venus Dekka.

414
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,060
Hey!

415
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,060
Why are you guys showing up?

416
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,560
The special detective department is on a holiday in Hawaii

417
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:31,960
for the New Year's Eve.

418
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,600
The special detective department is on a holiday in Hawaii for the New Year's Eve.

419
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,280
And they're asking the TV department to get in the way of you guys!

420
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,340
And they're asking the TV department to get in the way of you guys!

421
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:38,840
What?

422
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,780
You guys don't show up for nothing because you're special, do you?

423
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
You guys don't show up for nothing because you're special, do you?

424
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,600
Moonlight Power!

425
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,300
Reca!

426
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,300
What's that?

427
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,800
Let me explain.

428
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,700
By transforming Moon Dekka into Rosa Ogawa,

429
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,700
you can cause a huge, intense wind to blow.

430
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:58,940
you can cause a huge, intense wind to blow.

431
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,660
Oh!

432
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,360
Moon Dekka!

433
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,000
You're so澄!

434
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,280
Oh!

435
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,720
Moon Dekka!

436
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,740
Oh!

437
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,540
K겠지만!

438
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,100
They're really something!

439
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,300
What?

440
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,480
It's the first time you needed to go on a tour,

441
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,640
but you called us!

442
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,000
What's the matter?

443
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,100
You were fooled by your hunting experience after you shopped?

444
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,400
Okay!

445
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,840
I'll tell you!

446
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,920
Hey! Moonlight!

447
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,760
Please, send me to that direction!

448
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,360
What? You're too cocky to tell me the direction!

449
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,240
Fine, I'll do as you say.

450
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,900
Venus!

451
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,840
Roger!

452
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,140
Oh!

453
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,260
Mars!

454
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,200
I told you the fishing was wrong!

455
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,660
No, no, no.

456
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,600
I can't understand Japanese at all.

457
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,800
I hope Kankichi won't come soon.

458
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:05,960
Hey!

459
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,300
Sorry to keep you waiting!

460
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,200
K-Kankichi!

461
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,700
Kankichi!

462
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,220
Don't underestimate a Japanese tourist!

463
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,980
I-I'm sorry! I'll be back!

464
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,820
What? You can speak Japanese!

465
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,380
Let me see.

466
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,160
Here, here, here.

467
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,080
See you later!

468
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,940
He's not as good as always.

469
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,740
Why is he a parachute?

470
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,380
He's like 007.

471
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,480
Now, each player will be sent to the goal as follows.

472
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,520
Good job!

473
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,000
But you landed pretty far, so you get 0 points.

474
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,040
Damn it!

475
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,440
What's the next race?

476
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,780
The second race for today is long board racing on the Oaf Island!

477
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,460
Well, I'm good at surfing.

478
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,280
That's my style!

479
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,400
Ready, start!

480
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,220
Fuck!

481
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,320
You're so annoying!

482
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,600
No, no, no.

483
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,340
What?

484
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,580
Can we go back there?

485
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,040
They're just for show.

486
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,640
"Taking her own life"

487
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,160
Now, here comes the first challenge, Life-Saver!

488
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,240
Please save the drowning beauty, and aim for the goal with two people!

489
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,580
"I'm going to save the drowning beauty!"

490
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,800
In short, we just have to save the girl!

491
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,680
"I'm going to save the drowning beauty!"

492
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,440
"I'm going to save the drowning beauty!"

493
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,540
Alright, it's your turn! Grab on!

494
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,780
"I'm going to save the drowning beauty!"

495
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:48,860
"I'm going to save the drowning beauty!"

496
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,260
Sitting down and paddling is tough!

497
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,180
I'll go on the wave, so when I'm on the wave, grab on my back!

498
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,060
"Okay!"

499
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,100
"I'm going to save the drowning beauty!"

500
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,620
I'll go on the wave, so when I'm on the wave, grab on my back!

501
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:00,980
There she goes!

502
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,520
Ready, go!

503
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,940
Grab on, now!

504
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:06,640
"I'm going to save the drowning beauty!"

505
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:07,960
"Yeah!"

506
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,400
Yippee-ki-ki-ki!

507
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,180
This kind of feels a little extravagant!

508
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,080
"I'm going to save the drowning beauty!"

509
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,380
That was so lovely!

510
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,260
I want to show Kankichi too!

511
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,140
Dear, thank you for your hard work for a long time.

512
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,100
You've been working hard for a long time. Thank you.

513
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,600
No, thank you for giving me such a wonderful trip.

514
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,980
It's another gift for your gratitude.

515
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,780
What is it?

516
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,200
Open it.

517
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,560
Such an expensive thing.

518
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,420
Which one?

519
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,680
It suits you very well.

520
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,440
Dear, thank you for your hard work.

521
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,340
Hey, did you see that pendant just now?

522
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,900
A big ruby with a diamond on it.

523
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,800
A $100,000 is a ridiculous treasure.

524
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,400
My heart is pounding after a long time.

525
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,040
I wonder what kind of treasure it is.

526
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,160
Wait a minute.

527
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,140
Google.

528
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,660
What are you guys?

529
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,040
Don't talk.

530
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,080
You have a long umbrella on your back.

531
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,040
Come with me.

532
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,780
Yay!

533
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,400
I'm the president!

534
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,860
What the hell?

535
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,660
What are you doing here?

536
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,560
Are you

537
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:07,180
love the sea and protect justice?

538
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,080
Who called you, Poseidon?

539
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,380
I'm going to lock you up in a tank.

540
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,060
If it's an ocean case, let me handle it.

541
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,980
I'm sorry.

542
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,400
The first one is the one who can get the cutout!

543
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,780
Dolphin Dekka!

544
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,000
Dolphin Dekka!

545
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,800
Are you here to get in the way of the race too?

546
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,880
I'm on a part-time job during my New Year's holiday.

547
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:34,620
Again?

548
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,640
What? I'm free to get in the way now!

549
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,080
Kankichi, something bad happened!

550
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,240
Something bad happened in the cruiser!

551
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,660
What? I got it! I'll be right there!

552
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,020
Get in!

553
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,260
Dolphin Dekka!

554
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,760
I'm sorry, but can you take care of this girl for me?

555
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
I'm counting on you!

556
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,920
Hey, wait a minute, Ryotsu!

557
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Hey...

558
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,180
What?

559
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,820
Yes, I was suddenly shot from behind.

560
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,720
I didn't see her face.

561
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,760
What did Kankichi say?

562
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,060
He said he'd be here soon.

563
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,540
How did he say he'd be here?

564
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,760
Aloha!

565
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,840
We're waiting!

566
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,900
Kankichi!

567
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,920
Kankichi!

568
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,120
What has happened to you?

569
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,980
Kankichi!?

570
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,820
Kankichi!

571
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,300
Kankichi!

572
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,540
Kankichi!

573
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,520
Kankichi!?

574
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:48,600
What happened to me!?

575
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:50,940
Why?

576
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,000
I didn't see you.

577
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,720
I thought I could see you.

578
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,800
Look, I saw you!

579
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,960
I'm saying my name.

580
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,380
That means you're Kankichi.

581
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,900
Kankichi, you're Kankichi!

582
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,420
The Hiroshimaены of the group.

583
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,500
The Hiroshimaens?

584
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:05,760
Listen, I've been hit.

585
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,940
Kankichi…

586
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,300
I don't think so.

587
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,060
I see. Did the culprit run away?

588
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,840
We were on the deck the whole time, but nothing like that happened.

589
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,200
That means the culprit is still on this ship.

590
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,020
Does that make sense?

591
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,000
Then the culprit must have been caught.

592
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,460
What?

593
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,760
While I was coming, I contacted the coastal guard, so he should be coming soon.

594
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,420
Oh, here he comes!

595
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,560
Hey, here he is!

596
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,080
Hey, this is bad. What should we do?

597
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,420
What? They're not looking at us.

598
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,780
If we hide the pendant somewhere, we'll be able to do it.

599
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,560
I see.

600
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,100
All we have to do is leave the rest to the coastal guard.

601
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,300
Kankichi.

602
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,120
Yes?

603
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,280
I want to pee.

604
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,980
Oh, well, that can't be helped.

605
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,160
Here, here.

606
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,080
Kankichi, bring it for me.

607
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,600
Huh?

608
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,080
This is too much of an excuse to be called into the back room.

609
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,140
Hm.

610
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,140
"Oke."

611
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,380
Ah, wait a minute.

612
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,480
Hey, let me take a look.

613
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,780
Here, here, here!

614
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,880
What are you doing?

615
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,060
Ochiai.

616
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
*Sneeze*

617
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,380
Hankichi!

618
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,520
Hankichi!

619
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,360
Hey, Raymond. You're still up?

620
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,100
Yeah.

621
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,180
I fell asleep.

622
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,820
Thanks.

623
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,240
No, I have to go back soon.

624
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,240
Hurry up!

625
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,400
Hankichi!

626
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,320
All right.

627
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,840
Oh, yeah!

628
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,600
You did a great job, Dolphin Dagger.

629
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,320
Yeah!

630
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,860
Now, the second game of today.

631
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,120
The longboard is the end of the O.A.F.T.O. half-way race.

632
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,800
The players who have safely rescued the beauty

633
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,280
are now in the goal.

634
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,340
Thank you for your hard work.

635
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,080
But you're in the first place, so you get zero points.

636
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,740
What?

637
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,640
I did it!

638
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,980
I'm in third place.

639
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,760
All right.

640
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,440
I'll be in the top position all day today.

641
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,680
What is the third race?

642
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,220
Now, the last race of today is

643
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,640
a physical strength match!

644
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,360
Animal Onbunmaru-son!

645
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,300
Please carry these cute animals

646
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,840
and complete the goal of O.A.F.T.O.!

647
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,060
Wow!

648
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,760
Ryoichi has carried an elephant!

649
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,840
Just by carrying an elephant,

650
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,640
the elephant will be added 100 points.

651
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,120
Furthermore, if you can reach the top,

652
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,620
you will get 100 points.

653
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,360
A total of 200 points will be added.

654
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,260
I'll be in the top position all at once!

655
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,620
You go first!

656
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,140
Wait, you bastard!

657
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,500
You!

658
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,300
You!

659
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,180
You!

660
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,720
You!

661
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,420
You!

662
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:30,740
Hey!

663
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,820
You shouldn't be eating that!

664
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,040
You!

665
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,160
What?

666
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,880
You're feeding animals

667
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
and making them rampage!

668
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,720
Who's doing this?

669
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:56,940
You!

670
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,560
You are!

671
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,660
You are!

672
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,060
I'm not just a piece of junk!

673
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,300
When an accident occurs on the land,

674
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,780
I can solve everything with a single piece of bread!

675
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,920
I, the King of Bread,

676
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,180
am here today!

677
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,100
I, the King of Bread, am here today!

678
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,560
Are you in the race, too?

679
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,460
I'll give this to the elephant!

680
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,260
What?

681
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,020
Hey, Cube!

682
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,940
See?

683
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,340
Yaw!

684
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,720
Yaw!

685
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,020
Yaw!

686
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,780
Don't let it get away!

687
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,640
Yaw!

688
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,560
Yaw!

689
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,040
Yaw!

690
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,000
Hey!

691
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,280
Don't eat though!

692
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,640
Eh...

693
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,420
Oh?

694
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,100
Hello?

695
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:37,800
What's up?

696
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,140
Did you find the criminal?

697
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,880
After all, we didn't find him

698
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,440
and were released.

699
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,520
So?

700
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,620
What do you want to?

701
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,940
I thought about taking a photo of Hawaii

702
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,300
You should come with us!

703
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,040
You what?

704
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,600
I don't have to go!

705
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,000
I don't care if I can't do it!

706
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,240
Lemon really wants to go with you.

707
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,340
Or what?

708
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,840
Is there any reason why you can't come here?

709
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,660
No, no, that's not true.

710
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,600
Okay! I'll be there soon!

711
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,660
Oh, damn it!

712
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,840
So I'm going to go out of the course for a bit!

713
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,740
Wait! I won't let you!

714
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,940
If you want to go, you have to compete with me first.

715
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,900
I'm not going to go! I'm going to do a U-turn!

716
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,540
No problem!

717
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,280
Now, let's have a serious match.

718
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:23,900
What?

719
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,380
I don't have time to play with you!

720
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,820
I don't have time to play with you!

721
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,160
Let's go!

722
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,120
It's going to be a long ride.

723
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,900
Kankichi, you're really late.

724
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,220
You don't know the photos here, do you?

725
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,760
K-Kankichi!

726
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,820
I'm sorry!

727
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,800
The road is a little...

728
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,040
I'm sorry!

729
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,600
Wait for me, Konji!

730
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,800
Kankichi, the rides are different every time you come!

731
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,300
This time, it's a fake card!

732
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,320
It's amazing!

733
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,900
I know.

734
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,320
Your face is so pale.

735
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,520
Are you all right?

736
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,760
I see.

737
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,860
Okay, then, I'll take it.

738
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,800
Hey, smile!

739
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,660
Here!

740
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,060
Cheese!

741
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,480
Don't call me!

742
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,740
What time is he going to Hawaii?

743
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,720
I don't know

744
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,120
Hawaii is held in Oahu Island

745
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,620
Family vs. family, an iron man and a fool in Hawaii

746
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:50,260
The second day's final race, the animal on-board marathon is also the end

747
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,960
Only number 30 Ryozu Kankichi is left

748
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,140
It seems that the arrival is quite late

749
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,960
Will this be dangerous?

750
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,680
It seems to be dangerous

751
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,660
I don't know

752
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,980
What is it?

753
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,120
It's here!

754
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,760
This is a good picture

755
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,360
Camera on standby

756
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,860
Please continue the broadcast

757
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,000
Everyone, please take a look

758
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,940
Number 30 Ryozu Kankichi is back with an elephant

759
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,400
Ryozu Kankichi participated in this race alone without his family's request

760
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,940
Please watch

761
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
What an iron man and a fool

762
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,860
He does not let go of the elephant he carries

763
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,780
One step, another step and he is approaching the goal

764
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:44,320
Ryozu Kankichi received applause and support from the gallery

765
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,940
Now, Kato's goal

766
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,500
Somehow, I got only 100 points for the elephant

767
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,960
Now I'm in Ryozu-san's hotel

768
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,240
It was Kankichi

769
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,220
Kankichi, what happened to you?

770
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,540
It's just a futile

771
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,340
I heard that some residents in the family were sleeping

772
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,000
What table?

773
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,060
I heard that your family members are sleeping in their beds after losing their health.

774
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,200
What? What are you talking about?

775
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,060
Hey, Matoi.

776
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:37,880
You're awake.

777
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,300
What's this place?

778
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,200
Don't worry. It's a hotel room.

779
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,000
I see.

780
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,580
Kankichi, why didn't you tell me?

781
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,720
Huh? What are you talking about?

782
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,520
Don't be silly.

783
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,740
I heard all the stories from the producer who was a stupid iron man.

784
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,160
Geku...

785
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,660
What about Lemon and Gepard?

786
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,280
They're all going to see a fire dance show.

787
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,900
Then you're the only one who knows the story.

788
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,500
You're such an idiot who works hard alone until you get this far.

789
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,440
Idiots are born stupid.

790
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,380
If you say a word, I'll join you.

791
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,500
No, you're in charge of your own business.

792
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,020
I'm just a little bit more interested.

793
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,400
I have a lot of work to do for my family.

794
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,540
I just wanted you to enjoy your Hawaii trip.

795
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,940
Really, you said something that didn't make sense.

796
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,580
But I've revised it a little bit.

797
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,940
I'll be participating in the race tomorrow.

798
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,500
I can't help it if you get caught.

799
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,880
Actually, I thought I was at my limit by myself.

800
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,680
I'm sorry. Please.

801
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,760
Huh?

802
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,420
Huh?

803
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,220
What?

804
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,640
Huh?!

805
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,740
Huh??

806
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,100
What?

807
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,440
Gepard, no!

808
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,640
You mischievous girl!

809
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,040
Grandma!

810
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,660
No!

811
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,480
Please help me!

812
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,660
Wait!

813
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,260
Oh, I wonder if I'll be fine if she's that good.

814
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,300
Matoi!

815
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,140
Did something happen to Kankichi?

816
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,060
Hmm? Hmm...

817
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,440
So, if Grandma finds out about the race, it'll be a big deal, right?

818
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,900
I see. So that's what happened. I'm sorry for doubting you.

819
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:36,340
Ahaha! Don't worry about it at all. But, you really like Kankichi, don't you?

820
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:41,080
Everyone is looking at the bad side of Kankichi, so they don't know the good side of Kankichi.

821
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,720
That's right. But, this is a secret for everyone.

822
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,520
I see!

823
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,700
Today, we're going to tour the city.

824
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,120
What's up? Matoi, you're not going, either?

825
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,380
Yeah, it's a little windy.

826
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,820
Kankichi, if you do anything strange to Matoi, I'm sorry.

827
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,060
That's why, it's a misunderstanding.

828
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,100
Don't worry. Matoi is stronger than Kankichi.

829
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,880
If something happens, we'll beat him up.

830
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,060
Alright.

831
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,480
Then, it's okay.

832
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,680
That's true.

833
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,540
Hey, put that back!

834
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,180
Then, I'm going.

835
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,880
Hey, have fun.

836
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,440
Grandma, too.

837
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,460
Yeah, sure.

838
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,940
Then, we're going too.

839
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,840
Yeah, leave it to me.

840
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,420
Let's go.

841
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,320
Let's go!

842
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,800
Mahi,!

843
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,440
Hey, get in there, too!

844
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,820
The new Taitai!

845
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:06,300
I'll give you an opportunity to do a good job, so please be careful while you're relaxing.

846
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,320
Well.

847
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:10,880
Will you take over the land?

848
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,200
It's okay! I'm good at riding a bike!

849
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,620
The pedal is heavy!

850
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,060
What is it? It hurts!

851
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,560
It's a tire! It's been hit once!

852
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,060
Today is the last day. We have prepared a more harsh trial!

853
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,060
Damn it!

854
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,560
Kankichi! Are you okay to fly so far?

855
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,240
What? I'm ready to crush you like this!

856
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,380
Now, everyone! It's a Kamehameha grand premiere!

857
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,060
The Kamehameha Grand Prix

858
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:19,960
The Kamehameha Grand Prix

859
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,480
The Kamehameha Grand Prix

860
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:21,580
The Kamehameha Grand Prix

861
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:21,660
The Kamehameha Grand Prix

862
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,620
What are you doing?

863
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,380
Let go of me!

864
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,220
What are you doing?

865
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,760
You brat!

866
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,080
But...

867
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,020
This is terrible!

868
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,040
This is terrible!

869
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,080
Kankichi is amazing!

870
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,360
He's top at tearing his legs apart!

871
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,980
Okay! I'll reach the goal as I am, and I'll get 100 points for the first race!

872
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,800
The top goal is the Ryotsu Kankichi Team!

873
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,360
Now, both teams have got 100 points!

874
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,120
They've finally come out in the first and second places!

875
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,180
Alright! Next is the 10 km race!

876
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,320
Let's go!

877
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,920
Hey, wait up!

878
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,580
What is it?

879
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,100
I'll let you swim with this for today's performance.

880
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,100
What? Did you give it to Tetsukabuto?

881
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
I told you that the final day is prepared for a harsh trial.

882
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,500
Hey, Matoi! Hurry up!

883
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,540
What? I can't swim with this on.

884
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,280
What? Again?

885
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,680
Hello?

886
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:37,800
Hello?

887
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,180
Kankichi, I've got a big problem. Lemon has been kidnapped!

888
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,240
What?

889
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,380
What?

890
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,160
It's a relief that you've come all the way here.

891
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,660
Now, miss, shall I give you a stuffed animal?

892
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,840
No!

893
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,380
This one?

894
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,100
Lemon!

895
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:01,940
What?

896
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:05,880
Lemon!

897
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,660
Hooray!

898
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,000
Yes, Kanchi, Matoi!

899
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,780
Hey! Speed up!

900
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,540
Yes!

901
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,280
No! If I had such a heavy thing with me...

902
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,500
You don't have time to take it off now!

903
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,500
Now!

904
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,000
What?

905
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,560
Damn it! Take this, Kazuma!

906
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,520
No, wait!

907
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,160
Hey, Kanchi!

908
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,540
Hey, Kanchi!

909
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,560
I can't catch up!

910
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:49,740
Gah!

911
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:50,640
Ah!

912
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,020
Ah!

913
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,780
I can't do it!

914
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,720
Don't let go!

915
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,360
Okay!

916
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,240
Hey!

917
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,680
They're from the Special Police Department!

918
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,840
Oh, it's Ryozu.

919
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,540
They came to the right place!

920
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,400
Sorry, but I don't have time to push you!

921
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,780
What?

922
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,720
I forgot the time and played too much!

923
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:22,900
I completely forgot that there was a mission!

924
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,480
Well then, goodbye!

925
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:27,520
Hey, hey!

926
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,240
Help me!

927
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,260
You can't tell what's going on if you look!

928
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,200
You're an idiot!

929
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,180
Matoi!

930
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,980
Take the bicycle and climb up from there!

931
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:39,760
What?

932
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,500
Hurry up!

933
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,060
I got it!

934
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:42,900
What?

935
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Just keep your head on the pedestal and climb up!

936
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,160
What?

937
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,120
No way!

938
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:52,680
It's okay!

939
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,840
Sorry!

940
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,760
Kankichi!

941
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,480
Hey!

942
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,120
Gah!

943
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,500
Why the bicycle?

944
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,900
If you don't have this, they'll be here!

945
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,700
Kankichi!

946
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:09,200
Get in!

947
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:09,940
Yeah!

948
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,740
Now, miss!

949
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,960
There's no one to help you anymore!

950
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,640
Get that stuffed animal over here!

951
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:19,700
No!

952
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,840
Don't come any closer!

953
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,600
What?

954
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,040
What's wrong?

955
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,480
Kankichi!

956
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,100
Matoi!

957
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:26,660
No way!

958
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,920
I was supposed to fall down, but...

959
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,460
Don't think you can escape from me!

960
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,980
I can't get out of this narrow tunnel!

961
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,720
Hey!

962
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,980
I need you to hold me tight!

963
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:49,900
Hey!

964
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,820
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

965
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,380
What?

966
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:53,940
Kankichi!

967
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,900
Raymond help me right now!

968
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,080
Well!

969
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,820
The enemy is hitting us!

970
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,580
It's our turn!

971
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,300
Oh!

972
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,100
The tunnel!

973
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,120
Hey!

974
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,180
Stop the car!

975
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,240
Quiet!

976
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,700
I said stop the car!

977
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:15,940
Hey!

978
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,600
I'm going to kill you!

979
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,120
I'm going to kill you!

980
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,280
You scum! Go home!

981
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:42,040
Ah! I was on that cruiser yesterday!

982
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,680
What? So you two are the perpetrators of the jewel robbery?

983
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,800
That's right. I hid a pendant inside this kid's stuffed animal.

984
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,480
What? What did you say? You hid a pendant inside this kid's stuffed animal?

985
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:55,800
And then you took a lemon...

986
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,400
Damn you! You brought in a kid like this!

987
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,660
I will never forgive you!

988
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,500
Kouki!

989
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,820
Kouki!

990
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,180
Kouki!

991
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:18,600
You idiot!

992
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,920
The sword is one more thing.

993
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,380
Kouki!

994
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,440
Hey, kid!

995
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,400
Lemon!

996
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,000
Give me the stuffed animal!

997
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:34,740
No! This stuffed animal is the treasure that Yuzu, who went to Kyoto to train, bought for Lemon for the first time with his salary!

998
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,620
Lemon! I'm going to give you the stuffed animal!

999
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,640
No!

1000
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:42,760
No way!

1001
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:43,780
No way!

1002
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,280
It's no use!

1003
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,340
No way!

1004
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:45,540
You can't take it!

1005
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:46,880
No way!

1006
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,760
I'll take it!

1007
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,960
Kouki!

1008
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,400
Thanks to wearing this armor, I'm saved!

1009
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,180
Lemon, run!

1010
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,660
Kouki!

1011
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,160
Matoi! Lemon!

1012
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,340
Huh?

1013
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,120
Damn it!

1014
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,660
Uwaaaaaaah!

1015
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,700
Uwaaaaaaah!

1016
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,100
Uwaaaaaaah!

1017
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,600
Uwaaaaaaah!

1018
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:18,860
You bastard!

1019
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,060
You bastard!

1020
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,340
You always do bad things to Lemon, you bastard!

1021
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,700
You bastard!

1022
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,580
You bastard!

1023
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,440
How about this, chas!

1024
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,420
Today,

1025
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,300
I'll make you pay for this!

1026
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,600
Kankichi!

1027
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,560
Lemon!

1028
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,900
Kankichi! Lemon!

1029
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,340
You were scared, right? You did your best!

1030
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,360
I was sure you would help me!

1031
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,900
I was sure you would help me!

1032
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:46,920
I see!

1033
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,920
Alright! Leave the culprit to them,

1034
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,760
and get ready!

1035
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,100
We're going back to the race!

1036
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,160
If we do now, we'll be in time for the last race!

1037
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:58,920
If we do now, we'll be in time for the last race!

1038
00:46:59,440 --> 00:46:59,920
Yeah!

1039
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,700
The end!

1040
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,280
The winner is the Suzukidan team!

1041
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,460
Congratulations!

1042
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,560
Damn!

1043
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,120
The danger of being in the lead was so strong,

1044
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,840
that they ended up in 3rd place!

1045
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,200
That was a bit disappointing!

1046
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,860
Well, it can't be helped!

1047
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,200
There were accidents too!

1048
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,200
Kankichi!

1049
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,720
You two did a great job!

1050
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,400
Everyone, I heard everything!

1051
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,000
Thank you so much for helping Lemon!

1052
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:28,880
Thank you so much for helping Lemon!

1053
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,180
Even so, he's still a watery guy.

1054
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,220
He kept the race a secret!

1055
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,860
No, I'm just

1056
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,440
going to have everyone I'm taking care of

1057
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,520
enjoy my trip to Hawaii!

1058
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,620
I'm just going to have everyone I'm taking care of enjoy my trip to Hawaii!

1059
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,560
Ryoichi-san, well done!

1060
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,160
Oh, Producer!

1061
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,560
That was close!

1062
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,800
If there was no danger in the middle,

1063
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,200
I would have won for sure!

1064
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,160
Oh, I lost 100 million yen!

1065
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,740
100 million yen?

1066
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,480
What is 100 million yen?

1067
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,400
The prize money for this race!

1068
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,320
If you win, you get 100 million yen!

1069
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,280
Kankichi!

1070
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,200
You didn't say anything like that!

1071
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,040
I didn't say anything like that!

1072
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,820
What? You said something cool,

1073
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,620
but you actually meant that!

1074
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,480
No, no, no!

1075
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,200
Everyone, you see,

1076
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,800
there should be a luxury prize until third place!

1077
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,480
Yes, that's right!

1078
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,920
A world tour with the family!

1079
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,140
A world tour?

1080
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,520
Did you hear that? It's amazing!

1081
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,700
Everyone, it's a world tour!

1082
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,160
You did it, Kankichi!

1083
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,800
That was big!

1084
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,060
I did it!

1085
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,160
What do you think?

1086
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,760
I'll do it when I have the chance!

1087
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,460
However, this is free for the next project!

1088
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,600
For everyone,

1089
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,700
you will have to do

1090
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,040
a family-based iron man race

1091
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,840
while going around the world!

1092
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,320
What?

1093
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,260
Are you going to do this race again?

1094
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,260
While going around the world?

1095
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,360
Yes!

1096
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,460
Kankichi!

1097
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,160
Are you going to let us do that race?

1098
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,300
What?

1099
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,980
No, no, that's not what I mean!

1100
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,520
We're almost at the end of the Shogatsu!

1101
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,800
Damn it!

1102
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,880
I hate the iron man race so much!

1103
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,640
