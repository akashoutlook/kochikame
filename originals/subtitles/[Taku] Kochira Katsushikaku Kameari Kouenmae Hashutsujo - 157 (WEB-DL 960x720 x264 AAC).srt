1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,940
When you watch TV

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,420
Make the room brighter and try to get away

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:25,320
It's like someone's calling

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,240
After the rain

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,400
I walked while looking back

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,220
I held my mom's hand

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,620
I felt it at that time

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,500
A strange feeling

9
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,140
So I tried to walk on the black tile of the Agedo Gai

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,280
I tried to walk on the black tile of the Agedo Gai

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,320
Nobody's been a child once

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,880
But we all forget

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,100
A great-looking politician

14
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,400
An old blue aunt

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,160
Turn around and take a look

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,260
At that corner

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,600
You can see us all

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,540
There's a turtle over there

19
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,300
There's a turtle over there

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,400
Ah, I'm sure there's a turtle.

21
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,480
Everyone, come to our town.

22
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,600
Thank you!

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,660
Memories of Shinobazu's Fountain

24
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:44,520
It was wonderful.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,020
Yes. I feel the tradition of Europe.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,120
I could only see everything together.

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,440
I was looking forward to eating with everyone on my way back.

28
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,040
So I followed you.

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,240
By the way, what would you like to eat?

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
Eel? Sushi? Or a

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:01,940
Yes.

32
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,320
It's a little early to eat.

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,640
Hey, the weather is good.

34
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,720
Why don't you all take a boat?

35
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,740
Oh, that's great. Let's go!

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,660
Is there a place to ride a boat in Ueno?

37
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,620
It's the Shinobazu's Fountain.

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,480
It's just down the mountain.

39
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,740
I see.

40
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,160
Ah, they have a place over there.

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,060
Oh, a toilet.

42
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,740
I decided on this!

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,060
Boat and foot bath are fun!

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,480
Let's make a decision on this!

45
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,160
Let's get this one then.

46
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,100
Yes, we'll get this one.

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:45,920
OK.

48
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,040
Nana, try calling her.

49
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,740
Okay.

50
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,140
It's been a while since I rode a boat.

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,820
Hey, wait!

52
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,340
Why are you so happy that you can't ride a boat alone?

53
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,680
Because you're the one who's riding it.

54
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,560
That's right.

55
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,420
I decide.

56
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,140
Honda is the same as me.

57
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,940
Princess Futo, you ride with Reiko.

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,160
And Nagagawa, you ride alone.

59
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,240
Why am I alone?

60
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,720
There are three of us on the boat.

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,280
Even if I ride with Reiko and the others...

62
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,580
Anyway, you should ride with me!

63
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,360
Yes.

64
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,600
I wanted to ride with you because I have a chance.

65
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,620
No! You should decide with me!

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,440
Why do I have to ride with my friends?

67
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,560
This is the most fashionable style.

68
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,380
Ryo, you wanted to ride with Honda, didn't you?

69
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,480
No, I'm fine.

70
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,680
There are a lot of birds, right?

71
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,100
It's a yurikamome.

72
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,800
They've been growing recently.

73
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,160
Look at this!

74
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,320
It's a yurikamome.

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,260
The yurikamome comes with us.

76
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,200
It's cute.

77
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,140
That's right.

78
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,100
I'll give you a biscuit.

79
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,360
Nana is feeding a yurikamome.

80
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,140
She's so kind.

81
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,860
What?

82
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,860
Oh, no!

83
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,200
Hey, you can't feed it!

84
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,800
What?

85
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,200
Ah!

86
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,180
Hang in there.

87
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Oh, no!

88
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,040
Don't!

89
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,880
Hey, out of the way!

90
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,220
You are going to eat me in one piece!

91
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,860
Let's take it!

92
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,720
You should concentrate on the chink!

93
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,780
You should expend the chink soon!

94
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,380
Yes!

95
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,840
Kyo-chan, Pong-chan!

96
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,960
Stop that!

97
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,320
Aim...

98
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,220
That was scary!

99
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,480
He's trying to cheat on Dosaku and even a terrapin!

100
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,640
Are you alright?

101
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,780
Yes.

102
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,780
I was surprised how beautiful the river is.

103
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,640
How is it? You don't want to compete?

104
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,720
The one who gets to the other side of the pond first wins.

105
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,740
The one who loses will treat today's meal.

106
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:19,820
What?

107
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,700
Reiko-san is bad at this.

108
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,880
Let's go!

109
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,280
Ready, go!

110
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,480
Hey, Kyosuke!

111
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,540
What do we do?

112
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,540
It's not good to lose and get a good look on your face.

113
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's stand up, Kei-chan.

114
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,520
Okay.

115
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,880
All right.

116
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,420
Damn it.

117
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,160
The boat over there is inefficient.

118
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,500
It's a disadvantage.

119
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,100
I'm in the center.

120
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,400
Damn it!

121
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,300
Give me more pitch!

122
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,200
I can't do this anymore.

123
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,200
I'll go first.

124
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,580
Ryo-chan, treat me to a meal.

125
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,160
Damn it!

126
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,400
I won't let you do that!

127
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,220
Ouch!

128
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,400
Ryo-chan, you're so mean!

129
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,260
I have to choose a way to win.

130
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,240
I've found a good way to win.

131
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,060
Four pins.

132
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,820
Oh, dear.

133
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,460
I won't let you win!

134
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,280
You'll take the��는.

135
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,800
Damn it!

136
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,640
Damn it!

137
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,920
I'll rip them all.

138
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,360
What?

139
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,640
Don't jump off the Lambo, but I'll stab you if you die!

140
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,360
Hold on!

141
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,120
Calm down.

142
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,060
I'm not a bike!

143
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,420
It's not a game!

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,500
Calm down!

145
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,060
Stop it! Don't hit me!

146
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,600
This is a game, Ryo-chan!

147
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,560
Hey, you! You're not gonna save your life?

148
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,820
No way! It's not fun at all with you!

149
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,740
This is the natural way!

150
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,880
That's right!

151
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,100
Damn!

152
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,860
Shut up!

153
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,940
What's wrong?

154
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,920
There's water under the pond!

155
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,000
It's coming out!

156
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,660
The water from the pond is circulating through the pump.

157
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,420
Why?

158
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,640
Because the Hedoro was in the pond before.

159
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,720
The pump makes the water flow and purifies it.

160
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,580
I see.

161
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,960
Hey, a strange fish is floating.

162
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,360
Which one?

163
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,480
Look!

164
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,040
This isn't a fish. It's a plastic model of a submarine.

165
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,400
A toy?

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,820
Someone must be playing with it.

167
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,260
What's this?

168
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,280
What's wrong?

169
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,400
It's mine.

170
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,740
It's from my elementary school.

171
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,820
What?

172
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,060
No way!

173
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,640
Look! It has my name on it.

174
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,140
Oh, it's true!

175
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,280
But why is it floating now?

176
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,920
The weight of the lead is separated and it's floating in the water.

177
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,780
Did you make a boat run in this pond when you were in elementary school?

178
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,020
Yes, I came here every day.

179
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,440
When I was in elementary school, the submarine was very popular.

180
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,680
I made most of the plastic models.

181
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,420
I went to the bathhouse and made it run.

182
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,220
But I saw too much of the sinking part of the bath, so I wanted to make it interesting.

183
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,920
The pond and pond are more realistic because they are invisible in the water.

184
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:32,960
It's cool.

185
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,880
But it's good that it's sunk, but it's not floating.

186
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,780
The lead is entangled in the screw and can't move.

187
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,360
The angle of the effect is too tight, so it gets stuck in the bottom of the pond.

188
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,940
The weight is too heavy, and there are various causes.

189
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,820
The sink is not as strong as the bottom of the pond.

190
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,680
In this Shinobazu lake, there were many waterfowl competitions.

191
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,380
So, probably hundreds of them are sinking.

192
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,960
Hundreds?

193
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,020
Yes, that's right.

194
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,260
I have a good idea.

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,640
Where are you going?

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,900
What's that?

197
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,240
It's a four-leaf.

198
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,460
I borrowed it from the folk museum.

199
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,940
I'll investigate the bottom of the pond with this.

200
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,620
Can I get it with that?

201
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm a genius. Leave it to me.

202
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,200
Alright, just like that.

203
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Look, there's a lot!

204
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,020
Wow, amazing!

205
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,540
Oh, what's this?

206
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,040
It's the G.I. Joe I lost and the underwater scooter.

207
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,360
Is that yours too?

208
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,160
There might be more.

209
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,000
It looks like you're looking for treasure.

210
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,740
No...

211
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,780
Oh, it's heavy.

212
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,840
What is it?

213
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,120
This is a model of a human body I've sunk.

214
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,520
Why is that in the pond?

215
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,720
I took it out of the school's room to scare everyone.

216
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,760
I put it here, but I forgot about it.

217
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,080
Are you surprised?

218
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm not surprised.

219
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,540
That's a lot.

220
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,180
This is a piece of junk.

221
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,080
Oh, there's a lot of scum.

222
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,900
Oh, that's my half-sleeve.

223
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,140
Why is it in the pond?

224
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,340
When it comes out like this...

225
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,840
This is...

226
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,940
Takayama.

227
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,300
Takayama

228
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,340
Takayama

229
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:40,520
Takayama

230
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,020
Takayama

231
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,060
Takayama

232
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,850
Takayama

233
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,320
Takayama

234
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,460
Takayama

235
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:47,900
Takayama

236
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,000
Takayama

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,040
Takayama

238
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,720
Takayama

239
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:48,760
Takayama

240
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,680
Takayama

241
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,060
Takayama

242
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,140
Takayama

243
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,840
Takayama

244
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,640
Takayama

245
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,540
Takayama

246
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,740
Takayama

247
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:04,260
Takayama

248
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,920
Takayama

249
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,680
Takayama

250
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,340
Takayama

251
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,020
Takayama

252
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
Takayama

253
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,720
Takayama

254
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,580
*pain*

255
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,480
*pain*

256
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,800
*pain*

257
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,660
It's no good!

258
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,220
You're no good.

259
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,020
*pain*

260
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,720
*pain*

261
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,720
The cankichi fell!

262
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,760
*pain*

263
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,060
*pain*

264
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,080
*pain*

265
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,720
*pain*

266
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,860
I can't go on.

267
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,540
There were 100 sweet potatoes in my pocket!

268
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,040
*pain*

269
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,260
*pain*

270
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:46,880
They won't come.

271
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,380
They're trying to surprise us.

272
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,420
*pain*

273
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,240
Oh no!

274
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,380
Kankichi!

275
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,440
*pain*

276
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,720
Kankichi, are you okay?

277
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,980
That was close.

278
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,780
*pain*

279
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,540
*pain*

280
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,380
*pain*

281
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,500
*pain*

282
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,800
*pain*

283
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,300
*pain*

284
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,080
*pain*

285
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,240
*pain*

286
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,880
Hahahahaha!

287
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,760
*pain*

288
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,700
*pain*

289
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:39,780
Oh! As expected, Kankichi!

290
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,400
Dad, you can do it if you let me do it.

291
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,580
Takayama, did you hit your finger again?

292
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,940
I made a mistake.

293
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,880
Takayama!

294
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,880
Takayama!

295
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,880
Did you forget your umbrella?

296
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,720
I can't sleep.

297
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,000
It's nothing.

298
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,100
Next Sunday, it's the submarine competition in Shinobazu.

299
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,160
I'll win this time.

300
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Takayama!

301
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,960
I made you laugh today.

302
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,160
I can't imitate anyone who can hit all five fingers with a tonkachi.

303
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,320
Jiro...

304
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,440
Takayama!

305
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Let me do it.

306
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,540
It hurt.

307
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,140
Amazing.

308
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,180
My brother was selected as a category in the last sports competition.

309
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,300
My brother belongs to the school.

310
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,480
My brother's a junior judo player.

311
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,960
Nothing can I boast about.

312
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,440
I don't have a place to go.

313
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,400
Where's Jiro and his brother?

314
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,260
Eh?

315
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,420
My brother is...

316
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,700
My brother is...

317
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,420
He...

318
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,260
He's good at being a professional model.

319
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,540
Eh?

320
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,140
He's really good at it.

321
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,820
He can fly a submarine.

322
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,120
Oh.

323
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,060
Then, will he participate in the submarine competition on Sunday?

324
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,300
Eh...

325
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,180
Well...

326
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,040
Well...

327
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,680
I'm definitely going to see it.

328
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,460
Me too!

329
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,880
Hey!

330
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,900
Kankichi!

331
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,460
Wait!

332
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,720
Hey!

333
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,460
Wait!

334
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:14,880
I said wait!

335
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,280
Kankichi!

336
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,920
Takayama!

337
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Kankichi didn't escape?

338
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,620
He went out the window.

339
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,240
I see.

340
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,940
Damn Kankichi!

341
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,220
If I see him on Monday, I'll beat him to death!

342
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,520
Kankichi, your teacher is gone.

343
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,300
Phew...

344
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,900
Hmph!

345
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,560
Ah!

346
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,180
Aah!

347
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,560
Ah!

348
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,860
Ouch!

349
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,600
Ouch!

350
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,840
Are you OK?

351
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,860
Ouch!

352
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,460
I'm saved.

353
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,720
But you have to catch him on Monday.

354
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,580
I forgot on Monday.

355
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,340
Hehehe...

356
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,720
Huh?

357
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,540
You make Takayama's Promo?

358
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,220
You're really terrible at it.

359
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,700
You're right. I can't swim in this much space.

360
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,060
I guess I can't.

361
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,160
Huh?

362
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,400
I see. For your brother.

363
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,880
I wanted to keep it a secret and surprise him, but I'm not good at sports and I don't study well.

364
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,380
And I'm clumsy and I don't have anything like my brother.

365
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,800
So you stayed and did it.

366
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,040
Yeah, but it didn't go well.

367
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,840
Okay, then I'll help you.

368
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,660
Huh?

369
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,560
I have a brother named Kinjiro, so I know how you feel.

370
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,160
But Kankichi-kun is different from me.

371
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,580
No, Kinjiro is a top student unlike me.

372
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,220
I'm not the kind of brother who would be proud of his brother.

373
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,520
Kankichi-kun.

374
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,360
I'll help you, but you're the one who makes it.

375
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,300
Okay.

376
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,020
First, take the bari well and glue it after putting the parts together.

377
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,720
Okay.

378
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,520
Don't use too much glue.

379
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,580
Okay.

380
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,380
Huh?

381
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,840
Brother, are you going to the submarine competition tomorrow?

382
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,180
Yeah. I don't know if I'll win.

383
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,460
Hey, have you made a submarine yet?

384
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,060
I'm in the middle of making it.

385
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,580
Show me, show me!

386
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,280
The glue isn't dry yet, so it'll break if you mess with it.

387
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,700
I'll leave it until the competition.

388
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,180
I didn't know that you were really good at modeling.

389
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,400
Yeah!

390
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,700
Haha!

391
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,500
I did it!

392
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,680
Hehehe!

393
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,500
The competition starts in the afternoon, so you have to drive before that.

394
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,620
Okay.

395
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,240
I wonder if it'll work.

396
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,880
It'll be okay.

397
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,580
Because even I saw it, it was well made.

398
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,020
Really?

399
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,240
I'm relieved if you say so, Kankichi-kun.

400
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,240
I-I'll do it.

401
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,120
Go!

402
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,800
Wow!

403
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,560
Ah, it sank.

404
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,000
Wow, I did it!

405
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,860
Good job!

406
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,260
Amazing, amazing! You did it, Kankichi-kun!

407
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,500
Thank you. It's all thanks to you, Kankichi-kun.

408
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,440
Now I can proudly boast to my little brother.

409
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,160
What?

410
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,900
Anyway, Takayama.

411
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,980
Let's try to move it in the middle.

412
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,020
Huh?

413
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,600
But I can't take it off.

414
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:46,940
What if it gets stuck?

415
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,460
It'll be okay.

416
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,720
It's in good shape!

417
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,160
Ah...

418
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,640
Ah...

419
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,440
Ah!

420
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,080
Huh?

421
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,700
What's this?

422
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,660
What's wrong? What's wrong?

423
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:15,880
You missed something.

424
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,520
What's wrong?

425
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,200
Oh, Kankichi-kun...

426
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,060
Give it back.

427
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,440
It's your toy.

428
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,840
I'm sorry.

429
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:21,560
Huh?

430
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,660
Take it back.

431
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,000
What's wrong?

432
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,700
You're the one who woke the sleeping child up.

433
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,900
Tell me to return them.

434
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,520
What is that face?

435
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,520
Do you have a problem?

436
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,440
Nah, I don't.

437
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,760
Give it back.

438
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,180
That one.

439
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,640
I don't like it.

440
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,680
It's perfect. Let's play with this one to get rid of boredom.

441
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,500
I don't like that.

442
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's hit the stone where it's running and sink it.

443
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,700
What? We made it.

444
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,100
If you say give it back, give it back.

445
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,720
What?

446
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,380
You're a naughty kid.

447
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,700
If you want to give it back, you have to take it.

448
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,620
Kankichi, what should we do?

449
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,360
Hold on, Takayama.

450
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,240
Take this!

451
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,480
Give it back!

452
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,900
You little brat!

453
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,760
You did it again!

454
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,840
What?

455
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,580
How's that? Did I hurt you?

456
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,320
Give it back, submarine!

457
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,320
Damn it.

458
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,080
My submarine!

459
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,140
Damn it!

460
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,860
Taichiki!

461
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,860
Don't look up!

462
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,100
Damn it. Where is it?

463
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,200
Where is it? Where did it go?

464
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,580
It's my fault.

465
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,880
If I had held back there...

466
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
I'm sorry.

467
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,960
No, it's not your fault.

468
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,380
It's fine.

469
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,080
Wait!

470
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,220
Kankichi!

471
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,620
Kankichi!

472
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,120
What's wrong with you?

473
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,880
You're so mean.

474
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,180
I'm not talking about that.

475
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,700
Kifumi...

476
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,660
I can't get enough.

477
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,300
Kinjiro, give me your savings!

478
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,840
What?

479
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,920
I don't want it.

480
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,780
I'll give it back even if I die.

481
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,360
I'm telling you!

482
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,660
Kankichi!

483
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,660
Kankichi!

484
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,580
Kankichi!

485
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:04,700
I'm telling you!

486
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,040
Believe me!

487
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,500
You have to believe me.

488
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,980
I'll give it back to you!

489
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,200
Kankichi?

490
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,300
Yes?

491
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,280
I'll give it back to you!

492
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,600
Let's fight for the possessions!

493
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:23,640
Yes, let's!

494
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,660
Kankichi!

495
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,220
We're going to something even worse.

496
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,560
I'll give it back to you!

497
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,000
No it's not your fault.

498
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,080
Kinkichi!

499
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:33,760
Kinkichi!

500
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,900
Kanpichi!

501
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,740
What's wrong? The submarine competition is over!

502
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,180
Where's Takayama? Where's Takayama?

503
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,120
If it's Takayama, he went home with his brother.

504
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,360
He seemed very upset.

505
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,720
I didn't have a face to face him.

506
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,200
But I should have sent the plums to Takayama's house.

507
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,760
Takayama suddenly moved out of the house because of his father's work.

508
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,260
He couldn't say goodbye to everyone.

509
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,360
It's a pity.

510
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,560
I can't believe he's coming out now.

511
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,720
Oh, Senpai.

512
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,180
You're here.

513
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,880
Are you going to return it to its original state?

514
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,420
The best thing is to return it to its original state.

515
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,180
There are too many memories.

516
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,100
Where did I play when I was a kid?

517
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,460
Now, let's eat!

518
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,960
We're going to eat tarasco today!

519
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,620
Today?

520
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,820
Today, too.

521
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,040
Put it away.

522
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,400
Then, what do you want to do today?

523
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,020
What do you think?

524
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,120
I guess I don't have to go.

525
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,500
Because I took a bus.

526
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,180
And we were in the off-road area.

527
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,740

What's up with this golf course?

542
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,760
It's a mess.

543
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,760
It's in the middle of the city.

544
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,920
It was originally in the great nature,

545
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,500
but it became like this in the nature

546
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,400
while it was entrusted to the flow of nature.

547
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,820
That's not natural at all.

548
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,220
Next time,

549
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,440
"The Final Battle! Great Nature Golf!"

550
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,360
Please watch it.
