00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,460
Everyone, come to our town

23
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,600
Thank you!

24
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,360
Dad, what is that place shining?

25
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,140
It's Tokyo Stadium.

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,060
It's a new baseball field.

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,320
The light of Tokyo Stadium is clearly visible from the train.

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,880
It was built in Minami-senshu, Arakawa, as the home of the 大マイオリオンズ in June 1937.

29
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,900
It costs 3 billion yen and has a capacity of 35,000.

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,440
The light of the American league is very bright in the small town.

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,700
It was a field of light.

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,100
This is the light of the Tokyo Stadium.

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,820
But why did you bring it?

34
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,560
The Tokyo Stadium had a pleasant memory.

35
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,640
It was when the history was destroyed in the last ten years.

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,420
Stand clear, everyone!

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,100
Hey, Kikichi!

38
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,200
It's dangerous!

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,520
Stop it!

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,720
Hey, Ikkura! Get off!

41
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,520
I'll break it anyway, so just one is fine, right?

42
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,340
Kikichi!

43
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,280
You didn't turn it off?

44
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,240
I'm sorry!

45
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,720
After all, it's the source of the light of the light.

46
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,160
It must be selling high.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,820
Certainly, there are many enthusiasts at the auction of today's baseball goods, so it will be very expensive.

48
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,500
It's a memory, right?

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,920
Are you really going to sell it?

50
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,180
It's tomorrow's meal rather than old memories.

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,000
It seems that time has not advanced since a while ago.

52
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,160
Oh, that clock stopped when I came.

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,280
It's 10:05 now.

54
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,040
What? The auction starts at 10 o'clock!

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,880
Oh!

56
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,560
Hey, idiot!

57
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,540
Put the clock together!

58
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,360
Senpai!

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,660
Kikichi!

60
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,920
Kikichi!

61
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,220
Are you okay?

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,040
The light bulb is safe.

63
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:13,640
I didn't expect that Senpai would be fractured by hitting the car.

64
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,780
It's a memory, so I'll sell it.

65
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,380
It's a memory.

66
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,800
That's right.

67
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,800
Kikichi, why are you so hard on me?

68
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,080
Don't add to it!

69
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
This is not your fault.

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,380
Senpai!

71
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,160
I'm just sorry!

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,320
It hurts, but I'm really sorry.

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
Do you know it?

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,400
It hurts a little, but keep my love.

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,540
Don't do it.

76
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,500
That's right?

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,760
I said do it.

78
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,920
Have you met him before?

79
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,340
No, this is the first time.

80
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,900
I see.

81
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,620
Ryo-san, are you really injured?

82
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,360
As you can see.

83
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,600
What are we going to do about today's match?

84
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,960
I see. It starts at 3 o'clock.

85
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,180
What's going on today?

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,500
It's a match against PTA.

87
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,060
I was supposed to be there in their parents' place.

88
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,680
But I can't.

89
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,180
But you can't.

90
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,000
Ryo-san, you promised to hit me with a homerun.

91
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Don't worry. I'll keep my promise.

92
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,200
Here I go.

93
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,880
Sorry.

94
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,420
Senpai!

95
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,760
Are you okay?

96
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,840
You can't do that.

97
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,140
I know. They'll understand.

98
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,920
A man promised once. I'll keep my promise.

99
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,640
Both of your legs are fractured.

100
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,740
What's that?

101
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,800
I'm a man who hit a homerun with a fractured whole body to keep my promise with this cheeky kid.

102
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,320
What's that warrior's name?

103
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,020
Hyuga Kenji.

104
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,160
Hyuga Kenji?

105
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:16,980
I don't know.

106
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,260
An old player?

107
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,600
Yes, a long time ago when you were born.

108
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,460
There was a stadium called Tokyo Stadium in this place.

109
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,120
Hyuga was a professional player.

110
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,800
What?

111
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,540
So the Tokyo Stadium we talked about earlier was here.

112
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,240
Yes.

113
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,280
It was the stadium that gave us lots of dreams.

114
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,020
It was a rescue that gave me a dream

115
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,000
Dad, faster!

116
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,180
It's okay, the night is until 9 o'clock

117
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,100
Wow, it's bright

118
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,840
Will everyone get together?

119
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,320
Hey Gin-san, you're early today

120
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,960
I was approached by him

121
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,640
Two tires

122
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,660
Hurry up

123
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,580
Hey, which one do you want?

124
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,140
Wait a minute

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,400
Taima is the champion

126
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,160
Yay

127
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,060
Mr. Asakusa, I've made a seat

128
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,660
You're here at the right time

129
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,800
Hozu, I'm counting on you

130
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,680
Go, Kankichi

131
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,140
That's right

132
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,760
Flare, flare

133
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,940
Daimai

134
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,980
Flare, flare

135
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,740
Daimai

136
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,620
The missile boom

137
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,800
Good, good. Enomoto

138
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,940
Good, good.Enomoto

139
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,160
Escaping from the beginning

140
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,460
The first-class team has come out.

141
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,420
What should I say?

142
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,560
Mr. Shimura, let's say that it is a hit that has been supported.

143
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,700
Now, the hero of the Orions is entering the game.

144
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,400
4th, third, Hyuga, number 0.

145
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,780
At that time, Hyuga Kenji was still young.

146
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
He was a slugger who was entrusted with the missile shooting 4th.

147
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,980
He was a slugger who was entrusted with the missile shooting 4th.

148
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,380
Fly away, Hyuga!

149
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,580
Defeat Hankyu!

150
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,400
That's right!

151
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,040
Fly away, Hyuga!

152
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,300
Adachi on the mound.

153
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,500
From the set position, number 9, Nagelos!

154
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,560
Hyuga Kenji has entered!

155
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,880
3 runs, homeruns!

156
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,860
I did it!

157
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,160
I did it!

158
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,340
I did it!

159
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,760
I did it!

160
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,920
I did it!

161
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,420
I did it!

162
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:01,800
I did it!

163
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:01,980
I did it!

164
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,580
Thanks to the boss, I got an extra point.

165
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
It's a reward yakisoba.

166
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,020
Oh, thank you.

167
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,900
There's also cider.

168
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,340
How about a bento?

169
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,560
I did it!

170
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,860
Thank you for your always support.

171
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,880
Oh, I was called by Hyuga.

172
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,300
Hey, Kankichi, eat a lot.

173
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,180
That's your dinner.

174
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,280
It's your dinner.

175
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,500
Yeah.

176
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,000
Damn it, a change.

177
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,340
I'm going out for a while.

178
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,880
Actually, there was another purpose for me to come to Tokyo Stadium.

179
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,220
No, rather, this book was the real purpose.

180
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,400
Hey, are you lost?

181
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,900
Hey, are you lost?

182
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,100
Hey, are you lost?

183
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,480
Hey, are you lost?

184
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,220
Oh, nice.

185
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,260
Oh, nice.

186
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,080
Oh, nice.

187
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,220
It's just a book.

188
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,760
I see.

189
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,460
I see.

190
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:02,800
I see.

191
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,560
Thank you.

192
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,880
Thank you.

193
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:06,860
Thank you.

194
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:06,980
I'm glad you're here.

195
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,720
Me, too.

196
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,080
Let's go to the stadium together.

197
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,440
Yeah.

198
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,820
Let's go.

199
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,460
This is so fun.

200
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,100
Thanks, Kankichi.

201
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,080
Thanks.

202
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,820
Thank you for the baseball card the other day.

203
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,540
I found a lost child again by chance.

204
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,200
Thank you for your hard work.

205
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,920
No, I'm happy if you can help my sister.

206
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,860
I will call a lost child.

207
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,720
Mr. Yamada from Mikawa Island.

208
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,320
The child, Taro, is lost.

209
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,540
Please come to the office below the stand immediately.

210
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,460
It's a good voice to hear.

211
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,860
It seems that your heart can be washed.

212
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,100
Here you are.

213
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,700
Candy.

214
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,960
No, thank you.

215
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,640
Wait quietly until your father comes.

216
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,100
Yes.

217
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,900
Here you are.

218
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,500
For Kankichi.

219
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,520
This candy is also the best.

220
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,300
Her name is Yayoi Kurihara.

221
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,500
She used to play the game in Tokyo Stadium.

222
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,220
Her voice is not only beautiful, but also beautiful and kind.

223
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,260
I went to the stadium to see her.

224
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:29,860
Well.

225
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,700
She is like your daughter.

226
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,580
I couldn't find her for once.

227
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,260
So I took her to Kansai to see her brother.

228
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,180
Her father found out and hit her.

229
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,360
Oh.

230
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,980
Of course.

231
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,100
Hey, what's the story of the home run?

232
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,800
I don't care about the story of the woman.

233
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,920
Don't be in a hurry.

234
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,760
She has a big relationship with that legendary home run.

235
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,740
The new home run

236
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,320
Here, Kankichi.

237
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,320
Wow, Huga's autographed ball.

238
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,140
Huga said thank you for always supporting me.

239
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,680
I can brag about the cross 12.

240
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,100
I thought I'd give it to you now.

241
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,900
That's right. It's almost time.

242
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,840
What?

243
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,700
Yayoi, I'm going to quit this season.

244
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,300
What?

245
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,660
I'm going to quit this season.

246
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,720
Why?

247
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,280
I'm going to get married.

248
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,380
With who?

249
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,860
With that person.

250
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,020
Huh?

251
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,500
Huga?

252
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,280
Number 4, third, Huga, number 0.

253
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,680
I'm sorry, Kankichi.

254
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,480
I was going to say it sooner.

255
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,000
What's wrong with you, Huga?

256
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,760
He did it!

257
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,220
It's a comeback.

258
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,720
Good job, Huga.

259
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,580
You're playing well.

260
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,480
On that day.

261
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,300
I decided to Years out of this position.

262
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,280
What!?

263
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,960
Episode 5

264
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,660
Number 4, Third, Hyuga.

265
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,720
Number 0.

266
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,480
Let's do this, Hyuga!

267
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,180
It's a reverse!

268
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,440
If that kid doesn't show up, it'll be a big deal.

269
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,480
She hasn't shown up lately, has she?

270
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,680
Yeah.

271
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,720
It seems she liked you.

272
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,800
She was shocked to learn that you were getting married.

273
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,120
You're so stupid, Daimai.

274
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,960
It's a 8-loss draw.

275
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,400
Hyuga's not a hit again.

276
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,340
How about we go to the Tokyo Stadium this evening to get some katsu?

277
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,800
If you want to go, you can go on your own.

278
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,680
I'm not going.

279
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,500
But I've decided not to go again.

280
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,960
You were so loud the other day that you said you'd take me every night.

281
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,280
Daimai, you're so...

282
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,960
Hyuga, you're so...

283
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,140
You're going to cheer me on even if I die, aren't you?

284
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:52,900
Here.

286
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,560
It's Hyuga!

287
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,600
I told you I don't like Hyuga.

288
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,060
That Hyuga is coming to the store!

289
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,680
What?

290
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,400
He's serious.

291
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,620
You're Kankichi, aren't you?

292
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,520
W-Why do you know about him?

293
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,620
Because he always supports me on the bench.

294
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,520
And I've heard about you.

295
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,520
Do you have time?

296
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,660
How about a football game?

297
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,160
Why don't you try it?

298
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,960
You're throwing a good ball.

299
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,540
I can see that.

300
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,200
I don't want to be a professional baseball player.

301
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,720
I don't like professional baseball players.

302
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,520
Look at the ball.

303
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,720
Kankichi, how are you?

304
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,980
I haven't seen you lately, and I'm very lonely.

305
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,900
Show me your happy face again.

306
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,740
Yayoi wants you to bless our marriage.

307
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,380
Can you accept our marriage?

308
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,020
I'll make you happy.

309
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,640
I'll make you happy.

310
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,360
Can you believe me?

311
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,600
Even though you didn't score 20, you're a professional baseball player.

312
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,320
How can I make you happy?

313
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,920
All right, I'll do it.

314
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,600
The last match will be held in Tokyo Stadium in two weeks.

315
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,760
It's the last match for you, Yayoi.

316
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,640
I'll make you hit the home run in that match.

317
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,220
What?

318
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,060
That's impossible.

319
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,380
Yes, it's impossible.

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,380
It's absolutely impossible.

321
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,780
It's absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.

322
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,680
It's a promise between a man and a man.

323
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,560
Yes, it's a promise between a man and a man.

324
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,980
Kankichi?

325
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,400
I saw the trash.

326
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,520
I won't admit it if you don't hit me.

327
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,580
Yes.

328
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,720
What?

329
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:24,900
Ahh!

330
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,400
Hyuga Kenji was injured for 2 months.

331
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,420
What are you going to do, Kankichi?

332
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,540
This is the last match of the year.

333
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,860
Are you going or not?

334
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm going.

335
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,200
You go first.

336
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,220
I have to go somewhere.

337
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,300
I have to go somewhere.

338
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,100
No, just 5 minutes.

339
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,840
Hyuga is still in a bad shape.

340
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,620
Yeah.

341
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,400
Oh, Hyuga!

342
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,120
No way...

343
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,080
Now, the 9th round is coming to an end.

344
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,280
It's a big deal.

345
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,760
It's a two-out, but it's a full-time game.

346
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,100
The score is 3 points.

347
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,900
If it goes out, it's a comeback.

348
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,240
Daimai can finish this season with a white star.

349
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,760
But...

350
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,980
The order of the game is terrible.

351
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,340
The next batter is the pitcher, Sakai.

352
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,460
If Hyuga was here at a time like this...

353
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,580
Damn it!

354
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,320
I've been chasing him all this way.

355
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,800
Coach!

356
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,040
Please use me.

357
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,920
Hyuga!

358
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,680
But...

359
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,260
But you're in good shape.

360
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,560
I'm fine with a big hit.

361
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,720
Please, coach!

362
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,660
I got it.

363
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,740
Is it a big hit here?

364
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,520
But...

365
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:47,700
But...

366
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,060
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,520
The weak point on the bench...

368
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,940
I should have played well, but...

369
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,920
It's a stand-off.

370
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,160
Yes!

371
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,840
Daimai Orions' batter, Sakai...

372
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,760
Pinch hitter, Hyuga...

373
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,260
Cebang Go, zero.

374
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,720
As I expected.

375
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
This is a surprise.

376
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,120
In this situation,

377
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,540
A supposed to be hospitalized...

378
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,420
Hyuga is coming!

379
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,920
What a surprise.

380
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,520
A miraculous recovery, let's say.

381
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,420
But...

382
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,080
The opponent pitcher has suddenly turned in from the 9th hole.

383
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,580
The ace of the South Pole, Stanker.

384
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,560
Will he be able to defeat the dark-haired Hyuga?

385
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,460
Play!

386
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,760
Stanker.

387
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,940
From the set position, the 9th hole.

388
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,600
He threw it!

389
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,340
Strike!

390
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,940
The 5th ball is in the middle!

391
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Hyuga can't make it!

392
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,360
The 1st ball is a game.

393
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,260
I knew it.

394
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,940
It's the end.

395
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,860
Everyone!

396
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,220
Kankichi.

397
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,600
Hyuga is standing in the corner with his body in pain.

398
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,800
Don't cheer him up here!

399
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,160
When are you going to cheer him up?

400
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,580
Let's go!

401
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,680
Play!

402
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:05,420
Play!

403
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,060
Hyuga!

404
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,880
How many times do I have to say it?

405
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,140
Play!

406
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,680
Play!

407
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,100
Hyuga!

408
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,620
How many times do I have to say it?

409
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,060
Play!

410
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,700
Kankichi.

411
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,900
I won!

412
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,860
I won!

413
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,660
Hyuga!

414
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
The stand is a tremendous support.

415
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,360
Can Hyuga respond to this voice?

416
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,860
Stanker!

417
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,920
He has become the 2nd ball!

418
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,220
For Yagai.

419
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,860
For Yagai.

420
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,040
For Yagai.

421
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,360
For Kankichi.

422
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,440
For Kankichi.

423
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,160
For Kankichi.

424
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,880
For Kankichi.

425
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:52,960
For Kankichi.

426
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,680
For Kankichi.

427
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,180
For Kankichi.

428
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,060
For Kankichi.

429
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,900
For Kankichi.

430
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,540
For Kankichi.

431
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,100
For Kankichi.

432
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,640
For Kankichi.

433
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,980
That's what I'll do.

434
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,220
I'll get him.

435
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,580
Never forget that.

436
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,340
I'll be sure to do it for Kankichi.

437
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,240
See? You too!

438
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,560
Amazing! Amazing!

439
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,160
I've never seen such an amazing home run!

440
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,700
It's a promise made by men.

441
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,760
Sis!

442
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,480
Yayoi!

443
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,740
Mr. Detective!

444
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,380
Thank you! Thank you!

445
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,440
You're the best, Mr. Hyuga!

446
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,160
Yay!

447
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,240
The home run of Mr. Detective Hyuga

448
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,560
was a legend at a distance of 200 meters.

449
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,060
He was an amazing guy.

450
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,240
Your father was Mr. Hyuga Kenichi.

451
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,640
Why did you say my name?

452
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,580
It came to my mind when we first met.

453
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,080
You looked just like Mr. Hyuga when you were young.

454
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,520
You were a slugger who was in the 9th grade of college.

455
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,820
Then will you be a professional?

456
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,220
Like your father?

457
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,800
Certainly, I've been invited by several clubs.

458
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,740
But I don't have the confidence to be a legendary batter like my father.

459
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,620
You idiot!

460
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,080
Your father was amazing not because he made a legend.

461
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,020
He risked his life to keep his promise.

462
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,540
To keep his promise with this cheeky kid.

463
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,740
A legend is a result of doing your best to do something.

464
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,880
A legend is a result of doing your best to do something.

465
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,920
A legend is a result of doing your best to do something.

466
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,660
Hey, Mr. Ryo!

467
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,980
Everyone is here!

468
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,660
Okay, the game begins!

469
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,260
Ryo!

470
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,800
Mr. Ryo, please let me play this game.

471
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,480
I'll do my best to do a home run!

472
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,020
Okay, it's a promise!

473
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,200
Not only me, but Junpei, Kappei and Nakagawa and Reiko.

474
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,100
Yes, sir.

475
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,000
Go for a home run!

476
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,620
It's a promise!

477
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,920
Good!

478
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:28,980
Amazing!

479
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,500
As expected of a college-class swagger!

480
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,220
I do it!

481
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,360
We did it!

482
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,540
It's his turn.

483
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,560
He is the right one for the owner.

484
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,860
Besides, the treasure is important.

485
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,820
