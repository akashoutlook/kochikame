1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:00,900
"The End"

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,740
"The End"

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,320
"The End"

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,100
"Buchaa!"

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,020
"Today is the day I'll have to put up with this!"

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,100
"Neeee!"

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,940
"Did you know that?"

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,160
"Ryo-chan, what are you doing?"

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,440
"You can't tell?"

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,980
"I'm trying to get my heart out to the manager who's always here."

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,280
"You made this diorama just for that?"

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,420
"I don't have that much time, either."

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,240
"I made this tank first, but then I wanted a diorama that would be the background."

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,960
"That's where I made this exit."

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,040
"If I didn't have the manager, it wouldn't have started."

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,720
"You're out of your mind. You have plenty of time."

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:51,920
"No!"

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,720
"Creating a plastic model requires the level of determination and concentration that you can't even imagine."

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,940
"Look at this! This is a diorama that's been reproduced to the fullest extent!"

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,520
"It's really well done."

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,680
"Isn't it?"

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,940
"But then, suddenly a tank comes in here!"

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,140
"That's terrible!"

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,660
"Captain Nigel!"

25
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,160
"Go, the tank of justice!"

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,140
"Go, the tank of justice!"

27
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,480
"Go, the tank of justice!"

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,160
"Go, the tank of justice!"

29
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,020
"Go, the tank of justice!"

30
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,740
"Crap, crap."

31
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,220
"Nigel, do you always do this?"

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,740
"Look at this!"

33
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,780
"Looks like you're having a lot of fun."

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,260
"Captain!"

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,740
"Ryotsu!"

36
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,900
"You're a jerk!"

37
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,060
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"

38
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,660
"You're making such a stupid thing while you're working, and you're making something like this!"

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,780
"Aah! My diorama..."

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,740
"From now on, you are not allowed to make any plastic models in this station!"

41
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,300
"No way..."

42
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,900
"When watching TV, please brighten the room and look away."

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,000
"Goodbye..."

44
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,000
"Goodbye..."

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,180
"Goodbye..."

46
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,940
"Who have no money, come to me!"

47
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,460
"Come!"

48
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,680
"I have none, so don't worry!"

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,200
"Look at the blue sky..."

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,520
"And the white clouds..."

51
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,300
"You will make something..."

52
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,440
I wonder if it will work

53
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,940
I know, I know, I know

54
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,760
If you understand, come to me quietly

55
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,300
Follow me!

56
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,000
Are you calling me, Inspector?

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,740
Actually, something terrible has happened

58
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,000
Terrible?

59
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,380
What?

60
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,300
What is that?

61
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,560
Actually,

62
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,260
I want you to build this within two weeks

63
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,060
This is the model of the 50 towers in the Holy Land

64
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,580
That's right

65
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,760
If I don't complete this within two weeks, I will...

66
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,240
Don't tell me there is something serious that we can't tell you

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,300
That's right, I'm sure there is

68
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,280
Please leave it to me, Inspector

69
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,740
I will take responsibility for this

70
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,980
Oh, I see

71
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm counting on you

72
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,840
That look on Inspector's face

73
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,340
That's not fair

74
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,840
But I have never built anything like this

75
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,880
So, what should I do?

76
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,520
That's right

77
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,940
Excuse me

78
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,520
May I come in, Director?

79
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:01,820
Yes, I am

80
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,600
Actually, I want you to build this

81
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,680
What?

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,660
This?

83
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,740
That's right

84
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,460
I will complete this within two weeks

85
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,380
I'll tell you, if we don't complete this, there is no tomorrow

86
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,120
It's okay

87
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Just leave it to me

88
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm counting on you

89
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,080
Are you calling me, Director?

90
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,120
Actually, I want you to assemble this

91
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,620
What? This?

92
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,660
I've never made anything like this

93
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm not saying I want you to assemble it

94
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,620
Look, your subordinate is here

95
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,480
A person who is good at this

96
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,240
What? Is it about Ryotsu?

97
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,960
That's right

98
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,860
He doesn't have this kind of model

99
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,480
Nothing's wrong with that, right?

100
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,920
Why don't you leave it to Ryotsu?

101
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,920
We cannot make a model in the wyr office

102
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,260
N-no way!

103
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,960
A favor from me?

104
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,560
Please, Ohara

105
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,860
That's an urgent request from the director

106
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,800
If this is not finished, both you and I will…

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,060
No way!

108
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,840
He would have forgotten

109
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,280
There's something we don't know about this case.

110
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,860
If we don't do something about this, we won't be able to make a living.

111
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,940
Or rather, we might lose our jobs starting tomorrow.

112
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,660
Do you understand?

113
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,500
Yes, I do.

114
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,920
Ryo, you're still hiding something?

115
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,100
Of course.

116
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,940
I'm not giving up just because the chief told me to.

117
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,980
Let's make it.

118
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,240
Ryo!

119
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,160
Ryo!

120
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,020
This is the gift from the goddess who came out after dropping a pencil in the pond.

121
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,340
I'll give you a big mission.

122
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,920
Build this.

123
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,460
What is this?

124
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,480
It's a model of a 50-story tower.

125
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,700
This is a wooden model.

126
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,200
It's a real wooden model with a size of more than 1 meter.

127
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,960
This is the big mission.

128
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,140
Is this really a big mission?

129
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,540
Exactly.

130
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,400
That's why I'm asking you to do it.

131
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,180
Only a fool like me can do this.

132
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,460
Fool?

133
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:31,900
This is a request from the chief.

134
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,700
Do it well, Ryo-tsu.

135
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,400
Ryo-tsu, you'll give me a 3?

136
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,280
Why do I have to give you a 3?

137
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,640
I see.

138
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,360
Well, thank you for your hard work.

139
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,320
I understand.

140
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,560
Please, Ryo-tsu.

141
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,460
Ryo-tsu-san...

142
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,360
Huh?

143
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,300
Ryo-tsu-san...

144
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,080
Hmm, I can't hear you well.

145
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,020
Ryo-tsu-san!

146
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,520
Yes, it's common sense to add "san" when you ask for something.

147
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,780
Do you understand, Ohara-kun?

148
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,560
I understand, Ryo-tsu-san.

149
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,000
Please.

150
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,200
But I'm also busy with something.

151
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,580
Ah, how was the schedule?

152
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,940
I slept at 12:00, had snacks at 3:00, took a bath at 6:00, and ate at 7:00.

153
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,520
Hmm, it's a hard schedule.

154
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,140
How much do you want?

155
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,180
Huh? What did you say?

156
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,260
I'm asking how much you want!

157
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,240
I don't like it, Chief. It's like I'm blackmailing you.

158
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,920
It's a complete blackmail.

159
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,140
The price of this model is 85,000 yen without tax.

160
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,180
What's wrong with that?

161
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,260
I've heard that before.

162
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,900
The finished product was sold for 700,000 yen.

163
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,840
700,000 yen?

164
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,720
A complete model is a waste of 1 million yen.

165
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,040
That's how high the production technology is.

166
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,300
I, I didn't know.

167
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,300
But it's a request from the Chief, so I'll make it for 50,000 yen.

168
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,220
Really? Thank you.

169
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,240
At first, I thought it was expensive, but it's cheap.

170
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,380
Ryo-chan, you're good at gambling.

171
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,340
Don't worry, Chief.

172
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,720
Leave everything to me.

173
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,540
I'm counting on you, Ryo-chan.

174
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,100
Huh?

175
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,160
Ryo-chan.

176
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,260
Yes.

177
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,420
Hahaha.

178
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,060
Oh, I see.

179
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,380
I'm glad you're going to accept it.

180
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,460
I'm proud to have a subordinate like you.

181
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,840
I'm sure you're not mad at me for asking you to do it.

182
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,580
I'm looking forward to it.

183
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,660
Hahaha.

184
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,220
Good morning.

185
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,720
Good morning.

186
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,380
Is the production of 50 towers going well?

187
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,360
It seems so.

188
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,120
Oh, finally, the assembly.

189
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,240
As expected, the hand is good.

190
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,380
Hey, Chief.

191
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,760
I've replaced this money.

192
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,580
Oh?

193
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,960
150,000 yen?

194
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,320
What is this?

195
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,640
It's a cost.

196
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,700
Why is it so expensive?

197
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,720
I bought everything I needed for modeling.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,680
Back set, electric drill, gas burner for dirt.

199
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:25,600
CD, electronic keyboard, potatoes, canister, whiskey, shampoo, pants, soap, toothbrush, manga, game software, and cup noodles.

200
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:25,900
Wait!

201
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,060
In the second half, there are only unnecessary things.

202
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,080
I won't pay for such a thing.

203
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,520
Then, do you assemble this yourself?

204
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,240
Huh?

205
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,780
Oh, I remembered my business.

206
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,060
I'll go home.

207
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,080
Wait.

208
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,580
I understand.

209
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,540
I'll do as you say.

210
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,420
So, please keep working.

211
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,020
As long as you understand, it's okay.

212
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,520
It's a work that requires a lot of effort.

213
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,440
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm sorry.

215
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,380
After all, you're the only one who can make it.

216
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,040
I'll ask you for it.

217
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,860
I don't know how long this will take to complete.

218
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,260
I feel sorry for you, Chief.

219
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,640
If you need anything, please feel free to tell me.

220
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,020
I'll arrange it right away.

221
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,940
I'm getting a little hungry.

222
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,260
I want to eat eel.

223
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,320
Okay.

224
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,600
Nakagawa, it's time to go to the eel house.

225
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,460
Yes.

226
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,060
Oh, the old guy from Ueno.

227
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,720
Don't mess with me.

228
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,060
You can't go from Ueno to Kameari.

229
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,500
You can just go by bicycle, Chief.

230
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,540
You...

231
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,940
I'm the one who's noisy about the taste.

232
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,280
I understand.

233
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,100
I'll go buy it.

234
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,480
It was delicious.

235
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,360
I just went to the chief's house on purpose.

236
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:42,720
Okay.

237
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm a little stiff now.

238
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,520
I want someone to rub it.

239
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,680
Someone.

240
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,640
No, I'm sorry.

241
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,640
I was a little stiff.

242
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,600
Oh, my God.

243
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,620
Oh, no.

244
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,220
I have to do it again.

245
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,120
I don't know if I can make it in time.

246
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,840
It's getting dangerous.

247
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,420
Please do your best, Mr. Ryotsu.

248
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,820
Call me a teacher from now on.

249
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,380
Good morning.

250
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,020
Good morning.

251
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,020
What?

252
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,160
You're still here?

253
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,000
That's...

254
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,140
I'm going to go on a local tour to make it more realistic.

255
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,320
Please pay for transportation and other expenses.

256
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,060
Chief.

257
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,260
Ryotsu.

258
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,520
Local tour?

259
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,740
That means...

260
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,980
No way.

261
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,960
He went to Nara.

262
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,940
I'm sorry.

263
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,800
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,420
I didn't see you earlier.

266
00:11:51,780 --> 00:12:00,100
I will let you go back to Nara and give it back to me as you completed it.

267
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,080
...

268
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,680
It isn't easy even for me to help you.

269
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,260
Good morning.

270
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,020
He's chocolate�전ero.

271
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,360
It was nothing strange.

272
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,160
Now that we're in a usual room, I want to her.

273
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:09,880
Why are you doing this?

274
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:10,880
I've 밖에.

275
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,860
Oh, come on.

276
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,780
I don't like coaching when you're taking stuff.

277
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,440
Where are you going?

278
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,560
To the director's office.

279
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,320
The director's office?

280
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,840
I can't stand it anymore!

281
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,980
Calm down, Ohara.

282
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,680
Can you calm down?

283
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,520
You're the only one who can't build that 50-storey building.

284
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,880
So you can do whatever you want.

285
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,980
I got it.

286
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,760
I'll talk to the director for now.

287
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,120
Director?

288
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,900
Excuse me.

289
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,800
The director wants to talk to you.

290
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,660
What?

291
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,040
You can't build a 50-storey building?

292
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,660
I'm sorry.

293
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,760
But according to the report,

294
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,820
it's pretty difficult.

295
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,840
Oh no!

296
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,020
This is bad!

297
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,920
I have to complete it!

298
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,920
That serious look.

299
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,740
There must be something serious about this case.

300
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,720
Is it a national disaster?

301
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,900
Is the future of the Japanese police in danger?

302
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,880
What?

303
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,680
I understand, director.

304
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,300
Please leave everything to me.

305
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,480
Please.

306
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,360
Please complete the 50-storey building.

307
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,360
I see.

308
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,420
So the director is the director.

309
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,540
This is getting interesting.

310
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,260
This is a masterpiece.

311
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,820
Ryotsu.

312
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
If you think I'm always on the front lines,

313
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,140
you're wrong.

314
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,720
If the 50-storey building is not completed,

315
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,760
the director will be in trouble.

316
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,340
Why?

317
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,480
And the director is the police officer.

318
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,060
So the police can't do anything about it.

319
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,680
What?

320
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,120
The police officer?

321
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,600
That's ridiculous.

322
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,180
Hello.

323
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,780
Yes.

324
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,400
Please wait a moment.

325
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Director, the phone is ringing.

326
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,340
Who is it?

327
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,260
Well, it's...

328
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,420
Yes, I'm Ohara.

329
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,680
M-Mr. Police Officer!

330
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,620
Yes. No.

331
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,820
That's not it.

332
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,360
No.

333
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,320
But...

334
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,200
Yes.

335
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,800
I understand.

336
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,160
Yes.

337
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,820
Excuse me.

338
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,940
The police officer's nervous look.

339
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,280
There are some important things behind this.

340
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,840
That means,

341
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,680
if you mess this up,

342
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
the director, the chief, the chief,

343
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,740
and the chief may be fired.

344
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,960
What a shame!

345
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,880
Oh, I get it.

346
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
I get it.

347
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,540
Please do something about it,

348
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,460
Mr. Ryotsu.

349
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,640
Leave it to me, Ohara.

350
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,020
Hey, you're too much.

351
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,180
Don't you think?

352
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,660
I'm just a senior.

353
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,960
I'm just a senior.

354
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,680
But if you do this,

355
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,600
the 50 towers won't be completed

356
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:11,700
no matter how long it takes.

357
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,660
The chief will be used to do it.

358
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,780
I can't believe that.

359
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:16,900
I can't believe that.

360
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,640
I can't believe that.

361
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,080
Mr. Ryotsu?

362
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,440
What else do you need?

363
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,600
What else do you need?

364
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:20,640
Well,

365
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,780
I'd like to eat about 20 bread

366
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,300
from the Urashimaya.

367
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,320
I'd like to eat about 20 bread

368
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,500
from the Urashimaya.

369
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,740
Yes, I'll buy it right away.

370
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:31,980
Chief,

371
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,660
I have something to tell you.

372
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:33,800
I...

373
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,700
I need to talk to you about something.

374
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,780
I need to talk to you about something.

375
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,020
The promo champion?

376
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,080
Yes.

377
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,500
The world's best Promo Contest

378
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,340
regional champion

379
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,320
won in Russia.

380
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,300
won in Russia.

381
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,320
We called you to Japan immediately.

382
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,200
We called you to Japan immediately.

383
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,220
We'll arrive in Narita tomorrow.

384
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,920
If you leave the 50 tower to him,

385
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,700
I think he'll be satisfied with it.

386
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,560
I think he'll be satisfied with it.

387
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,500
I think he'll be satisfied with it.

388
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,560
Wait for us, Ryotsu.

389
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,180
Your kingdom will end today!

390
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,520
Nakagawa...

391
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,720
I have to do something about this.

392
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,260
I see. Someone's here to welcome you.

393
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:22,820
Welcome!

394
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,860
The world's first-place winner of the Promo Contest,

395
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,100
Alexey Pramoski!

396
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,000
Who's that?

397
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,520
I don't have a name to call you!

398
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,980
Hey, Pramoski!

399
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,400
I'm asking you to participate in the Promo Contest!

400
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,000
Promo Contest?

401
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,840
That's right. I'm a little experienced too.

402
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,200
I won't lose to you!

403
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,860
Interesting! I'll be your opponent!

404
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,660
Alright! This contest will be decided by the completion of 1/250 Mobile Force Gungall!

405
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,740
I'm looking forward to it!

406
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,560
Let's start the Promo Fight!

407
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,200
Ready, go!

408
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

409
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,520
I'm going!

410
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,580
Look! My Gungalls have shining eyes!

411
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,880
Hahahaha! No one will be surprised by that simple modification!

412
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,480
Watch my moves!

413
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,000
By modifying the joints, you can take the pose you want.

414
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,200
And the arms will fly!

415
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,020
Whoa!

416
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,700
And the legs will fly!

417
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,620
Whoa!

418
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,460
And even the neck too!

419
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,460
Whoa!

420
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,240
And then his body will fly away!

421
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,260
I... I lost...

422
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,040
It's about time you're here...

423
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,340
Hey, Mr. Plamoski! Where are you?

424
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,200
N-No... My Pramo...

425
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,260
Mr. Plamoski! What's wrong?

426
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,320
I'm still immature.

427
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,880
I'll go back to the country and fix it.

428
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,540
W-Wait! What happened?

429
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,400
Huh? You went home?

430
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,580
That's right. I was a little upset.

431
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,840
Well, it can't be helped. Let's hit someone else.

432
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,380
Hey, hey, hey! You're the sculptor, Jin Zoukei, right?

433
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,780
Let's have a fair fight!

434
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,080
I-I lost...

435
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,600
Hmph! Not yet!

436
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,220
I'll go back to the country and fix it!

437
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,580
I didn't know you had such a trick!

438
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,640
I was a little upset!

439
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,540
I-I can't believe you used that kid's Pramo!

440
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,820
It's 300 million years too early to beat me!

441
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,720
What? You all went home?

442
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,900
But it's all right.

443
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,580
I'll come back today.

444
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,920
Really?

445
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,620
Yes. Kei-chan is on guard this time, so we'll be fine.

446
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,300
Oh, I see.

447
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,420
Good. The country of Ryotsu is here, too.

448
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,600
Mr. Modera.

449
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,880
Please take care of the 50 towers.

450
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,740
Leave it to me.

451
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,940
I'll recreate the real 50 towers.

452
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,440
What's that?

453
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,220
Huh?

454
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,440
Oh, Senpai!

455
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,920
You're the world Pramo Contest Champion.

456
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,480
Ken Modera, right?

457
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,580
I don't see a way to make you have a big fight in Japan!

458
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,500
We're going to have a proper Pramo match!

459
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,840
I see.

460
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,340
So the whole world has been driven away by you.

461
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,860
Mr. Modera, this is another ship port for now.

462
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,120
No, no, no.

463
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,060
If you want to get challenged and then escape, you're not qualified.

464
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,160
Fine. I accept the challenge.

465
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,140
What the hell are those people?

466
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,020
I won!

467
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,980
What's the plan?

468
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,260
I'll take the sign!

469
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,260
I'm a young man, Ryozu Kankichi!

470
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,040
Ah!

471
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,060
It's one win, one loss.

472
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
I don't have any more enemies in the country.

473
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,680
Senpai!

474
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,920
You're back again.

475
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,080
I won't lose no matter who comes.

476
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Are you sure you want me to do that?

477
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,480
Ryo, have you forgotten something important?

478
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,660
Important?

479
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,820
It's a model, the 50-toward tower!

480
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,940
Oh, no!

481
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,340
I forgot about it when I was worried about the competition!

482
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,940
Tomorrow is the final round. What are you going to do?

483
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,540
If you don't finish it, I'm sorry for not doing it.

484
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,520
I'm sorry for not doing it?

485
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,700
Idiot!

486
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,060
No! I'll finish it by tomorrow!

487
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,380
It's like a kid who played too much during the summer vacation.

488
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,220
I can do it if I do it.

489
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,300
It was such a sad day.

490
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,300
I did it!

491
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,220
I managed to make it!

492
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,740
All I have to do is take this.

493
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:26,900
Ah!

494
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,240
Hi.

495
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,520
Ah, hello, director.

496
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,420
I just finished!

497
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,480
Oh, I see.

498
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,280
You've hook it up.

499
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,460
Then, take it to the head office by 1 o'clock today.

500
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,000
I'll be sure to bring it, so don't worry.

501
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,500
I'll be sure to bring it, so don't worry.

502
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,100
I'll be sure to bring it, so don't worry.

503
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,180
I'm sure you're a professional at protecting the end of the line.

504
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sure you're a professional at protecting the end of the line.

505
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,440
I'm sure you're a professional at protecting the end of the line.

506
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,060
I'm sure you're a professional at protecting the end of the line.

507
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,700
I'm sure you're a professional at protecting the end of the line.

508
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,880
I'm sure you're a professional at protecting the end of the line.

509
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,060
I'm sure you're a professional at protecting the end of the line.

510
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,710
I'm sure you're a professional at protecting the end of the line.

511
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,160
I'm sure you're a professional at protecting the end of the line.

512
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,020
I can't wait. I'll make it, but I can't hurry any more.

513
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,860
I can't wait. I'll make it, but I can't hurry any more.

514
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,000
You've done it.

515
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,780
You should've seen it earlier.

516
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,920
You should've seen it earlier.

517
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,460
You haven't done it yet?

518
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,180
You haven't done it yet?

519
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,920
You still have some time.

520
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,540
Suddenly, I got a call.

521
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,360
Suddenly, I got a call.

522
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,100
Turning the Michelle in on the wrong order.

523
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,280
He said he'd use it to carry the statue.

524
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, I see.

525
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,020
He said it's fine.

526
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,020
It's fine.

527
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay.

528
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,600
No problem, Commander.

529
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,800
Huh?

530
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,180
That's definitely the 50th Tower!

531
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,300
It's finally here!

532
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,320
What is this?!

533
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,280
Isn't it the 50th Tower of the Real World?

534
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,300
Wow! It's a huge 50th Tower!

535
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,040
Grandpa! Thank you!

536
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,820
Huh?

537
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,360
"Thank you"?

538
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,860
When I asked my grandson what he wanted for his birthday present,

539
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,560
he said he wanted a 50th Tower.

540
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,040
He said he'd buy anything.

541
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,980
Didn't he say he had to prepare something for it?

542
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,080
I didn't hear that!

543
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,060
Here's your order.

544
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,760
I've sent it to you.

545
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,760
Please sign here.

546
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,140
Here you go!

547
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,540
Wait!

548
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,560
Shoot!

549
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,460
What the hell is this?!

550
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,260
Here's the next news.

551
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:39,920
Huh?

552
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,320
A strange event has occurred,

553
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,400
where the 50th Tower of Nara suddenly disappeared.

554
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,780
Who did this?

555
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,600
Or is it a natural phenomenon?

556
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,840
Or is it an unknown cosmic power?

557
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,220
The mystery is just getting deeper.

558
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,540
That's great!

559
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,860
It seems like your grandson is happy, too.

560
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,380
Isn't that great?

561
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,000
Well then...

562
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,940
You idiot!

563
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,100
I didn't mean to!

564
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,340
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

565
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:17,800
That's my son!

566
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,860
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

567
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,040
You idiot!

568
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,740
What's happening?!

569
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,500
Your little sense is horrible!

570
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,360
So ask your grandson!

571
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,760
Why?!

572
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:28,780
Ask your grandson!

573
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,760
How dare you use falsified knowledge to find me!

574
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,640
I heard you sister!

575
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,080
He's not the only one!

576
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,500
Now is not everything

577
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,000
Don't worry too much

578
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,920
Even if you lie and cheat a little

579
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,720
You are sometimes helping someone

580
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,560
Baby, do you know me?

581
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm heading to tomorrow

582
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,820
Nice breath

583
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,280
Don't be rotten

584
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,520
I'll do what I do

585
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,220
Cute breath

586
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,020
It's hard to understand

587
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,440
I want to show it

588
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,740
It's better than looking down

589
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,300
Eve!

590
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,500
My brother is here!

591
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,080
I bought a baby castle

592
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,800
Eve is always a child

593
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,080
Do you have a story?

594
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,300
Get married!

595
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,360
Next time, Honda Shock Eve's marriage

596
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,160
I'll make you wet!

597
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,780
See you in the next video!
