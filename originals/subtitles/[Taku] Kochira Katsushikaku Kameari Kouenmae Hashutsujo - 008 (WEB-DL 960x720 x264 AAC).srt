It's come, it's come!

What a wonderful wedding!

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,760
Cheers!

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,520
Hey, we've come all the way to Ginza.

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,140
Let's go back to Kachidoki Bridge.

39
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,460
But the direction is the other way around.

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,300
What? You're not saying anything.

41
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,860
I understand.

42
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,260
It's Ryo-chan.

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,060
Ryo-chan, we're going to Kachidoki Bridge.

44
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,880
Ryo-chan, we've arrived. Wake up.

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,700
You should have told us to go by ourselves.

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,460
Kei-chan, stop the car!

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,080
What's wrong?

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,100
There's a man on the bridge.

49
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,220
He's not a ghost, is he?

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,120
Where are you, Reiko?

51
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,960
I think I saw him on the bridge.

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,440
It seems there were no accidents near the bridge.

68
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,760
Kachigukiboshi?

69
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,500
But why is there a person in such a place?

70
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,880
Good morning.

71
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,800
Senpai, you're lucky.

72
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,480
The chief is in a good mood this morning.

73
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,940
Lucky.

74
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,740
Good morning.

75
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,380
I think I drank a little too much.

76
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,500
Idiot!

77
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,420
What do you think you're doing?

78
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,920
Don't yell at me.

79
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,900
My head is so hot.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,700
Come here.

81
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,260
I'll squeeze you.

82
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm not a stray cat.

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,100
Hey, where are you in such a good mood?

84
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,820
Hurry up and come here.

85
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,700
What's wrong?

86
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,720
He was in such a good mood.

87
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,340
Idiot!

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,940
It's a illegal parking lot.

89
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,860
Good morning.

90
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,400
Oh, it's a police car.

91
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,020
That's Sapporo No.

92
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,100
Yes.

93
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,640
I've been driving next to Kachigukiboshi since last night.

94
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,500
Kachigukiboshi?

95
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,100
Since last night?

96
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,720
Yes.

97
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,480
A man in white clothes was driving by.

98
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,000
White clothes?

99
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,360
Could it be last night's car?

100
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,000
Hello, can you tell me who owns this car?

101
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,520
The No. is Sapporo.

102
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,100
So it wasn't an illegal parking lot.

103
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,880
Is this an incident?

104
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,120
No, it's still a car.

105
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,560
It's not like it's a man's car.

106
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,200
Yes. Sapporo City, Toyohiakku, yes.

107
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,140
Shiratori, white bird, pure water, Shiratori Jun.

108
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,520
Thank you very much.

109
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,840
Did something happen to Shiratori Jun?

110
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,280
Yes.

111
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

112
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,400
Do you know him, Pyo-chan?

113
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:09,980
Yes.

114
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,600
He's my friend from middle school.

115
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,820
But it was only for a short time.

116
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,540
He left his car near Kachidoki Bridge and disappeared somewhere.

117
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,000
Kachidoki Bridge?

118
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,960
Oh, right. He came to see the bridge.

119
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,500
The bridge?

120
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,940
What do you mean, Senpai?

121
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,100
Yes. That was when I was a cute junior high school student.

122
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,140
Hello, Kankichi.

123
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,680
Yes.

124
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,480
Wow.

125
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,620
That's awesome.

126
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,320
Yes.

127
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,080
Big spin, medium speed.

128
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,040
My eyes are spinning.

129
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,920
Kankichi!

130
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,580
Who told you to do the big spin?

131
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,280
It's a service.

132
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,620
Kankichi, you're awesome.

133
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,040
Jun, did you have fun?

134
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,200
Next time, I'll show you something even more flashy.

135
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,800
Kankichi, you're awesome. The next time, I'll show you something even more flashy.

136
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,180
Kankichi!

137
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,200
Yes!

138
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,880
Next time, I'll show you something even more silly.

139
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,140
Next time, I'll show you something even more trickier.

140
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,620
Hey, Jun, you went on a night trip, didn't you?

141
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,160
That's amazing!

142
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
But I couldn't see well because I'm so busy.

143
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,920
I went by bullet train.

144
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,200
Have you ride "Tonkichi"?

145
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,300
Soldiers have never been on it before.

146
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,500
Would you like some tea?

147
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,940
Yes.

148
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,400
Food for everyone please.

149
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,040
Oh, it's cake again!

150
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,800
Oh, it's cake again!

151
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,380
Sorry for always having to do this, auntie.

152
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,540
It's okay.

153
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,600
From now on, be good friends with Jun.

154
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,380
Okay.

155
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,020
Then, take your time.

156
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,460
When I'm watching the gym,

157
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,020
I don't feel bored at all when I'm watching Kan-chan and the others.

158
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,880
Kan-Kishi's torii is only about energy.

159
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,580
Damn you!

160
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,440
Next time, I'll show you my back.

161
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,980
Instead, show me again during the test.

162
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,000
My vision is 2.5 and it's for the tanning.

163
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,340
Hahaha!

164
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:17,920
Hahaha!

165
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,500
That's a really good book.

166
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,380
Did you read all of these?

167
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,400
Most of them.

168
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,240
I'll lend you one anytime.

169
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,160
We're not good at these kind of thick books.

170
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,940
Right, Tonkichi?

171
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,140
Yeah, just the textbook is enough.

172
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,780
That's right.

173
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,020
I think this is interesting.

174
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,280
Japanese...

175
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,660

183
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,840
Japanese...

184
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,100
Japanese...

185
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,300
Japanese...

186
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,280
Japanese...

187
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,520
Japanese...

188
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,700
Japanese...

189
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:08,840
Japanese...

190
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,120
That's the bridge over the Sumida River.

191
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,680
Wow.

192
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,120
You made me remember it in elementary school.

193
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,900
What I like the most is the Kachidoki Bridge.

194
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,580
It moves like a gaga.

195
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,220
I want to see it.

196
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,240
You've never seen it?

197
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,920
I want to see it, but it's far away.

198
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,260
It's close. It's just over Ginza.

199
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,500
You stop the car and the bridge opens slowly.

200
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,740
When you look at the bridge, the road is like a wall.

201
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,040
It's very powerful.

202
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,040
I want to see it with my own eyes.

203
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,020
Let's go to Kachidoki Bridge.

204
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,740
It takes about 20 minutes by bicycle.

205
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,200
OK.

206
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,140
Let's go!

207
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,880
"Kachidoki Bridge"

208
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,560
"Kachidoki Bridge"

209
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,580
A large army of soldiers appears here.

210
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,360
Ta-da!

211
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,920
The bridge of Kachidoki Bridge

212
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,120
"Kachidoki Bridge"

213
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,480
"Kachidoki Bridge"

214
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,540
We're almost there.

215
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,720
The End

216
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,120
Look, over there!

217
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,220
That bridge opens!

218
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,240
It's perfect to look at from here!

219
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,720
I always buy bread and watch while eating.

220
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,420
Oh, the boat is here!

221
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,480
We did it! It opens!

222
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,880
There we go!

223
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,660
Gugugutta!

224
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,160
Huh?

225
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,260
It won't open.

226
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,680
That's strange. It should always open at noon.

227
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,640
What's wrong?

228
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:18,380
What? It won't open anymore?

229
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,900
It opened yesterday.

230
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,180
The Kado-kyo is no longer popular.

231
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,020
From now on, it's the era of land transport.

232
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,420
It's easier to carry water.

233
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,620
I didn't know that at all.

234
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,620
What?

235
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,780
The Kachidoki Bridge won't open anymore?

236
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,080
Once the station is decided, it won't open again.

237
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,900
The ones who are made to suffer by the flow of time are always the weak ones like us.

238
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,220
The Kachidoki Bridge

239
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,900
The Kachidoki Bridge

240
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,340
The Kachidoki Bridge

241
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,080
The Kachidoki Bridge

242
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,480
Tch. I came to see it. I'm disappointed.

243
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,600
I understand.

244
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,680
Jun, you were looking forward to it.

245
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,240
Don't lose your temper, Jun.

246
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,800
Kondo.

247
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,520
Yes!

248
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,300
Shibayama.

249
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,020
Yes!

250
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,140
Shiratori is a dead man.

251
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,900
Sensei, what's wrong with Jun?

252
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,120
He's sleeping with a fever.

253
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,000
He's sleeping with a fever.

254
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,860
I heard he was shocked when he heard about Kachidoki Bridge.

255
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,820
Shibayama.

256
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,800
Let's go back.

257
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,400
Yes.

258
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,320
What?

259
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,480
The weather is getting better.

260
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,460
I'm moving to Hokkaido where the air is nice.

261
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,100
I got along with everyone.

262
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,960
We're friends even if we go far away.

263
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,080
Yes.

264
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,880
That's right.

265
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,460
But...

266
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,480
There's only one thing left in my mind.

267
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,440
I couldn't see the Kachidoki Bridge.

268
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,780
I wanted to see it with everyone.

269
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,140
Jun, when are you going to Hokkaido?

270
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,700
The day after tomorrow.

271
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,060
That soon?

272
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,260
I see.

273
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,340
Jun moved.

274
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,680
That's too bad.

275
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,120
I can't eat such delicious cake for the rest of my life.

276
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,200
I'll come back to the zero point test again.

277
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,080
I'll come back to the zero point test again.

278
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,900
Jun, you were disappointed about the Kachidoki Bridge.

279
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,900
I wanted to show you the place where the bridge opens.

280
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,460
That's right.

281
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,940
I'll show you the place where the bridge opens.

282
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,900
What?

283
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,420
It's impossible.

284
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,840
We'll open it.

285
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,720
We'll open the bridge.

286
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,600
We'll open the bridge and show it to Jun.

287
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,380
What?

288
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,520
Kanchan.

289
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,940
What are you doing here?

290
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,700
Come with me.

291
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,120
I'll show you how to open a Kachidoki Bridge.

292
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:27,860
What?

293
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,900
How to open a Kachidoki Bridge?

294
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:29,920
Yes.

295
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,800
Hurry up.

296
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,140
Wait.

297
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,020
I'm going to change.

298
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,780
Over here.

299
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:38,860
Over here.

300
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,900
John, I'll be right back.

301
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,660
This is the best view.

302
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,340
Wait here, Jun.

303
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,500
Can we really open it?

304
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,400
Don't worry.

305
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,220
Leave it to us.

306
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,920
Let's go.

307
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,700
There are four towers in Kachidoki Bridge.

308
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,400
The only one with stairs is that tower.

309
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,660
That must be the driver's room.

310
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,260
I'll give you the bridge.

311
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,880
You two stop the car.

312
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,300
Okay.

313
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,260
It's as I thought it would be.

314
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,880
Here it is.

315
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,720
As I thought, it is locked.

316
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,220
However...

317
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,640
It's useless.

318
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,760
I'm good at opening.

319
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,140
Stop.

320
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,040
Stop.

321
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,680
Stop.

322
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,480
I'll open it.

323
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:56,860
I'll open it.

324
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,720
I can't.

325
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,500
I can't stop it at all.

326
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,780
This one too can't stop.

327
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,760
It's open.

328
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,760
I got it.

329
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,420
It's so crispy.

330
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,520
There are so many switches.

331
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,660
I guess I have to turn on the power.

332
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,500
How do I do it?

333
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,020
Stop!

334
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,140
Please stop!

335
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,020
Stop!

336
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,100
Stop!

337
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,040
Stop!

338
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,440
What are you doing?

339
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,860
Why did you stop the car?

340
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:52,740
Go!

341
00:15:54,020 --> 00:16:00,480
Mr. Hakushu, Mr. Omawari found us.

342
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,620
Sola, wait!

343
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,140
Sola, wait!

344
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,020
Mr. Hakushu, close the door!

345
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,480
Sola, open the door!

346
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,820
What are you going to do?

347
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,780
No! The car won't stop, and Mr. Omawari will find us.

348
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,380
The plan was too reckless. Let's stop it.

349
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,520
Idiot! Jun is waiting for you!

350
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,080
Will it really open?

351
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,200
Sola!

352
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,680
Sola!

353
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,460
How will you do it if you can open the door?

354
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,940
I give up!

355
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,060
Open it!

356
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,960
Please, get out of there.

357
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,100
What are you going to do, KhangKi?

358
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,340
I'm going to open the door.

359
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,560
Only this chance!

360
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,640
Good!

361
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,820
You are so nice.

362
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,800
Shut down the power!

363
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,880
Sola, don't touch it!

364
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,400
Sola!

365
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,460
Yankee!

366
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,120
The power is on!

367
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,700
Okay, put in all the switches!

368
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,320
Yes!

369
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,140
Gun, stop the car immediately!

370
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,580
Yes!

371
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,820
Stop it!

372
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,400
Stop it!

373
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,020
Open it!

374
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,520
Oh, the signal of the Kachidoki Bridge has arrived!

375
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,140
Impossible! That bridge should have been closed!

376
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,860
Move! The bridge will rise!

377
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,440
Oh, no!

378
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:34,580
Oh, no!

379
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,640
Please, move! The Kachidoki Bridge!

380
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:42,800
Stop it!

381
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,520
The Kachidoki Bridge is here!

382
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
The Kachidoki Bridge!

383
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,760
Open it!

384
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,160
The bridge is...

385
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,960
The Kachidoki Bridge is here!

386
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:34,420
The bridge is...

387
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,280
Open it! Open it!

388
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,120
Open it more!

389
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,740
Open it more!

390
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,240
The bridge is...

391
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,280
I knew it was real!

392
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,960
The Kachidoki Bridge is...

393
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,800
What is going on?

394
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,020
Idiot!

395
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,080
Please, return the signal!

396
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,630
Oh, no!

397
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:13,980
No, no, no!

398
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,480
No, no, no!

399
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,680
No, no, no!

400
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
No, no, no!

401
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,940
No, no, no!

402
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,180
Yes!

403
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,880
It's fully open!

404
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,140
It's fully open!

405
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,220
We did it!

406
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:35,920
Yes!

407
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,780
The Kachidoki Bridge is open!

408
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,020
It's like they are celebrating!

409
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,280
The bridge is open again?

410
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,600
The Kachidoki Bridge is not supposed to be like this, after all!

411
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,660
The Kachidoki Bridge is not supposed to be like this, after all!

412
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,640
It's because of Sumida's face!

413
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,040
It's really amazing!

414
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,680
It's more than I could imagine, Kan-chan!

415
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,500
I did it!

416
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,600
Did you see Jun?

417
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,760
Yes!

418
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,340
Yes!

419
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,420
Yes!

420
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,200
It's amazing, 3-B.

421
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,320
It's amazing, 3-B.

422
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,960
Enough, cut the bullshit!

423
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,500
Let's break!

424
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,280
He just 경찰ied the bridge!

425
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,380
Feeling the pressure...

426
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,480
I see the bridge!

427
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,000
Now, the bridge!

428
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,720
You can run!

429
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,860
I'm going!

430
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,120
Run!

431
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,520
I'm going!

432
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,040
Run!

433
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,320
Bye bye!

434
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,960
Hey! Hold your horses up and let's escape!

435
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,920
Gee, look at them!

436
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,040
Boss!

437
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,900
Help! Help!

438
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,320
Get him!

439
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,180
And then they swam to Hamarikyu, and then they ran away and came back.

440
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,780
Takami was watching the chaos of the Kachidoki Bridge.

441
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,220
It's been a mess for a long time.

442
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,120
I'm sure Jun was happy.

443
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,680
Of course. I can't forget the excited smile of that time.

444
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,840
But if Jun had left the car and climbed the Kachidoki Bridge...

445
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,560
Maybe...

446
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,520
That's impossible.

447
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,820
He was weak, but he was strong.

448
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,220
Excuse me.

449
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,600
The car in front...

450
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,900
Jun!

451
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,880
Kan-chan?

452
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,980
Why are you here?

453
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,940
He looks like a policeman.

454
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,660
Kan-chan is the police.

455
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:54,920
Are you serious?

456
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,440
Don't laugh. You're a criminal.

457
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,080
No, I was just thinking that the repairman would take me.

458
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,960
Oh, yeah.

459
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,320
This...

460
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,760
A professor?

461
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,600
You're here, Jun!

462
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,840
It's all thanks to Kan-chan.

463
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,900
I can't forget the day when he raised the bridge with his life.

464
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,560
Now he's designing the bridge.

465
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,380
He's designing the bridge.

466
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,640
Then, what made you climb the Kachidoki Bridge?

467
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,720
There was something I really wanted to find out.

468
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,360
Hm?

469
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,200
The Kachidoki Bridge is very good.

470
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,940
Oh, Chief!

471
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,100
That's my friend, Dr. Kouhaku.

472
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,860
Everyone told me about you, Ryo-tsu.

473
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,680
What? You heard about me?

474
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,340
Chief, you're acting strange.

475
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,380
Yeah.

476
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,680
I heard that you were hung up together when the bridge was raised.

477
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,140
You were hung up together when the bridge was raised.

478
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,560
That's right.

479
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,380
I remember that I was so nervous and worked so hard on my legs.

480
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,500
But at the end, I fell down and fell on the river.

481
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,620
Do you remember the policeman's face?

482
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,460
Of course.

483
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,760
He had such a strange look.

484
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,440
He had such thick eyebrows.

485
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,400
His nose was so long.

486
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,540
And he had such a big mouth.

487
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,800
I'd forget about that if I ever saw him again.

488
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,080
Ryo-chan.

489
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,000
What?

490
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,320
He had such a strange look.

491
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
What did he have?

492
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,600
He had such a strange look.

493
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,780
He had such a thin, thick eyebrows.

494
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,220
I-I can't believe it.

495
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:29,600
He had such a strange look.

496
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,180
He had such a strange look.

497
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,680
I'm that policeman!

498
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,060
I'm that policeman!

499
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:45,520
I'm that policeman!

500
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,480
I finally met the culprit of that riot.

501
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,840
Calm down, chief!

502
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,940
Hey, wait!

503
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,660
It's already an accident!

504
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,180
It's already an accident!

505
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,400
It's already an accident!

506
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,640
I did it!

507
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,380
Osmo's final blow hit!

508
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,200
Four final blows will be taken.

509
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,980
I'll invite Reiko and take Nakagawa with me.

510
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,080
Who should I choose as the last one?

511
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,100
Chief!

512
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,180
Chief!

513
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,040
I'm kidding!

514
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,340
I'll invite you, chief!

515
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,860
Next time on Tokoton Osmo!

516
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,600
Thank you!

517
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,160
Let's smile anytime

518
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,080
Even when something ridiculous happens

519
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,100
Let's smile cutely

520
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,280
Let's smile cutely

521
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,440
You can leave with a face that's nothing

522
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,280
Hey, smile for me

523
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,140
You're not in any bad shape

524
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,760
Hey, smile for me

525
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,860
You're in the same mood as before

526
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,580
Let's smile cutely

527
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,740
Let's smile cutely

528
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,540
Let's smile cutely

529
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,080
Let's smile cutely

530
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,200
You aren't young

531
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,280
Smile as you usually do

532
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,140
If you aren't a child

533
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,980
Smiling is not beautiful

534
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,900
Smiling is he question

535
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,700
Smiling is OK

536
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,040
Smiling is OK

537
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,220
Smiling is OK

538
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,120
Smiling is OK

539
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,720
Smiling is OK

540
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:43,760
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

541
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:43,860
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

542
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:43,880
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

543
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,000
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

544
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,000
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
