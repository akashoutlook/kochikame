00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:17,560
I look up at the sunset floating in the river

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,560
When I kick the love stone, it flies to my shoes

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,580
I wonder if I'm going to the gym that I was saving on

5
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,880
I was laughed at that I was just a kid

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,780
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can only get a slap

7
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,440
It's a city that doesn't change a single time

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,920
It's strangely kind

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,380
From the water source of the Tungari-boshi

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,960
To the taishakuten, the sun sets

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,420
Tomorrow is already over like this

12
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,500
I lost my happiness because of the Katsushika Shiba

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,880
I realized

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,340
I'm such a fool

15
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,540
I'm such a fool

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,740
I'm such a fool

17
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,140
I'm such a fool

18
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,440
I'm such a fool

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,300
I'm such a fool

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,900
I'm such a fool

21
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,500
But isn't that fair?

22
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,140
I like all day being stupid

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,720
I aim for the top of the list

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:39,800
of the top of the list

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,540
I'm so stupid

26
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,200
But at the same time

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,460
I want to get her

28
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:42,560
and do it

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,780
I love what Katsushika Shiba does

30
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:51,520
I'd be so happy

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,480
Because I'm aparadise

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,640
Yes.

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,900
Well, that wraps up the new SOKAI store.

34
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,220
Everyone, please enjoy yourself until the end!

35
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,640
- Azuma, have you see the bodyguard from before? - I think he has a car accident.

36
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,120
Thank you for visiting my store every time.

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,300
Ah, it stinks!

38
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,400
I'm hungry!

39
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,660
I'm so busy!

40
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,980
I have to go to the store!

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,860
Why are you still here?

42
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,080
The typhoon is coming, so I have to go to the store.

43
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,340
I'm sorry, sir.

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,420
The typhoon is not coming.

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,000
These two are former soccer and basketball champions.

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,000
They are professional defenders.

47
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,740
That's what I'm talking about.

48
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:49,780
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,440
It's a million dollars sale.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,640
What?

51
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,000
Sir.

52
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,700
It's off-side, sir.

53
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,140
Give me a ball.

54
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,580
I don't sell roses.

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,560
This is the only money.

56
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,080
Please sell it somehow.

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,380
But...

58
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,260
Don't say it's impossible.

59
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,980
You can buy an egg from a single one.

60
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,280
You can buy 1 liter of milk, 500ml, 250ml of milk.

61
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,960
You can buy 50ml of milk.

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,560
You can buy a pachinko shop according to the consumer's needs.

63
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,340
No way.

64
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,160
Any famous man can't do it with one shot.

65
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,100
All right.

66
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,500
I understand.

67
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,000
After one shot, you can go home.

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,500
Of course.

69
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,420
You can't pick up and shoot a falling ball.

70
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,980
I understand.

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,100
It's a promise.

72
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,920
If it's no good with just one shot, you must go home.

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm a man, too. I will keep my promise.

74
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,900
Hurry up and shoot this guy and hand it over.

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,720
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,140
It will be a big fight.

77
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,060
What the hell is this?

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,060
I don't know what I can do.

79
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,360
That's a raccoon.

80
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,700
It's a raccoon.

81
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,360
Good.

82
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,180
That was too cruel a raccoon.

83
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,020
I've taken too many.

84
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,540
I guess I'll go with this one.

85
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,340
Seriously, I can't believe my eyes. I'm going to faint.

86
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,800
Wait, I think the other one's coming out.

87
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,500
I can't forget that one.

88
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,760
1, 2, 3, 4...

89
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,740
This one?

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,500
This one?

91
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,700
This one, I knew it.

92
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,240
But this one...

93
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,820
No, stop it!

94
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,980
If you're the manager, you should practice your poker face.

95
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,120
Go!

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,480
I can't believe it!

97
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,920
Go!

98
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,860
Yeah!

99
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,200
I've won!

100
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,340
Hurry up and hide the money!

101
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,680
I'm going to take it all!

102
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,960
Hide it, hurry!

103
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,700
It's 52,725...

104
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,480
I'll put the biscuits in a 5-case juice,

105
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,120
Then, 20 cans of yakiniku, crab cans, corned beef each.

106
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,040
A year's worth of toilet paper, 100 sheets of underwear,

107
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,180
1 rice, miso, soy sauce, and 1 bottle of sake.

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,800
Just in case, I'll also take 30 watches.

109
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,360
If I take them at night, they'll be enough to live.

110
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,940
After that, deliver them all to Niconico.

111
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,360
How many are left?

112
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,920
There are still 300,000 left.

113
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,120
Please forgive me.

114
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,620
If the prize is empty, the business will be...

115
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,480
Shut up.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,280
You don't have any other money?

117
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,280
Huh?

118
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,980
What about that?

119
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Yes, I'm doing a pet shop for a second job.

120
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,100
If you don't mind, I'll give you 300,000 left for your favorite pet.

121
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,560
Pet, huh?

122
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,700
Ryo-tsu's late again.

123
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,600
He's late for the next day.

124
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,360
I wonder if he'll be able to get a job.

125
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,360
Oh, he's here.

126
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,600
Hey, Ryo-tsu, what time do you think it is?

127
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,780
Good morning.

128
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,620
Ryo-tsu, what's that?

129
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,300
Does this look like a surfboard, chief?

130
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,200
It's a crocodile.

131
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,960
Isn't it cute?

132
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,580
It's a very quiet crocodile.

133
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,980
It doesn't even tickle.

134
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,820
Don't scare me.

135
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,100
Chief, please don't do this.

136
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, that was a nice idea.

137
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,260
*你好,四面相*

138
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,180
Ryo-tsu, it's a crocodile.

139
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,120
*もつもちママ*

140
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,880
The pet shop isn't open yet, so it'll be dangerous if they come by tomorrow.

141
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,820
U-u-u-u-u 같아요

142
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,260
It's delicious potato.

143
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,420
You can bite it often.

144
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,660
I love you!

145
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,520
If you're eating with them, they'll be quiet.

146
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,600
They won't bother you.

147
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,500
Good boy.

148
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,280
You're so cute.

149
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,480
You're so cute.

150
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,960
Hey, you're not going to buy the crocodile, are you?

151
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,580
Of course I will, Chief Ohara.

152
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,540
Because I've been dreaming of buying a crocodile since I was a child.

153
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,680
I've never heard of that.

154
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,240
Why do you call it a crocodile, not a dog or a cat?

155
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,420
It's hard to believe that it's so easy to misunderstand.

156
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,220
Look at its big eyes shining in the depths of its shell.

157
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,260
You're too good.

158
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,040
No, Ryosuke! You're going to get eaten!

159
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,420
No!

160
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,440
You're going to get eaten!

161
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,800
When you use sharp fangs, you can protect yourself from the outside enemy and kill the prey.

162
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,160
You can even attack people.

163
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,960
Senior!

164
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,100
What? I was just kidding.

165
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,500
You're so cute.

166
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,160
I'll do it!

167
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,300
Chu! Chu! Chu!

168
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,940
Don't be so naughty!

169
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:58,700
What'd you say?

170
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,460
Su! Su! Su!

171
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,620
I don't forgive you for hurting me.

172
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,420
Let's clean up, Wani-chan.

173
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,420
Be careful so you don't break your back.

174
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,360
Keep it inside!

175
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,720
Don't leave anything behind!

176
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,940
And now you have that sharp fr Virtual Face!

177
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,360
You're so great at taking care of animals.

178
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,560
I hand-me-downed a lasso, to the top of the net.

179
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
I'll just have a few bites.

180
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,300
What's up? Are you hungry already?

181
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,460
I see, I see.

182
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,960
You'll get hungry as you grow up.

183
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,720
Okay, okay.

184
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,720
Eat a lot and grow up soon.

185
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,260
Hey, the crocodile is shining.

186
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,960
If you're so spoiled,

187
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,960
you can't raise a good crocodile, Ryo-tsu.

188
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,700
It's okay.

189
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,720
From today, I'm going to be a crocodile

190
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,920
and fight against paranormal phenomena

191
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,440
and evils with the spirit of animal protection.

192
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm aiming to reform.

193
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,940
Reform?

194
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,180
There must be a reason.

195
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,600
Eat a lot and grow up soon.

196
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,920
Six? Okay, okay.

197
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,760
It's a crocodile!

198
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:25,780
What?

199
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,980
You're so smart.

200
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,180
The crocodile's handbag

201
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,120
will cost more than 500,000 yen.

202
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,700
Is it that expensive to have a crocodile?

203
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,080
Yes.

204
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,100
It's a real problem.

205
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,180
If you buy this crocodile for 5 years,

206
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,500
it will grow 5 meters and

207
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,000
sell for about 4 million yen.

208
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,820
It will definitely sell well.

209
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,360
If you buy it for 5 years,

210
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,440
it will grow 4 million yen.

211
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,660
Is that so?

212
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,340
What?

213
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,640
What's wrong with you?

214
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,400
What's wrong with you, Nakagawa?

215
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,700
I'm going to raise a crocodile

216
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,000
and sell it for 4 million yen.

217
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,900
No, no.

218
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,500
I knew it.

219
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,080
I'm not in trouble

220
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,240
with the crocodile.

221
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,040
The manager is.

222
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,840
I knew it.

223
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,340
What money, huh?

224
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,580
I thought you woke up

225
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,180
your mind of animal-loving.

226
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,820
Do you buy chickens, cows, and pigs

227
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,800
as pets, manager?

228
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,080
You buy them for the sake of your life,

229
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,000
don't you?

230
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,080
But...

231
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,020
It's fine to buy a crocodile for your life,

232
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,380
but I buy this as a moving bank.

233
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,120
There's no crocodile here!

234
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,960
If it's a crocodile,

235
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,600
let's go to the kitchen.

236
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,740
What happened?

237
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,040
Look! What?

238
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,400
He's standing with two legs!

239
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,020
Hey, that!

240
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,500
If you buy it for dinner, it's not everyone's meat!

241
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,900
Don't eat it!

242
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,860
Hey, stop it, Reiko!

243
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,800
But, the crocodile is everyone's meat!

244
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,440
If it's meat, I'll give you a treat!

245
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,740
Instead, don't be violent to my precious crocodile!

246
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,880
Got it?

247
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,440
That crocodile is laughing at us!

248
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,240
Don't make fun of him!

249
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,640
Now, let's go for a walk!

250
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,620
You're so violent!

251
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,600
How far are you going?

252
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,380
Hey, hey!

253
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,480
Welcome!

254
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,940
Hey, this is a famous and expensive meat shop!

255
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,560
What do you want?

256
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,740
No, I'm fine today!

257
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,300
Hey, 4,000 yen per kilo!

258
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,060
Don't be so luxurious!

259
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,620
It's cheap!

260
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:52,820
Hey, you're not eating it!

261
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,120
It's a large portion!

262
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,220
3 of this is for you!

263
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,340
Ouch!

264
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,060
It's meat or meat!

265
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,340
4,000 yen for a handbag!

266
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,520
I have to be careful with my luxury!

267
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,380
This is for you!

268
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,400
100 grams...

269
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,820
Ouch!

270
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,780
One kilo, please!

271
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,940
4,000 yen for a handbag!

272
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,040
4,000 yen for a handbag!

273
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,180
I'm a rich man!

274
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,100
I'm a little selfish!

275
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:34,860
I can't help it!

276
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,660
It was 4 million yen five years later!

277
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,860
Ryo, how much is the meat you fed the crocodile during the day?

278
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,200
Huh?

279
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,660
It was 2,940 yen for 3 kilos of thigh meat.

280
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,100
7,000 yen in total.

281
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,620
What about the amount you ate?

282
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,260
100 grams, 200 yen for a loaf.

283
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,200
That's 1,000 yen.

284
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,000
If you calculate it roughly, it's 240,000 yen per kilo.

285
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,520
Then we'll lose it!

286
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,360
Huh?

287
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,580
What did you say?

288
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,840
The crocodile's sales are 4 million yen.

289
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,860
Stop eating the thigh meat and keep the food cheap.

290
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,560
If you keep it cheap, it'll be 100,000 yen a month.

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,260
1 year, 1.2 million yen.

292
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,220
5 years, 6 million yen.

293
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,400
The transaction is minus 2 million yen!

294
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,000
Senpai...

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,820
It's not about the savings!

296
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,280
It's about the money!

297
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,500
Shut up!

298
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,200
You tricked that pachinko guy!

299
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,380
Senpai!

300
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,100
Shut up!

301
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,140
I don't care about the money!

302
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,080
Shut up!

303
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,620
Shut up!

304
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,340
I didn't calculate it because it was about the savings!

305
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,920
Damn it!

306
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,400
I can't believe I'm getting so much more money!

307
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,460
I don't need your consolation!

308
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,280
Now that I know you're the boss, there's no reason for me to buy you!

309
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,880
Get out of my sight!

310
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,280
I will not Nuke you!

311
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,140
Now who I am to judge a man like you?

312
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,320
If the crocodile hombres a problem, then Senpai will get fired too!

313
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,720
Why would I get fired?

314
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,880
The problem's with this abacus!

315
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,240
You decided to buy it once.

316
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,620
Now you must take care of the pets, Ryo?

317
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,740
I cannot do this?

318
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,820
I'm not able to take care of my pets?

319
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,780
I don't have the right to be your pet!

320
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,720
You're so stupid!

321
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,420
This is a very soft crocodile.

322
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,880
It wouldn't be good for us if it was a bridge.

323
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,840
But I've never seen a crocodile like this.

324
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,320
It's so cute!

325
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,080
What?

326
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,060
Can you do anything else?

327
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,040
I think I can do it.

328
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,600
You!

329
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,800
You can only feed the birds if you don't make money!

330
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,480
And now, the winner of this week's best work is...

331
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,880
The genius crocodile!

332
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,840
- He won 100,000 yen for winning! - You did it, crocodile!

333
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,240
100,000 yen!

334
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,240
All right, all right, I get it.

335
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,700
I'll make a dog food from tomorrow.

336
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,220
This will be a better deal than selling it.

337
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,020
For the video of the crocodile riding a bicycle,

338
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,400
you'll get 100,000 yen for winning!

339
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,360
Crocodile!

340
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,900
Today, I'll feed you real meat.

341
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,800
But I'll give you the cheapest meat.

342
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,660
If you want to eat good meat,

343
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,180
you'll have to make more money.

344
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,200
You'll have to make your own living expenses.

345
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,880
You understand?

346
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,140
Hey, you old man!

347
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,100
10 more calories for each person!

348
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,360
The crocodile won again!

349
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,960
He won four weeks in a row!

350
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,900
Dad!

351
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:41,940
Dad!

352
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,260
Give me all the plums in this basket!

353
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,000
I have money.

354
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,040
It's about time I get bored of bicycle jokes.

355
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,760
Find me another one.

356
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,960
It's amazing.

357
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,220
The crocodile won't get bored.

358
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,760
Let's ride it again!

359
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,100
Okay!

360
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,320
Everyone, please give me an applause!

361
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,940
It's been a long time since I rode a bicycle,

362
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,000
and I hope that I can keep it up.

363
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,980
Let's get back to our safety.

364
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,660
I won't.

365
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:26,960
It's all he got.

366
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,080
All right.

367
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,780
Hey, Riko.

368
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,120
Did you get any calls from the TV station?

369
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,560
No.

370
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:44,680
Why?

371
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,420
The amateur TV program was also in a bad situation.

372
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,480
It's about time to get some attention from the entertainment world.

373
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,040
I wonder if it's going to work out that well.

374
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,060
There it is!

375
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,440
Here it is!

376
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,040
Oh, it's that brother.

377
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,600
Who are you guys?

378
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,780
Oh, excuse me.

379
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,480
I'm the TV station's producer.

380
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,440
Actually, I'd like to ask you to appear on the show.

381
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,260
Of course, I'll prepare a lot of meat.

382
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,360
Oh!

383
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,000
Huh?

384
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,920
Oh, I see.

385
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,860
Then I'll ask you, the manager of the TV station.

386
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,980
Especially about the character.

387
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,580
Huh?

388
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,540
Huh?

389
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,000
What are you doing?

390
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,400
Huh?

391
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,420
Huh?

392
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,400
Huh?

393
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,300
Are you the worst?

394
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,040
Huh?

395
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,560
Huh?

396
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,040
Huh?

397
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,720
Are you the worst?

398
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,920
Why?

399
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,960
Well, if you get 90% of the attention, even the crocodile will get angry, Ryo-san.

400
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:42,920
Huh?

401
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:43,420
Huh?

402
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:43,780
Huh?

403
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:43,980
Huh?

404
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,640
Damn it.

405
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,020
You're so nice.

406
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,240
But he's a precious money thief.

407
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,920
Now, I can't let him go.

408
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,500
I can't let him go.

409
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,560
How can he do that?

410
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,920
Sir, crocodile.

411
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,440
No, please don't.

412
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,300
Please...

413
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,580
This week's 1st place is the popular explosion crocodile.

414
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,820
My outfit is perfect!

415
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,920
All right.

416
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,660
It's a little rush, isn't it?

417
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:16,880
It's been a long time to see you.

418
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,940
It's been a long time.

419
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,760
Thank you for being so good to me!

420
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,700
You're such a liar, manager!

421
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,040
Nice shot!

422
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,200
Next time, please come on my show and play a guest, Ani-san!

423
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,260
Look at this!

424
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,440
She was on the stage!

425
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,240
She was on the stage!

426
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,360
I saw her!

427
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,840
She's so popular.

428
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,180
Hey, you!

429
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,580
Don't look!

430
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,740
I'm tired of you!

431
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,960
Here's your coffee.

432
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,040
If you come with a high school girl again...

433
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,780
I'm sorry!

434
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,640
Please say hi!

435
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,400
I'm going back right now.

436
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,840
Damn!

437
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,120
Remember this, monk.

438
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,920
You hung in there, huh?

439
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,560
You think you have me, I don't care what you say.

440
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,860
That's Handsome Monk!

441
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,380
It seems he's been on TV quite a lot lately.

442
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,160
But you know what?

443
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,180
I don't see any point

444
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,360
I think it's too early to get bored.

445
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,780
Please come to our new show!

446
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,380
I've decided on another cast.

447
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,620
No, I'll take care of it.

448
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,460
Hey, ah, ah, I cut it.

449
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,440
Damn it, I can't do this either.

450
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:04,900
Yes!

451
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,680
Ah, ah, that's right.

452
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,820
Ah, canceling the crocodile?

453
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,500
Are you tired of it?

454
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,980
Please don't say that.

455
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,000
Look, the schedule is completely blank.

456
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,220
There's no work from now on.

457
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,800
You don't have to be rich.

458
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,440
I'm going to quit my job as a manager today.

459
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,360
See you later.

460
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,540
Your show is boring the world.

461
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,780
Think about how you're going to make a living.

462
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,320
I'm sorry if I'm involving you anymore.

463
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,880
The End

464
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,360
Boss! You're late!

465
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,080
I think I've done enough.

466
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,440
What are you doing, man?

467
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,180
Thanks, crocodile.

468
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,540
Boss, what's this guy doing?

469
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,160
You're late again.

470
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,640
Ryozu. You've done well.

471
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,560
Thank you for helping.

472
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,720
You're all so helpful.

473
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,520
You made it out real quick.

474
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,840
He's a good boy, and he's been doing his first job for a while.

475
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,960
He's better than you.

476
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,720
That's right, Chief. Let's massage his shoulders.

477
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,180
The crocodile massaged his shoulders earlier.

478
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,360
It's a shame that he's not allowed to go to the festival.

479
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,940
Which station is Kameari?

480
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,300
I don't need you if you're here, Ryo.

481
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,640
Please do something about it.

482
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,260
Let go of me. I don't need you.

483
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,760
The only one who can get the money is the one who has no brain.

484
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,860
They're going to have a baseball match outside the store.

485
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,120
But I'm going to be a spy.

486
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,800
I'll beat you no matter what kind of cowardly hand you use.

487
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,500
I'll beat you no matter what kind of cowardly hand you use.

488
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,000
You won't forget your promise.

489
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,580
Next time on the baseball competition

490

491

493
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,460
I want to run through the vast desert on a motorcycle

494
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,140
I want to be free more than a bird

495
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:10,060
The lady's dream changes with the speed of a full moon

496
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:15,180
I'm sorry, wait for me

497
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,280
The bright future of the panorama

498
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,660
You know it, right?

499
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,100
I'm sorry, wait for me
