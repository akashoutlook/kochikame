Oh, the summer is here again this year

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,120
It's here! It's here! It's here!

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,080
Oh, the summer is here again this year

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,860
It's here! It's here! It's here!

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,920
Oh, the mayor of Okinawan is waiting

32
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,900
Episode 1: The Big Bang!

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,620
The Big Bang! The Big Bang!

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,840
...What was that?

35
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,800
What's this?

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,280
A meeting?

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,800
Huh?

38
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,100
A meeting?

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,040
Are you quitting, Senpai?

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,700
Huh?

41
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,580
I don't want to, Chief.

42
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,900
Please call it a "restaurant request".

43
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,260
A restaurant request...

44
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,940
What a fool!

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,940
What?

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,320
A big adult can't even write a kanji!

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,140
So you're taking a vacation?

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,840
Are you going to a wedding?

49
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,300
No way.

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,820
I-I've written down the reason in detail.

51
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,960
Reason?

52
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:14,780
Huh?

53
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,380
"Ryotsu Kankichi is watching the Tameari fireworks show?"

54
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,080
I haven't seen any fireworks show since I was a kid,

55
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,220
so I don't know what kind of work you're doing!

56
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,280
I don't know what you're doing, either!

57
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,320
I don't know what you're doing!

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,600
Of course!

59
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,380
I'm a policeman!

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,100
You think you're a policeman,

61
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,740
so you can take a vacation at a fireworks show!?

62
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,480
Fireworks shows are amazing every year.

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,120
I want to borrow a cat's hand as a guard.

64
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,200
Huh?

65
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,620
What do you mean, "I don't have money"?

66
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,400
Don't worry.

67
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,040
If you do that, you'll be fired!

68
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,620
You're kidding!

69
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm not kidding!

70
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,060
I'm not kidding!

71
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,160
The chief's head of stone is using his brain every day.

72
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,600
It would be great to ride him and watch the fireworks show.

73
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,920
Damn it!

74
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,660
There's no way I can get a good vacation!

75
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,280
Hey, Ryo!

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,520
Huh?

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,360
Hey!

78
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,780
What!?

79
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,520
No!

80
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,020
My money is all over the place!

81
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,840
I was just about to return it!

82
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,000
I won't pay for anything I don't have!

83
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,820
Huh?

84
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,200
Is it that unfair?

85
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,500
Yeah.

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
I have to pay for Ryo-san's money.

87
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,040
Then I can have a good vacation.

88
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,040
This is a step forward.

89
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,560
There's no food here.

90
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,980
But the shop is located near Kagono.

91
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,240
If we don't have any food, why are you riding a horse?

92
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,940
Let's go!

93
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,940
I'm late.

94
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,680
What!

95
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,140
What is going on?

96
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,280
If we don't when we get to Higashiyama, we have to come back.

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,880
But the shop's open again.

98
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,860
What are we going to do?

99
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,600
I don't know.

100
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,220
This is resistance.

101
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,180
I'm with you.

102
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,620
I gotta go.

103
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:16,840
I'll be on the watch.

104
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,360
Good.

105
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,140
I'm off, then.

106
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,160
Theに音 is noisy. It is much easier.

107
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,320
Nothing to be afraid of.

108
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:50,420
I'm doing it, Katsushika Balloon Club!

109
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,200
Hey, Ryo.

110
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,580
Komaki, you're nervous.

111
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,640
Yeah, I'm in debt.

112
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,140
Where's the old guy?

113
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,300
He's in the warehouse.

114
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,580
If you don't mind, lend him to me.

115
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,900
I have a friend who's interested in him.

116
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,540
Yeah, we're very happy to have more friends.

117
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,640
I don't mind.

118
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,040
It's hot.

119
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,540
Does it mean I should go down by this?

120
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,380
You'll use propane gas for fuel, for reference.

121
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,380
So we're making ramen in here.

122
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,840
How do you like it?

123
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,960
Actually, I heard you liked this one.

124
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,680
I said I want to go down on the ship.

125
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,660
Please!

126
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,240
Really?

127
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,280
I see. Then let's try to drive it ourselves.

128
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,340
It's getting bigger!

129
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,000
Remember the procedure.

130
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,680
What?

131
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,580
We'll drive it when it's time.

132
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,160
What?

133
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,340
Don't ask that bald guy.

134
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,860
I heard you're going to do a business with Nekikyuu.

135
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,760
Do you think he'll be happy to cooperate?

136
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,580
Besides, the Nekikyuu don't allow night flight in Japan.

137
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,260
What if he finds out about it?

138
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,260
People with beards are scared of getting angry.

139
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,520
- Maybe you'll get bitten to death! - What?

140
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,120
Ryosan, get in the car.

141
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,980
- Alright! - Let's calm down.

142
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,700
Don't be so rude!

143
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:35,800
What?

144
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,580
As expected of a professional.

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,460
What a great technique.

146
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,900
The basic movement of the heat ball can be adjusted with this burner.

147
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,920
You can go up to a pretty high level, but...

148
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,980
It's okay to fly so high.

149
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,000
You can even go up to the height of a high-rise building.

150
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,900
What?

151
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,720
What?

152
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,360
When it's quickly melted, you can also remove the heat.

153
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,920
Um, remove the heat...

154
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,100
Oh, you're so enthusiastic.

155
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,820
Because I have a business to do.

156
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,540
Business?

157
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,520
No, I mean...

158
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,000
I wanted to be a professional in the heat ball,

159
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,160
so I wrote a book about it in my elementary school.

160
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,920
I wanted to do a business to fly in the sky.

161
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,200
What?

162
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,020
Ah, yes.

163
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,380
That's reliable.

164
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,420
I'll get it done.

165
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,960
Thank you.

166
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,820
I'm hungry.

167
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,100
We're running out of time.

168
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,360
It's a pain in the ass to go to the convenience store.

169
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,820
Oh?

170
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
What's that?

171
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,860
What?

172
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,080
It says ramen.

173
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,960
No way.

174
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,360
It also says my phone number.

175
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,480
I'll try calling it.

176
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,420
Yes, this is Kikyu Ramen.

177
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,240
Are you coming?

178
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,520
What?

179
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,260
Um, can I have two ramen, please?

180
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,460
Yes, two ramen, please.

181
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,260
Which one would you like?

182
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,380
This is Yamada from Room 3011 of Room 8.

183
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,420
30 times, right?

184
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,140
I'll take it.

185
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,940
Wait a minute.

186
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,940
I ordered it properly.

187
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,920
But how can I deliver it?

188
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:44,980
It's coming.

189
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm scared.

190
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,160
Welcome!

191
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
It's Mr. Yamada.

192
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,960
Y-Yes.

193
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,980
Here you are.

194
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,920
You're fast.

195
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,000
You're fast.

196
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm in Kikyu.

197
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,640
It's a ramen shop.

198
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,620
Yes, thank you.

199
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,380
Yes.

200
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,640
Sorry to keep you waiting.

201
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,560
Here's 1,000 yen.

202
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,360
Hey, this is Kikyu Ramen.

203
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,260
Yes, hello.

204
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,980
Three ramen.

205
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,160
Beat 40235.

206
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,340
All right.

207
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,740
It's that room.

208
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,900
Kikyu Ramen

209
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,140
Yes, okay.

210
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,720
Let's go.

211
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,500
Oh, here it is.

212
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,480
Hey, I bought the ramen.

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,520
Hello.

214
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,200
Jarshu Ramen.

215
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,100
70 cents.

216
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,320
Five miso ramen, please.

217
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,860
I understand.

218
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,100
Oh, I'm so busy.

219
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,860
Kikyu, there's a patrol car.

220
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,080
Someone called the police.

221
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,780
What should we do?

222
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,720
Formation launch against the emergency!

223
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,580
Formation, launch!

224
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,660
That balloon...

225
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,260
Where is it?

226
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,760
It's dark and I can't see anything.

227
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,160
It's called the Dark Night Crows.

228
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,960
That's why I painted the balloon black.

229
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Only the bad guys are good at this.

230
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,360
If I get caught at the first light of dawn,

231
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,360
I'll be in big trouble!

232
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,640
I didn't think it would be this bad.

233
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,780
I didn't think I'd be in big trouble.

234
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,340
If I make money like this,

235
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,900
I'll be rich, and I'll be rich.

236
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,700
You're in a good mood.

237
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,120
But is it okay for a policeman to work part-time?

238
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,680
I'm a policeman.

239
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,660
I have a duty to help the people in trouble.

240
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,020
If there are people who are hungry at night,

241
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,560
it's the way to help people.

242
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,880
A suspicious balloon is seen near the high-rise apartment in the city.

243
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,780
It's a big possibility that it will appear tonight.

244
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Strengthen the night patrol and work for discovery.

245
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,100
Are you listening?

246
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,100
But I don't think I'm going out tonight.

247
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,300
How do you know that?

248
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,020
That's the person who...

249
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,160
It's a policeman's pipe.

250
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,240
Did you have a policeman's pipe?

251
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,920
What?

252
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,900
Then what?

253
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,060
What do you want to write, chief?

254
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,620
A thousand yen for a bite.

255
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,340
Idiot!

256
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,700
Do you think it's okay for a holy policeman to gamble?

257
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,820
Chief, what about this?

258
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,500
If Ryo-chan gets the clue to the suspicious balloon,

259
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,740
he'll make the fireworks festival day a holiday.

260
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,240
I see. That's good.

261
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,780
What do you think, Ryotsu?

262
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,520
Is it good?

263
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,760
Huh?

264
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,640
That's right.

265
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,180
I don't get it...

266
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,880
I've decided already.

267
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,300
What's wrong with my cell phone?

268
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,660
I'll give it back to him.

269
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,200
Well then, let's take our summer trip to the tenütz.

270
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,500
Oh, it's a bit later today.

271
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,800
You wanted to leave me, didn't you?

272
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:02,880
a busy guy.

273
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,900
Why don't you have any face?

274
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,340
She's a bad dude.

275
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:11,520
I know!

276
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,700
Then what? Can you see it with your own eyes?

277
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,060
Well, just take a look.

278
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,820
A bird?

279
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,020
Why? It's a bird.

280
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,780
It's so dark, but it's very clear.

281
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,820
It's a starlight scope used by the U.S. military.

282
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,200
If you take a look, you can find a black, suspicious balloon right away.

283
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,300
That's bad.

284
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,900
Oh, no. I've got something amazing.

285
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Senpai, why don't we find a balloon and make a gift together?

286
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,020
I'll give you the gift.

287
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:59,180
Hey! What are you doing here?

288
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,700
Oh, Ryo-san.

289
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,960
I always make money for you, so I thought I'd give you a late-night meal.

290
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,880
Idiot!

291
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,220
What if you get suspicious by wandering around this place?

292
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,580
Oh, it's a ramen shop.

293
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,740
I'm glad.

294
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,280
I was just hungry.

295
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,780
Oh, I've never had ramen at a restaurant before, so I want to try it.

296
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,340
It smells delicious.

297
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,180
Is this how a ramen shop is built?

298
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,220
Huh?

299
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,720
Yeah, that's Nakagawa's son-in-law.

300
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,600
He's a policeman by hobby.

301
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,900
He makes ramen.

302
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,120
I don't eat ramen very often.

303
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,620
It's not like you're doing it as a hobby.

304
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,440
Come to think of it, a suspicious balloon is selling ramen, right?

305
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,260
Huh?

306
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,840
The phone is ringing.

307
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,160
Oh, hello.

308
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,880
Hello, balloon ramen.

309
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,880
No, it's just a ramen shop.

310
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,860
Huh? Just a ramen shop?

311
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,760
It's a balloon ramen shop, right?

312
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,140
What time will you come around here tonight?

313
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

314
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,940
Today is my day off.

315
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,720
Oh, yes.

316
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,800
Please come again.

317
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,280
Isn't your day off a business trip?

318
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,760
Oh, no.

319
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,880
I was thinking about going early tonight.

320
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,720
Right, Ryo?

321
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,200
Don't ask me.

322
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,660
I don't know anything.

323
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,120
That's right.

324
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,600
Oh, my.

325
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,480
Cut.

326
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,480
Air sock.

327
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,620
Third turn.

328
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,080
Oh, it's Ryo.

329
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,700
I'll open it now.

330
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,480
What's that luggage?

331
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,080
You'll get a good profit if you just eat ramen.

332
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,980
The theory of what's good to sell is developed in various ways based on the needs of the times.

333
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,760
Yeah.

334
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,500
Right?

335
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,120
What's that?

336
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,160
and the Combin-i that flies in the sky!

337
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,640
Everyone, we're sorry to keep you waiting.

338
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,060
Combin-i Kikyu Ramen is here!

339
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,660
Combin-i Kikyu Ramen!

340
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,680
Hello, sir!

341
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,260
Three chashu noodles, please.

342
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,760
Can I have a rice ball, please?

343
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,680
Sure!

344
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:34,900
Here you go!

345
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,820
The limited edition of Idol Hell 3rd edition set!

346
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,860
I really wanted this!

347
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,520
Hey, you want an egg?

348
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,220
Here you go!

349
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,120
Oh, you have everything you need!

350
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,280
Chocolate, please!

351
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,100
I'll have oolong tea and yakisoba!

352
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,500
Thank you!

353
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,020
I'll have a cup of coffee, too!

354
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,820
And a drink, please!

355
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,480
Here you go!

356
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,100
Melon, strawberry and condensed milk.

357
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:00,820
Which one would you like?

358
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,020
Oh, that was a great help!

359
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,380
Oh, by the way,

360
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,740
can I have two or three of these?

361
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,920
Sure!

362
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,200
You're in a hurry!

363
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,880
What a big profit!

364
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,640
Oh, look!

365
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,920
It's that balloon!

366
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,360
It's here!

367
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,360
All right, let's get going!

368
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,460
This is Nampo!

369
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,780
We just discovered a suspicious balloon!

370
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,180
Where is it?

371
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:27,860
Okay.

372
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,220
Kei, please prepare the Starlight Scope.

373
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,600
Roger that!

374
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,460
Haha, that was a big profit!

375
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,820
Hello?

376
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,520
Ah, sorry.

377
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,460
It's sold out today.

378
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,860
Here you go!

379
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,220
Ah, it's Ryo-san's mini-bat!

380
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,040
What?

381
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,200
What?

382
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,460
That must be Komachi and Naoko?

383
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,100
All right!

384
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,140
A first match for the formation against a mini-bat!

385
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,180
Oh!

386
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,100
You've erased Ryo!

387
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,980
It's okay.

388
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,920
You can see it through the moonlight.

389
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,480
Oh, look!

390
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,620
It's a balloon!

391
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,180
Hehe, that's right.

392
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,460
This is a secret strategy.

393
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,940
The Kasumika-Kumoka strategy.

394
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,400
You really know how to work well, don't you?

395
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,380
I can't see the moon.

396
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,760
Just follow the smoke!

397
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,820
Follow the smoke!

398
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,880
But I can't see the road.

399
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,600
Damn it!

400
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,160
Where is this going?

401
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,840
I can't see anything!

402
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,840
Ah!

403
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,680
I'm going crazy!

404
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,360
I'm going crazy!

405
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,540
I'm going crazy!

406
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,760
I'm going crazy!

407
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,580
I thought I was going to die.

408
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,980
You bastard!

409
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,880
The earth is facing this way.

410
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,140
I can't see it at all.

411
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,620
That telescope is okay in the dark, right?

412
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,820
It should be fine up to a few kilometers away.

413
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,060
But now I'm going to die.

414
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,680
K, look at this lens!

415
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,100
What's wrong?

416
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:05,820
Ah!

417
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,220
This is a black operating instrument.

418
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,320
Who did this?

419
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,660
If you ask me who did this,

420
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,140
Hahaha!

421
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,100
I don't think we can be caught that easily!

422
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,760
I'm sorry, Ryo.

423
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,840
I was able to help you until the day of the fire.

424
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,960
You can pay the debt in a few days, right?

425
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm counting on you!

426
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:30,620
Where is it?

427
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,620
Yes, this is the convenience store machine ramen.

428
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,000
I want you to give me your number.

429
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,960
My voice is...

430
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,420
As I thought, Ryo-chan.

431
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,440
Today is already the end. Good night.

432
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,740
Why is Reiko's phone number?

433
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,160
There's no doubt.

434
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,920
Because the strange machine is always at Ryo-chan's absence.

435
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,040
If this happens...

436
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,040
The police officer got a cold?

437
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,060
She's a nice woman.

438
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,080
I think it's time to open the store.

439
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,480
I'm in a hurry.

440
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,920
It's okay.

441
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,620
I have to clean up this pile of stock.

442
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,940
Let's make a lot of money at the end.

443
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,160
If it goes well, you'll be able to hold a store.

444
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,620
How can I make so much money?

445
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,280
Use the fireworks competition.

446
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,440
Fireworks competition?

447
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,500
But Ryo-san, can you take a day off?

448
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,400
My relatives are unfortunate.

449
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,560
I can take a day off if you say that.

450
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,000
I have many older relatives.

451
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,580
Chief, actually...

452
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,660
I know. I know.

453
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,480
It's about the vacation, right?

454
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,040
What?

455
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,040
Well...

456
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,740
I've heard the report.

457
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,740
You were on the day of the fire.

458
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,720
You're looking for a strange machine until the second day.

459
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,260
Oh, I see.

460
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,560
I'm impressed with you.

461
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,060
I'll take a special vacation for tomorrow's fireworks competition.

462
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,200
Please continue to investigate.

463
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,720
Yes, sir.

464
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,800
What?

465
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,980
You don't look very happy.

466
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,780
It's not half!

467
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:23,240
It's not half!

468
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,260
It's not half!

469
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,100
It's not half!

470
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,840
It's not half!

471
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,840
It's not half!

472
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,100
Hurry up and give it to me.

473
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:33,640
I can't afford to waste it.

474
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,760
I'll take the discount.

475
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,500
Please, no.

476
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,280
It's not half.

477
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,540
I don't have half.

478
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,920
I don't have half.

479
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,060
I'm sorry.

480
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,160
I'm sorry.

481
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,840
You're my hierophant.

482
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,620
I'm not going to let Reiko get in the way of business!

483
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,800
Ryo-san, it's finally time to decorate the finale!

484
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,320
Yeah!

485
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,060
The last delicious ramen at the convenience store!

486
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,680
I'm going to make it as lively as fireworks!

487
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,680
Everyone, thank you for waiting!

488
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,820
The convenience store that you've all been waiting for, Kikyu Ramen, has arrived!

489
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,320
Drinking beer while watching the fireworks of Ido-cho is a true Japanese delight!

490
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:20,520
The last one!

491
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,520
Everyone in the high-rise apartment building who is the first class of fireworks!

492
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,880
Beer, snacks, and shaved ice!

493
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,820
All of these are convenient stores that are happy to sell to you!

494
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,060
Yes, everyone, let's go together!

495
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,340
Let's go!

496
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,920
Hey, give me some beer!

497
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,420
Give me some shaved ice!

498
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,480
Okay, I'm coming!

499
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:46,840
I'm coming!

500
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,660
I knew it!

501
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,620
I was beaten up!

502
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,200
Ryo-san, if you keep this up, you'll lose everything!

503
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,400
This is a great profit!

504
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,180
What's wrong?

505
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,200
Oh, the burner's out of order.

506
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,660
It's old, after all.

507
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,660
Stop!

508
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,060
Kei-chan, where's Kikyu?

509
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,960
I think he's on the way.

510
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,960
There's no mistake.

511
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,440
As I thought, you were good.

512
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,520
You bastard!

513
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm going to get you!

514
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,740
What?

515
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,380
What?

516
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,920
What is this?

517
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,140
Looks like he's involved in a fireball explosion and is doing a dutch roll.

518
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
He's a freak.

519
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,360
Ryo-chan...

520
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,880
Is it over?

521
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,340
No, there's a 15-ball left at the end.

522
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,080
A 15-ball?

523
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,520
It's only 300 meters in diameter, so if he gets caught...

524
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,140
Caught?

525
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,080
You've been involved in a natural disaster!

526
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,960
That's a terrible end to a foolish man.

527
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,360
What?

528
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,920
Money has flown in from the fireworks!

529
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,120
A fireplace.

530
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,480
Uh, I don't want any money.

531
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Eh, oh well.

532
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm sorry. I was able to see the fireworks near the storehouse.

533
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,320
I'll give them to everyone as a souvenir.

534
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,700
Gege!

535
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,260
I won 5.5 billion yen with a foreign currency!

536
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,740
I won 5.5 billion yen with a foreign currency!

537
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,000
I'll return the money, buy a plastic model, eat eel, and eat a steamer!

538
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,300
I can't use all of it!

539
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,940
Next time, we'll do a one-shot promotion!

540
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,720
See you then!
