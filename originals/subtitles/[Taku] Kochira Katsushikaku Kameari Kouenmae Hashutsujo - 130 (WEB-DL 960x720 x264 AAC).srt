1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
Hearsay

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,340
O- O- O- When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,420
Dry your hair and look away

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,660
In the middle of the river, gazing at the rising sun

5
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,440
The cityscape doesn't change a wink Love is strangely gentle

6
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,280
From Shu Sui-to, the place where you wear a hat,

7
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,280
The sun goes down to Taishakuten

8
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,180
The sun sets and the sun sets

9
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,700
Tomorrow will end like this

10
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,840
If I win, I'll lose happiness again

11
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,420
I lost it and I realized

12
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,680
Because I'm a fool

13
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,900
Wow, Honda-san!

14
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,660
What happened?

15
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,000
Alright, it's done. What's wrong, Honda?

16
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,040
Senpai...

17
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,580
The plastic... Damn, it took three days!

18
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,020
Hey, Honda, thanks to you, the result...

19
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,940
Senpai...

20
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,800
What?

21
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,860
You're so mean, Ryo-chan.

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,160
You can't make me cry just because that toy is broken, right?

23
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,340
What? Is it my fault?

24
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,740
Alright, stop crying.

25
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,920
What? You can make something like this again.

26
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,920
No, Nana-chan...

27
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,580
What? Otohime Nana?

28
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,060
Speaking of Otohime Nana, she's Honda-san's girlfriend.

29
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,760
She was a famous girl manga artist with the pen name Aino Miko, right?

30
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,040
You don't have to explain it so well. Everyone knows.

31
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,220
So, what happened to Otohime Nana?

32
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,000
She hasn't been seeing me for a while, and she hasn't called me.

33
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,180
Honda, cry with all your heart.

34
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,320
Senpai...

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,420
Everything is over. Give up.

36
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,680
No...

37
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,940
Ryo-chan, it's so sad to make such a decision.

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,820
That's right.

39
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,900
It's a common pattern, right?

40
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,120
You have a new boyfriend.

41
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,580
Don't cry.

42
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,520
How was the two of you recently?

43
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,560
Even if it's something I think of...

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,460
It was two weeks ago that I met you.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,560
I bet you did something you hated at that time.

46
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
That's not true.

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,640
It was just a normal date.

48
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,100
Didn't you try to kiss her out of the blue?

49
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,840
Ryo-chan...

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,940
I didn't do that.

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,840
At first, I went to see a movie.

52
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,460
After that, I took the Tokyo Bay Aqua Line by bike.

53
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,400
In the middle, I ate soft cream by a firefly.

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,960
On my way back, I had a meal at the family restaurant and sent it to her apartment.

55
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,520
You don't seem to hate anyone.

56
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,700
Rather, we're a lovely couple.

57
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,700
Hmm...

58
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,180
Don't you have any other reason?

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,680
Okay, I'll ask the editor who was in charge of Otohime.

60
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,040
Hyo Ryusenshi?

61
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,860
Yes, that's her.

62
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,960
I'll ask her.

63
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,620
Let's ask her.

64
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,000
Here.

65
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:10,820
Here.

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,300
Hey, copy this.

67
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,580
I don't need this.

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,400
I don't need this.

69
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,860
You have a good writing skill.

70
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,840
Yeah.

71
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,240
Then, I'll do it.

72
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,940
Huh?

73
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,060
You two...

74
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,760
Yeah.

75
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,320
Actually, Miko is in a slump now.

76
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,760
She couldn't figure out the direction of the new series that was scheduled to start next week.

77
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,220
And she didn't call me.

78
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,820
What?

79
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,900
That means...

80
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,360
That's good, Honda.

81
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,600
She hasn't been dumped yet.

82
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,260
Yeah.

83
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,040
That's not good.

84
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:41,920
Huh?

85
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,520
Miko is an important time as a manga artist.

86
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,620
I don't know what her future will be like.

87
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,460
Huh?

88
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,100
As a girl manga artist, this is the boy's version.

89
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,240
We editors use our nerves quite a lot.

90
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,140
Being dumped by him,

91
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,860
or a pet caught a cold,

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,900
or having a lover,

93
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,520
or having a crush on someone,

94
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,040
his mental state affects the work.

95
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,200
I see.

96
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,480
Editors are also difficult.

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,120
Speaking of editors,

98
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,380
everyone here seems to have jumped out of the boy's manga.

99
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,560
Yeah.

100
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,720
It's the editorial department of the boy's manga.

101
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,240
The editorial department of the boy's manga is completely different.

102
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,520
By the way,

103
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,900
this is a photo of when I was in Young Dandy,

104
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,580
when I was in charge of the boy's flower road.

105
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,760
The author of the former Boso tribe,

106
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,560
Mr. Takenaka, took this photo.

107
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,400
It looks like a friend of the same tribe.

108
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,540
What's his name?

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,900
How do you read it?

110
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,380
Bari Bari?

111
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:37,940
It's written in gold,

112
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,160
and you read it in gold.

113
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,900
It's Bari Bari King.

114
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,880
I see.

115
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,540
And this is a photo and a name

116
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,740
that I took with Mr. Ero-kichi Ogeretsu

117
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,440
when I was in the Eros Heaven.

118
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,660
What?

119
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,840
Ogeretsu Ero-kichi is a big fan.

120
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,440
I like that pervert look.

121
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,840
What kind of face does he have?

122
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,020
It's the pervert look as in the manga.

123
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,200
But if you match it up to here...

124
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
What's his name?

125
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,180
It's easy to understand.

126
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,640
Is he a pervert with no sense of purpose?

127
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,820
And now,

128
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,400
this is Hyo Ryu,

129
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,860
in charge of Aino Miko.

130
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,380
It's a relationship

131
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,700
since she debuted in the third grade.

132
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,640
It's a long relationship

133
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:12,940
than the Honda.

134
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
There are many cases

135
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,360
where the editor in charge

136
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,260
and the girl cartoonist

137
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,960
get married on the street.

138
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,040
Don't say such a bad thing,

139
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,860
Senpai.

140
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,380
Don't worry about that.

141
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,800
Miko is a great help to Mr. Honda.

142
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,600
When Mr. Honda confessed to her,

143
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,960
her name became faster.

144
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,040
And the heroine

145
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,800
got a sense of motivation.

146
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,640
You bastard!

147
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,080
No way.

148
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,340
So,

149
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:38,820
I would like to ask you

150
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,720
to help Miko

151
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,000
to get over her slump.

152
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,940
If you don't put her in the printing house,

153
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,620
she will be in a real trouble.

154
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,800
No!

155
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,640
I can't do it!

156
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,320
It's not like that.

157
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,480
It's okay.

158
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,780
Hey,

159
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,460
Nanachan,

160
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,160
don't cry.

161
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,940
What kind of manga

162
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,040
are you trying to write?

163
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,200
This time,

164
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,480
to open the new possibility

165
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,300
of the girl manga,

166
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
we are focusing on

167
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,380
the friendship between men.

168
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,240
The friendship between men?

169
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,900
Miko,

170
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,580
what's wrong?

171
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,400
I can't draw the scene

172
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,220
the friendship

173
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,460
between men.

174
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,700
What?

175
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,660
Is that so?

176
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,060
Ryouchi,

177
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,060
can you help me?

178
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,460
Yes, sir.

179
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,300
I'll leave it to you.

180
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,220
How is it?

181
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,820
Hey,

182
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,500
stop it!

183
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,240
I don't need to stop

184
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,900
the friendship between men.

185
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,340
Right, Miko?

186
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,080
Yes,

187
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,600
but

188
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,140
not just hitting,

189
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,100
but also

190
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,500
dropping your heels.

191
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,840
I see.

192
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,700
Drop your heels.

193
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,820
Okay.

194
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,380
How is it?

195
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,940
Like this?

196
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,660
No.

197
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,880
It's like a shrimp.

198
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,460
I'm screwed.

199
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:54,640
No.

200
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:54,940
No.

201
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,720
How is it?

202
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,160
Exciting.

203
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,540
Just like I said last time.

204
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,700
If you fancy it,

205
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,180
you can do like

206
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,400
rock, paper, scissors,

207
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,100
one,

208
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,600
2.

209
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:07,980
2.

210
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,480
3.

211
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:08,740
4.

212
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,080
4.

213
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,340
Five,

214
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,320
5

215
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,720
6.

216
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,020
1.

217
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,160
2.

218
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,380
3,

219
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:21,920
1.

220
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,580
2.

221
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:22,680
4,

222
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,260
It's better to fall.

223
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,580
Don't call me a fool!

224
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,300
Alright.

225
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Don't call me a fool!

226
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,760
It's alright.

227
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,720
With your strength, this height is fine.

228
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,380
What are you talking about?

229
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,120
You'll find out how to calculate what's alright!

230
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,280
Hmm. Falling is impossible after all.

231
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,960
Yeah.

232
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,380
Ah, I fell down myself.

233
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,780
Hey, help me.

234
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,000
Help me.

235
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,880
I see.

236
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,300
You ride like that too?

237
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,540
Yeah.

238
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,740
It's really helpful.

239
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,300
Nana-chan, you can't see around you if you get into the world of your work.

240
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,540
Damn.

241
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,640
Nobody came to help after all.

242
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:03,940
See?

243
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,000
I was okay after all.

244
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,300
Don't copy everyone.

245
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,640
Ryo-tsu-senpai saved me.

246
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,260
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

247
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,900
I'm not immortal either.

248
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,680
Senpai, are you okay?

249
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,940
I'm not okay!

250
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,020
I'm not okay!

251
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,320
It's so hard to write a manga.

252
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,140
What's wrong this time?

253
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,560
To make sure that men are friends,

254
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm going to make a scene where they hug each other.

255
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,440
There's no such thing as friendship!

256
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,900
Yes!

257
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,200
It's the proof of the beautiful friendship between men.

258
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,960
It's absolutely necessary.

259
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,940
You don't have to cry, Miko.

260
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,180
There are two men here.

261
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,960
They'll do it.

262
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,700
Yeah.

263
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,180
Idiot! What are you saying?

264
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Senpai!

265
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,080
Let's do it!

266
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,460
Calm down, Honda!

267
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,140
Miko's life as a manga artist is over?

268
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,140
It's your fault.

269
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,900
Eh...

270
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,340
Senpai!

271
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,340
No, stop it! Stop it!

272
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,440
Put your hands on your waist and your cheeks closer.

273
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,640
Smile.

274
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,640
Yeah.

275
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,980
Ah, okay.

276
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,160
What's this time, Miko?

277
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,240
The police uniform doesn't match my image.

278
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,620
What?

279
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,860
Senpai, it's for Nana-chan.

280
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:11,940
Let's do it!

281
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,320
Hey, stop it.

282
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,880
No!

283
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,400
Let me do it, Senpai!

284
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:15,920
Let me do it!

285
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,400
What?

286
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,520
You told me to do it.

287
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,480
I'll do it when it's done.

288
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,480
I'm sorry.

289
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,900
Senpai!

290
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:21,840
No!

291
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,480
No!

292
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:23,860
I can't do this.

293
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,020
I don't have the talent.

294
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,460
No, you don't.

295
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,020
The model is too ugly.

296
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:29,900
What?

297
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,500
I'm not kidding.

298
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,220
You're not wearing this because you like it.

299
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,720
You bastard!

300
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,780
It's not because of Miko.

301
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,780
I'm sorry.

302
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,880
I'll go outside for a moment.

303
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,400
What?

304
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,840
I told you.

305
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,260
I'm a girl cartoonist.

306
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,640
I'm a delicate.

307
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,200
What should I do?

308
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,960
I don't have time.

309
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,700
There's a hole in the manuscript.

310
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,760
It's not our fault.

311
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,800
I'm in trouble.

312
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,800
What should I do?

313
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,900
I can't ask anyone else for help.

314
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,160
Senpai, I was mistaken.

315
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,400
You can't make excuses.

316
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,460
Hey, how many pages is that manuscript?

317
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,800
It's 30 pages.

318
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,860
What?

319
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,160
30 pages?

320
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,220
I can write in 30 minutes.

321
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,080
One page, one minute.

322
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:16,700
What?

323
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,240
Really?

324
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,400
Senpai is quick to do anything.

325
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,400
If it's true, I want you to write 30 pages.

326
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,600
Right now.

327
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,580
Instead, I'll take the manuscript.

328
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,560
That's...

329
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,520
All right, bring the paper and ink.

330
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,800
Yes.

331
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,680
I can't write on the stairs.

332
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,020
I can't write on the desk without a draft.

333
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,340
All right, it's done.

334
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,340
Here you are.

335
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,120
Wow, this is...

336
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,760
It's a masterpiece, right?

337
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,220
Senpai, you have a talent for manga.

338
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,420
It's too bad.

339
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,140
But maybe readers will think it's an illusion.

340
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,700
All right, let's go.

341
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,480
I did it!

342
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,220
I'm a manga artist's debut.

343
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,340
Ta-da! Robodeca!

344
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,100
Saku, Ryozu, Patricia, Kanco.

345
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,400
I have a masterpiece.

346
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,620
I'll buy it for 1 billion yen.

347
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,960
Wait, Senpai.

348
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
Oh, Robodeca!

349
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,720
It's over.

350
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,220
Robodeca appears!

351
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:27,900
What?

352
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,600
Go, Robodeca!

353
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,000
It's small.

354
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,440
It's not scary.

355
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,520
Gusha!

356
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,960
Gyafun!

357
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,860
Is this the manga Ryo-chan wrote?

358
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,620
Robodeca?

359
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,740
Is this the manga Ryo-chan wrote?

360
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,120
That's the real deal.

361
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,540
The manga is full of big eyes and stars.

362
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,300
It looks fresh and wild.

363
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
I don't see it as wild and wild.

364
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,720
I can only see it as a hand-picked drawing.

365
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,820
I can only see it as a bad and dirty drawing.

366
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,780
The viewer will know how good it is.

367
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:04,860
I wonder.

368
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,600
There's ink stains everywhere.

369
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,100
I drew it in 30 minutes.

370
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,080
I didn't have time to think about it.

371
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,660
But I think it's better to draw with my hands.

372
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,800
Ryo-chan!

373
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:17,840
Yeah?

374
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,740
What's wrong?

375
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,520
Ryo-chan, I did it!

376
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,060
He said he was a teacher.

377
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,160
That manga got 3rd place in the reader's survey!

378
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,440
What? Really?

379
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,500
Well, it's a natural result.

380
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
I didn't expect it to be this good.

381
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,380
I can't believe it.

382
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,380
This kind of manga...

383
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,740
I didn't have enough gag, so I gave it to the reader.

384
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,240
The reader was impressed.

385
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,320
Please give it to me next week.

386
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,680
You see, I'm busy.

387
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,680
You can't help it.

388
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,320
Please.

389
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,880
Wait a minute.

390
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,480
I have a lot of work to do in a month.

391
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,580
Please.

392
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,740
I'll double the amount.

393
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,860
No, I don't care about the amount.

394
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,260
It's the official duty to help ordinary citizens in trouble.

395
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:02,540
Please write.

396
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,920
Thank you.

397
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,360
Thank you very much.

398
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,840
Well then, I'll report to the editor-in-chief right away.

399
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,320
Don't forget to give me some when you come again!

400
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,640
Understood!

401
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,720
Isn't that amazing, Ryo-san?

402
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,460
You're one of the most popular manga artists!

403
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,060
Well, it's obvious from my ability.

404
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,040
If you're able to publish comics, you'll be rich in debt!

405
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,840
Comics?

406
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,320
It's about the comic book.

407
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,800
There are also comics that have been published for 1 million copies in the first half of the year.

408
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,040
How much is the tax on 1 million copies?

409
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,160
Well, one comic book is 390 yen,

410
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,160
and the copyright rate is about 10%,

411
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,700
so it's about 39 million yen.

412
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,060
39 million yen?

413
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,280
For just one comic book?

414
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,620
Yes, of course, it's a popular manga that people all over Japan know about.

415
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,080
Good! Let's go to the editor-in-chief right away and ask him to publish 1 million copies of the comic book!

416
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes!

417
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:01,900
Ah!

418
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,360
Senior!

419
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,360
Ah, it's gone.

420
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,880
If it's like that, even if you stop it, it won't work.

421
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,440
Oh, Mr. Honda, you've been quiet for a while.

422
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,680
Well...

423
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,920
This is it! Here!

424
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,360
Hmm?

425
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,480
Eh?

426
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,100
Nana-chan, are you going to take a break?

427
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,040
Nana-chan...

428
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,600
What?

429
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,580
You want me to publish a 1 million-publish comic book with a special limit?

430
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,620
Yes!

431
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,140
If you have three days left on the remaining pages, you can do it!

432
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,440
Don't be stupid.

433
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,120
Can you suddenly publish 1 million copies of a new person?

434
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,460
Because my manga is third in the popular vote!

435
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,180
It will definitely sell!

436
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,400
I think it was just a rare thing.

437
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,380
That's not true!

438
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,400
Next is third to second!

439
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,460
From that next, you should get the first place of the bid!

440
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,380
I'm kidding!

441
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,660
This world is not so sweet.

442
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,760
What?

443
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:03,500
I've been in this world for 25 years, but when I saw it, this manga will be much more popular from the next time.

444
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,640
Then what if you get first place in the next time?

445
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,180
That's impossible!

446
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,900
Then if you get first place, you'll get 1 million copies of my comic book!

447
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,220
That's great!

448
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,000
If you can do it, try it.

449
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,240
This person is a hard joke!

450
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,240
All right! I made a promise!

451
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,080
Good!

452
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,680
Ryusei, come here!

453
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,540
Yeah...

454
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,680
How do you take a survey?

455
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,720
It's a survey postcard.

456
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,240
You can take a survey postcard of your favorite manga or manga artist.

457
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,320
You collect the number of postcards sent from all over the country and collect the data.

458
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,160
Every time, you will put out the popularity ranking of the work.

459
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,540
This popularity ranking determines the winner.

460
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,340
So the ratings of the TV are almost the same.

461
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,760
I see.

462
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,880
You mean the number is the power.

463
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,320
Look at this.

464
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,120
Oh, right!

465
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,220
I came to the editorial department.

466
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,740
I'll write a novel for next week here.

467
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,080
What?

468
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,340
Well...

469
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:05,800
What?

470
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,940
All right! This is fine.

471
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,620
What?

472
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,520
I'll borrow a pen.

473
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,500
All right! It's perfect!

474
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,940
What a person!

475
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,500
Please help me!

476
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,620
Do you have a weekly Sapphire?

477
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,580
I'll take it all.

478
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,240
But you have to pay for it.

479
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,680
All right.

480
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,220
Thank you very much.

481
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,880
Welcome.

482
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,920
Do you have a weekly Sapphire?

483
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,000
What?

484
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,340
I'll take it all.

485
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,680
All right.

486
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,340
Please! Please!

487
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,940
Good luck.

488
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,700
General, hurry up!

489
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,760
The more you do it, the more you'll get paid.

490
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,520
Good luck!

491
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,640
But Ryotsu, is it really all right?

492
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,160
Don't worry.

493
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,780
If you have a million comics, even if it doesn't sell, you can get a tax.

494
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,240
Really?

495
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,080
Yes.

496
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,120
That's why you should be on the big board.

497
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes!

498
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,120
Now the first place in the survey is certain.

499
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,280
What?

500
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,820
The first place in the survey for the Robodeca class?

501
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,600
I can't believe it.

502
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,200
I have overwhelming support.

503
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,720
Idiot.

504
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,420
All my readers are fools.

505
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,800
That's rude.

506
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,780
My manga was such a masterpiece.

507
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,440
Do you have a weekly Sapphire?

508
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,240
Yes.

509
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,140
This is the first place...

510
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,660
What do you mean by the first place?

511
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,220
What do you mean by the first place?

512
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,620
I'm sorry.

513
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,820
It's a matter of principle.

514
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,520
As promised, I'll get you a million copies right now.

515
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,560
But a million copies for this?

516
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,180
It's a common sense as an editor.

517
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,040
It's a promise.

518
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,000
All right.

519
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,400
A million copies of the comic book?

520
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,560
That's right.

521
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,720
Ryo, you did it.

522
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,260
Now you have a lot of money.

523
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,760
I'll take the 3,900,000 yen tax.

524
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,160
Hahaha.

525
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,400
Hahaha.

526
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,300
I was wrong.

527
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,860
I'm here again.

528
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,080
I bought Nana's favorite cake.

529
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,540
Nana.

530
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,740
Oh?

531
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,160
Mr. Honda.

532
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,700
What's wrong with everyone?

533
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,860
He asked me to leave.

534
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,760
I can't work here.

535
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,100
I see.

536
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,960
Since I'm here,

537
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,680
Mr. Honda.

538
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,460
Nana.

539
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,180
What's wrong?

540
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,000
I can't.

541
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,800
I can't believe it's the new serial.

542
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,380
I've never had a genius idea.

543
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,280
Nana.

544
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,760
Nana.

545
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,260
Have you been riding a bike lately?

546
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,240
Let's fly a bike once in a while and change the mood.

547
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,900
I'll go with you.

548
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,080
Mr. Honda.

549
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,860
You don't have to worry about a bike rider.

550
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,700
What?

551
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,700
Hahaha.

552
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,740
Nana.

553
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,120
Nana.

554
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,000
You can't go with me.

555
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,100
He's gone.

556
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,080
You're right.

557
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,860
I'm going to the police station.

558
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,960
OK.

559
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,380
Mr. Honda.

560
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,920
You can leave now.

561
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,480
I'll be waiting.

562
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,640
Nana.

563
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,740
Nana.

564
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,180
But you look different when you're thinking about manga with a difficult face.

565
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,920
Really?

566
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,920
I guess it's because I like bikes.

567
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,740
Um, why did you like bikes?

568
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,900
Me?

569
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,500
That was when I was in high school.

570
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,280
I was suddenly in a bad mood while I was bringing a manuscript to the editorial office.

571
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,480
Then, a rider who happened to pass by brought me to the hospital.

572
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,040
The rider at that time was like a prince riding on a white horse.

573
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,580
Hmm, I feel the same way...

574
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:21,760
Ah!

575
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,620
That rider didn't put a shooting mark on his helmet.

576
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,460
Eh?

577
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,680
Come to think of it...

578
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,260
He did!

579
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,080
The location is near Tamagawa in Kawasaki.

580
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,700
It's a little in front of the vending machine.

581
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,200
Yeah, why?

582
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,500
Why do you say that?

583
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,100
Oh, is that...

584
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,100
Honda-san?

585
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,840
Hmm...

586
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,080
What?

587
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,520
No, he used to be a good rider.

588
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,480
Even so, he was Nana-chan.

589
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,500
Honda-san and I were destined to meet God.

590
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,620
Yeah, to the God of Bikes.

591
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:00,980
Hahaha.

592
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,740
Hey, Nana-chan.

593
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,860
Next new year's festival,

594
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,240
how about you draw your favorite bike world?

595
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,480
Bike world?

596
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,380
Yeah.

597
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,860
Bike world...

598
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,840
Thank you very much, Honda-san.

599
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,620
Then, I feel I can draw something.

600
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:17,980
Really?

601
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,760
That's good.

602
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,960
I'm a big fan of Aino Miko-chan's manga.

603
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,260
This is Nana-chan's new year's festival.

604
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,240
Finally, an idea has come up.

605
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,520
Thanks to you.

606
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,160
To have a white horse appear in a girl's manga,

607
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,240
If that happens,

608
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,480
it'll surely be a mistake.

609
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,700
You're so naive.

610
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,680
How true.

611
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,800
I've passed the first task,

612
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,520
like the one given by Robotical President.

613
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,220
Come on!

614
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,080
Come on!

615
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,340
Come on!

616
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,040
Come on!

617
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:46,980
Stop!

618
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,040
Say good-bye!

619
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,080
Hey, you...

620
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,140
There's a book.

621
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,700
It's so expensive

622
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,400
that it's like lost in a lost.

623
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,460
What?

624
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,140
Don't worry about it.

625
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,920
What?

626
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,460
What?

627
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,580
Stop!

628
00:22:59,840 --> 00:22:59,960
No!

629
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,280
-The End-

630
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,640
Ryo-san, what are you doing?

631
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,480
Once I put it out, the money will be mine!

632
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,980
Ryotsu!

633
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,320
Pay the money for the manga and the money for the sketchbook.

634
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,020
I know, Ryo. How much is it?

635
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,360
The manga I bought costs 7,500,000 yen for 300,000 copies.

636
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,760
300,000 copies for 500,000 yen, that's 1,500,000 yen!

637
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,500
And the part-time wage we hired is 5 million yen.

638
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,460
So it's 9,500,000 yen in total!

639
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,400
So the total is 5,600,000 yen.

640
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,640
5,600,000 yen!

641
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,280
Don't run!

642
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,140
I need to remember my business!

643
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,600
I'm done with my tax life!

644
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:10,820
