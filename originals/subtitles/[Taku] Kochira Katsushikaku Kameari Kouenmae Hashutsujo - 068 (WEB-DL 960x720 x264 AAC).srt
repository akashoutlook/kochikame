2
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,940
From the top to the bottom, the sun sets

3
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,460
Tomorrow will end like this

4
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,480
If you win or lose, you lose happiness again

5
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,920
I realized it, it was an idiotic me

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,120
Taikichi! Beauty! Nippon Zuri!

7
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,160
You got it! Hurry up and get it!

8
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,400
Yes! I did it! I got it, senpai!

9
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,300
It's not the time to be happy!

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,580
Line tension is high! You'll be cut if you don't do it!

11
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,580
What should I do?

12
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,080
Loosen the drag and pull the string!

13
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,080
The drag button is...

14
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,500
You're bad, you got the line cut.

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,860
Mr. Honda, it was a pity.

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,620
It was a big one, but it was a pity.

17
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,780
It's not that I caught it.

18
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,460
Come to think of it, Senpai caught a 23-pound big one.

19
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
Well, well.

20
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,780
Even if the fishing is bad?

21
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,560
Well, well, it doesn't matter.

22
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,820
Good job!

23
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,820
Yes!

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,900
What's hiding you now?

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,780
Good job!

26
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,780
I know, I know.

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,940
I'm sorry. I was playing a fishing game.

28
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,100
A fishing game.

29
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,380
Is it true that the chief is also a fisherman?

30
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,120
Well, I'm a herabuna expert, but I caught a 50-centimeter fish.

31
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,840
When I went to the chief's house, there was a tall fishing rod.

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,320
That's a product made by a famous craftsman.

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,160
If you like fishing, why don't you go fishing with me?

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,860
It's a toy. I'm a toy.

35
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,980
Chief, that's not what you're making fun of.

36
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,980
When you catch it, it vibrates like a real thing.

37
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,660
Oh, and the reel is also attached properly.

38
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,440
That's not all. You can choose the lake and lure where the bass is.

39
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,520
It's a great feature that can be found at the depth of the sonar and the water room and the lure.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,260
It's pretty serious. How do you do it?

41
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,940
I'm here, chief.

42
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,100
Which lake do you want?

43
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,560
Oh, this one.

44
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,180
Next is the boat.

45
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,780
Look at the sonar and aim for the place where the bass is.

46
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,200
The depth of the lure will also come out.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,120
What? Then it's easy to catch.

48
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,600
Oh, man.

49
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,140
The most important thing in lure fishing is to choose the lure.

50
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,500
The bass cannot be caught unless the proper lure is used according to the weather, water and depth.

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,460
I see.

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,840
Beginners are good at eating.

53
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,680
It's safe to catch a spider jig brown.

54
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,320
Then I'll leave it to you.

55
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,380
Now, please cast.

56
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,200
It's here.

57
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,940
It is amazing that it is large.

58
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,740
You got it!

59
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,840
Itacion Channeling

60
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,300
I did it! I were able to cast it!

61
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,400
The bass is 25 pounds long.

62
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,020
That's awesome.

63
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,840
It's my first time to catch a bass for the first time.

64
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,500
Ah, is it?

65
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,020
I'm a genius in fishing.

66
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,920
By the way, Ryotsu, what's your best record?

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,620
I forgot. What was it?

68
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,860
You said 23 pounds.

69
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,640
What? 23 pounds?

70
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,200
You're playing games all the time and you're saying 23 pounds.

71
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,300
I'll be the first to do it and it's 25 pounds.

72
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,060
What's with that ridiculous laugh?

73
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,640
You're so stupid that you caught it by chance.

74
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,460
Lend me your money.

75
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,580
I'll catch a bigger bass.

76
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,960
Let's get the boss closer to the rock.

77
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:35,860
Alright!

78
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,900
That's a good fish. It's definitely a big one.

79
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,760
Really? It's a big one, but it's not that big.

80
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
This is why you should be worried.

81
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,000
You're pretending to be weak and you're playing games all the time.

82
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,260
I caught it.

83
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,740
What? It's a bluegill.

84
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,620
How much is it?

85
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,500
5 pounds.

86
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,060
I can't win a game with fishing.

87
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,060
I've been fishing since I was a kid.

88
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,040
I've been fishing from herapuna fishing to Christmas tree.

89
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,740
I've never lost to anyone.

90
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,500
What? Christmas tree?

91
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,360
I've been fishing and I've been fishing.

92
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,700
It's a joke from your father.

93
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,120
Ryo, this is a talent.

94
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,520
No matter how hard you try, it's not going to work for me.

95
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,200
This is a life.

96
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,280
Remember that.

97
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,080
Where are you going? I'm working.

98
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,380
I don't think you'll come back for the rest of your life.

99
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,440
The chief is to blame.

100
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,000
He will hurt Ryo's pride.

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,860
He's in a bad mood.

102
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,040
I'm sure he's thinking of revenge for Ryo.

103
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,960
Kumoyuki is getting suspicious, so I'm going home.

104
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,820
Excuse me.

105
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,240
You're not coming back.

106
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,540
You're drinking Yakisake somewhere.

107
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,400
Who's drinking Yakisake?

108
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,080
Ryo.

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,580
Where have you been?

110
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,080
I went to a toy store.

111
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,820
A toy store?

112
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,640
Yes. To get this.

113
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,040
Chief, let's play again.

114
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,580
What? Bus Fishers again?

115
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,240
This is not Bus Fishers.

116
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,600
It's a new game machine in the works.

117
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,160
It's Gal Fishers.

118
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,440
Gal Fishers?

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,960
It's a game where you get a gal instead of a black bus.

120
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,940
Idiot!

121
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,960
I'm going to quit my job and borrow something like that.

122
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,580
I don't care what you say.

123
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,520
Let's see who can catch more gal.

124
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,420
You're stupid.

125
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,980
I don't play such a stupid game.

126
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,580
What's this document?

127
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,860
You're running away.

128
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,920
No.

129
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,360
I'm not going to play a game like fishing for a gal.

130
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,060
You said you'd never lose a fish, but you were lying.

131
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,260
You said you'd never lose a fish, but you were lying.

132
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,220
I don't want to play such a stupid game.

133
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,180
I don't want to work under a boss.

134
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,600
I don't want to work under a boss.

135
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,200
I'm a real man.

136
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,440
Is there a bill of two balls?

137
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,380
I can't do anything about it.

138
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,960
I can't do this.

139
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,220
Shut up.

140
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,240
All right.

141
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,900
If you say so, I'll do it.

142
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,680
Let's do it!

143
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,800
Chief!

144
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,440
As expected of the chief.

145
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,980
He's a man after all.

146
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,200
Tell me how to fish, Ryotsu.

147
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,380
Fishing is similar to the bus fishers, but

148
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,000
It has a digital camera and real gyaru can catch it.

149
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,920
I'll try it, so please watch.

150
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,580
Oh, the reaction is over immediately.

151
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,460
This game machine has a fish-based detector instead of a fish-based detector.

152
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,040
Oh.

153
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,840
It also reacts to women who are actually alive.

154
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,460
It's a pretty cute little gyaru.

155
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,680
Next, choose a lake that seems to be alive.

156
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,620
It's not a lake.

157
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,880
The prey is not a bus, but a gyaru.

158
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, the current child is a little gyaru.

159
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,620
If you're going to play, choose Harajuku.

160
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,100
Next, choose a car instead of a boat.

161
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,660
She seems to be active in short cuts, so she's an outdoor fan.

162
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,860
4WD Range Rover.

163
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,980
As expected of the senior, you have a sharp reading.

164
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,500
Next, choose a lure.

165
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,360
The lure is also quite different.

166
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,840
Well, it's realistic.

167
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,420
The gyaru is choosing what she wants to be presented.

168
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,120
Well, since she's a high school student, Tiffany's ring is suitable.

169
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,580
OK, the setting is complete.

170
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,900
Well, the gyaru is choosing what she wants to be presented.

171
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,760
Oh, yes!

172
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:05,840
I didn't know that.

173
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,400
What is it?

174
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,160
It's a gift.

175
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,400
Let's go.

176
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,420
Let's go.

177
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:20,500
Let's go.

178
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:20,520
Let's go.

179
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:20,560
All right.

180
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,040
I got it!

181
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,460
I got it!

182
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,500
Look, look, look!

183
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,040
Look, look, look!

184
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,460
What's this?

185
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,040
If you lift it, the picture of the girl appears.

186
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,360
The computer will compare the face and body of the girl with the beauty score.

187
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,520
And the girl with 70 points of beauty score will wear a swimsuit.

188
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,660
This is so cool!

189
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,440
Do you know how to use it?

190
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,200
Yes.

191
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,500
But it's not fun to just compete.

192
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,740
That's right. How about this?

193
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,020
Let's bet on the most precious treasure.

194
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,420
What?

195
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,020
I bet on this.

196
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,520
I don't need this.

197
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,420
This is 350,000 yen.

198
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,080
I don't have such a high treasure.

199
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,140
You have.

200
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
A rod for a herabuna.

201
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,160
No, that's not good.

202
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,200
Then let's have you admit your defeat.

203
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,120
You'll show up in front of me and say you won't brag about fishing anymore.

204
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,960
And lower your head.

205
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,740
You don't have confidence in winning.

206
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,080
What?

207
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,540
You don't want to bet on this because you don't have confidence in winning, do you?

208
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,180
What do you want to do?

209
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,020
A game of rock-paper-scissors?

210
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,720
Which do you want?

211
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,780
Okay, I got it.

212
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,040
I'll bet on the rod and show you.

213
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,520
Boss?

214
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,400
How can we decide who will win?

215
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,540
Well, let's decide who will win with how many points you get within an hour.

216
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,340
Okay, that's good.

217
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,880
Then, follow the position.

218
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,340
Ready.

219
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,600
Start.

220
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:47,820
Start!

221
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,280
I found three of them.

222
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,740
I think it's Komachi and Naoko.

223
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,440
Okay, I'll go with those two.

224
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,780
I can't expect a high score even if that blue animal is the one.

225
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,680
I'll go with the flashy girl next to it.

226
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,560
I'll go with Komachi first.

227
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,020
I remember Komachi often went shopping in Ueno,

228
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,840
so he bought a place in Ueno.

229
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,840
Komachi's appearance is like a small gyaru,

230
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,420
but he has a unique style.

231
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,920
This is the car, and this is the lure.

232
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,320
Ready, set, go!

233
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,220
Miss, would you like to drink some tea with me at the Togenuki Jizo?

234
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,360
Chibu~i!

235
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,340
If you date me, I'll give you a Bill Search outfit as a present.

236
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,560
I like you, Mister!

237
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,620
Let's go on a date!

238
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,400
I'll go with you!

239
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,820
I did it! I got it!

240
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
40 points!

241
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,020
I thought it was a higher score.

242
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,360
That's just how Komachi is.

243
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,280
Okay, it's my turn this time.

244
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,660
Ready, set, go!

245
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,700
One, two, three.

246
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,680
Stop!

247
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,780
Stop!

248
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,360
Get out of the way, all right?

249
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,040
Whenever I see a car, I drive it.

250
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,060
Don't tell me...

251
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,100
Doc.

252
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,640
Is this the real corner?

253
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,360
I'm going to drive!

254
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,720
Fish on!

255
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,600
90 points. No doubt about it!

256
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,140
What? I'm not going!

257
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,400
How about the Kimijita brand suits?

258
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,340
Great! Naoko, let's go!

259
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,120
Fish on!

260
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,360
I did it! I caught it!

261
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,840
You're definitely below 50 points.

262
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:28,940
I'm not!

263
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,100
I did it! 70 points!

264
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,140
What? Naoko got 70 points?

265
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,920
What's the point of making this game?

266
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,240
Damn it! I'm going this way!

267
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,680
I did it!

268
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,200
Come out, 100 points!

269
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,220
25 points!

270
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,680
Why is it 25 points? I can't believe it!

271
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,380
What? You can just watch it!

272
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,720
But the violation is a violation!

273
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,960
What's wrong with you?

274
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,400
Huh?

275
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,600
You're so stupid.

276
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,800
What?

277
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,080
Yeah!

278
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sorry I'm stupid.

279
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,800
What's wrong with you, you bastard?

280
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,560
Yeah!

281
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,820
I've got 25 points.

282
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,740
Change the point, Ryoza.

283
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,960
Get out of my house, Ojiya!

284
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,260
Oh, no!

285
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,180
Uchyo, how's it?

286
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,200
Huh?

287
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,820
What's going on?

288
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,520
I'm going to my house, Ryoza.

289
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,300
It's more useful to have an artificial Whale

290
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,100
which is familiar to you

291
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,380
rather than a whaling who can't even hear women.

292
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,540
Of course, I have a trip to the blue sea, too.

293
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh, come on!

294
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,460
You're trying to escape by yourself!

295
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,880
I'm coming with you!

296
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,900
Fish on!

297
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:20,900
-Captain! -Yes, Oryosu!

298
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,540
Too bad. I've caught all the fish that are currently in the club.

299
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,900
I might be a big killer!

300
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,660
You're right. You're all just old ladies.

301
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,020
That's ridiculous! You caught only a woman with 25 points!

302
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,600
Unlike you, I'm not a big fish. If I caught both of them, I'd be in the opposite position.

303
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,860
That's...

304
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,040
A young girl with a strong sense of propriety!

305
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,320
-Yosha, itadakii! -What? I'll catch her!

306
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,180
-Captain, it's my prey! -The fast one wins!

307
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,820
-Are you serious, Oryosu? -Indeed.

308
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,400
If the game has the same prey during battle mode, the one who catches it first will get points.

309
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,300
-You're not confident, Oryosu! -What? I'll catch her first!

310
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,360
-Rua will use a powerful bass bait. -What's a bass bait?

311
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,840
It's a device that makes the lure spin on the surface of the water, and makes the fish excited.

312
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,420
It's a BGM.

313
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,740
-Go! -Go!

314
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:32,740
-The next day. -The next day.

315
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,340
Lady, would you like to go with me to the National Fair?

316
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,580
No, Lady. I'll go with Odaiba.

317
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,700
I see. What do you want?

318
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,600
I'll give you this watch.

319
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,460
This is a ring of Garche. And...

320
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,520
This is a new Sharanpi song.

321
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,020
How about a drive while listening to the new song?

322
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,660
No! I want to see it!

323
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,200
Drive smoothly!

324
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,140
Sharanpi!

325
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,240
Eh? The BGM is off.

326
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,360
You're quite a drag, Saotome. The tension of the line is severe.

327
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,880
Ah, cut it out! Cut it out! If you get caught, I'll take it!

328
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,020
What the hell!

329
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,380
I did it!

330
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,180
Look! It's 85 points!

331
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,840
Hehehe! What's going on?

332
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,740
-Heh... I won't lose! -Wait, you!

333
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,060
Oh, it's Reiko! I bet she'll get a high score.

334
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,440
I'm sure Reiko will get 100 points.

335
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,800
Good. If I fish for this, the gap will open again.

336
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,540
It's so easy. The more beautiful you are, the more difficult the conditions are.

337
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,300
The weather is rainy and the water is cloudy.

338
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,060
It's okay.

339
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,160
Reiko, the rich man, won't be able to find a luxury car or a branded product.

340
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,040
It's a sure thing to simply attack.

341
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,600
Will it really work out?

342
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,140
Alright!

343
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,700
Yeah!

344
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,460
Reiko!

345
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,220
Reiko!

346
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,280
Reiko!

347
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,860
Reiko!

348
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,320
Reiko!

349
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,120
Reiko!

350
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,020
Reiko!

351
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,280
Reiko!

352
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:25,040
"I! Reiko! Reiko! Reiko! Reiko! Reiko! Reiko! Reiko! Reiko! Reiko! Reiko! Whooah!"

353
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,500
This is a fastest race!

354
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,800
It's such a cool feeling.

355
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,140
Reiko!

356
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,640
Reiko!

357
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,760
I love simple presents like this one.

358
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,260
So, where should we go for lunch?

359
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,200
What do you want to eat?

360
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,840
I know, French food would be nice.

361
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,880
Oh, French food.

362
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,320
The shop is in Paris.

363
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,160
Paris?

364
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,880
Are we going to France just for lunch?

365
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,320
French food is the best in France.

366
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,220
What's this?

367
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,580
The thread is getting loose.

368
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,600
It's not getting any closer.

369
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,480
It's not easy to catch a super-big one like Reiko.

370
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,340
What's that?

371
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,300
Maria?

372
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,000
Maria has nothing to do with Reiko.

373
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,860
I know everything about her.

374
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,100
I can easily catch her.

375
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,520
I won't let her make any difference.

376
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,220
Go!

377
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,960
Maria, where are you?

378
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,780
Maria!

379
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,200
wilt state

380
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,980
Maria, would you like to eat this?

381
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,660
This is made by me.

382
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,400
Maria, I am so happy.

383
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,660
I'll save you.

384
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,440
Maria is jealous about me.

385
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,480
She doesn't care about me.

386
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Ugh...

387
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,240
My hands are getting tired...

388
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,180
Uwaaah!

389
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,040
Oh, no! He found me!

390
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,900
Damn it! I was going to a good place, but...

391
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,260
Too bad, Chief.

392
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,580
This way is easier.

393
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,340
Here you go.

394
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,260
Get!

395
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,700
What?

396
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,480
Minus 100 points?

397
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,680
This game machine, Marian, is a man, isn't it?

398
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,160
Hahaha!

399
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,620
You're so stupid, Ryo-tsu!

400
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,620
This is mine!

401
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,300
Ehh...

402
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,180
Watch this!

403
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,560
Come on, come on.

404
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,100
Eat this.

405
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,520
I'll give you all of it for free.

406
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,640
You're so considerate of a gorilla!

407
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,880
Give it to me too!

408
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,060
Give it to me too!

409
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,140
This is amazing!

410
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,120
What are you doing?

411
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,960
I'm the one who brought the food.

412
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,720
These are all my fish.

413
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,020
Please look for others.

414
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,980
Here you go.

415
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,620
I'm going to eat you now!

416
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,100
Eat my food!

417
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,300
Eat my food!

418
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,380
Eat my food.

419
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,560
Eat my food.

420
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:08,960
Damn it.

421
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,700
He's going to turn the tables if I keep this up.

422
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,940
This is amazing.

423
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,220
100 points at once.

424
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,720
What?

425
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,580
Nice Buddy Gal.

426
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,160
Alright, he got it!

427
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,260
It's dirty, Ryo-tsu.

428
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,180
This is my prey.

429
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:24,880
I'm body-wrecking you.

430
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,620
I'm not getting any more!

431
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,320
You're in trouble.

432
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,340
I did it!

433
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,600
Why did I get minus 50 points?!

434
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,460
No way!

435
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,980
What's wrong?

436
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,280
What's wrong?

437
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,700
Nothing.

438
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,200
What's wrong with you?!

439
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,040
It's killing me...

440
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,740
I'm sorry...

441
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,580
Damn it, I have three minutes left.

442
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,800
I'm gonna lose if I keep this up.

443
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,840
I found a big fish!

444
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,100
Alright, let's go home.

445
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,940
I'm sorry.

446
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,760
I'm sorry for making you wait so long.

447
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,300
Here...

448
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,240
You idiot!

449
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,540
You're not supposed to sneak into a girl's classroom!

450
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm really sorry.

451
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,560
It's a draft!

452
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,440
Draw it yourself!

453
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,280
You're lucky to live in a draft.

454
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,260
Shut up!

455
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,800
I've worked as a cop for thirty years.

456
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,960
This is the first time I've ever drawn a draft!

457
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,240
This guy's pretty tough.

458
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,640
Here you go!

459
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,300
Here you go!

460
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,880
Here you go!

461
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,560
Here you go!

462
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,560
Here you go!

463
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,380
Here you go!

464
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,260
Here you go!

465
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:57,980
Here you go!

466
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,480
Here you go!

467
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,620
Here you go!

468
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,100
Here you go!

469
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,760
Here you go!

470
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,080
Here you go!

471
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
Oh, I see.

472
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,460
I see.

473
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,780
How you've suffered.

474
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,260
Are you all kidding?

475
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,680
That old man is crazy.

476
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,860
He's been a fraud-punisher since the moment he built the school library.

477
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,420
You pushed this annoying old man all over me.

478
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,660
Next time on...

479
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,180
Grandpa and the Bomberman!

480
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,160
