1
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,080
THE NIGHT AFTER

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,660
I gazed upon the rising sun

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,240
that floats among the rivers

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,240
I rolled up a stone

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,420
and reaped its fruits

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:32,760
I wonder if I should go to the gym I used to go to

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,080
I laughed at it as it was

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,440
Even if I try to cheer up somehow

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,720
There are only bad things and bad things

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,720
The cityscape that doesn't change even one bad day is strangely kind

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,280
From the waterfront of a cap

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,980
The sun goes down to the taishakuten

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,160
Tomorrow will be over already

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,520
I'm happy again with Katsushika and Shiba

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,860
I feel like I lost it

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,700
I feel like I lost it

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,120
I feel like I lost it

18
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,180
Because I'm a fool

19
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,600
The hair is long, my friend

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,560
Good morning, senpai

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,060
Ryo-chan, your hair is long

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,260
Huh?

23
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,680
Come to think of it, it didn't get cut for a while

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,560
I should have extended it and made it like Kim Taku

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,200
I'll do it like a real man.

26
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,720
Long hair and gangles.

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,600
It's hard to leave a woman alone.

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,140
That's a little...

29
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,320
I definitely don't want to!

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,340
Cut it for me!

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,320
Yeah, I got it.

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,500
What are you doing with those scissors?

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,560
You're the one who cut it.

34
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,320
I can go to the butcher's, right?

35
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,040
I don't have money.

36
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,700
I can't help it.

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,860
I'm sure there was a set of tools in the back, so I'll cut it for you.

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,440
Don't expect too much.

39
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,420
I'm not a professional.

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,200
It's enough if it's short.

41
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,100
But when I look at it again, Ryo-chan's hair is quite thick.

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,020
It looks like it's five times as thick as a normal person's hair.

43
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,560
I can use my head for my legs.

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,600
Reiko, I'll wash your body, too.

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,900
Don't say anything stupid.

46
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,360
Let's get started.

47
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,260
Oh, he's eating.

48
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,060
I can't get out.

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,980
What?

50
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,540
I can't get out.

51
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,060
I can't get out.

52
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,380
I can't get out.

53
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,020
What's wrong?

54
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,540
I have to cut from the root.

55
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,940
He ate again.

56
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,060
What?

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,120
I'll borrow some with the barricade.

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,060
Oh, he ate again and took it away.

59
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:07,600
What?

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Ouch!

61
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,200
This hurts!

62
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,320
Ow!

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,040
What's wrong with you?

64
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,560
Reiko, you're so...

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,520
I'm sorry. I tried my best, but...

66
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,140
You look good in it, Ryo.

67
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,220
Why don't you wear it for a while?

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,340
Don't joke around! It's your fault!

69
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,760
Hey, hey, hey, do something!

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,340
I got it, I got it!

71
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,440
I'll lend you money, so go to the chocolate shop!

72
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,160
Welcome.

73
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,960
Sorry, I'll lend you all the money, so please spare my life.

74
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,360
What are you misunderstanding? I'm just a customer.

75
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,480
Sorry, you were a customer?

76
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,300
Yes.

77
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,480
Sorry, but the manager is out now, so I'm from 5 o'clock.

78
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,300
You're here, aren't you?

79
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,740
Sorry, I'm still in the middle of training.

80
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,440
If you're ready, I'll be your training team.

81
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,880
Really?

82
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,080
Instead, it's free because it's a practice.

83
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,540
Yes!

84
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,580
I'll watch you!

85
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,620
I'll watch you!

86
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,420
I'll watch you!

87
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,920
Yay, I'm already paid for the training.

88
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,260
Yay!

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,860
I've been going to the market for three years.

90
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,260
I can finally use my brain!

91
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,560
Well, please come this way.

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,400
Hmm?

93
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,580
I told you I wanted to see you, but you're used to being treated like this.

94
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,460
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,140
I'm not scolding you.

96
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,160
I'm praising you.

97
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,280
You've been saying sorry for a while.

99
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,180
Stop it.

100
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,060
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,880
Oh, well.

102
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,380
By the way, what's your name?

103
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,020
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,860
I told you to stop.

105
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,860
I'm just asking for your name.

106
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,180
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,300
So don't apologize.

108
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,140
It's your name.

109
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,600
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,800
Are you kidding me?

111
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,200
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,020
But my name is Sumimasen Taro.

114
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,440
What?

115
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,260
Your name?

116
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,080
You're just giving me a random name.

117
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,820
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,040
Sentaro, I'm going to sleep.

119
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
Wake me up when you're done.

120
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,080
Yes, sir.

121
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,620
He's fast.

122
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,560
All right!

123
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,180
Cut!

124
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,280
Cut!

125
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,240
The problem starts here.

126
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,900
I'm not good at shaving my beard.

127
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,960
Let's do it after training.

128
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,540
What's wrong?

129
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm sorry.

130
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,080
It's nothing.

131
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,540
I see.

132
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm worried.

133
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,640
I'm sorry, but I have to do it to be a good employee.

134
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,760
It's not cut.

135
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,040
I see.

136
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,780
This person has a thicker skin than a normal person.

137
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,300
If this is the case, I'll do my best.

138
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,260
My eyebrows!

139
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,720
What's wrong? Are you done?

140
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,320
I'm sorry, I'm not done yet.

141
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,380
I see.

142
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,880
I have to trick him somehow.

143
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,780
Was it this kind of eyebrow?

144
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,360
No, it's not.

145
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,660
This is also not.

146
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,060
It's completely different.

147
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,380
Not like this.

148
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,960
Not like this.

149
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,340
What is it?

150
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,180
Not like this.

151
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,200
That's right!

152
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,180
It was thickly connected.

153
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,860
I feel like it's still different, but it's okay.

154
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,300
Yes, it's over.

155
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,080
I see.

156
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,480
Please come again.

157
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,960
Why are you in a hurry?

158
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,620
If the master finds out, he'll get angry.

159
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,380
I see.

160
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,040
Well then.

161
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,120
Thank you very much.

162
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,920
Yeah!

163
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,960
It's refreshing.

164
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,520
Oh!

165
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,020
Hey, Pramoya!

166
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,940
Ryo?

167
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,700
I went to see you.

168
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,400
You're a man now, aren't you?

169
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,600
Oh, yeah.

170
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,780
I wonder if that's the trend these days.

171
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,180
I went.

172
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,420
Oh, it's pretty refreshing.

173
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,580
It's cool, senpai.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
I see.

175
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,280
Especially this eyebrow is in order.

176
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,120
Oh, it fell.

177
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,940
What?

178
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,740
This is magic.

179
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,680
Oh, my eyebrows!

180
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,880
If you look closely, your head is pretty messy.

181
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,360
The back is super rare.

182
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,060
That's the Minara!

183
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,340
Welcome.

184
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,160
You came again?

185
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,420
Get ready!

186
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,220
You bastard!

187
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,220
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,200
I don't need the police.

191
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,100
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,240
Here I am!

193
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,240
1998

194
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,660
The total amount of hair Wang

195
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,480
And I made my Kyog εκ eyebrows with the man's eyebrows.

196
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,180
What do you think?

197
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,340
They're'll be scary.

198
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,080
You look different, senpa.

199
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,200
It looks good.

200
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,240
What if I do this here?

201
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,300
You came back to normal.

202
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:57,920
I'm back to normal.

203
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,980
You should do something about your hair.

204
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,460
Yeah, that's right.

205
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm going to pass because I have Sentaro here.

206
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,840
A high-tech shop. Sounds interesting.

207
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,780
I see. It's quite high-tech.

208
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,700
Welcome!

209
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,460
How is it?

210
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,900
This is my computer-controlled,

211
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,340
RIOIST, automatic cloth-wrapping machine.

212
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,200
It's pretty good, isn't it?

213
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,940
Thank you very much.

214
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,160
How are you going to do it today?

215
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,500
I'll do a quick angle.

216
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,680
I see.

217
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,420
I'm going to sleep for a while, so wake me up if you can.

218
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,120
That was fast.

219
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,600
Hey! One-Touch Barricade, on standby!

220
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,640
Yes, sir!

221
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,100
Huh?

222
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,440
Stop it!

223
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,900
Sentaro!

224
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,000
Hurry up and learn how to use it!

225
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,980
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,640
You said you wanted to be a RIOIST,

227
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,860
so I hired you to be my client.

228
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,740
I'm sorry.

229
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,500
Then, set the One-Touch Barricade on your client's head.

230
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,940
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,500
Don't let it move on its own.

232
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,880
Yes, sir!

233
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,520
All right, that was easy.

234
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,340
Next, press the blue button...

235
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,420
And then, the cutter will be set to wrap the head.

236
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,040
All right!

237
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,240
Next, press the green button...

238
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,220
And then, the cutter will be set to wrap the head.

239
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,640
What?

240
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,380
It's not working!

241
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,680
It's not working!

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,540
You're jealous, aren't you?

243
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,920
I told you not to let it move!

244
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,540
I'm sorry.

245
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,180
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,580
I hope it's being cut properly.

247
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,300
This...

248
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,540
This man...

249
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,080
What?

250
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:13,960
You know him?

251
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,800
Then, I'll leave the rest to you.

252
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,600
What?

253
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,260
What?

254
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,420
I'll go ahead and hurry up.

255
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,820
Hey, are you sure you don't need to do anything?

256
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,660
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,940
It's a service day today.

258
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,140
There's nothing to apologize for.

259
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,180
Lucky, I hope you'll make it today.

260
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,020
I'm sorry, sir.

261
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,380
That was easy.

262
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,260
Hey, Promo!

263
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,320
Yo, Ryo-san. What's up?

264
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,040
I went for a walk.

265
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,640
You look good today, don't you think?

266
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,240
Yep.

267
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,400
Oh, so that's been the trend lately.

268
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,440
Yeah.

269
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,560
I'm back.

270
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,040
Oh, you're fresh.

271
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,220
You're cool, senpai.

272
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:00,780
Really?

273
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,880
What's wrong with your head?

274
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,440
Oh, I see.

275
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,860
I'm sure you're trying to atone for what you've done so far.

276
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,020
I see.

277
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,340
Come to think of it, you've done a lot of bad things so far.

278
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,580
Senpai finally understood.

279
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,480
What did you say?

280
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,120
I don't like it.

281
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,180
It's written on the back of your head.

282
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,600
What?

283
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,060
What's this?

284
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,000
What?

285
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,020
You just borrowed it by mistake.

286
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,160
I thought it was strange.

287
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,640
Bastard.

288
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,820
I knew it.

289
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,740
You're sorry, aren't you?

290
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,860
Was it your fault again?

291
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,500
Bastard.

292
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,600
I'm sorry.

293
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
You don't need to apologize to the police.

294
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,160
I'm sorry.

295
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,720
I was angry.

296
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,960
I'm really sorry.

297
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,060
I made a wig with that guy's hair, maybe.

298
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,440
It's creepy.

299
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,480
He looks like a different person.

300
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,820
Doesn't it look so pretty with your hair?

301
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,720
I think so, too.

302
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,180
Bukimi

303
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,160
Created by:

304
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,660
Episode 6 Oblivion

305
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,560
Hmph, finally you've grown.

306
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,120
Saying that to a crowd like that, it'll be tearfully uncomfortable!

307
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,300
That's right.

308
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,420
I can't stand here.

309
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,220
I've been ditched around here.

310
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,080
Let's do this right today.

311
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,560
Let's find a place like that.

312
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,900
Hair grows fast and it's hard to shave.

313
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,880
I don't need to grow hair.

314
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,940
Then, I developed a new type of permanent hair removal.

315
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,820
It will never grow again.

316
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,680
That's good. Please make it.

317
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,900
Understood.

318
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,620
Bio? Sounds interesting.

319
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,640
Welcome. Please come in.

320
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,780
It's quite a bio-like atmosphere.

321
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,740
We are applying various bio-research methods to the hair.

322
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,900
In addition to dyeing and hair removal, there are also drugs that can permanently fix the hair.

323
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,520
You can do that?

324
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,980
The power of bio is strong.

325
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,300
Then, please fix my hair with a square cut.

326
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,060
Then, please fix my hair with a square cut.

327
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Then, please fix my hair with a square cut.

328
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,080
I'm sorry, Master.

329
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,040
I have a call from the chairman of the town council.

330
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,020
I have a call from the chairman of the town council.

331
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,400
Please wait a moment.

332
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,100
Yes, it's Kai.

333
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,680
Yes, it's Kai.

334
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,000
A meeting of the town council?

335
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,340
A meeting of the town council?

336
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,980
A meeting of the town council?

337
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,920
Okay, I'll go right away.

338
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,380
Okay, I'll go right away.

339
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Sentaro, please do the permanent hair removal.

340
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,960
Just let the hair soak into it.

341
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,500
Even if you are clumsy, you won't fail, right?

342
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:09,920
Even if you are clumsy, you won't fail, right?

343
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,160
Yes.

344
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,680
Then, I'll be back soon.

345
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,140
Have a nice day.

346
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,440
Which way should I go?

347
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,280
I don't know how to do it properly.

348
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,420
I'm sorry, I'll do it now.

349
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,780
I'll take a nap, so wake me up when you're done.

350
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm sorry, I understand.

351
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,340
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

352
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,060
It's hard to get along with the town council.

353
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,840
Good luck, Master!

354
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:48,020
Good luck, Master!

355
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,780
What's wrong with you?

356
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,280
What's wrong with you?

357
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,400
It's the same guest.

358
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,380
He's the guy next door who does the permanent hair removal.

359
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,820
Is it over?

360
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,300
Not yet.

361
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,060
Not yet.

362
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,900
I see.

363
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,700
Not yet.

364
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:08,840
Not yet.

365
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,420
Not yet.

366
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:09,660
What's wrong?

367
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,180
What's wrong?

368
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,080
What?

369
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,060
Is he that violent?

370
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,980
I'm sorry. I should have noticed earlier.

371
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,060
I hope he hasn't heard the medicine yet.

372
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,860
Please don't listen to him.

373
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,000
He's cold.

374
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,680
He's cold.

375
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,120
Are you done?

376
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,380
I still have a beard.

377
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,420
I see.

378
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,780
I'll leave it to you.

379
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,200
I don't want to die yet.

380
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,960
I'm sorry.

381
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,260
Sir, sir.

382
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,020
It's over.

383
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,760
It's finally over.

384
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,520
It's all settled.

385
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,460
It's as tight as if it were stuck to my head.

386
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,680
It's because of the power of the bio.

387
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,980
How much is it?

388
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,100
I'll give you a free service for the first time.

389
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,440
I see. I'm sorry.

390
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,780
No, it's fine.

391
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,760
I'll come again.

392
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,140
I'll be waiting for you.

393
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,720
I'm going to run away, Sentaro.

394
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,740
I'm sorry.

395
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,920
That was easy.

396
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,960
Hey, Promo.

397
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,100
Ryo?

398
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,420
You went out for a walk.

399
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,100
You're a man now, aren't you?

400
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,820
Yes.

401
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,660
That's what's been a tradition lately.

402
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,380
Thank you very much.

403
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,120
I went.

404
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,080
How about the next time?

405
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,780
I'm afraid...

406
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,480
He was stuck in a mess at the teaware again, wasn't he?

407
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,260
Right?

408
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,300
Ryo!

409
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,100
What is this?

410
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,300
It seems you've been hit again.

411
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,180
Thank you very much.

412
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,600
Thank you for the meal.

413
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,960
That old man!

414
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,520
He ran away.

415
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,920
Damn it!

416
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,760
I'm not going far!

417
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,100
I'm sorry, Master.

418
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,940
It was a big mistake to hire you.

419
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,980
I'm sorry.

420
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,140
I found you!

421
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,220
I'm sorry!

422
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,980
I'm so sorry!

423
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,140
I'm sorry!

424
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,700
I'm sorry!

425
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,520
I'm so sorry!

426
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,400
It was your fault again!

427
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,480
You did it!

428
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,760
You're not my friend!

429
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,520
I'm sorry!

430
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,600
I'm sorry!

431
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,920
I'm sorry!

432
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,320
I'm sorry!

433
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,720
I don't need the police!

434
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,140
What?

435
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,860
I'll never grow hair again!

436
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,100
Yes.

437
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,560
I'm getting rid of my hair follicles with the power of the powerful bio.

438
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,000
It's a good opportunity.

439
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,140
If you can eat up the actions you've done so far,

440
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,680
you can be a priest.

441
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,220
I'm not kidding!

442
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,220
It's all your fault.

443
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,160
What are you going to do?

444
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,940
I'm sorry!

445
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm sorry!

446
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,120
I'm sorry!

447
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,760
It's your fault that everyone is going to be working for Re-O yep.

448
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,120
I'm sorry.

449
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,660
I promise to be my companion's good friend in the countryside.

450
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,340
You don't know that.

451
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,940
It won't help if you go on as a good friend.

452
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,060
You have to give up now!

453
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,900
I think so, too.

454
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,740
It's your hair, but it might work.

455
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,980
What?

456
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,980
NSFW

457
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,100
January 5th, 2006

458
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,940
developed a powerful medicine for hair loss.

459
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,760
Even if the hair is gone, it'll grow back.

460
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,620
That's good, Ryo.

461
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,380
Now I'm relieved.

462
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,460
Okay!

463
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,040
Good morning, Senpai.

464
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:17,640
Oh!

465
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,220
Okay.

466
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,540
It's already growing back?

467
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,700
Yes.

468
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,500
It's because I'm doing it on a daily basis.

469
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,740
That's strange.

470
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,280
According to the research center, it should take about a week for hair to grow back.

471
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,540
Don't compare me to the average people.

472
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
My hair is special.

473
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,260
If you say so...

474
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:38,660
That's right.

475
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,560
Oh?

476
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,600
But Ryo-chan, hasn't your hair grown longer than before?

477
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,400
It's definitely grown, Senpai.

478
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:45,760
Yes.

479
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,940
What's this?

480
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,300
Hey!

481
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,660
I can't see the front!

482
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,340
Hey!

483
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,400
The speed is too fast!

484
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,140
It's growing faster than expected!

485
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,180
Hurry up and do something!

486
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,720
Hurry up and do something!

487
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,160
Hurry up and do something!

488
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,360
The research center should have a growth inhibitor.

489
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,140
If you use it...

490
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,240
Wait!

491
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,660
This is too much for me!

492
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,560
Don't do it to me!

493
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,280
Are you okay, Senpai?

494
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,260
I'm glad my hair became a cushion.

495
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,580
I have no choice.

496
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,480
I'll go get the medicine.

497
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,540
Senpai, please don't move.

498
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,720
I'm counting on you, Senpai.

499
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:26,780
I'm going!

500
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,120
...

501
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,840
I guess...

502
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,560
I don't have any talent, after all.

503
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,260
....

504
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,100
???

505
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,480
???

506
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,040
???

507
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,800
???

508
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,580
???

509
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,580
???

510
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,720
???

511
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:56,780
You are a cancer!

512
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,140
But I...

513
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,440
I...

514
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I didn't know I'd have grown this much.

515
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,720
I'm going to put out a fire right before you.

516
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,120
Roger that.

517
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,120
What's wrong?

518
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,140
The God is stuck in the rotor and can't be controlled.

519
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,120
What?

520
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:46,880
That's...

521
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,340
Hey, Nakagawa!

522
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:48,900
Are you okay?

523
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,500
I'm fine.

524
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
The God has become a cushion and saved me.

525
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,000
But from here,

526
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,700
I don't think we can get out of here.

527
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,120
To get here is a difficult task.

528
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,000
Okay, I have an idea.

529
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,140
Senpai!

530
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,620
Put the medicine in the ball and shoot your head directly.

531
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,160
Please turn your head to me.

532
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,100
I got it!

533
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,900
It's only one shot.

534
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,340
If you miss it, it's over.

535
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,120
You know my gun skills, right?

536
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,560
Don't worry!

537
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,940
I've been using it since I was a child.

538
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,100
I've been aiming for the best.

539
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,380
I can't give up at my youth.

540
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,840
That's right! I'm young!

541
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,000
What if I fail once or twice?

542
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:33,960
What should I do?

543
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,080
Okay, fire!

544
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,600
I'm still working hard!

545
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,660
The growth inhibitor...

546
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,380
It's you again, Sentarou!

547
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,360
I'm sorry!

548
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,440
You don't have to apologize!

549
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
I'm sorry!

550
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,020
I'm sorry!

551
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,540
I'm sorry!

552
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,020
If you want to play baseball,

553
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,600
don't play like this.

554
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,440
Don't play like this.

555
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,120
Out! Safe!

556
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,500
Nice, nice!

557
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,640
Next time, we'll play baseball games!

558
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,200
See you next time!

559
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,680
Next time, we'll play baseball games!

560
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,160
