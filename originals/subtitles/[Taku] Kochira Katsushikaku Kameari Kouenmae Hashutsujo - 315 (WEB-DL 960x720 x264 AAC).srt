Kei-chan, that hair is wonderful!

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,440
Do you know?

34
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,580
Mouche Francois, right?

35
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,500
Mouche? Francois?

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,460
Yes, he is a friend's hair-making artist living in Paris.

37
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,460
His staff went to the shop in Roppongi this time, so they came to the opening ceremony.

38
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,660
I was also invited and had the latest cut of spring.

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,520
How is it?

40
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,560
It's light, natural and spring-like. As expected of a scissors champion.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,320
Honda-kun, do you know?

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,860
Well, it looks the same as usual.

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,460
It's the same as usual. It's hair. It doesn't matter if it's there.

44
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,240
It can't be helped if a man wears only cool clothes.

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,520
Nakagawa! Nakagawa-san is cool! Please sign it!

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,900
Shut up!

47
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,920
Sign? Nakagawa is not an idol.

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,100
Damn it, it was almost finished, but it's remade again.

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,800
I'm sure Reiko-san went to London and had the cut, right?

50
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,900
Yes, to Mrs. Elizabeth.

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,200
No, are you going abroad on purpose for a three-part?

52
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,960
Rich people are different after all.

53
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,580
When I was just a policeman, I used to travel abroad in a Concorde for haircuts.

54
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,740
Concorde...

55
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,280
During my training period, I had a hair stylist come to see me at the charter school.

56
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,120
Charter school?

57
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,200
Ding-dong!

58
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,300
Oh, wow it's a charter school, the others aíl wasted money and spent useless money on my hair,

59
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,440
It's a hair sixth.

60
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:11,080
Even though you said that, your hairstyle was a big point that determined your impression of the person, right?

61
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,360
Speaking of which, Senpai is always awie, aren't you tickled the same?

62
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,760
My Angle of´Bird´sел rat is simply easy to order, I'm done with it.

63
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,500
If there's a cheap shop even for one yen it won't be expensive for you.

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,800
He drives his bike anywhere he wants.

65
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,480
My policy is that I don't care about his hair.

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,560
That's right. If you're a senior, you might want to cut your hair at that shop.

67
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,720
What?

68
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,000
There's a shop that specializes in cutting hair in Fukagawa.

69
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,380
Specializing in cutting hair?

70
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,240
Yes, but the owner there is a little different.

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,420
He's a little difficult to get along with.

72
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,480
What?

73
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,700
He doesn't like customers who don't like it.

74
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,100
What's that?

75
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,760
But he doesn't take money from customers he likes.

76
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,500
Really?

77
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,260
He's like a craftsman in the city.

78
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,100
I think he'll be popular again.

79
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,400
He's popular in cutting hair.

80
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,460
I heard that he'll have a cutting hair boom soon.

81
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,720
Okay.

82
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,080
Get the car, Honda.

83
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,880
That's the shop, the owner of Ryotsu.

84
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,980
Yes.

85
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,440
It's a normal shop except for the square signboard.

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,540
I'm scared of my father.

87
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,880
You bastard!

88
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,620
He's getting beaten up.

89
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't show me that head again!

90
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,460
I'll beat you up, old man Kakugari!

91
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,400
I'll beat you up, old man Kakugari!

92
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,440
I'll beat you up, old man Kakugari!

93
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,960
I'll beat you up, old man Kakugari!

94
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
I'll beat you up, old man Kakugari!

95
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,420
I'll beat you up, old man Kakugari!

96
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:55,700
I'll beat you up, old man Kakugari!

97
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,020
You bastard!

98
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,900
I see.

99
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,880
What should I do for the eyesore?

100
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,960
I haven't been in the shop since I'm not a fan of Kakugari.

101
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,060
I haven't been in the shop since I'm not a fan of Kakugari.

102
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,100
I don't like being scared.

103
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,760
I don't like being scared.

104
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:08,920
What's that?

105
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,800
Never mind.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,740
It's not like I need a smile just to be cut.

107
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,280
The eyesore here is my specialty.

108
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,400
What's that?

109
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,180
Senpai, be careful.

110
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,640
Yeah.

111
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,200
If I don't come back alive, I'll ask Kameyari for help.

112
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,660
Senpai...

113
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,540
What a blind face.

114
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,620
Where did you come from?

115
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,900
Money!

116
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,580
The match starts now.

117
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:38,760
I feel it.

118
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,400
I'm Hikaenasu.

119
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,980
I was born in Ryotsu, Kankichi.

120
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,980
I'm a smart guy.

121
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,060
I live in Kameyari now.

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:50,760
Oh.

123
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,860
I'm Shibata.

124
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,600
Is this where you learn about Kaku-gari?

125
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,280
I was born to be a guy.

126
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,980
I've never tried any other hairstyle other than Kaku-gari.

127
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm clumsy.

128
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,160
Wait here.

129
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,800
Yes!

130
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,860
You're amazing, Asagawa-senpai!

131
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
You easily beat the first member.

132
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,680
The models look scary, too.

133
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,560
I'm not sure if I can beat them.

134
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,820
But Kaku-gari suits you.

135
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
The signboard, cream, and hairspray.

136
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,360
Even the decoration.

137
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,620
You're so good at everything.

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,960
You're a Kaku-gari master.

139
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,120
Done!

140
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,280
No turning back this time.

141
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,460
Too bad.

142
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,440
Turning back?

143
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:56,880
Next.

144
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,600
Yeah!

145
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,060
One Kaku-gari.

146
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,460
Before we start,

147
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,600
there are a lot of rituals.

148
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,540
A barricade on the hairpin.

149
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,700
Alright!

150
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,040
What's this?

151
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,780
What's next?

152
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,800
You're as good as you think.

153
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,100
You have a straight hair,

154
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,660
thick eyebrows,

155
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,400
and a thick neck.

156
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,580
You were born to be a Kaku-gari.

157
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,860
Thank you.

158
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,080
This is the first time I've ever been praised for my face.

159
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,020
I guess I've never been praised for my face before.

160
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,500
I feel like the manager likes you.

161
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,320
Most young men these days

162
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,100
are barely as good as you.

163
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,400
But when it comes to Kaku-gari,

164
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,480
you're not good.

165
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,820
You're not good enough.

166
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,740
OK.

167
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,340
This is it.

168
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,540
I eat all kinds of soft food.

169
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,260
My chin won't grow.

170
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,860
Dad!

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,300
Hey!

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,780
Don't move!

173
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,380
I'm coming.

174
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,700
This is more than 4,000 hairpins.

175
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,200
He's quiet.

176
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,280
How was it?

177
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,060
You got your manly face up, right?

178
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,500
Yeah.

179
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,940
I went whoop in the back.

180
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,060
That was a fun day today.

181
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,940
No big deal.

182
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,300
Lucky.

183
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,380
It is necessary to do that.

184
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,660
Sorry.

185
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:49,900
Bro,

186
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,720
buy it first.

187
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,640
Oh?

188
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,200
Some change?

189
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,400
My dream is that

190
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,080
all men around the world

191
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,540
may be Kaku-gari!

192
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,560
All over the world?

193
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

194
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,600
Senior Asugawa, you got a point for the first time.

195
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,740
What? A point?

196
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,500
Seriously?

197
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,240
That's amazing!

198
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,820
What are they?

199
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,940
I'm envious of you because you got a free pass for the first time.

200
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,260
What? A free pass for the first time?

201
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
This guy had such a great score.

202
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,000
What's with him?

203
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,520
I'm scared of Ryo-san's head.

204
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,200
I've been popular with girls for a long time,

205
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,800
but I was the most popular one for kids.

206
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,940
Is it because of this place?

207
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,140
We have to wait until they grow.

208
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,600
But the customers like Shibata's store.

209
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,760
They even give out things like this.

210
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,540
Is it a business?

211
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,600
It's rumored that the internal affairs are pretty strict.

212
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,220
He's really a stupid old man.

213
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,120
But if Shibata's management doesn't get better...

214
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,540
Then...

215
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,280
Then the free pass is a given.

216
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,300
No, it's not.

217
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,620
What? That's a problem.

218
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,580
What's a problem, Ryo-chan?

219
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,620
N-nothing.

220
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
Huh? Reiko-san, that hair looks great.

221
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,180
Oh, you know?

222
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,640
Yeah.

223
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,960
I don't get it at all.

224
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,340
It's natural and casual, like she's taking over the era.

225
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,340
As expected of Miss Elizabeth, the Scissors Queen.

226
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,240
There's a World Scissors Contest this weekend in Tokyo.

227
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,460
So, I came here suddenly.

228
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,940
I got a call earlier and got my hair cut for lunch break.

229
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,220
Miss Elizabeth is participating in the World Scissors Contest?

230
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,160
That's right.

231
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,480
I was asked to be the hair model for the day.

232
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,100
Me too.

233
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,460
I got a call from Monsieur Francois earlier.

234
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,540
If Monsieur Francois is participating in the contest,

235
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,820
it's a one-stop shop with Miss Elizabeth, right?

236
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,800
That's right.

237
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,240
What's that World Scissors Contest?

238
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,060
It's a world-wide hair cut contest

239
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,620
that is selected by hair stylists from all over the world.

240
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,320
So, it's going to be held in Tokyo.

241
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,560
Will you get a prize?

242
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,820
I heard the prize is 10 million yen.

243
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,080
10 million yen?

244
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,340
Honda, you said that the Scissors is going to be popular soon, right?

245
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,820
Yeah, it's a rumor in the Fukagawa area.

246
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,740
If you're going to talk about the spread of Scissors and the good of the market,

247
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:28,960
I think it's for the money.

248
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,100
If you're going to talk about the spread of Scissors and the good of the market,

249
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,180
I think it's for the money.

250
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,880
My dream is to make all the men in the world a hair cut.

251
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm not going to refuse that stubborn guy.

252
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,140
I'm not going to refuse that stubborn guy.

253
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,100
Maybe, senpai…

254
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,480
I'm going to pull Barber Shibata into Scissors Contest.

255
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,460
Barber Shibata

256
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:45,780
Barber Shibata

257
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:45,840
Barber Shibata

258
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,480
Barber Shibata

259
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,960
Barber Shibata

260
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,140
Barber Shibata

261
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,420
Barber Shibata

262
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:58,960
Barber Shibata

263
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,960
Barber Shibata

264
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,460
Barber Shibata

265
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,640
Barber Shibata

266
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,140
Barber Shibata

267
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,320
Barber Shibata

268
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,840
Barber Shibata

269
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,380
Barber Shibata

270
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:10,840
Barber Shibata

271
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,320
Barber Shibata

272
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,860
Barber Shibata

273
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,080
Barber Shibata

274
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,500
Barber Shibata

275
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,540
Barber Shibata

276
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:13,900
Barber Shibata

277
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,500
Barber Shibata

278
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,780
Barber Shibata

279
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,120
Barber Shibata

280
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,840
Barber Shibata

281
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,620
Barber Shibata

282
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,180
Barber Shibata

283
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,380
Barber Shibata

284
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,140
Barber Shibata

285
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,360
Barber Shibata

286
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,860
Barber Shibata

287
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,620
Barber Shibata

288
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,080
You can't be like that, Ishiatama.

289
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,780
Huh?

290
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,060
What happened the other day?

291
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,980
You bastard, what did you want to say?

292
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,700
I talked about the contest with Ishiatama the other day.

293
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,580
And then...

294
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,360
You can't just keep on talking about it!

295
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,720
Look at the world more!

296
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,500
Shut up!

297
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,660
Don't ever show me that bright head again!

298
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,960
Get lost, Kaku-gari-jiji!

299
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,380
Why are you looking at me like that?

300
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,660
Senpai, that's a bad guy.

301
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,700
Shibata, you two are parents, aren't you?

302
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,020
I'm not afraid of leaving Fukagawa after all.

303
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,400
You don't say!

304
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,720
Then let's have a contest!

305
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,660
Here's an example.

306
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,740
Yes.

307
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,680
The Riyoshi Association wrote a letter of recommendation for you with two replies.

308
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,840
I went around the neighborhood and heard that if Barber Shibata was to participate, he'd be cheering for you.

309
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,880
Everyone is looking forward to you!

310
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,340
Let's take the world with Kaku-gari!

311
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,580
Dad.

312
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,640
I understand. But only this time.

313
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,880
No way!

314
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,320
The prize is one in a million.

315
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,360
The contest will be in one Kaku-gari.

316
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,580
But that place is flashy, so Kaku-gari alone won't stand out.

317
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,600
That's the aim.

318
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,660
Honda.

319
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,180
Yes?

320
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,560
Yes.

321
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,620
Honda, contestant three.

322
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,520
Simples is best.

323
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,640
Look at the colorful and flashy scenery and play satisfied with all the black hair that stands out!

324
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,920
You're not talking about hairstyles. Your face is the main evolutionary factor.

325
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,980
Furthermore, the judges are mostly foreigners.

326
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,180
The votingés are from Tokyo.

327
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,280
So that's a good thing -- you already know the taste of Kaku-gari.

328
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,140
That's a bit boring, isn't it?

329
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,700
What?

330
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,620
It seems like if there was no blood, Kaku-gari wouldn't exist.

331
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,060
It's like you're not going to win

332
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,420
That's not what I meant

333
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,800
What do you mean, Honda?

334
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,840
In other words, you're the best at fighting

335
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,380
But you're weak

336
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,660
What's weak?

337
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,180
You think I'm second place?

338
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,280
Say something

339
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,740
You need a model that looks good at fighting to participate in the contest

340
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,180
I can't do that

341
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,000
Don't worry, I'll be the model

342
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,480
But the contest is over, right?

343
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,600
If you don't have a hair to cut, I won't be able to participate

344
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,100
Don't worry

345
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,440
Ta-dah

346
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,080
What's that?

347
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,240
You need to get the medicine

348
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,920
This spring, Nakagawa Chemical will be releasing the ultimate medicine

349
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,300
I got this from the back of my hand

350
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,600
Put this on your head

351
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,080
Rub it well

352
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,360
Wait a little

353
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,800
Oh?

354
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,640
It's about time

355
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:20,980
What?

356
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,420
You're like a primitive

357
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,000
I think I put on too much

358
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,520
Anyway, I'll be the best at fighting in Japan

359
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,800
I'll be the best at fighting in Japan

360
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,280
And I'll be the best at fighting in the world

361
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,820
I'll win for sure

362
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,740
Good

363
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,080
I have another plan

364
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,860
But I won't reveal it now

365
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,140
The next day

366
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,180
The next day

367
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,320
Let's go, Shibata!

368
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,720
Do you mean Takada's father?

369
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,620
Yes

370
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,660
Let's go!

371
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,620
Hurray, hurray Shibata!

372
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,720
Hurray, hurray Shibata!

373
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,320
Sorry to keep you waiting

374
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,680
We have a special guest

375
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,440
He's theислijke for the Sizzards

376
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:13,300
We will give him 100.000 yen

377
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,320
and a pair of scissors

378
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,420
That's enough!

379
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,920
Give it to me!

380
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,060
This pattern is broadcasted worldwide on satellite broadcast.

381
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,280
World Scissors Contest 2004!

382
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,820
Oh, it's started!

383
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,380
Now, the players will enter.

384
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:46,660
Oh, it's Reiko! Reiko, you can do it!

385
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,980
You're a hairdresser, aren't you?

386
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,760
That's fine.

387
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,600
Oh, there's Nakagawa!

388
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,540
Huh?

389
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,740
Nakagawa, you can do it!

390
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,100
What are you talking about?

391
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,040
I found a primitive man!

392
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,360
What? What's that hair?

393
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,120
He's like a real primitive man!

394
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,360
Shigata, you seem to be on a stage you're not used to.

395
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,960
I think everyone else is used to the contest.

396
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,160
Ah!

397
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,820
I fell!

398
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,280
Dad, are you okay?

399
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,180
I just got out of Fukagawa for the first time, so I'm a little nervous.

400
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,940
If I start to borrow, I'll be the same everywhere.

401
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,660
Alright!

402
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,140
The contest will have a technical department competing for accurate and elegant scissors,

403
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,940
and an art department to show off their originality.

404
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,140
Originality?

405
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,860
The two departments will decide the winner.

406
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,940
The total score of three top three people will be awarded with the Scissors Master Award.

407
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,860
The judges will be the world-renowned mass media, fashion designers,

408
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,020
and the public opinion experts.

409
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,800
Then, the technical department of the first stage, start!

410
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,980
You have twenty minutes.

411
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,400
Let's scissors!

412
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,900
Dad, you can do it!

413
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,040
Senpai, you can do it!

414
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,900
I'm sorry!

415
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,480
It's okay, so calm down!

416
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,020
You can do what you always do!

417
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,840
Leave the rest to me!

418
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,420
Okay.

419
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,560
You don't have to worry.

420
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,360
I'll take 10 million yen!

421
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,220
Whoa!

422
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,820
Huh?

423
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,280
That's… that's some hair!

424
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,040
What?!

425
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,180
Why is it growing?

426
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:28,860
How did this happen?

427
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,180
It's gonna be fine!

428
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,540
It's growing!

429
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,580
What is going on?

430
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,920
Could this be…

431
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,260
Alright, that's good.

432
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,040
You're doing good!

433
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,220
Shibata seems to have gotten better.

434
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,200
He seems to be feeling good.

435
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,300
Yeah!

436
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,280
*Badass music*

437
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,900
Alright, I'm done!

438
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,780
Finished!

439
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,220
Wonderful!

440
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,020
Beautiful!

441
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,000
I got the first stage!

442
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,960
*Giggle*

443
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,180
Next time, I'll be the best and get 10 million!

444
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,320
Senpai!

445
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,640
Eh? No, this is bad.

446
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,720
What did you say?

447
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,760
I think you mixed Kei-chan's company's medicine into everyone's spray!

448
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,300
This!

449
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,780
W-What are you talking about?

450
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,780
*Giggle*

451
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,940
Eh? Ah! W-What are you doing?

452
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,680
*Giggle*

453
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,400
I knew it!

454
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,340
During the competition, the most important proof is that Senpai's hair was the only thing he wanted to drink!

455
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,700
Do I have proof that I did it?

456
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,140
When, what time, how many minutes, how many seconds?

457
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,020
Don't say things like that!

458
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,400
Ryo-chan is the only one who thinks like that!

459
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,260
That's right!

460
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,180
That kind of hair won't be a match!

461
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,860
Give up on winning!

462
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,200
There's no cheating in the second stage!

463
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,660
Next is the art department.

464
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,820
Then, the second stage!

465
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,960
Let's start the evaluation of the art department!

466
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,220
The time required is 30 minutes!

467
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,240
Listen! The enemy will decide in a flashy way, but don't be fooled by such things!

468
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,220
Just attack with a square!

469
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,420
Good!

470
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,540
Ah!

471
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Please show your originality as much as possible!

472
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,940
Let's start!

473
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,080
Eh?

474
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,380
What does originality mean?

475
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:05,620
Eh?

476
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,080
Well, it means that you are unique or that you have no other hairstyle, but...

477
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,880
Unique?

478
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,740
What's wrong, Shibata?

479
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,160
Look, Dad!

480
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,880
No, well...

481
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,660
They're already moving on...

482
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,320
Don't worry about others!

483
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,740
Ah...

484
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,220
Huh?!

485
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,900
It's a square!

486
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,680
We're just square!

487
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,920
Ah...

488
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,680
What's wrong?

489
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,860
Square cutting is tradition!

490
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,960
Is it okay without original hand?

491
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,140
It's okay!

492
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,760
But isn't the square cutting too plain after all?

493
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,680
No, it's fine.

494
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,800
When it's a flashy on parade, the plain ones stand out.

495
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,280
We just had a meeting yesterday.

496
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,500
Don't be confused.

497
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,460
Dad.

498
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,980
Nowaday, the kakugari is not popular.

499
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,740
Look at the world more.

500
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,440
Look at the world more.

501
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,440
Okay.

502
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,320
It's cold.

503
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,860
Shut up.

504
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,760
What are you doing?

505
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,120
Don't move.

506
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,580
Nowaday, the kakugari is not popular.

507
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,800
Look at the world more.

508
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,720
What are you going to do?

509
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,700
30 seconds left.

510
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,060
Time up.

511
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,220
I did it.

512
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:41,940
Okay.

513
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,640
No way.

514
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,740
What?

515
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,120
Shibata.

516
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,080
Dad.

517
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,040
What's wrong?

518
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,600
What?

519
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,640
What's this guy?

520
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,200
What?

521
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,040
What?

522
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,160
What?

523
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,920
What?

524
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,160
What?

525
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,600
What?

526
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:19,960
What?

527
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,720
What?

528
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,440
What?

529
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,020
It's Kenichi.

530
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,840
I thought the kakugari wasn't bad.

531
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,460
He quit running and started working at home.

532
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,800
It's a celebration of his adulthood.

533
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,560
It's a celebration of his adulthood.

534
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,900
I'm glad I got a hold of him.

535
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,200
I'm glad I got a hold of him.

536
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,740
I wasn't able to find him, though.

537
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,580
I wasn't able to find him, though.

538
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,280
What's with him?

539
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,980
He's clumsy, so he doesn't like it.

540
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,920
He's clumsy, so he doesn't like it.

541
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,700
He's troubled by his health.

542
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,300
I see.

543
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,180
Ryo.

544
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,320
I've been looking after you.

545
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:52,860
I've been looking after you.

546
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,120
Thank you.

547
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,260
No, I'm not going to treat you like that.

548
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,920
I'm going to buy the head of the customer.

549
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,640
I've got more money.

550
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,700
It's going to be hard to manage.

551
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,880
No, it's okay.

552
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,020
I'm going to take care of it.

553
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,340
I'll see.

554
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,200
Oh, Ryo-san, can you please take this off?

555
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,160
You're not allowed to use the free pass.

556
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,140
What?!

557
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,480
I'm sorry about that.

558
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,780
I'll take the money, so if you don't apologize, I'll call the police!

559
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,180
Oh, there he is!

560
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,580
Hey, you were on TV the other day, right?

561
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,300
You're a thief, aren't you?

562
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,620
Can you just do it?

563
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,120
Hey!

564
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,380
You guys are suddenly talking back?

565
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,140
You're a guest, so don't get carried away.

566
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,980
Wh-what are you doing?

567
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,220
I'm telling the seniors to be careful how they talk.

568
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,920
Otherwise...

569
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,980
I'll do it like this!

570
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,060
Please forgive me for that.

571
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,460
I'm going to play with people's heads!

I made a bicycle for Lemon

590
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,100
What? You stole it?

591
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,220
I won't forgive you! I'll let you know what will happen if you make me angry!

592
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,500
I don't have a bicycle!

593
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,960
Next time on Cycle Big Operation!
