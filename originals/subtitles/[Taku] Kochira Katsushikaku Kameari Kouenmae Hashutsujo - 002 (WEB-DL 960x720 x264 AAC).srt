00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,060
"Summer is here again this year!"

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,360
"Summer is here again this year!"

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,940
"Summer is here again this year!"

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,160
"Summer is here again this year!"

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:24,880
"Summer is here again this year!"

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,040
"Summer is here again this year!"

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,360
"Summer is here again this year!"

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,500
"Summer is here again this year!"

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,960
"Summer is here again this year!"

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,680
"Summer is here again this year!"

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:47,920
"Summer is here again this year!"

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,740
"Summer is here again this year!"

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,080
"Summer is here again this year!"

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,700
"Summer is here again this year!"

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,200
"Summer is here again this year!"

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,500
"Summer is here again this year!"

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,500
"Summer is here again this year!"

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,740
Nagisa-de

19
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,580
Puri puri puri puri puri puri puri puri

20
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,360
Puri puri puri puri puri puri puri puri

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,620
Minami Kaze ni Horiu

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,700
Minami Kaze ni Horiu

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,460
Nagisa-de

24
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,160
Purupuru

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,860
Nagisa-de

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,660
Purupuri

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,160
A Newcomer From the Sky

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,240
It's a nice day.

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,080
Something good is going to happen on a day like this.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,060
It's quiet.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,700
It's too quiet.

32
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,400
That means...

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,560
You're late again!

34
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,020
Ryo- Ryo- Ryo-tsu is working!

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,700
He's been like this since two hours before he came to work.

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,380
We were just talking about it, thinking it might rain.

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,300
I'm very moved right now.

38
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,640
I've been a policeman for 30 years, and I've never been this happy!

39
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,720
Sir, you don't have to be so moved.

40
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,700
Ryo-tsu finally woke up to work.

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,720
The hardships he's gone through have been rewarded.

42
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,800
All right!

43
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,340
You're great, Ryo-tsu!

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,600
I knew you'd do it someday!

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,420
By the way, what documents were you writing?

46
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,060
What do you mean, I don't want to!

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,200
Did you forget, sir?

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,780
Didn't you say it yesterday?

49
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,900
You said you'd submit the remaining death certificate.

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,320
Death certificate?

51
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,940
I wrote it all down.

52
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,720
My hands are frozen.

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,320
You idiot!

54
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,880
Ryo-tsu!

55
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,900
Ryo-tsu!

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,600
Ryo-tsu!

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,680
You're a...

58
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,500
Sir, are you all right?

59
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,680
I'm sorry. I need to go to the bathroom.

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,860
Yes, sir.

61
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,560
You drank too much, sir.

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,180
You're old enough. You need to take it easy.

63
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:20,820
It's dangerous.

64
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,800
What? It's all your fault!

65
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,040
Sir, calm down.

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,940
If you get too angry, you'll get a broken heart.

67
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,460
Huh!

68
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,280
I can't believe I had such a bad subordinate.

69
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,340
I have no choice but to give up.

70
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,320
I remembered it as a subordinate.

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,940
Is Nakagawa still here?

72
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,580
Mr. Nakagawa?

73
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,740
He's a new employee who's coming to this station today.

74
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,800
What kind of person is he?

75
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,260
Oh, he's pretty handsome.

76
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,300
He stayed in New York until he was 16.

77
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,480
I see.

78
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,700
So he has a job in the same place as Riko.

79
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,380
Yes.

80
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,100
He has a driver's license, a boat and an airplane license.

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,660
And he's a sports and a language expert.

82
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,900
He's a great shooter.

83
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,960
Who is this Nakagawa?

84
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,520
He's the head of the Nakagawa family.

85
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,440
The Nakagawa family?

86
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,380
Is that the Nakagawa family that has five fingers in the world?

87
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,440
Is that Nakagawa's fortune?

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,500
Yes.

89
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,180
What's that Nakagawa something?

90
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,240
It's a fortune-telling shop.

91
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,500
It's not a fortune-telling shop.

92
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,740
It's a fortune-telling shop.

93
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,500
It's a conch.

94
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,520
What's that? A conch shop?

95
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,280
Oh.

96
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,040
No, it's not.

97
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,120
Riko.

98
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:37,800
Yes?

99
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,720
Don't talk to that idiot.

100
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,900
He'll hurt his stomach like me.

101
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,640
Yes.

102
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,780
Hmm.

103
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,020
You're such a hard-working police officer.

104
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,220
You don't have a job.

105
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,360
I'll say goodbye to you soon.

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,580
Then, Ryotsu.

107
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,640
So don't do that.

108
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,560
You must instruct Nakagawa.

109
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,880
Now, now.

110
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,840
How about that?

111
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,460
Isn't it great?

112
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
The combat rescue type of the American Black Hawk.

113
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,740
Is it?

114
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:19,840
I'm so tired.

115
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,240
So that's what you were doing yesterday, skipping work?

116
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Well, well, if you find out, you'll be in big trouble.

117
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,900
Well...

118
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:31,920
Hm?

119
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,020
That's strange.

120
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,480
What's with that slouch?

121
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,480
What's with that locker?

122
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,340
Oh, right! I remember!

123
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,860
When did you get that?

124
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,060
What's with that?

125
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,480
You didn't know?

126
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,180
He's completely turned the exhaust into a private one.

127
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,860
Good, good.

128
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,220
There!

129
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:04,980
There!

130
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,240
Good boy!

131
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,440
Anyway, you sure made a lot of stuff.

132
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,360
I wish I could use this passion for work at least a little bit.

133
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,940
You're always using it, aren't you?

134
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,540
Yeah!

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,640
Sorry, sorry.

136
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,740
Jo-chan!

137
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,560
Ryo?

138
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,820
What's going on?

139
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,700
Are you all right, Ryo?

140
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,920
I thought you were going to die.

141
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
Oh, by the way, where's Ellie?

142
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,060
Ellie?

143
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,520
She flew out.

144
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,460
Wow!

145
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,220
Oh, we got three hundred thousand yen!

146
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,240
I'll pay her when we lose the money.

147
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,300
I'm not kidding.

148
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,080
The bad thing is you, right?

149
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,820
Shit, I'm so screwed...

150
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,420
Wow, it's Ellie.

151
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,020
It's the best셨!

152
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,280
She brought her friends over!

153
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,500
I'm out of breath!

154
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,720
Give me that gun!

155
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
What are you talking about?

156
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,160
Huh?

157
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,940
Wh- what's going on?

158
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,000
The train is coming this way!

159
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,900
Wh- what?

160
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,520
What's that?

161
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,580
Shiro, what the hell is that?

162
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,060
It's a bomb!

163
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,540
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-...

164
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,320
Ya-ho!

165
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,040
Everyone, I'm late.

166
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,160
I've been working at the power station from today.

167
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,880
I'm Keiichi Nakagawa.

168
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,780
Nice to meet you.

169
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,480
You!

170
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,840
You broke my helicopter!

171
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,680
Huh?

172
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,520
Huh?

173
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
It's a Walther MPL submachine gun!

174
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,280
You know what? I'm so happy.

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
By the way, this is the gun.

176
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh! It's the same gun as the Dirty Harry!

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,700
That movie was awesome!

178
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,560
Oh, if you don't mind, can I apologize for breaking the helicopter?

179
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,820
Really? That's boring!

180
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,280
No, we still have a lot of them.

181
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,000
Do you want to come see them next time?

182
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,120
Yeah, I'm coming!

183
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,680
You idiot!

184
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,520
What are you thinking about?

185
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,760
I'm calling for help!

186
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,000
So, you can't take this either?

187
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,460
Of course not.

188
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,380
Tellai, go get it.

189
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,860
Yes, sir!

190
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,780
I'm getting a little too excited.

191
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,640
I'm going to the office, so you can take care of it, Eiko.

192
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,460
You sure have a good eye.

193
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,920
My name is Ryo. Nice to meet you.

194
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm Ryo.

195
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,700
Oh, you're the super famous Ryochi from the senior department.

196
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,720
Nice to meet you.

197
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,380
I'm so happy to have two of you.

198
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,920
You're the one that's happy.

199
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,540
Hehehe.

200
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,200
Huh?

201
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,720
That helicopter is for the next world?

202
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,880
Hmm...

203
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,980
You're rich, despite being a konnyaku shop.

204
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,260
A konnyaku shop?

205
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,420
Hehehe.

206
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,460
Anyway, why did you become a police officer, Nakagawa-san?

207
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,820
Well...

208
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,780
I've lived in New York for many years, where crime is common.

209
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,300
I've always been a police officer who fights for the people's lives.

210
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,760
I've always been a police officer who fights for the people's lives.

211
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,580
Anyway, you're wearing a fancy uniform.

212
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,140
Huh?

213
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,960
I see.

214
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,160
I think it's more of a problem than a gun.

215
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,220
Really?

216
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,460
Japanese police uniforms are not that good.

217
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,080
I was an order maid in Germany.

218
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,220
I see.

219
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,380
I think it was about 1 million yen.

220
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,600
Wow!

221
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,700
1 million yen!

222
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,760
Wow!

223
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,840
I don't think I can afford such a cheap uniform!

224
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,520
I don't think you can afford such a cheap uniform!

225
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,260
I don't think I can afford such a cheap uniform!

226
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,240
Don't you agree?

227
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,400
Yes.

228
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,420
But, you know...

229
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,080
I haven't been to the police station recently, but I've been told to forgive such a uniform.

230
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,560
Well, I was told I shouldn't wear it.

231
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,400
But I changed my clothes in the helicopter.

232
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,880
I'll do it to you.

233
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,060
I'm sure you must be upset.

234
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,140
I'm gonna go check on the patrol.

235
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,780
Ryo, tell Nakagawa-san about this.

236
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,580
Have a nice trip!

237
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,500
So, what should I do?

238
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,980
I'll teach you.

239
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,700
Ryo, you are the instructor, right?

240
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,140
I'm going to patrol too!

241
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,440
Damn it...

242
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,600
Well, I...

243
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,920
Well, you can just stand there and guide the way.

244
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,680
Yes sir!

245
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,460
Oh, are you the man?

246
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,160
Yes, I am.

247
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,240
Oh, I see. I'd like to ask you about the way.

248
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,100
Yes, I'd love to.

249
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,020
Senpai, wake up.

250
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,000
What's wrong? I slept well.

251
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,400
I was asked about the way, but I don't know much about this area.

252
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,020
Huh?

253
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,160
What?

254
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,780
Show me the map and let me look for it.

255
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,000
That's the old man who came back to Japan after 50 years and he said he doesn't know where this place is.

256
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,120
I can't help it.

257
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,040
So, where do you want to go?

258
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,300
The cafeteria.

259
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,680
What?

260
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,080
The cafeteria.

261
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,900
I forgot the name of the place, but I have a clue.

262
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,040
Huh?

263
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,160
It's this kind of place.

264
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,100
Oh.

265
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,120
That's a bad drawing. Did you draw it?

266
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,980
When I was a student. It's been over 50 years.

267
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,120
What? 50 years?

268
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,240
So, where is the place?

269
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,520
It's under Tokyo.

270
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,480
That's all?

271
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,400
Yes.

272
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,780
No, no.

273
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,340
It's a big city. You won't understand.

274
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,080
Give up.

275
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,320
That's not good.

276
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,840
It's my first job.

277
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,840
Do whatever you want.

278
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,140
If I had looked for it, I would have thanked you.

279
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,460
Why didn't you say that first?

280
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,460
Let's talk about the details later.

281
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,900
Hey, Nakagawa.

282
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,760
Order coffee and cake at the cafe.

283
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,740
What?

284
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,720
Go now.

285
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,340
Yes.

286
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:07,740
Yes.

287
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,240
I see.

288
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,360
I went to the cafe a few times when I was a student of art school.

289
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,760
Art school?

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,440
Yes. It's Tokyo Art University.

291
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,800
It was a lunch break, so it was always crowded.

292
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,700
So, you are next to the art university.

293
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,100
Yes. I thought it was about 15 minutes walk.

294
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,260
The art university is the upper neighborhood.

295
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,460
Hmm.

296
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,340
Hmm.

297
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:36,880
Hmm?

298
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,120
If you like, you can have this.

299
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,240
Sorry.

300
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,860
Okay.

301
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,220
Let's look for it around YANAKA NEZU.

302
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,020
Um.

303
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,820
Yes?

304
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,280
I wonder if we can find it in 2 hours.

305
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,020
It's about 20 to 30 minutes by car.

306
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,780
It will be fine.

307
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,420
Actually, it's Narita's first flight at 1 o'clock.

308
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,060
I have to go back to Paris.

309
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,740
Hmm.

310
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,960
It's about an hour by express.

311
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,900
It will be fine.

312
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,620
Narita, get a taxi.

313
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,700
Then, I'll call you with my car.

314
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,320
Yes, it's me.

315
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,220
Please bring your car to the exit immediately.

316
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,240
Hmm.

317
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,180
Um.

318
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,320
How about mine?

319
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,100
No, thanks.

320
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,080
Here it is.

321
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,800
Oh!

322
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,740
Ferrari F40!

323
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,300
Here you are.

324
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,700
Thank you for waiting.

325
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,660
But this is for two people.

326
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,940
It has been modified for four people.

327
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:35,840
It's okay.

328
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,460
Please get in.

329
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,020
Hmm.

330
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,000
Hmm.

331
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,120
Reiko.

332
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,840
You came back to a good place.

333
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,360
Ryo-chan.

334
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:45,780
Help me.

335
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,720
I'm begging you.

336
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,900
Huh?

337
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:48,920
See you.

338
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,320
Ah!

339
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,120
I think I saw someone now...

340
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,420
Hmm.

341
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,560
Hmm.

342
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,020
Hmm.

343
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,340
Hmm.

344
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,400
Hmm.

345
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,540
Phew.

346
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,440
I wish I had more time.

347
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,160
Hey,中川!

348
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,820
Turn there.

349
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,780
I can't.

350
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
The exit is a single lane.

351
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,800
You undermine the company.

352
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,080
I don't want to make the wish of an old man.

353
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,440
Gosh!

354
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,940
I'm going back.

355
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,660
It will be fine.

356
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,420
No.

357
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,120
I got it.

358
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,000
Senpai,

359
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,820
I'm going back.

360
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,280
I got it.

361
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
What are you talking about?

362
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,580
It's not that far from here!

363
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,560
What?

364
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,920
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Our...

365
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,980
Don't fool me!

366
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,500
You don't know, don't you?

367
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,380
Ah! Ryotsu Kankichi!

368
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,440
He's going to pass at one stroke!

369
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,540
How nice. He got on that super-bubbly car like...

370
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,240
He's not the time to observe!

371
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,580
It's the time to arrest!

372
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,840
What?

373
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,840
Stop the Ferrari in front!

374
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,600
What should we do, Senpai?

375
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,240
When the fight is in its midst, come on!

376
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,980
Show them the power of the Ferrari!

377
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,280
Yes, sir!

378
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:18,940
That was too fast!

379
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,520
That's no use, Kanchi!

380
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,800
If anything happens, I'll make sure to get you out of there!

381
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:24,960
That's right!

382
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,180
Right corner, to the right!

383
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,160
The next street, to the left!

384
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,800
But I can see why the alley is so crowded.

385
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,560
I've been playing around here since I was a kid.

386
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,900
It's like a garden.

387
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,040
No matter how close we are, we can't go any further.

388
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,280
Idiot! It's your first job, right?

389
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,040
A police officer is one who is always ready to do anything,

390
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,120
no matter what happens.

391
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,820
Senpai...

392
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,900
I was wrong.

393
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,360
All right!

394
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,240
Hey, hey, hey!

395
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,700
It's getting faster and faster!

396
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Don't worry!

397
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,880
I can get through!

398
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,260
I've been here before, too.

399
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,960
With a bicycle.

400
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,960
Come on!

401
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,880
You're the best, Senpai!

402
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,980
This place...

403
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,160
Can you stop it for a second?

404
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,820
I miss it.

405
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,600
I've lived in Paris for decades,

406
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,100
but I often think of Japan.

407
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,120
That was when I was a student at an art school.

408
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,000
I was surrounded by good friends,

409
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,160
drawing all day long.

410
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,000
Ueno is a forest of art.

411
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,180
I used to walk to and from art museums every day

412
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,440
and exchange art theories with my friends.

413
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,800
At that time, I fell in love with the daughter of the cafeteria

414
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,340
who took me with my friends.

415
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,800
It was really my first love.

416
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,680
That's the cafeteria in that picture, isn't it?

417
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,920
When was that?

418
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,300
I think it was near graduation.

419
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,600
It was when I fell asleep in the cold.

420
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,300
She came to the cafeteria,

421
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,680
and she took care of me.

422
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,620
I was in a good mood,

423
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,720
and I thought I should thank her.

424
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,920
At that time, I was poor,

425
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,220
and I didn't have the money to give her a nice present.

426
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,640
I thought about it,

427
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,120
and I drew her portrait.

428
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,160
And I gave her the painting.

429
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,580
I think it was the best.

430
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,020
The happy face of that daughter at that time

431
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,940
is still burning in my eyes.

432
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,380
And what about that daughter?

433
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,940
At the same time as graduation,

434
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,700
I went to Paris to study.

435
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,520
I didn't say I liked her.

436
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,600
It's a long time ago.

437
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,380
Grandpa!

438
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,420
You shouldn't get into trouble.

439
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,800
You have one hour left.

440
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,360
Let's find the cafeteria.

441
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:20,840
Yeah.

442
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,980
I have one hour left.

443
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,000
Do you remember the scenery around here?

444
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,080
Hmm?

445
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,380
It's 50 years ago,

446
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,140
so it's a lot different.

447
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,080
I have one hour left.

448
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,940
I'm not going to let you go.

449
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,280
I can't take it anymore.

450
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,940
Memories are memories.

451
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,860
I'll take them home.

452
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,760
I have 10 minutes left.

453
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,060
I won't give up!

454
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,620
I can't give up!

455
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,080
I can't find one or two things.

456
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,420
I have to be a policeman!

457
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:04,740
I have to be a policeman!

458
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,880
Damn it!

459
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,400
I've been thinking about this for 50 years.

460
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,320
First love.

461
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,580
I wanted to see you.

462
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,280
It's okay.

463
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,940
This is also fate.

464
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,000
That tree...

465
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,440
I got it!

466
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,400
I got it!

467
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,040
Look at this shop.

468
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,700
It's still in the picture.

469
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,600
It's changed a lot.

470
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,140
Let's go see the first love.

471
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,920
Wait a minute.

472
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,040
What's wrong, old man?

473
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,820
That woman is married and has a family.

474
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,840
It's a sudden visit.

475
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,600
What are you talking about?

476
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,000
Get in.

477
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,460
But...

478
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,440
If you don't open it, I'll open it.

479
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,000
Come on.

480
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,320
Open it.

481
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,100
Hurry up and open it, old man!

482
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,660
Ms. Misumi.

483
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,420
Mr. Taki.

484
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,800
It's Mr. Taki, right?

485
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,720
Yes.

486
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,780
Long time no see.

487
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,360
Oh, really.

488
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,440
Mr. Taki.

489
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,820
That picture is still in the shop.

490
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:30,960
What?

491
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,380
You took good care of it.

492
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,840
This picture is my treasure.

493
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,660
Thank you, Ms. Misumi.

494
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,820
Senior, look.

495
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,820
That happy face.

496
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,820
Yes.

497
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,520
Our police officers are working hard for the people's smiles.

498
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,940
Police officers have a wonderful job.

499
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,140
By the way, how much will you give me as a reward?

500
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,840
Senior.

501
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,800
Thanks to you, I have a good memory.

502
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,140
Please accept this as a reward.

503
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,780
Thank you.

504
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,360
Well, I'll take care of it.

505
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,080
Be careful.

506
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,480
Goodbye.

507
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,840
Let's go home.

508
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,000
What?

509
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:32,920
What?

510
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,720
Are you going to go again?

511
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,300
I'm not happy and there is nothing.

512
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,060
I don't want a picture like this.

513
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,680
Hey, you.

514
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:44,800
What?

515
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,820
I'll do this picture.

516
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,560
Are you sure?

517
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,100
Yes.

518
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,380
Come on.

519
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,560
Taki, Jotaro.

520
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,980
Is it just a Ferrari that's broken?

521
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,860
It's nothing.

522
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,040
I still have a car that's rotting.

523
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,960
Are you that rich?

524
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,880
Well, the asset is about 400 trillion yen.

525
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,140
400 trillion yen?

526
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,740
Nakagawa, let's get along.

527
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,700
Ryo, it's hard.

528
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,260
There was an old man on the Ferrari, right?

529
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,420
Yes, that old man.

530
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,520
That's ridiculous.

531
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,740
He was a world-famous painter.

532
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,400
He was a world-famous painter.

533
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,780
He was a world-famous painter.

534
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,180
Is he that famous?

535
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,400
A picture costs at least 100 million yen.

536
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,480
100 million yen?

537
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,460
I won!

538
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,540
Hey, Ryo!

539
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,160
I'll ask you a lot of questions.

540
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,080
My 100 million yen!

541
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:05,220
Hey, Ryo!

542
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,140
I'll ask you a lot of questions.

543
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,240
I'll ask you a lot of questions.

544
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,300
I'm there, too!

545
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,860
I'm there, too!

546
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:10,960
...

547
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:10,980
Good.

548
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,700
You can't go.

549
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,420
Then go.

550
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,480
Good luck.

551
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,420
Bye.

552
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,440
"Let's smile anytime"

553
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,660
Let's smile anytime

554
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,140
Even if something terrible happens

555
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,540
Please smile cutely

556
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:49,540
It's okay to go out with a face that doesn't matter

557
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,420
Hey, please smile

558
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,100
You're not bad

559
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,060
Hey, please smile

560
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,880
You're in the same mood as before

561
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,940
Smile anytime

562
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,160
A woman who is too serious is not beautiful

563
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,820
You should smile right away

564
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,260
If you're not a child
