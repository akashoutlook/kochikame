1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,080
"When you watch TV, please light up the room and look away."

2
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,040
Come over here, you cheap people.

3
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,880
I don't have money either but I'm worried,

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,920
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,100
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

6
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,100
Come to me, you jobless one

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,460
I'm not here, but don't worry

8
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,320
Look, it's burning

9
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,080
The red cloud is burning

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,600
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

11
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,580
You know what to do, don't you?

12
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,300
You know what to do, don't you?

13
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,820
If you do, just shut up and follow me!

14
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,220
Teacher!

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,280
Teacher is Hachamecha Grandpa!

16
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,280
Dolls?

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,640
Yes, the head of the department asked me to deliver 15 of them to the Katsushika office.

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,660
Why do I have to do such a troublesome thing?

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,020
Ryo-chan, you know a delicious restaurant because Asakusa is your hometown, right?

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,300
That's right. The person who gave it to me will also be happy with the name of the restaurant.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,800
You guys are leaving all the troublesome things to me.

22
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,600
Don't you try to make me cry?

23
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,480
Don't say anything and just buy it.

24
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,140
Look, there will be a fish of about 2000 yen.

25
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,580
That is your Oda-chin.

26
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,360
Oh, really?

27
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,660
Yes.

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,600
I'll go!

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,140
Ryo-chan, when you get Oda-chin, you are different from the way you are.

30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,980
Senpai's energy source is to earn.

31
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,540
I'll go.

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:36,940
OK.

33
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,380
It's a familiar restaurant, so I just let you lose a lot of money.

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,760
It's an unexpected temporary income.

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,140
I don't know anything, but I'm just a manager.

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,140
The grilled doll looks delicious.

37
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,560
There are only these. I don't know if I can get one or two.

38
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,000
It's delicious!

39
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,120
One more.

40
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,700
Isn't it Kankichi?

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,380
What are you doing suddenly?

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,460
It's me.

43
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,540
It's me.

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,840
What?

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,000
Kankichi.

46
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,800
Did you forget this face?

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,200
Oh, it's from elementary school.

48
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,620
That's right. I was a senior in elementary school.

49
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,080
It's nostalgic.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,180
How many years has it been?

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,680
Was the teacher still alive?

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,460
Of course.

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,520
It's just like this.

54
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,000
I think the teacher was quite old at that time.

55
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,360
Yes, this year it will be 90.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,540
90?

57
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:30,960
90?

58
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,940
I'm 70 or 80 years old.

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,920
I'm on the verge of youth now, Kankichi.

60
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,020
How long do you plan to live in youth?

61
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:42,840
Did you say something?

62
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,440
No, no, I'm fine.

63
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,920
Please stay healthy forever.

64
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,560
By the way, Kankichi.

65
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,980
What kind of work are you doing now?

66
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,220
What kind of work?

67
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,740
As you can see.

68
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,360
I see.

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,140
I see.

70
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,040
I see.

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,620
I see.

72
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,900
That rascal who always broke something in the classroom.

73
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,260
I feel strange when you say that.

74
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,680
Did you become a stewardess?

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,860
What?

76
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,100
Stewardess?

77
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,700
I'm a man.

78
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,260
Are you wearing it properly?

79
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,060
Of course.

80
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,520
Show me.

81
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,260
Can you show me at a place like this?

82
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,980
I can show you.

83
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,580
What?

84
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,000
It's a man's proof.

85
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,340
I'll show you now.

86
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:25,640
Ouch.

87
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:25,760
It hurts.

88
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,700
Here.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,040
What is this?

90
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,620
This is my name.

91
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,380
Read it.

92
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,400
"Omagari Daisaku"?

93
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
It's a man's name.

94
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,020
I was brought up to be 90 years old.

95
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,020
No matter how old you are, you're still a bad student.

96
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,300
Why did you walk around the store?

97
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,920
I was walking around.

98
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,360
I live in a mansion on Shisago Street.

99
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,100
You live in a mansion in that city?

100
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,740
That's unfair.

101
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,940
I can stay in such a large store for a little while.

102
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:58,860
What?

103
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,420
Is it eel?

104
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,080
Don't worry.

105
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,400
This is my hometown.

106
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,840
Don't tell me that.

107
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,100
To be continue ...

108
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,160
Damn.

109
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,040
You're good at it.

110
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,940
If so, let me teach you how to have it.

111
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,840
You paid so much.

112
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,560
You didn't say wow to me.

113
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,080
What?

114
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
That's why I didn't have the money to treat you.

115
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,700
I can hear your narrative.

116
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,080
What do you have?

117
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,180
I can't hear you.

118
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't have enough money to pay you back!

119
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,040
What?

120
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,200
I see, I see.

121
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,160
Sir, two more shirayaki.

122
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,100
What?

123
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,180
I'm telling you, it's not fair.

124
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,460
I said it's not fair! I don't have any money!

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,260
How about the temporary income?

126
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,600
Huh?

127
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,900
Or just be a manager?

128
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,100
Huh?

129
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,200
That's what you heard?

130
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,500
Do you want to eat?

131
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,860
Yes, yes. Sir, beer.

132
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,500
What?

133
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,940
Sir, you're in a bad mood.

134
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,320
You're too good.

135
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,720
What? You're in a bad mood?

136
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,760
Sir, two more shirayaki.

137
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,760
It started again.

138
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,680
Give me the money for that.

139
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,760
Sir, there are many students who have been teaching for a long time.

140
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,160
They make the class hours go by one hour and finish the class early.

141
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,960
They mess up the class lunch.

142
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,580
They try to drink water from the cup in the classroom.

143
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,240
I kept it a secret every time, so it's good.

144
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,740
But I didn't think...

145
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,060
That kid is a police officer.

146
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,100
Sir, let's drink.

147
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,860
Today is my treat.

148
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,340
Oh, it's nostalgic.

149
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,640
Right, right.

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,240
Well, even if you grow up to be an adult, you won't forget the old king.

151
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:33,900
It's gorgeous.

152
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,800
Please order whatever you like.

153
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,060
Damn, I lost.

154
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,900
Thank you.

155
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,120
Oh, it was delicious.

156
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,880
Damn, I spent a lot of money.

157
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,280
Well, sir, I'll have this.

158
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,580
Don't say cold things.

159
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,200
I've been teaching for 30 years like this.

160
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,480
And there was a student like you.

161
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,920
It's not something that happens often like this.

162
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,320
But I have to deliver the doll roast that was asked by the chief.

163
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,620
Oh, doll roast.

164
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,400
That looks delicious.

165
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,200
No, no, no, no.

166
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,260
That's right.

167
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,580
I wasn't good at mathematics.

168
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,180
How's that?

169
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,980
I wonder if I can do it.

170
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,440
What's the sudden question?

171
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,540
There are 15 kids here.

172
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,320
I need some snacks to get through all the kids.

173
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,400
How many are there?

174
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,600
I wonder.

175
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,040
How many are there?

176
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,720
It's a lot.

177
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,400
5 people.

178
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,020
It's possible now.

179
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,460
How many do you want to give them?

180
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
I think it's 15.

181
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,720
Then 15 is enough.

182
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,000
No way.

183
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,540
One box is one person.

184
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,780
So, there are 8 in it.

185
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,140
What will you do with the amount Kankichi ate earlier?

186
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,180
Eh?

187
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,760
I will reduce one person's portion.

188
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,120
I know.

189
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,660
If you make one person's portion into 6,

190
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,840
you will have 2 in each.

191
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,820
So, 2 x 15 = 30.

192
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,360
You are more clever than me.

193
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,500
So,

194
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,580
I will take one box from here.

195
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,340
This dollhouse is the best.

196
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,740
Thank you.

197
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,760
It's a good lesson to have.

198
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,800
You are on the right pace.

199
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,000
Today was fun, Kankichi.

200
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,580
See you again.

201
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,620
See you.

202
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,000
What a bad luck.

203
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
Oh?

204
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,980
That face.

205
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,280
Yo!

206
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,000
You must be Tompi.

207
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,580
Oh, yes.

208
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,720
You are the maid at elementary school.

209
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,020
Long time no see.

210
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,120
Oh, Mr. Maid.

211
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,740
It's a coincidence.

212
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,720
Is this your shop?

213
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,860
Yes.

214
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,100
You are a well-known person.

215
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,980
I am happy.

216
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,100
I am glad to see you.

217
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,820
I'm looking for experience.

218
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,660
You are all smart.

219
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,560
It's the luckiest are you ever.

220
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,780
But you have great skills.

221
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,340
As your good teacher,

222
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,640
I really like you.

223
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,280
There are about 2000 people in this neighborhood.

224
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,440
After being scolded by his wife, he went out when it was troublesome to cook for himself.

225
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,440
He's been scolded by one of the teachers, so he's been beaten.

226
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,960
But you remember the face of 2000 people.

227
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,560
It's not 90, it's memory power.

228
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,780
I'll pretend not to know even if I meet you from now on.

229
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,280
That's good. If you're on that pace, you'll lose.

230
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,860
It's a scary 90-year-old.

231
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,480
Welcome.

232
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,300
Hello.

233
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,880
I'm Mugitsu. Please come in.

234
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,880
Hello.

235
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,220
A foreigner?

236
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,100
It's Tachibana's god.

237
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,880
We got married recently.

238
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,880
Where did you meet each other?

239
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,200
In fact, I was at the last year's Asakusa Samba Carnival.

240
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,200
I was pulling the dashi from the god with a horse at the youth conference.

241
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,040
I didn't know that the god of the Gokukuya had a foreign god.

242
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,840
Asakusa is the same.

243
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,280
I've been internationalized.

244
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,500
See you later.

245
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,040
Yes, please do it anytime.

246
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,160
Tompei, Chinkichi, I'm going to drink soon.

247
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,880
Yes.

248
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,560
See you.

249
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,040
I'm here.

250
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,840
I'll take a look at the house.

251
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,740
Oh, there you are.

252
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,340
What?

253
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,780
It's dangerous.

254
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,160
Jump out suddenly.

255
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
No, it's Kankichi.

256
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,020
Oh, teacher Omagari.

257
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,500
It's been a while.

258
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,520
I just met him the other day.

259
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,800
Really?

260
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,040
Do you want to talk while drinking?

261
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,960
I can't do it anymore.

262
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,200
Well, where should I go?

263
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,160
No, no, no, no.

264
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:55,880
I pretended not to hear.

265
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,060
The teacher's house is...

266
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,520
What?

267
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,720
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

268
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,380
Teacher!

269
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,520
Don't scare me.

270
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,360
What are you doing?

271
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,920
Well, what?

272
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,040
What?

273
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,520
Welcome, Mrs. Murasame.

274
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,500
Is there anything good about the obidome?

275
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,200
Obidome?

276
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,480
Yes, sir.

277
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,320
It's beautiful.

278
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,620
It's like a pure white lily if you compare it to a flower.

279
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,160
What?

280
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,500
You have a big head.

281
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,340
You're 90 years old, aren't you?

282
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,880
Are you going to fall in love at that age?

283
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,500
What are you talking about?

284
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,900
Kounosuke Matsushita, who was called the god of business, said,

285
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,200
"Youth is the youth of the heart."

286
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,960
"Youth is the youth of the heart."

287
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,080
Oh, really?

288
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,680
So, did you confess to him?

289
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,640
That's...

290
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,380
Not yet.

291
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,100
What?

292
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,960
You're not like a teacher.

293
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,860
Why are you afraid of one or two dates?

294
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,720
But...

295
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,660
Look, it's out.

296
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,660
Hurry up and apply for a date.

297
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

298
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,400
I'm not ready yet.

299
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,660
It's okay.

300
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,060
It's okay.

301
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,240
Men are shy without saying anything.

302
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,820
Go away.

303
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:06,820
I'm sorry.

304
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,760
Oh, Mr. Omawari.

305
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,240
Oh, no, no, no, no.

306
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,840
This is good.

307
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,600
It's a good weather.

308
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,540
Yeah, that's right.

309
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,680
I wonder if it's going to work.

310
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,200
Well, then.

311
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,800
Be careful.

312
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,200
Yes, thank you.

313
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,980
Excuse me.

314
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,020
Thank you.

315
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,640
How was it?

316
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,440
Huh?

317
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,300
Was it no good?

318
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,140
Huh?

319
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,600
It's a great success.

320
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,520
I made a date.

321
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,680
Oh, my God.

322
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,240
Don't be surprised.

323
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,660
I did it.

324
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,340
But there's only one problem.

325
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,060
What's the problem?

326
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,820
I was lying to you.

327
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,420
Huh?

328
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,800
When I met you before,

329
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,140
I said I had three of the best companies.

330
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,020
What?

331
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,880
What?

332
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,240
Why are you lying to me?

333
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,080
It's just profit.

334
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,020
Please, Kanki.

335
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,560
If this gets out,

336
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,480
I'm going to get hated by Tokiko.

337
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,840
Please do something about it.

338
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,360
Even if you say you're asking me to do it,

339
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,720
I said you applied for a date.

340
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,420
Hey, Kanki.

341
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:08,960
Please.

342
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,220
I'm going to get hated by Tokiko.

343
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,040
I just thought you'd come.

344
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:10,880
I just wanted to save me as a donor.

345
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,480
I got you.

346
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,780
Really?

347
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,800
That's great.

348
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,440
Kanki.

349
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,720
This has become a huge mess.

350
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,360
Oh, my God.

351
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,360
What's wrong with you?

352
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,780
Oh, it's nothing.

353
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,500
I know.

354
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,420
You're going to do something for yourself.

355
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,860
I'm sorry you're telling me to do nothing at all.

356
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,200
No, i'm not.

357
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,040
I told him what you told me to do.

358
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,900
But...

359
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,200
I need to talk to him.

360
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,180
What do you want?

361
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:39,820
I'm sorry I couldn't park the car.

362
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,700
Pierre.

363
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,420
Huh? Me?

364
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,500
This is the sheep, Pierre.

365
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,580
If you need anything, just say it.

366
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,700
No, no, Pierre.

367
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,880
No, I'm the sheep... No, I'm the sheep, Pierre.

368
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,780
Nice to meet you, my wife.

369
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,200
How funny.

370
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm Murasame.

371
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,560
Nice to meet you.

372
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,780
Let's go.

373
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,800
When I think about it, I remember when I was studying in Paris.

374
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,360
I often went on walks in Seine.

375
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,080
In Paris?

376
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,760
You were an artist or something?

377
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,960
Well, that's right.

378
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,220
When I was young, I wanted to make a living by painting.

379
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,080
But my father passed away, so I had to move on.

380
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,580
That's why I came back to Japan.

381
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,580
If I had stayed in Paris at that time...

382
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,540
Nowadays, the world is changing.

383
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,300
I may be getting used to this country.

384
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Haha, but I never had the chance to meet a person as beautiful as you here.

385
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,680
That's how people's destiny works.

386
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,220
You don't have to keep lying about it.

387
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,100
I also remember the gondolas in Venice.

388
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,260
Venice, the city of water.

389
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,460
Ah, the days when I was young.

390
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,520
I'm envious.

391
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,660
How nice. I have never been out of Japan.

392
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,840
If you get on a gondola with someone you love, it will be very romantic.

393
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,860
Of course. Oh, right. This is Pierre.

394
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,300
Hey, Pierre!

395
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,040
Then it's me. Yes, what do you want, sir?

396
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,920
What kind of classic gag are you doing?

397
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,100
Get me a gondola.

398
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,140
Gondola?

399
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,940
It's the same as the one in Sumida River and Venice.

400
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,680
Get me a gondola right away.

401
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,540
What kind of gag are you doing?

402
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,420
It's the same as the one in Sumida River and Venice.

403
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,780
What kind of gag are you doing?

404
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,760
Get me one right away.

405
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,800
All right, sir. I'll get it right away.

406
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,020
Gondola, gondola.

407
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,400
Shaken by the waves, gondola.

408
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,360
I'm sorry.

409
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,180
No, it's okay.

410
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,680
What?

411
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,220
No, it's okay.

412
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,980
I have to dance with a real man.

413
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,300
Here, two rivers are divided.

414
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,340
Harumen is the other side.

415
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,040
The bridge ahead is the bridge.

416
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,700
Tohiko, look.

417
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,500
It's the Kaji Toki Bridge.

418
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,640
It's nostalgic.

419
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,160
It's been a while since it's opened again.

420
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,880
There's Tokyo Bay.

421
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,920
I smell salt.

422
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,860
It smells like a sea.

423
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,720
Rainbow Bridge.

424
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,700
I've never seen it.

425
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
Where are you going? You'll go out into the sea.

426
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,760
Look, I can see it.

427
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
It's the TV station I bought last year.

428
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,060
What?

429
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,660
It was cheaper than I thought.

430
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,060
Isn't that right, Pierre?

431
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:50,960
Yes.

432
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,600
Next, I'll rent Queen Elizabeth and go on a cruise to Tokyo.

433
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:55,680
A cruise to Tokyo?

434
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,120
But I want to go on a cruise to Tokyo.

435
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,400
A cruise to Tokyo?

436
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,820
I see.

437
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,700
Pierre, get me a carriage.

438
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,560
A carriage?

439
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,340
What?

440
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,340
You mean the carriage we used at the Sanba Carnival?

441
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,560
You mean the stock?

442
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,380
Yes, I think I got it at the Youth Conference.

443
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,840
Where is it?

444
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,240
It's probably in the warehouse.

445
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,900
Alright, show me the way.

446
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,440
The store...

447
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,420
Leave it to God.

448
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,820
But...

449
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,020
Don't worry.

450
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,320
Here we go.

451
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,540
Hold on tight.

452
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,520
I'm counting on you, Pierre.

453
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,040
There!

454
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,020
Pierre, don't fly so far.

455
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,160
Tokiko is scared.

456
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,420
I got it, sir.

457
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,560
I'm Kabukiza.

458
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,740
Let's go see Kabuki next time.

459
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:55,860
Okay.

460
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,420
If we go on a cruise to Yamamoto at this speed, the sun will set.

461
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,380
We have to be horses, not turtles.

462
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,800
I really had a great time today.

463
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,020
I'm glad you were happy.

464
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,160
It was really fun.

465
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,020
Tokiko?

466
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,620
Yes?

467
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,960
I...

468
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,300
Um...

469
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,960
Um...

470
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,400
Um...

471
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,900
How are you feeling about me?

472
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,160
I think you're a very nice person.

473
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,620
Eh?

474
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,980
So...

475
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,260
So...

476
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,460
Tokiko?

477
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,560
I...

478
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,000
I...

479
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,680
I...

480
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,480
I'm too late.

481
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:38,980
Eh?

482
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,820
I'm not.

483
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,920
I'm not.

484
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:42,800
I'm not.

485
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:42,960
I'm not.

486
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,480
I'm not.

487
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm not.

488
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,280
I'm not.

489
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,960
I'm not.

490
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,140
I'm not.

491
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,720
I'm not.

492
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:45,980
I'm not.

493
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,380
I'm not.

494
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,280
I'm not.

495
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,540
I'm not.

496
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,520
I'm not.

497
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,240
I'm not.

498
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,160
I…

499
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,180
I'm not.

500
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,600
I'm not.

501
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:51,700
I…

502
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,220
I…

503
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,540
I don't…

504
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,180
I...

505
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,680
I don't…

506
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,300
I'm not.

507
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,660
I don't see anything.

508
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,200
It's just a…

509
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,760
A super deep pit.

510
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,440
Almost frozen.

511
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,420
It's so deep, it's too strong.

512
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,500
It's just like a rock to me.

513
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,040
I don't even have a even weigh.

514
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,620
I'm just like a clay.

515
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,260
Like...?

516
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,980
I want you to collect all the money.

517
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,400
But, Senpai...

518
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,520
I'll talk about it later.

519
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,660
I'm in a situation where I don't know if I can get the best happiness in my life or fall into a pit of misfortune.

520
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,740
I'm begging you to do something!

521
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,960
I understand. I'll try to do it.

522
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,660
I'm begging you to do something!

523
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,200
Yes.

524
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,200
I'm a good person, too.

525
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,720
It doesn't cost a penny, but why do I have to suffer so much?

526
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,700
Tokiko, I'll make a miracle happen.

527
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,000
So, so, I...

528
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,400
I'm happy to hear that, but it's impossible for you to do that.

529
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,880
No, there's nothing I can't do.

530
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,040
What do you mean, "I"?

531
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
I...

532
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't measure the value of that person with money or social status.

533
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,420
Tokiko...

534
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,860
There are some people who can be respected even if they don't have much.

535
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,720
There are people who are admired by people even if they don't have much.

536
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,660
I think that kind of person is the best.

537
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,320
I...

538
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,540
Tokiko, I'm sorry.

539
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,320
Omagari, what are you...

540
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,960
I lied to you.

541
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,720
I lied about running a large company.

542
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,180
I'm the worst man.

543
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,000
Please stand up.

544
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,600
I've tried to be loved by you somehow,

545
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,340
but I'm much more than your pure heart.

546
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,460
I'm a narrow-sighted man.

547
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,560
Please raise your face.

548
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,420
I knew it from the start.

549
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,680
Then,

550
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,380
Then you knew it was a lie and went out with him?

551
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,400
I'm embarrassed.

552
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,020
But I lied to a lie.

553
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,080
I'm not good enough for you.

554
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,620
Thank you for your trouble.

555
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,200
Mr. Omagari, please wait. I...

556
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,720
Sensei! No, Mr. Owner!

557
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,900
Kankichi, it's okay.

558
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,560
I took care of you today.

559
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,420
Sensei, don't say that. Please wait a little longer.

560
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,020
I'm Ryotsu, a teacher at a elementary school where Mr. Omagari worked.

561
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,540
You were a teacher at a school?

562
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,660
Yes, but now I'm a man who is obsessed with those teachers.

563
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,760
You're not like your usual teacher.

564
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,440
Please be more confident.

565
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,860
Kankichi!

566
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Here he comes.

567
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,140
Sensei!

568
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,200
Mr. Omagari!

569
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,120
Everyone!

570
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,620
Even them...

571
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,020
Yes, everyone is his teacher.

572
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,420
These people live next door, and they're cheeky to Mr. Omagari.

573
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,760
Mr. Omagari!

574
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,920
Susuman...

575
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,160
We're all looking forward to meeting him from time to time and having some food.

576
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,620
That's right.

577
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,820
Sensei was so much loved by everyone.

578
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,720
It's wonderful.

579
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,960
Oh my!

580
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,540
Hey! Oh my!

581
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,640
Oh, I see!

582
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,220
That's right! A miracle happened!

583
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,820
Kankichi, did you do this?

584
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,760
It's a miracle, Sensei!

585
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,420
Sensei, a miracle will happen!

586
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,700
Let's make a miracle happen too!

587
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,520
No, I don't...

588
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,440
Mr. Omagari!

589
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,980
I was just about to say it, but...

590
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,740
I was happy to hear that you were willing to do something for me even though you lied.

591
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,440
Mr. Tokiko, will you forgive me then?

592
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,860
Yes, if you don't mind being such an old lady, I'll go out with you.

593
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,860
Mr. Tokiko!

594
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,380
Banza!

595
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,220
Banza!

596
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,700
Banza!

597
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,840
Banza!

598
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:19,860
Banza!

599
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:20,800
Banza!

600
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,240
Banza!

601
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,720
Hey, Flan!

602
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,060
You're too old!

603
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,400
Idiots!

604
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,220
The snow's not cleaning up the area today, and the traffic is in a big mess!

605
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,460
It's this heat! If you leave it alone, it'll melt away!

606
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
Idiots!

607
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,120
What?

608
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,500
Look!

609
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,140
What is it?

610
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,360
This will clean up all the snow!

611
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,160
What?

612
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,240
Don't come back until it's cleaned up!

613
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,700
You're a jerk!

614
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,420
It's impossible to keep it clean!

615
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,360
Yeah!

616
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,900
Welcome to my house!

617
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,700
Welcome to my house!

618
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,920
Welcome to my house!

619
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,580
Welcome to my house!

620
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,500
Welcome to my house!

621
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,320
Welcome to my house!

622
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,000
I say, "Welcome to my house!"

623
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,240
Welcome!

624
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,020
I say, "Welcome to my house!"

625
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,740
Welcome!

626
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Ah, that's right.

627
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,480
Do you have California Macchi?

628
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,300
California Macchi no yo.

629
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,260
This is not America.

630
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,080
Sorry.

631
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,340
Um, well, excuse me.

632
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,060
Hi, what's up?

633
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,680
Then, Kushiage, Kakiage, Katsuage, whatever, Ageage, what was it again?

634
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,260
What do you recommend?

635
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,560
Just be careful with Katsuage.

636
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,900
Just be careful with Katsuage.

637
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,120
Oh, that's my father's gag.

638
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,060
Yes, I'm sorry.

639
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,380
I have no idea either.

640
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,020
Huh, huh, huh?

641
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,940
Seriously?

642
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:09,960
Welcome.

643
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,960
Welcome.

644
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:12,860
Welcome.

645
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,220
Welcome.

646
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,800
Welcome.

647
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,760
Welcome.

648
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,840
Welcome.

649
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,640
Welcome.

650
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:21,900
Welcome.

651
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,280
Welcome.

652
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:22,500
Welcome.

653
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,080
Welcome.

654
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,100
Welcome.

655
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,720
Welcome.

656
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:23,940
Welcome.

657
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,320
Welcome!

658
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,260
Where am I? What am I doing here?

659
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,560
Who am I?

660
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,020
I don't remember at all!

661
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,820
By the way, why do I call myself "I"?

662
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,880
Someone, please tell me!

663
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,420
Next time, "Who am I?"

664
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,400
See you!

665
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,780
Everyone, come to our town!

666
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,920
Thank you!
