00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,220
Swandering the river seen end-to-end in the sun

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:24,560
I tear off the love stone and fly down to the invited building

4
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,600
From the water tank of a pointed hat

5
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,980
To the taishakuten, the sun sets

6
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,480
Tomorrow will end like this

7
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,560
Katsushika, Shibamata, I lost my happiness

8
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,400
I realized, I'm such an idiot

9
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:42,220
This is the escape room in front of Kameari Park.

10
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,240
I see. This is the rumored...

11
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,400
Escape Room

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,100
Escape Room, in front of Kameari Park.

13
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,120
Is that it?

14
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,080
The escape room is the basis of police activities.

15
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,460
It's a very important job.

16
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,220
It prevents crime...

17
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,220
Of course, it prevents crime.

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,000
The crime rate of the criminal by interrogating the police is higher than expected.

19
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,540
Police School, Daishiten, 777th Street.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,080
Newspaper, Newspaper, Newspaper.

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,260
I'll introduce you.

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,220
I'm Miyaji, your student.

23
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,420
Hello.

24
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,560
Nice to meet you.

25
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,240
After graduating from Tojo University,

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,520
Miyaji entered the police school with the best grades.

27
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,980
He's a top student with a good education.

28
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,680
Amazing.

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Tojo University is a prestigious school, isn't it?

30
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,940
He's a candidate for the future executive.

31
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,200
He's Terai, the secretary of our escape room.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,220
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

33
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,220
I don't know anything.

34
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
Even if I had any questions, I wouldn't ask you.

35
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,400
What?

36
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,220
Please be gentle, Miyaji.

37
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,040
Those two are Nakagawa and Reiko.

38
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,600
Nice to meet you.

39
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,540
It's an honor to have a good student like you.

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,540
What?

41
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,100
Police School, Daishiten, 124th Street.

42
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,920
Police officers are required to wear uniforms.

43
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,720
They're not required to wear uniforms.

44
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,620
They're not allowed to wear uniforms.

45
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,820
Nakagawa.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,300
I see.

47
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,520
I have permission, but...

48
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,920
It's boring to wear uniforms.

49
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,300
20 centimeters above the knee.

50
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,860
Too short.

51
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,260
Yellow and pink uniforms are not allowed.

52
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,540
Chief Ohara.

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,880
What?

54
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,020
Do you know what they say about this escape room in the police school?

55
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,700
No.

56
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,500
The escape room in front of Kameyari Park is the first place to have a bag.

57
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,360
A

58
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,100
The chief's management ability is also problematic.

59
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,340
The first step in my field experience is why this is an escape room.

60
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,260
I have to measure the thread of the upper part of the body.

61
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,960
I will create the training schedule myself.

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,540
Please feel free to do it.

63
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,840
Please feel free to do it.

64
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,820
Please feel free to do it.

65
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,580
Ms. Terada, please lend me the map of the patrol area.

66
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,220
Oh, yes.

67
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,400
Um...

68
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,980
I'm... I'm a monk.

69
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,100
Hello.

70
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,980
Actually, it was a difficult training.

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,680
It's only one day today.

72
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,460
It's going to be a long day.

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,800
It's going to be a long day.

74
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,080
Yeah!

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,120
Yeah!

76
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,560
100km/h deck morning!

77
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,700
With a brilliant technique!

78
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,080
Here I come!

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,820
Yeah!

80
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,760
Oh, oh!

81
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,020
Good morning!

82
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,340
Ryo!

83
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,900
Oh, no!

84
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,660
I've been riding my bike since this morning!

85
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,320
Finally, I can ride this bike!

86
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,920
Cornering is my life!

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,580
You! My important data has been leaked!

88
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,660
What?

89
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,480
You're wearing the uniform of the police, but...

90
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,800
Police school, page 125,

91
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,180
Support for the officer's uniform wearing duty.

92
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,300
Who's the one who's violating the rules of sandals and no underwear?

93
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,380
Me?

94
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,180
I'm Ryo-tsu Kankichi, and you're Daru!

95
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,620
Good morning, Ryo-tsu.

96
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
You're in a good mood this morning, too.

97
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,920
What's with this mouthy guy?

98
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm Miyaji, an intern.

99
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,500
An intern?

100
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,800
I'm Ryo-tsu Junsacho.

101
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,480
I'm going to appoint you as the director of Miyaji's army for the day.

102
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,440
What?

103
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,240
What's the director's duty, chief?

104
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,220
You're going to patrol with Miyaji.

105
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,600
Good for you, Ryo-tsu.

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,520
Chief, I can do it by myself.

107
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,880
That's the chief's order, Miyaji.

108
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,700
What page was the uniform's rule?

109
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,780
Page 572, rule 17.

110
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,860
I'm going to obey my boss's orders.

111
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,520
Damn it.

112
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,340
Today is the day Virtual Fantasy X will join the arcade.

113
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,900
I can do as much as I want if I can fool the intern.

114
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,420
All right, let's hurry!

115
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,600
Follow me, intern!

116
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,080
Ryo-tsu!

117
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,980
Don't be late, intern!

118
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,540
There's no skateboard in the main equipment department of the foreign police!

119
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,960
Are you okay, chief?

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,260
You left Miyaji to your senior.

121
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,960
Ryo-tsu of the physical side and Miyaji of the brain side.

122
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,120
It may be surprising to combine different personalities for a high effect.

123
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,760
Chief, you've done a good job paying your debts.

124
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,760
Humph!

125
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,440
Humph!

126
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,040
Huh?

127
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,100
"The Subway Shop"

128
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,380
Ten minutes before the game starts...

129
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,240
I'm the first one to enter the coin in the new game machine.

130
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,900
Ryo-tsu!

131
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,460
Yeah?

132
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,380
The default patrol course is not working.

133
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,860
It's fine.

134
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,700
But the first place to pass the Kameari elementary, junior high, and high school, and the Tatsushika area is the official course.

135
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,540
What are you going to do if you go to such an uninteresting place?

136
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,380
My patrol is decided to be a game, pachinko, and plum.

137
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,760
Then, isn't it a tour of the amusement park?

138
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,640
Please return to the official course.

139
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,360
If you don't like it, you can leave it to the two of you.

140
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,460
You go over there, and I'll go over here.

141
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,980
Two hours later, we'll meet at the exhaust.

142
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,320
Bye!

143
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,520
Wait a minute.

144
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:39,680
Please wait.

145
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,480
Page 843.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,480
Newbie training, number 20.

147
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,220
You must be on duty during patrol training.

148
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,580
I knew it.

149
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,860
Get out of the way.

150
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,680
Are you going to disobey the director's orders?

151
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,020
Are you going to give up my directorial responsibility?

152
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,220
This will be the first reason for the Virtual Fantasy X to be taken away by someone else.

153
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,220
I understand.

154
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,520
All right.

155
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,680
I will adopt the official course.

156
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,860
What?

157
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,720
I'll just go around somewhere.

158
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,500
No abnormalities near the Kaeyari Elementary School.

159
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,700
Hey!

160
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,480
You always carry such a thing?

161
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,520
Yes.

162
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,080
Because of this, I always got the top grades from university to the police school.

163
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,380
But even if you're smart, you can't be a police officer.

164
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,620
In fact, it's a hindrance to your education.

165
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,800
What?

166
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,920
What a police officer needs is more than knowledge,

167
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,220
but more than the ability to make a decision and act.

168
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,600
A ability to make a decision?

169
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,700
Mr. Ryotsu!

170
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,460
Where are you going, Mr. Ryotsu?!

171
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,120
This is the ability to make a decision! Remember that!

172
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,800
Parora! Parora! Parora!

173
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,320
That's it!

174
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,640
Mr. Ryotsu!

175
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,620
We're running out of time.

176
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,640
We only have 3 minutes left.

177
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,340
When the shutters open and we jump in at the same time, we win.

178
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,560
This guy's fast!

179
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,080
Alright, I'll suggest you to give the police officer a skateboard.

180
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,980
30 seconds to go!

181
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,540
It opened.

182
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,040
I'm excited.

183
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,580
Virtual Fantasy X!

184
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,240
Go!

185
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
I won! I'm in first place!

186
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,180
So this is Virtual Fantasy X!

187
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,180
Mr. Ryotsu!

188
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,740
Why do you know?

189
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,000
I can't think of anything else other than your words!

190
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm in first place!

191
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm in first place!

192
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,400
I'm out~!

193
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,700
Take this!

194
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,680
I won!

195
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,360
Hey, hey, don't go!

196
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,720
Oh...!

197
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,280
How could you do that to me!

198
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,040
It's because of you that I violated the rules of your programbirds at the start of the Competition.

199
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,500
Don't keep that secret from me!

200
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,440
Well...

201
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,560
I see.

202
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,780
What are you doing?

203
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,040
That was awesome!

204
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,580
You wanted to play that game until you ran away with me, didn't you?

205
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,360
No, I didn't.

206
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,040
Of course, it was for the patrol.

207
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,880
What?

208
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,600
30 minutes to the escape room.

209
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,380
The patrol should be efficient and be in the back.

210
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,220
If you don't hurry to the next place, you won't be able to do everything in time.

211
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,060
Don't be stupid.

212
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,940
It's a professional to climb mountains with a direct feeling.

213
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,760
If you decide here, you'll be able to do it.

214
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,200
That's the secret of the patrol.

215
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,780
I'll stay here for about an hour.

216
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,720
I've never heard of such a gamble patrol.

217
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,860
Come on!

218
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,080
Let's go!

219
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,340
Just do it once.

220
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't.

221
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,180
No suspicious vehicle.

222
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,000
No.

223
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,460
No problem.

224
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,500
Just leave it to me.

225
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,680
All transfer from headquarters to the game center in front of the station.

226
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
Arrest Maruhio of Ryoga Station Arashi.

227
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,440
What?

228
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,680
Thank you for your hard work.

229
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,400
Ryoga Station Arashi.

230
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,180
As I said, if you stay here, you'll be the first trainee.

231
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,680
You're so lucky, Miyaji.

232
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,540
You didn't do this crime?

233
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,360
Huh?

234
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,220
Oh, of course I did.

235
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,520
My sense of smell as a patrol chief is sensitive to the smell of crime.

236
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
The smell of crime.

237
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,040
Shut up.

238
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,840
I'm on it.

239
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:20,980
Chance.

240
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,620
Listen.

241
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,500
This is not something you can get by studying a little.

242
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,740
Hmm?

243
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,860
My sense of smell is getting more and more.

244
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,680
This way? This way?

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,760
This way.

246
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,700
All right.

247
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,820
Let's go, Miyaji.

248
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,120
Yes.

249
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,740
Here?

250
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,580
That's right.

251
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,440
It smells good.

252
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,180
There's something in this store.

253
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Where is it?

254
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
!

255
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,140
It's here.

256
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,240
Miyaji!

257
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,280
You haven't left yet?

258
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,120
Well, I'm sure I'll arrive at the spot tomorrow at about 3 a.m.

259
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,260
Now, you're going to block the entrance because you're going to be wagon service.

260
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,920
Well...

261
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,600
Even if you're like this, my sharp senses are always catching up with the situation around me.

262
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,820
Hey, didn't you think the man who just left was acting strange?

263
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,200
Eh?

264
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,100
Miyaji, try to identify that man.

265
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:42,440
Oh!

266
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,340
The crime rate of the criminal, according to the questions asked during the patrol, is...

267
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,580
More expensive than expected!

268
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,080
Yes!

269
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,980
Ichimatsu!

270
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,600
Hehehehe...

271
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,440
Excuse me, but...

272
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,500
Excuse me, but...

273
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,820
What is your job?

274
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,340
Hello? What is your job?

275
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,580
Job?

276
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,280
I'm asking about your job.

277
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,940
Huh? Your job?

278
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,160
Come on! Come on! Come on!

279
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,680
Eh? What is it?

280
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,920
Stop it!

281
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,720
What are you doing?

282
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,180
I don't know! I just asked about my job, and all of a sudden...

283
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,880
What a pathetic trainee!

284
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,280
Didn't you do judo?

285
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,660
I'm on the third team, but...

286
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,160
What?

287
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,360
Your third team is better than that!

288
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,320
Hey, old man!

289
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,460
You're lying!

290
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,800
What a pathetic trainee is!

291
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,720
Look at this!

292
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,760
Sometimes, it may be more swaying than judo!

293
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,680
Swaving.

294
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,480
Swaving?

295
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,220
And, when the opponent is panting...

296
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,180
Swaing!

297
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,900
Give him a good hand!

298
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,240
There! There! There!

299
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
Ouch! Ouch!

300
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:56,880
Ouch!

301
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,700
We are not getting paid for it!

302
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,300
You got it, Miyaji?

303
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,880
I think this is a will.

304
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,080
Will? You?

305
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,040
I was fired from a company I worked for for 30 years!

306
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,940
I'm sorry for being so rude earlier.

307
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,000
It's okay. Don't think too much.

308
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,320
It's good to be alive.

309
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,460
Thank you very much.

310
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,060
Excuse me.

311
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,040
Let me go!

312
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,620
Cheer up!

313
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,840
Are you sure you're okay with that?

314
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,740
I'm fine with your energy.

315
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,620
He found out about one incident in an hour and saved one life.

316
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,660
Maybe he's a good cop.

317
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,980
By the way, what is a ristora?

318
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,140
Is it a rare animal?

319
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,360
It's different.

320
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,570
Yeah?

321
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,440
Yeah.

322
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,600
I'm hungry now.

323
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,480
The next day

324
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,080
This dango is always delicious.

325
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,860
Sorry, Ryo.

326
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,480
I'm sorry to ask you to do this.

327
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,740
Thank you.

328
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,940
I'm glad we happened to pass by.

329
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,360
It was a flood after the rain.

330
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,240
What a coincidence.

331
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,500
I came to eat dango.

332
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,140
That's the work of the shakum.

333
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,680
You have to do it right.

334
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,540
What?

335
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,320
I've been wrong about one thing.

336
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,240
You're too smart.

337
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,800
You don't have enough experience.

338
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,260
So it's just right to work three times as hard as you.

339
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,860
Well, do it right.

340
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,960
If you do it, you can do it.

341
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,140
I can't move anymore.

342
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,280
I'm sorry.

343
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,760
Well, I'm sorry.

344
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,900
Ryo, this is a bath.

345
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,080
If you don't mind, I'll use it.

346
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,300
Oh, Miyaji.

347
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,360
The warm hearts of the residents have returned.

348
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,820
Can I get something like that from the civil servants?

349
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,440
Don't waste the kind heart of people.

350
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,900
In the next few days,

351
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,800
In the bath!

352
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,280
Yay!

353
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,320
Good bath!

354
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,040
Are you okay, Ryo?

355
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,020
Mr. Ryo, go to the bathroom while you're working.

356
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,740
That's fine.

357
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,540
You're dirty with the dump cleaning, too.

358
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:29,800
It's disgusting.

359
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,640
That's right.

360
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,440
I've already washed the mud.

361
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,460
Let's go back to patrol.

362
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,900
Yeah, I got it.

363
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,260
Then, before that.

364
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,760
Huh?

365
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,680
Let me back off.

366
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:42,880
What?

367
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,760
The contract is 300 pages.

368
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,200
I will obey your orders.

369
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,260
It's 572 pages.

370
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,220
Oh, yeah?

371
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,820
Yeah.

372
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,880
Wow, it's refreshing.

373
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,980
You know what?

374
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,960
If you just go around the patrol course of the century, you won't be able to get there.

375
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,060
I don't know if I look like I'm playing all the time.

376
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,400
It's really helpful to the residents, isn't it?

377
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,600
And then you're working at a game center or a pachinko.

378
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,440
That's why.

379
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,740
That's to look at the world from different angles.

380
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,580
Oh?

381
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,060
Weight scale.

382
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,180
Let's see how much it is.

383
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,840
Oh, it's the plastic model.

384
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,980
But I can't make it in a place like this.

385
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,500
Don't make it too big.

386
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,580
It'll get in the way.

387
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,840
I'm sorry.

388
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,780
When it's done, show me how it's done.

389
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,700
Let's see.

390
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,760
What's this?

391
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,460
What's wrong?

392
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,440
It's glue.

393
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,480
You put it here and...

394
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,400
I can't take it off.

395
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,320
It's instant glue.

396
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,560
What?

397
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,840
Do something.

398
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,660
Yes.

399
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,100
What are you doing?

400
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:48,800
It's a cart.

401
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,180
We need to get back on patrol.

402
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,720
We need to get back on patrol.

403
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,340
What's wrong?

404
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
My knees are stuck.

405
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,560
What?

406
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,320
The dump truck is coming in.

407
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,440
We need to hurry.

408
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,180
It's a paddock.

409
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,760
What?

410
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,680
What?

411
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,160
I need to hurry.

412
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,060
No way.

413
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,600
It's a

414
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:46,840
You're right.

415
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,540
This is awful.

416
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,220
We can't push it any further anymore.

417
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,120
Let's go.

418
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,040
Ready?

419
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,920
Alright, let's change direction!

420
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,000
Huh? How?

421
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,540
Hang on!

422
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,480
You have to move your center of gravity!

423
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,300
Go! Go!

424
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,380
Hey! You too, shake your butt!

425
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,380
Do you want to die?

426
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,640
Ugh...

427
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,700
Let's do it again, okay?

428
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,560
One, two...

429
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:05,980
Change!

430
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,200
Is it okay?

431
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,480
Yes!

432
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,420
Hehe!

433
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,980
Look, it's the same as skateboarding!

434
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,060
Alright!

435
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,400
That was useful for me again!

436
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,680
Ryo-san! Behind!

437
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,520
Huh?

438
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,140
Huh?

439
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,500
Oh no! It's a boundary!

440
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,280
Now, let's change the ring.

441
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,320
Yeah!

442
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,060
Huh?

443
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,780
Alright!

444
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,720
Three, two, one!

445
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,300
Yes!

446
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,160
Ah!

447
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,580
Good luck!

448
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,520
Virgin Road in that form...

449
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,300
Amen!

450
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,300
We did it!

451
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,300
We're out on the national road!

452
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,980
We finally stopped!

453
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,320
Isn't it embarrassing to be in a town like this?

454
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,700
It can't be helped!

455
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:47,900
It can't be helped!

456
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,440
You and I can't walk!

457
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,200
Huh?

458
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:52,840
Huh?

459
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,500
Huh?

460
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,220
It's a highway!

461
00:20:59,380 --> 00:20:59,840
Ah!

462
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,020
It's a road!

463
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,780
It's an artificial road!

464
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,500
You're kidding, Miyaji!

465
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,440
It's a waterway!

466
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,780
We can't use this scale!

467
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,480
Idiot!

468
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,540
If we let it go here,

469
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,100
we'll have to use a huge number of people and taxes!

470
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,240
Huh?

471
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,840
That's why we have to do a quick search of the street!

472
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,680
That's why we have to do a quick search of the street!

473
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,780
That's why we have to do a quick search of the street!

474
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,120
I got it!

475
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,280
All right, let's go!

476
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,240
All right, let's go!

477
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,460
All right, let's go!

478
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,840
All right, let's go!

479
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:24,880
All right, let's go!

480
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,580
Ah, a car!

481
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,300
Ah, a car!

482
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,860
Ah, a car!

483
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,280
No!

484
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,640
What are you doing?

485
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,160
Give me the bike I just told you!

486
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,180
No!

487
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,000
Ah!

488
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,620
All right, I'm on the gas!

489
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,720
Yes!

490
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,900
Okay, it's a truck!

491
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,820
All right!

492
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,600
Ah, Honey!

493
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm on the gas!

494
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,340
I'm on the gas!

495
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,860
All right, let's change the route!

496
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,660
I'm going to shake my butt!

497
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,620
Yes!

498
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,480
One, two, three!

499
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:54,980
Yes!

500
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,040
One, two, three!

501
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,020
Ah, crap!

502
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,360
I shook my butt too much!

503
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,480
Ryo, the car!

504
00:21:59,740 --> 00:21:59,960
Yes!

505
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,400
Ah!

506
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,400
You, kid!

507
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,680
Now, everyone is still the police!

508
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,580
I'm sorry, but please follow the bike ahead!

509
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh, you're Ryo from the park's exit, right?

510
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,580
Yes!

511
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,220
All right, leave it to me!

512
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,580
Thank you for your cooperation!

513
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,540
All right, everyone!

514
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,740
We're going to stop at the intersection!

515
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,660
Ryo!

516
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,420
Yes?

517
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,940
My legs are about to fall off!

518
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,740
What?

519
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,420
Ah!

520
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,140
Ah!

521
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,160
I'm back!

522
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,340
I-I'm coming this way!

523
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,260
Ah!

524
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,460
Ah!

525
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:35,700
Ah!

526
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,640
Ah!

527
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,080
Ah!

528
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,340
Hey, hey!

529
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:38,720
Be quiet!

530
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,140
I'm still the police!

531
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:40,880
Ah!

532
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,840
Ah!

533
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,580
You did it!

534
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,060
Ah!

535
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,900
Where's Ryo?

536
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,540
Ah!

537
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,460
Ah!

538
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,340
Ah!

539
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,880
Hey, Gifu!

540
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,000
Ah!

541
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,280
I-I'm so sorry!

542
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,500
Ah!

543
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,240
Ah!

544
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,540
I-I'm in the b-base!

545
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,280
Oh, the bank produção is in trouble!

546
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,880
The president's office is sure.

547
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,940
What? The president's office?

548
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,960
Miyaji!

549
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,200
I have a lot of money!

550
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,800
Idiot!

551
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,100
You don't have any money!

552
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,120
Yeah!

553
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,920
I'm going to the bank with Miyaji!

554
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,580
The news that a naked editor with a heavy weight has appeared

555
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,600
has been leaked to the Katsushika office.

556
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,680
I'm going to the Shimasu Shogunate today!

557
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,820
It's the constitution!

558
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,340
No way!

559
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,340
Miyaji was also naked and shivering!

560
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,140
Ryo, at times like this,

561
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,700
your daily trust is what counts!

562
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,260
That's right, senpai!

563
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,360
You're so heartless!

564
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,320
The constitution is terrible!

565
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,960
Heartless! Heartless! Heartless!

566
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,300
In order to save the crumbling toy factory,

567
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,220
I made a figure that can move 40 places in the whole body!

568
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,740
Alright! I'll sell it, sell it, sell it,

569
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,840
and make a fortune!

570
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,820
Everyone, please buy it for me!

571
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,000
Next episode: New product doll on sale!

572
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,100
Would you please?

573
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:33,880
I'm rumored to be a woman who can't fall in love

574
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,880
But there's a mountain of things I want to do

575
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,080
Me

576
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,500
I want to ride in the vast desert on a motorcycle

577
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,140
I want to be more free than a bird

578
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:10,040
The lady's dream changes with the speed of a full moon

579
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,180
I'm sorry, wait for me

580
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,740
I'm going to dive into the future of the panorama

581
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:26,680
You understand, right?

582
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,080
I'm sorry, wait for me

583
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,580
I'm sorry, wait for me
