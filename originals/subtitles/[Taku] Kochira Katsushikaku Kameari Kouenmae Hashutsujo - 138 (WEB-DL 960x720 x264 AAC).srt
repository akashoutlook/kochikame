2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,980
When you watch TV,

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,040
light up your room and look away.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:25,820
Hello, goodbye.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,480
If you say goodbye,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,760
you'll be home soon.

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,320
Wapara, wapara, wapara.

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,860
Wapara, wapara, wapara.

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,080
Don't panic.

10
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,900
Where are you going in this small town?

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,180
Hurry and turn around.

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,760
Maybe,

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,680
you'll find a better person

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,400
than me.

15
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,520
Let me hear you.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,860
Let me hear you all night.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,940
I don't hate waiting.

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,800
Because I'm a Kameza woman.

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,340
I don't want to lose.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,560
I'm a Ginza woman.

21
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,820
I've loved you

22
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,440
for a long time.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,360
I love you,

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,520
Kameza woman.

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,560
Kameza Woman

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:36,940
Idiot!

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,520
What's this?

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,320
You said you're going to do some sports during your work.

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,960
Well,

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,940
this month's living allowance

31
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,460
is only 15,000 yen.

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,860
So I thought I'd give it a try.

33
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,140
No, Ryo.

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,940
You're just out of pay.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,820
What did you use, senpai?

36
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,520
Yeah, it's not only this month's Eloy Dreamstation 3.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,480
Besides,

38
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,980
I used Bio Inferno,

39
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,440
Bridgett & Neilsenji.

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:00,860
And,

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,400
exclusive public version of the Plum,

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,840
Great Ointment.

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,160
Oh, I used Fugiar.

44
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,380
Then I bought Bibbilman.

45
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,020
And...

46
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,580
Idiot!

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,600
You wish to waste your living

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,820
just like that?

49
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,420
I don't think you have much time

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:17,980
God,

51
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,140
you're going to have to save your pay.

52
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,080
You can't make money by doing that.

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,480
Think more realistically!

54
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,700
That's not what I meant.

55
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,600
There's nothing like that!

56
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,700
Listen, Ryotsu.

57
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,300
You get paid with that kind of attitude.

58
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,200
So you should use it in a good way.

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,980
You should change your mind and think about working seriously.

60
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,320
The money you earned by sweating is really valuable.

61
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,640
But even if I sweat and earn,

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,460
it doesn't change my money.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,060
Then you should make money with ease.

64
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,400
Idiot!

65
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,280
If you don't change your mind,

66
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,620
I'll give you a new law next month.

67
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:55,920
What?

68
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,920
The one who comes to the end of the human race seriously wins.

69
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,460
The one who doesn't understand that

70
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,740
is a big idiot who doesn't know the real joy of living.

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,900
Then I'll go back to the main office.

72
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,680
Yes, sir!

73
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,020
Thank you for your hard work!

74
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,380
Ryozan.

75
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:17,860
Are you there?

76
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,800
Yes, I'm in the back room.

77
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,300
What's wrong?

78
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,460
Help me, Mr. Fukai.

79
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,200
I don't care.

80
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,600
Matsukichi.

81
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,760
Who's that?

82
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,540
You're lying, aren't you?

83
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,320
You know Ryozan.

84
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,820
It's cold, Ryozan.

85
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,620
It's Matsukichi, Kato Matsukichi.

86
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,900
Kato Matsukichi?

87
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,480
See?

88
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,620
Ten years ago, in the winter,

89
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,860
at the convenience store in front of the station.

90
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,460
Ten years ago?

91
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,500
The convenience store in front of the station?

92
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,660
Yes.

93
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,180
Yes...

94
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,520
What's this?

95
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,160
You tried to escape!

96
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,620
So that's all you are, Mr. Oomari,

97
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,620
reading an erotic book while you're working.

98
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,880
This is...

99
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,280
I was trying to dig the notes.

100
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,400
Probably, I got lost in the stars because of you!

101
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,460
Digging, huh?

102
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:19,980
Please don't forget to subscribe!

103
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,480
You're the one who was doing the Manpiki!

104
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,740
Long time no see.

105
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,220
What do you want?

106
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,720
Ryo-san, this is it.

107
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,100
Ryo Tsukankichi-sama, 15,000 yen for a sepiro-dai-kin?

108
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,200
What the heck is this?

109
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,520
He tore his clothes off when he wore them.

110
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,820
He said he didn't have any money.

111
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,520
Then, he asked me to borrow him because he knew Ryo-san,

112
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,100
Thank you!

113
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,240
Thank you!

114
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,720
Don't be silly!

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,380
I don't have any money either!

116
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,780
I don't have any money to lend you!

117
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,960
Ryo-san, Ryo-san!

118
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,440
What?

119
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,380
Put on the clothes that you're wearing!

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,680
Hurry up and take them off!

121
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,580
I won't return them!

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,640
I'll have them pay for everything!

123
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,780
Ryo-san, please!

124
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,980
Don't get involved!

125
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,660
Get out of my way!

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,100
I don't have any money to lend you!

127
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,800
My wallet?

128
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,340
Ryo-san, you have 15,000 yen!

129
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,300
Well, I see.

130
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,120
Here's your receipt.

131
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,300
See you later.

132
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,820
Why am I in such a mess?

133
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,920
Help me, Mr. Fukin!

134
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,940
My name is Kato Matsukichi.

135
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,220
What's your job?

136
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,480
My job?

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,300
I can't say it in one word.

138
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,220
It's like a day full of dreams and romance.

139
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,260
It's like a day full of freedom.

140
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,980
A day full of free time.

141
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,940
What's your address?

142
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,920
I don't have one.

143
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,880
Well, you can take the wind if it blows,

144
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,480
or you can take the wind if you want,

145
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,320
but the only thing you can do is travel freely.

146
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,200
I don't have one.

147
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,880
What's your second-hand insurance?

148
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:55,840
What?

149
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,840
I've heard there's no one who can lend me 15,000 yen!

150
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,900
I don't have any money to lend you!

151
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,620
I see.

152
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,840
If you can lend me 100,000 yen,

153
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,080
I'll double it tomorrow.

154
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,320
How?

155
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,840
I'll tell you how.

156
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
I'll put in a couple of times

157
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,000
to make sure you get it.

158
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,740
I'll double it,

159
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,700
or even triple it!

160
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,840
You idiot!

161
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,960
If you do it so well,

162
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,500
I'll become a swordsman!

163
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,460
Then I'll take 50,000 yen.

164
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,600
What kind of logic is that?

165
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,480
You two look alike.

166
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:38,640
You're right.

167
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,600
You two look alike.

168
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,380
Then let's not talk about the horse race.

169
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,980
There's a way to make money more easily.

170
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,560
What?

171
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,320
The one who's always expanding his power

172
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,540
in the store when there's a festival.

173
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,040
Choco Banana!

174
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,960
Banana?

175
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,300
Ichigo Daifuku, who has stirred up a new wave in the candy industry!

176
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,660
What about it?

177
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,760
The third hit fruit series I thought of.

178
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,560
Miso Melon!

179
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,840
I'm sure this will be a big hit.

180
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,560
It'll make a lot of money!

181
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,600
Oh, I'm a genius.

182
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,100
I'm going to make my own sense.

183
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,260
You idiot!

184
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Who's going to eat that?

185
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,700
I don't think you should stick to it.

186
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,580
Then,

187
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,640
the three Dango brothers

188
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,260
put their hands on it

189
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,060
and make four balls?

190
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,980
The Sazaibon

191
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,520
put their hands on it

192
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,240
and the Chibimarubon

193
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,000
put their hands on the Nelton Party.

194
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,680
Don't you ever put your hands on it!

195
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,060
You see?

196
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,280
The only one who can make money easily

197
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,720
is the one who has the luck and talent.

198
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,680
If a super rich man like you

199
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,600
thinks you can make money with that idea,

200
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Listen, Matsukichi.

201
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,340
Think more realistically.

202
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,680
Think about changing your mind

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,080
and working seriously.

204
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,400
Listen.

205
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,000
The money you make from spilling the sweat

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,240
is the real value.

207
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,900
What?

208
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,640
The one who comes to the end

209
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,760
seriously and seriously

210
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,800
The one who doesn't know that

211
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,480
is a big idiot

212
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,100
the true joy of living.

213
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,140
Oh, you've grown a lot.

214
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,060
Zuchan!

215
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,420
Zuchan!

216
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,220
You said something

217
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,760
that I've heard before,

218
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Ryo-tsu.

219
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,140
Well,

220
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,320
I thought about it

221
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,640
and I deeply regret

222
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,220
what the chief said.

223
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,080
I deeply regret what the chief said.

224
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,040
Oh.

225
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,860
I don't want him

226
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,740
to make the same mistake

227
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:21,940
as I did.

228
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,780
I don't want him to make the same mistake

229
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,280
Oh.

230
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,220
Well,

231
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,380
I think he's just showing

232
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,320
his regretful attitude.

233
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,960
Then,

234
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,400
let's delete the constitution.

235
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,720
Well,

236
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,980
it depends on his attitude.

237
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,600
Oh,

238
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,460
Ryo-tsu, Kankichi.

239
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,300
I'll encourage you to work.

240
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,020
I'll encourage you to work.

241
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,160
I'll encourage you to work.

242
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,980
this is for you.

243
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,040
Thank you,

244
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:39,900
Mr. Fukui.

245
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,560
I see.

246
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,340
Ryo-tsu is borrowing money

247
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,400
from you.

248
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
What do you mean?

249
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,540
If you're looking for

250
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:46,980
his job,

251
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,560
I have a feeling

252
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,260
that...

253
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,400
Well,

254
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,920
please lend me money

255
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,020
No, no, no.

256
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,300
I'll bring it to you right away.

257
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,740
Yes.

258
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,040
I was in trouble

259
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,520
because I didn't have enough

260
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,320
people to work with.

261
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,680
I can do it today.

262
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,880
That's fine.

263
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,560
Oh,

264
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,080
Matsukichi,

265
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,480
I've decided.

266
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,660
Hey,

267
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,880
why are young and cute girls like you

268
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,600
in such a dirty and dirty store?

269
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,380
What time are you going to work today?

270
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,700
Don't you go to eat something delicious?

271
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,420
Stop it.

272
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,980
She's the young lady here.

273
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,680
Come here.

274
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,140
You're not introducing the chief.

275
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,100
What do you want to do?

276
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
If you want to work,

277
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,320
I'd like to work in a cool building.

278
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,660
I'm good at suits.

279
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,320
You're a little kid like you.

280
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,360
Where are you hiring a foreign one?

281
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,740
Then what about the artist?

282
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,280
I'm good at karaoke.

283
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,800
I'm going to make promotional tape

284
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,400
and sell it.

285
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,840
I wonder if you're doing well.

286
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,160
If you take care of the young people like that,

287
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,540
you'll grow up.

288
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,980
Look at people's actions

289
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,760
and fix my actions.

290
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:53,940
Hey,

291
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,580
what's the matter?

292
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,100
Really

293
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,540
It's easy to do a good job with money.

294
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:57,940
I don't care.

295
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,700
If there's something like that,

296
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
I'll do it.

297
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm serious.

298
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,560
Think seriously.

299
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,660
I'm going to get back my money.

300
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,780
You look pretty good.

301
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,500
Senior.

302
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
That's Mr. Matsukichi's.

303
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,600
I'm taking care of him.

304
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,160
What kind of work are you doing for Mr. Matsukichi?

305
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,100
That's...

306
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,080
This is Kameyari Park Exhibition.

307
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,760
What?

308
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,460
You're so stubborn.

309
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,100
You left the job

310
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,340
that someone found.

311
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,980
This time,

312
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,960
you're going to get your money back.

313
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:39,860
Huh?

314
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,440
It's a letter from Mr. Matsukichi.

315
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,660
Chiyo Kato.

316
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,380
No, Ryo.

317
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,140
He left a letter without permission.

318
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,700
Shut up!

319
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,900
In this case,

320
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,380
he's a fugitive who stepped on the debt

321
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:50,720
and ran away.

322
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,340
This is a mission

323
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,560
to catch his feet.

324
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
A mission.

325
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,140
Well...

326
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,020
To my brother,

327
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,420
I rarely give you letters,

328
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,400
but how are you?

329
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,000
Actually,

330
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,380
my father is going to be hospitalized.

331
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,600
I won't say it out loud,

332
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,680
but my father wants to see you.

333
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,200
My mother said

334
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,780
she doesn't need to wear a wedding dress,

335
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,040
so she wants you to go home.

336
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,660
Please,

337
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,680
come home soon.

338
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,640
Hey!

339
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,640
Don't tell me

340
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,400
you're trying to rob a bank.

341
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,820
Huh?

342
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,760
Chiyo is my sister.

343
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,080
Ten years ago,

344
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,100
I had a fight with my father.

345
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,060
I will never be like my father!

346
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,100
What?

347
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,500
You're a criminal and you're so cheeky!

348
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,220
I'm off, mom!

349
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,200
Chiyo!

350
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,540
Matsukichi!

351
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,080
Brother!

352
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,280
Brother!

353
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,220
My sister is a young entrepreneur.

354
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,020
She came to see me when I was about to leave.

355
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,540
I had to hit her once to get back.

356
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,220
So you're going to go bankrupt with Miso Melon?

357
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,420
Don't be a burden to your family.

358
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,460
I'll do something about it.

359
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,280
Go back to your country without complaining!

360
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,480
Besides, you don't have to look like a young entrepreneur.

361
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,380
You don't have to look like a young entrepreneur.

362
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,180
Huh?

363
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,780
Young entrepreneurs these days have more debt than wealth.

364
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,760
Compared to that, you're more wealthy.

365
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,460
Ryo-san...

366
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,560
It's been 10 years since I came back.

367
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,720
You're not doing well as a young entrepreneur.

368
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,420
Sakata and Hashiguchi are lucky.

369
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,540
Goro and Akio and Mitsuko are the best.

370
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,700
You didn't have to say that.

371
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,000
Excuse me.

372
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,960
30 of these.

373
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,720
You're going to buy souvenirs for everyone in the village?

374
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,920
I like this bag too.

375
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,260
Don't buy souvenirs for Tokyo or Hakata Mentaiko.

376
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,640
Well, take care.

377
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,700
Thanks for everything, Ryo-san.

378
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,140
If they're happy, give them back the money you borrowed from me.

379
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,940
Matsukichi, the door is closing. Let go of me.

380
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,100
Hey, let go of me!

381
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,720
Ouch!

382
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,700
Ouch!

383
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,500
Ouch!

384
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,340
Ouch!

385
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,020
Ouch!

386
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,760
I'm your boyfriend!

387
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,340
Then why don't we go to Morioka together?

388
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,920
Why do you have to go with me?

389
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,340
I'm saying let's go to the next station.

390
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,400
Ohmiya. Ohmiya.

391
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,780
I have to take care of you.

392
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,000
Then...

393
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,960
I'll give you a ride.

394
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,800
I'm not brave enough to go home alone.

395
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,640
What are you talking about? Go back!

396
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
I don't know what to do!

397
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,360
Where do we go when we get back home?

398
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,680
You can look this side.

399
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,700
Go that way!

400
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,280
Ouch!

401
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:55,860
Ouch!

402
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,280
Ouch!

403
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,620
Ouch!

404
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,700
The fish in my country is very delicious.

405
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,560
Yes, it's my treat.

406
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,200
You're the culprit?

407
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,100
No, it's for democracy.

408
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,920
Thank you for the hard work!

409
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,260
You're a mean man.

410
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,220
Hehe.

411
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,920
But a young professional and a policeman are the same.

412
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,700
Wow, I'm so tired.

413
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,780
Your suit suits you, Ryo-san.

414
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,200
You're my secretary, so you should keep your mouth shut.

415
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,160
I'll get this suit back, too.

416
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,300
How long will it take?

417
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,860
About two and a half hours.

418
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,400
Two and a half hours? What's taking so long?

419
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,700
Let's get back to work. I'm getting a little nervous as I get closer.

420
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,580
How long will it take?

421
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,540
All right, let's rehearse.

422
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,860
Rehearsal?

423
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,480
Ready?

424
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,720
Yes.

425
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,480
All right, get ready.

426
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,660
Yes.

427
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,500
I-I-I'm back!

428
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,140
No, you'll open the door when you get home.

429
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,020
Yes.

430
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,980
Gara Gara, I'm back!

431
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:13,600
Huh?

432
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,040
Oh, Dad, you're okay?

433
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,540
You idiot! I'm not okay because I caught a patient!

434
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,440
Huh? Oh, I see.

435
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,120
There's something else, right?

436
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,680
Yes.

437
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,280
I'm counting on you.

438
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,340
Oh, Dad, you're not done yet?

439
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,100
You idiot! What are you going to do if a patient gets into a fight with you?

440
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,820
You look pretty energetic.

441
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,560
You're going to say something a little embarrassed.

442
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,360
That's how it is in this situation.

443
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,460
That's right.

444
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,560
I'm counting on you.

445
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,020
Oh, Dad, you look pretty energetic.

446
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,940
I-I-I'm not going to lose yet, though.

447
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,300
What are you talking about?

448
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,200
Why do you say things that will excite the patient?

449
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,160
Even if you say that...

450
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,880
The smell of salt...

451
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,500
Whoa!

452
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,100
I can't wait to eat.

453
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,300
Dad, I've been working in this fish market since I left home.

454
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,320
You're not interested in fishing.

455
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:24,960
Me?

456
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,720
It's early in the morning, my work is tough, it's no joke.

457
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,260
Besides, I'm going back to Tokyo.

458
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,740
Huh?

459
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,800
Matsukichi!

460
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,240
It's Matsukichi, isn't it?

461
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,660
I heard that you're doing well in Tokyo.

462
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,340
Not really.

463
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,260
It's a boring thing, but this is a souvenir from Tokyo.

464
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,560
So please share it with everyone.

465
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,320
Oh, thank you.

466
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,460
By the way, your father, I haven't seen him since yesterday.

467
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,440
Did something happen?

468
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,860
As I thought...

469
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,080
Hey!

470
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,880
Hey!

471
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,320
It looks like a loose.

472
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,360
I thought you had a similar voice, but it was Matsukichi!

473
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,680
I thought it was someone else's father, Goro!

474
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,220
Here, take a look.

475
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,820
Oh!

476
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,560
By the way, I don't have anyone at home.

477
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,400
Do you know where he went?

478
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,280
You don't know?

479
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,560
Your father was hospitalized yesterday.

480
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,480
Chiyo and your mother are in the hospital.

481
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,460
Hospital?

482
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,080
They are all here.

483
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,460
Matsukichi!

484
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,060
Mom, Chiyo.

485
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,640
Father.

486
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,960
My brother!

487
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,700
Get a grip, Matsukichi!

488
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,400
Are you alright?

489
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,820
I'm fine.

490
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,020
I'm fine.

491
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,200
My father should be dead.

492
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,440
Doctor!

493
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Is he all right?

494
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,080
Did he succeed in the surgery?

495
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,500
N-No.

496
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,220
He succeeded.

497
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,540
Thank you very much, Doctor!

498
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,940
Well, then...

499
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,820
Thanks!

500
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,240
Dad!

501
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,120
Dad...

502
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,440
Hang in there, Dad!

503
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,020
It's me! I'm your son, Matsukichi!

504
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,480
I'm back!

505
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,620
I'm back!

506
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,800
Dad!

507
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,360
Idiot!

508
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,500
Don't make such a big sound!

509
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,860
Excuse me!

510
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,160
Excuse me!

511
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,080
You look much better after the big surgery.

512
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,120
Excuse me!

513
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,120
What's your father's disease?

514
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,620
It's a disease called "disease"!

515
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,140
Disase?

516
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,120
Matsukichi, by the way, who is this?

517
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,060
This is my secretary, Ryo-tsu.

518
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,180
Nice to meet you.

519
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,820
You're so cool!

520
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,960
Who called you such an idiot?

521
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,560
I didn't come here because I wanted to!

522
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,440
Well, well, you two.

523
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,960
This is not a fight between kids.

524
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,940
Dad, don't turn your back on me!

525
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,100
This is easier!

526
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,780
You're so shy!

527
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,520
I really wanted to see you.

528
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,100
Who said I wanted to see you?

529
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,540
Hey, do it as we rehearsed.

530
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,420
But it was G.

531
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,340
It's not G, so do it!

532
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,520
Yes...

533
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,980
Anyway, I'm glad my father is doing well.

534
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,020
Is he doing well?

535
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,660
He's your son, so he's not doing well.

536
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,560
What?

537
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,160
Dad, you came back,

538
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,360
but you can't say that!

539
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,100
That's right. It's been 10 years.

540
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,360
I haven't seen you in 10 years.

541
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,500
You're so mischievous.

542
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,600
How dare you?

543
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,040
I'm not mischievous!

544
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,700
I said I'm mischievous!

545
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,220
What?

546
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,560
Dad!

547
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Calm down, Matsukichi.

548
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,520
I got it.

549
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,860
What are you talking about, dad?

550
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,820
I'm not mischievous, I'm doing my best.

551
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,160
I came here today because I had a busy job.

552
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,380
I was sensitive to the trend since I was here.

553
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,660
I made clothes and succeeded in the apparel industry.

554
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,480
The company has grown rapidly.

555
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,020
The building is on the top of Aoyama.

556
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,420
The building is on the top of Aoyama.

557
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,400
The building is on the top of Aoyama.

558
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,160
We're going to have a branch overseas soon.

559
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,480
Wow!

560
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,580
Really, Ryotsu?

561
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,360
Well, yeah.

562
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,420
Here's a souvenir.

563
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,380
This is Eromes' scarf.

564
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,420
Thank you, brother.

565
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,400
Here, mom.

566
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,720
Oh, it's a Hakata Mentaiko.

567
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,560
I gave my father a good one.

568
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,480
You're so stingy.

569
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,640
I'm not stingy at all!

570
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,100
Hittaro, I'm not like my father.

571
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,020
I'll never be like my father.

572
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,780
I'm not a man who will end his life like you.

573
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,580
I'm not a man who will end his life like you.

574
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,260
I'm not a man who will end his life like you.

575
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,200
It's already this late.

576
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,000
It's already this late.

577
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,640
I have a meeting today, so I have to go home by evening.

578
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,000
I have a meeting today, so I have to go home by evening.

579
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,860
Hey, Ryotsu.

580
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,380
Chiyo, this is Kinjirou's work.

581
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,460
Are you leaving already?

582
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,400
Yeah.

583
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,900
The boss is hard.

584
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,620
Take care.

585
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,880
I'll take care of today's meeting.

586
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,320
The boss should stay here for a while.

587
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,020
Right?

588
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,260
No, I can't do that.

589
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,980
But...

590
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,100
Let go, Ryotsu.

591
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,740
Ryotsu, what are you doing?

592
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,340
My Aromani is expensive.

593
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,240
I'm sorry.

594
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,280
I'm really stupid.

595
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,700
You're telling lies.

596
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:29,760
I'm sorry.

597
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,540
It's all right, Matsukichi.

598
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,780
I won't do it again.

599
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,080
Father.

600
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
If you stay here,

601
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,080
I'll hear your words.

602
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,680
I'm not old enough to be a butcher.

603
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,160
I'm not old enough to be a butcher.

604
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,420
So I'm not going to pretend to be the owner.

605
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,540
So I'm not going to pretend to be the owner.

606
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,800
Matsukichi.

607
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,300
-Machi! -Machi!

608
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,080
Mr. Ryoichi!

609
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,320
Your stupid son has helped you.

610
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,280
No, I...

611
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,220
I was wrong to raise him.

612
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,340
He's become such a half-baked idiot.

613
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,500
But his life is his.

614
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,680
I think he should live as he likes.

615
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,540
As he likes.

616
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,800
Thank you for waiting.

617
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,120
What are you doing, Matsukichi?

618
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,660
You're going back to Tokyo?

619
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,620
This is a specialty here.

620
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,980
Take it as a souvenir.

621
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,580
So you're staying?

622
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,480
My father is a grandpa.

623
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,020
I thought I'd have to take care of him.

624
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,940
What a noisy father.

625
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,780
I'm sorry.

626
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,060
Mr. Ryo!

627
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,700
You're so mean.

628
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,760
You're so annoying!

629
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,700
Let go of me!

630
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,940
You're making me a fool!

631
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,180
Let go!

632
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,480
So this is Matsukichi?

633
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,180
You've become so strong.

634
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,480
He's really a man of the sea.

635
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,120
Mr. Ryo, thank you for your help.

636
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,500
I was going to return the money I borrowed in the first month, but...

637
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,780
I was going to return the money I borrowed in the first month, but...

638
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,940
I was going to return the money I borrowed in the first month, but...

639
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,340
I'm going to return it to you with a huge amount of money.

640
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,460
I'm really going to become a fisherman this time.

641
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,700
My father said he wouldn't take it.

642
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,520
I told him I'd continue even if it was for fun.

643
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,780
Now I'm planning a fishing trip.

644
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,920
Please come and play with me.

645
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,520
You can go out at sunrise and do fishing.

646
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,400
You can experience all kinds of fishing so that you won't get tired of it for the whole day.

647
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,940
You can go fishing.

648
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,800
There's a lot of money in the savings.

649
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,180
It's all a whole bunch.

650
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:54,980
There's a lot of money in the savings.

651
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,020
It's all a whole bunch.

652
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,300
What do you think?

653
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:55,700
Good.

654
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,900
Don't you think this idea is cool?

655
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,400
How will it look in your eyes?

656
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:35,540
After a fight, you always give me a short kiss

657
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,160
You were so dear to me

658
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,180
How much can people get

659
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,780
With such irreplaceable things?

660
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,380
You are me

661
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,880
I am you

662
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,240
I was satisfied with just that

663
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,940
Just laughing at you

664
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,860
I felt that all the pain was healed

665
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:23,340
Oh, fireworks?

666
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,820
I played well when I was a child

667
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,780
I played with my friends in a rocket fire

668
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,700
I stabbed a 2B bullet into a dog's poop

669
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,740
No, not like that

670
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,940
Next time, "A Gift Bloomed in the Night Sky"

671
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,020
Please watch it!
