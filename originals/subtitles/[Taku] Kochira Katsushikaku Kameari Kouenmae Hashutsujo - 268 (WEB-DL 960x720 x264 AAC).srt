1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,480
"He's not here..."

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,000
I have 900 yen left this month.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,680
The crab is popular, so I can't take it out.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,140
Ryo-chan!

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,120
But I can't throw away the 7-padded koi.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,560
Ryo-chan!

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,960
As a 3-pack, I can be more at ease with the single-handed method.

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,120
But...

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,100
Ryo-chan!

10
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,660
Ehhh...

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,660
What are you doing?

12
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,120
I'm not suddenly.

13
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,260
I've been calling you a few times.

14
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,900
I understand. What's the matter?

15
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,000
What's the matter?

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,780
I have a lot of things to do.

17
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,960
Don't let me waste your time.

18
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,320
Yes, yes.

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm a scary woman when I turn my enemy.

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,120
Hello, Ryo-chan.

21
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,100
Again?

22
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,920
Where do you want me to sell land?

23
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,540
Are you looking down on me?

24
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,100
You can't sell anything you don't have, right?

25
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,820
What?

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,160
Don't sell anything else.

27
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,340
Thank you very much.

28
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,640
Is it a real estate again?

29
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,040
I think it was yesterday.

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,080
I'll enter this month.

31
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,020
It's been a day since I entered the house.

32
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,720
Why are you coming to me?

33
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
Isn't it your house in Asakusa?

34
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,600
You can't sell there.

35
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,720
Do you have any other intentions?

36
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,200
Yeah.

37
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,820
Wait a minute.

38
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,680
Speaking of another land...

39
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,420
I see.

40
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,240
That's it for today.

41
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,660
See you!

42
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,340
Was there an intention?

43
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,380
Yes.

44
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,280
When watching TV, make your room bright.

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,140
Stealthily and also you.

46
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,500
Good!

47
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,900
Keep step in.

48
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,580
You do not have to be serious about it.

49
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,480
I mean it.

50
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,860
I don't need to be scary.

51
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,340
I mean it.

52
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,920
Now,

53
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,740
Follow me!

54
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,080
Then,

55
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,760
Yes.

56
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,180
You see?

57
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,840
To buy a new house,

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,380
I wonder if I'll be able to do it somehow

59
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,780
I know, I know, I know

60
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,100
If you know, then shut up and follow me!

61
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,220
Follow me!

62
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,120
Hyoutanから10億円

63
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,700
Hurry, Gramateng!

64
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,700
We have to save Matsusako!

65
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,080
Dad, why don't you live?

66
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,320
What are you doing?

67
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,080
I'm going to die!

68
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,240
You're just working from home!

69
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,900
Shut up! What do you want?

70
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,580
My old man who passed away last year

71
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,600
Huh? Tsukuda Island's father?

72
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,060
He's still alive, isn't he?

73
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,980
It's his brother

74
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
Oh, you mean Uncle Minokichi

75
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,520
That old man didn't have any land?

76
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,480
He had a lot of land in the past

77
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,140
This used to be Uncle Minokichi's house

78
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,480
But he loved drinking and gambling

79
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,140
He sold his land and everyone else disappeared

80
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,100
That land was left somewhere

81
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,700
What?

82
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,160
And for some reason the real estate company thinks I'm the owner of that land

83
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,860
If we do well, that land might sell for tens of millions

84
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,660
What? Tens of millions?

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,100
Uncle Minokichi's luggage is here

86
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,780
I think Yone cleaned it up after the funeral

87
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,480
Mom!

88
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:30,760
Mom!

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,600
Wait!

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,360
Dad, that old man was single all his life

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,340
Yeah

92
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,720
If his parents or relatives find out, it'll be a big deal

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,960
Dad and I will take care of this

94
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,000
Then we'll be able to split the land

95
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,260
You haven't changed at all since you were a kid

96
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,560
You're against it?

97
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,500
No

98
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,560
Okay

99
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:55,780
Okay

100
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,480
This is the phone I used to use when I was in elementary school

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,840
Don't take anything that's boring

102
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,940
I'll take anything that's old

103
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,280
It's an album

104
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,860
Dad was young back then

105
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,780
Of course

106
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,680
It was hard for him to be popular and his mother to be jealous

107
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,500
I can say anything about the past

108
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,240
If you think it's a lie, ask your mom

109
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,500
Come on

110
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,240
Forget it and find out

111
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,920
Where's my land?

112
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,120
Yeah

113
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,160
You guys

114
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,580
Ouch

115
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,020
What have you been doing?

116
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,420
Are you looking for something?

117
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,160
Ouch

118
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,440
We're looking for old clothes

119
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,640
Right?

120
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,160
That's right

121
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,400
The old clothes are cheaper now

122
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Clothes?

123
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,020
It doesn't matter

124
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,620
You can put them back when you're done

125
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,920
-Give it to me. -Okay.

126
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,000
What's with the "what the hell" thing?

127
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,240
If you don't hurry, I'll find out.

128
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,000
I know.

129
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,940
-I found it! -Really?

130
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,340
It's the box that Minokichi-ojisan was taking care of.

131
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,180
Yeah, there's no mistake. The right to use it must be in here.

132
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,780
That's the right to use it.

133
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,660
What's this?

134
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,360
It's Harasetsuko's bromide.

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,740
Bromide?

136
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,080
Everything else looks like a movie actress.

137
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,840
It can't be helped. It's a Miha old man.

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,560
Huh?

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,560
The bottom is filled with love from a woman.

140
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,740
As expected of the playboy, Doraku-ojisan.

141
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,300
A broken watch, a small watch...

142
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,760
It's all useless, but he's taking good care of it.

143
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,920
What's this? A communication book?

144
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,580
It's all soldiers.

145
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,840
Idiot. It's the family.

146
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,800
It's a big book.

147
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,180
Anyway, let's look for the bottom again.

148
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,040
This is...

149
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,260
Land...

150
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,480
Law...

151
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,100
What?

152
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,920
No.

153
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,400
Dad, it's the Land Law.

154
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,600
Really?

155
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,640
Where is the land?

156
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,740
Where?

157
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,320
Kasumi-cho...

158
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
That's Azabu.

159
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,180
What?

160
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,140
It's the first land.

161
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,460
It's a big hit, Dad.

162
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,380
Dad, you're right.

163
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,880
Mino-kichi-ojisan is great.

164
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,120
Did you find the

165
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,200
Did you find the

166
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,000
Did you find the

167
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,020
Did you find the

168
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,540
Did you find the

169
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,400
Did you find the

170
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,760
Did you find the

171
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:34,980
Did you find the

172
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,840
Did you find the

173
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,000
Did you find the

174
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,620
Did you find the

175
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:40,980
Did you find the

176
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,400
Did you find the

177
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,780
Did you find the

178
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,780
Did you find the

179
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,620
Did you find the

180
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,560
Did you find the

181
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,740
Did you find the

182
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,180
Did you find the

183
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,760
Did you find the

184
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,480
Did you find the

185
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,380
There is also.

186
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,620
It has a house.

187
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,280
No.

188
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,280
The reason I found it is because it tried to me.

189
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,560
I durable enough to be a dad.

190
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,360
No.

191
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,700
Archers don't just bitterly fight to win this battle.

192
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:04,740
I'm sorry, but I'm not good enough to you.

193
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,000
And in the end, only the middle remained.

194
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,560
Yes.

195
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,560
So, you're saying that Minokichi-jisan sold the land and built a castle?

196
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,340
Well, a small land like that won't cost much.

197
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,140
However, the ten pots are an important point.

198
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,700
This is a project that our first-class construction group is working on.

199
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,360
It's the completion of the Big Hills Mansion.

200
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,420
Huh?

201
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,260
It's crumbling here.

202
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,160
Yes.

203
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,520
If we don't get the land of Lord Ryotsu,

204
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,080
we'll have to make it this way.

205
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,000
I see.

206
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,460
Then, even if we buy ten pots, we might be able to buy them at a higher price.

207
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,660
If we buy this place from another company,

208
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:46,960
we'll be in trouble.

209
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,100
The president wants to settle this in one fell swoop.

210
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,140
That's right.

211
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,540
Maybe it'll sell for about 50 million yen.

212
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,400
So, the amount we're going to show you is...

213
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,460
The amount is...

214
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,980
We're putting a lot of effort into the Big Hills project.

215
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,600
The amount the president has decided is...

216
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,280
Hmm. How much is it?

217
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,400
3.3 square meters equals 100 million yen.

218
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,320
In short, it's 100 million yen!

219
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,360
What's 100 million yen?

220
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,160
100 million yen!

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,760
100 million yen!

222
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,640
Please sell the five pots.

223
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,700
I'll sell them! I decided in 0.7 seconds!

224
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,420
Well, I'm sorry I'm late.

225
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,240
Father!

226
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,800
I've been waiting.

227
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,880
Father, please be happy!

228
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,420
That land sold for 100 million yen!

229
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,380
What? Really?

230
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,220
No, it's 100 million...

231
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,220
You just think about real estate,

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,880
and don't talk about your family.

233
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,420
Otherwise, you'll change your mind in 0.4 seconds.

234
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,120
Y-Yes.

235
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,060
100 million yen is amazing.

236
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,900
It's not a dream, Kankichi.

237
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,180
Before my father came, I negotiated and raised the price.

238
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,080
I'm glad.

239
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,380
This is the contract.

240
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,840
Please sell them here and here.

241
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,760
Oh, yes.

242
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,400
Wait a minute, father.

243
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,060
I'll check the documents first.

244
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,260
Yeah.

245
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,400
Okay, that's good.

246
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,300
Well, father, sell them here.

247
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,900
It's coming.

248
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,340
And here, too.

249
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,020
Good.

250
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,700
All right, it's settled, right?

251
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,120
Yeah.

252
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Well, well.

253
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,160
Then, please cut 100 million yen into small pieces and bring it to me.

254
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,420
Then I will...

255
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:31,800
I'll give it to my father.

256
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,400
So don't make any mistakes.

257
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,900
Y-Yes, I know.

258
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,800
All right, then let's go, father.

259
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:40,500
Yeah.

260
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,940
Yeah, that's good, that's good.

261
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,880
Well, I'm a scary man when I turn into an enemy.

262
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,340
Y-Yes.

263
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,320
Thank you very much.

264
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,880
That's good, father.

265
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,260
Yeah, it's true.

266
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,060
He's a really scary man.

267
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,200
He's going to take 900 million yen.

268
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,920
He's a really scary man.

269
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,480
What's wrong, Ryo-san?

270
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,380
Why are you grinning so much?

271
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,220
Oh, me?

272
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,340
Why are you grinning so much?

273
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,160
Did something good happen to you?

274
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,940
Well, not really.

275
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,060
I've earned 900 million yen.

276
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,420
That says something about them.

277
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,440
The problem is how much money they use.

278
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,980
In this era of ultra-low-minimum wages,

279
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,900
it's not easy to give credit to the bank.

280
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,440
It's a good thing to make everyone happy.

281
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,100
I want to do something big like this.

282
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
For example...

283
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,260
This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this!

284
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,700
I'm going to buy everything in this store!

285
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,900
I did it!

286
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,580
No!

287
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,860
It's small!

288
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,620
It's not big at all!

289
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,220
Alright, I'll use it more!

290
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,380
Today is the day of the big day!

291
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,920
All mention cards have been collected.

292
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,360
Hahaha!

293
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,180
I'm going to buy everything to make all the pachinko bags empty!

294
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,340
I'm going to buy them all!

295
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,820
Success!

296
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,820
This will be a good use of about 900 million yen!

297
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,140
I don't have good ways of using money to make you like me, your old friend!

298
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,380
I'm going to go through the moon tonight!

299
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,560
Alright!

300
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,140
Alright, I'll put all the money in the red 99!

301
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,220
Thank you!

302
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,660
Now, how is it?

303
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,280
Red 99!

304
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,400
Yes!

305
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,840
No, black 100!

306
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,480
No, I can't waste it.

307
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,780
I'm glad I thought about it.

308
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,480
I can't even do it myself.

309
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,380
I'm back!

310
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,580
Good work!

311
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,660
No problem.

312
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,060
I'll think of a more reliable way to use it.

313
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,880
The British famous horse, the Dian, is at the auction.

314
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,660
British market?

315
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,980
As expected of the real thing of Salabread.

316
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,340
He has a good face.

317
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,020
Dian? That horse?

318
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,400
Do you know him?

319
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,260
My British friend had an unmatched horse.

320
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,260
He said he wanted a Dian at the next auction.

321
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,720
I see.

322
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,140
I was wrong.

323
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,560
I'm sorry.

324
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:22,820
I didn't know that.

325
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
But I'm glad I have money.

326
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,460
Because I can buy a horse.

327
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,880
I have money, too.

328
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,740
That's right.

329
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,460
I'll be a horse owner.

330
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,880
Salabread will earn a lot.

331
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,980
That Dian is the descendant of Richard, the master of the Derby.

332
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,020
So, he will make 2 million pounds.

333
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,460
How much is 2 million pounds in Japanese yen?

334
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,900
About 400 million.

335
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,200
If the enemy has 400 million, I can win.

336
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,120
That's right.

337
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,000
Then, 200 million is required.

338
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,340
It can be spent talking with 2 million.

339
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,440
1 million is a lot.

340
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,480
In other words, it's still a lot.

341
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,140
You have a great idea, right?

342
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,660
A good idea.

343
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,380
No way.

344
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,960
Was opened?

345
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,580
Yes.

346
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:21,980
I directed a voodoo.

347
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,540
We've appeared.

348
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:22,560
I will show you about this.

349
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,360
The End

350
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,360
I'm fine with this, so use this one billion for your own sake!

351
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,840
You gave me all the money so that Kankichi could be a parent and a child.

352
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,680
I'm very grateful for your blessing, and I'll use this one billion.

353
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,540
What do you mean by one billion?

354
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,360
Don't be surprised!

355
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,420
You've been acting strange since yesterday.

356
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,020
You were grinning and grumbling.

357
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,620
I didn't say anything.

358
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,220
I wouldn't ask you if you didn't want to.

359
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,860
I know. You're going through a lot of trouble, Yone.

360
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,060
Alright.

361
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,300
Hey, Mom.

362
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,740
What?

363
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,320
Do you have anything you want?

364
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,560
A ring or a handbag, anything is fine, so tell me.

365
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,800
I want something.

366
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,260
Yeah, something you want.

367
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,040
Oh, I know. I want a boss who works.

368
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,300
Really?

369
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,840
What is it?

370
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,540
What a good person.

371
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,680
Are you going out?

372
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,360
Yeah, he's not a worker.

373
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,160
Come play with me for a bit.

374
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,300
Oh, I see.

375
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,500
If I use it now, it'll be the money of a homeless man.

376
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,460
I'll share it with you around Ginza.

377
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,440
I'm sorry.

378
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,820
I'm sorry.

379
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,370
I finally got a chance.

381
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,300
You're awesome, Yoshi.

382
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,800
The best friend.

383
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,500
I love you like my best friend.

384
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,280
You think you're good?

385
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,100
Thank you very much.

386
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,860
Thank you so much.

387
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,220
I'm just looking forward to it.

388
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,300
You will enjoy eating this hotift, aren't you?

389
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,540
You're welcome.

390
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,080
You're welcome.

391
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,240
If you return to Japan, we'll get the code back for you.

392
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,460
You're so funny.

393
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,640
Oh, here they are!

394
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,840
Mr. Nio, say something!

395
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,200
How do you feel about being the world's best member?

396
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,860
Please, say something!

397
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,240
Even as a local civil servant, I've worked dozens of times as much as people.

398
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:07,060
I've been to the UK to make a long-term dream of becoming a bar owner with the 900 million yen I've saved up.

399
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,360
But there's nothing bad about it.

400
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,260
Is there really nothing bad about it?

401
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,300
Huh, old man?

402
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,600
You're a 900 million-

403
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,840
I don't want to hear that. You're misunderstanding me.

404
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,980
What do you mean? Explain it to me!

405
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,720
No, old man. The land was sold for 100 million yen.

406
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,920
But what happens when you give 100 million yen to an old man who only has 100 million yen?

407
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,160
If he's working hard, it's the same as you.

408
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,920
I thought about how to use the money in front of the Buddhist temple.

409
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,380
I thought about buying a handbag for my mother.

410
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,000
But I ran out of the house.

411
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,240
I didn't have the courage to share it in Ginza.

412
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,540
After all, I was always drinking cold sake in the bar.

413
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,000
You were watching?

414
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,880
So for my father's sake, I took all the money and operated a dream-like asset management.

415
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,480
I'll win the big case for my father.

416
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,140
After all, it's a battle of truth.

417
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,200
It's a battle of truth.

418
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,760
I'm going to get 100 billion yen in prize money.

419
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,680
100 billion yen?

420
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,240
Not only the prize money.

421
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,180
The amount of the commercial, the movie, the CD, the DVD, the DDT.

422
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,640
That much?

423
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,520
Yes, it's a hundred million yen.

424
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,760
That's great.

425
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,480
I'm sure that Nino-Kichi will be impressed with my father's enthusiasm.

426
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,600
Uncle Nino-Kichi.

427
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,980
Well done, Genji.

428
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,840
You're a man who looks up when you buy a horse.

429
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,900
That's why I'm a good brother.

430
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,060
Uncle Nino-Kichi.

431
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,540
Thank you.

432
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,200
As expected of my child, you're big, Kankichi.

433
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,580
You have good muscles.

434
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,020
As you can see, it's a selfish and luxurious horse.

435
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,540
From now on, you will need the money to maintain it.

436
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,360
Can I borrow 100 million yen from my father?

437
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,220
Of course.

438
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,700
Use it without worrying.

439
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,600
Thank you.

440
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,980
Let's bloom a flower together, father.

441
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,840
Okay.

442
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,740
Ryo-chan is the owner.

443
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,260
I can't believe I'm the owner.

444
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,740
Charles lost the auction, but he was very disappointed.

445
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,000
I wonder if that horse is good for Ryo-san.

446
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,880
What?

447
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,940
You don't like it unless it's a hotel?

448
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,840
A luxury four-star hotel that can enjoy the night view of Tokyo.

449
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,800
A one-night suite room for 3 million yen.

450
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,080
I only eat food from the UK.

451
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,400
After all, the horse of memory is different, Kankichi.

452
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,760
Don't mess with me.

453
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,000
Kankichi, stop it.

454
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,600
Let go of me.

455
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,640
You haven't repented yet.

456
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,780
I'll make you a hot pot and eat you.

457
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,320
I said stop it.

458
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,180
This horse will pay you millions of yen.

459
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,520
Be patient.

460
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,040
I can't use the remaining 100 million yen.

461
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,180
I have to make the diamond race as soon as possible.

462
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,800
If you don't let me do it, I'll be in trouble.

463
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,220
Wait for the course at full speed.

464
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,080
Yes.

465
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,860
It's a test, Diane.

466
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,720
If you can't do it, you'll be in trouble.

467
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,340
Do you think you're kidding?

468
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,140
I'm serious.

469
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,400
He's running.

470
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,020
Are you looking down on me?

471
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,900
But he's giving you a good time.

472
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,200
What?

473
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,360
He's not slowing down at all.

474
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,920
What?

475
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,540
He's back.

476
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,260
It's a great speed.

477
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,360
It's a new record.

478
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,060
What?

479
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,780
I did it, Kankichi.

480
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,060
However...

481
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,160
Well done, Diane.

482
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,240
It's a feast.

483
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,120
Where in the world is there a horse that can run on his hind legs?

484
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,620
What?

485
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,040
Kankichi!

486
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:53,720
What?

487
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,940
What?

488
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,960
That bastard.

489
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,300
The horse racing club in England let him go.

490
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,640
I knew it.

491
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,940
President, I can't ride that horse.

492
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,200
Hey, the race is coming soon.

493
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,540
Someone please hit someone else.

494
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,680
You'll ride it, Kankichi.

495
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,020
Take responsibility for buying such a useless horse for 900 million yen.

496
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,480
I got it.

497
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,700
How was it?

498
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,740
How do you feel about participating in the race yourself?

499
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,060
It's an honor to be able to fight with Aiba, right, Diane?

500
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,380
You bastard.

501
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,080
Well, it's finally the start of today's main race.

502
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,580
And the last one who didn't get in the gate is...

503
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,420
Kankichi, you're going to be in trouble.

504
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,660
Listen, Diane.

505
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,600
If you lose, the food is domestic and it's a waste of vegetables.

506
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,700
What?

507
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,140
The race is starting at the corner.

508
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,220
No, it's a little late.

509
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,520
Oh, Diane is coming.

510
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,280
What are you doing, idiot?

511
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,860
Oh, no.

512
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,960
Diane is going to be in trouble.

513
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,100
Oh, wait a minute.

514
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,340
Senpai.

515
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,620
Ryo-chan, do your best.

516
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,400
The late Diane is still in the lead.

517
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:04,920
It's amazing.

518
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,060
It's amazing.

519
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:06,920
It's amazing.

520
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,440
It's good.

521
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,980
It's a good start.

522
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,360
Kankichi went from the first corner to the first corner.

523
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,920
Diane went up to the 5th place at once.

524
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,160
Good luck.

525
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,840
The lead is Tan-chan.

526
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,960
Next is the SDG, Kamiya, and Diane.

527
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,020
Diane is in the 4th place.

528
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,520
She's going straight through the 4th corner.

529
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,480
Diane is in the 3rd place.

530
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,320
She's going to win.

531
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:25,980
The 3rd place is Kakeyama.

532
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,680
It was the top.

533
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,200
And Diane was at the top.

534
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,380
Go, Diane.

535
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:30,960
Go.

536
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,140
What?

537
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,500
Let's go.

538
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,980
Diana suddenly changed her starting position.

539
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,540
All right.

540
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,700
It was the timing that made her break out.

541
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,360
I'm going to go with that any way.

542
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:39,980
Yay.

543
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:40,680
That was awesome.

544
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,580
That was fantastic.

545
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Ryo-chan is good.

546
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,380
Ryo-chan.

547
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:46,620
Ryo-chan.

548
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,060
Are you okay?

549
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,760
You little bastard.

550
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,180
It's not my fault.

551
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,040
That guy...

552
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,200
Charles from back then!

553
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,640
Charles, long time no see!

554
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,280
Oh, Mr. Nakagawa.

555
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,200
So this is the friend who was after Diane?

556
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,880
Yes. Charles was unable to give up Diane, and he came all the way to Japan.

557
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,380
Diane is my horse! I've given him a billion!

558
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,100
I'm going to make millions from now on!

559
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
I'm going to make millions from now on!

560
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,120
Kankichi, if you don't ride it, you'll lose it.

561
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,320
Sell it!

562
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,200
Yes, yes. Charles says he wants to buy Diane.

563
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,480
I'll sell it if I can make a billion!

564
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,820
Don't laugh! I'm serious!

565
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,180
Kankichi, you should pay the trouble before Ms. Hachida changes her mind.

566
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,300
How about a billion yen?

567
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,740
Oh, no!

568
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,300
Then I'll give you 90 million.

569
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,140
You can't lose any more than this.

570
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,080
8,500 million!

571
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,380
Then I'll give you 80 million!

572
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,000
Damn it, he's looking at other people's feet.

573
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,500
It's a plate of bread. It's a famous dish. Why is it 10,000 yen?

574
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,380
It's because you're not a fool.

575
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,040
Don't keep complaining about your father not doing anything.

576
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,280
It's because you're a horse!

577
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,180
You've made a billion yen!

578
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,580
What?

579
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,180
Why are you two doing this?

580
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,100
Mom, you...

581
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,420
You're about Minokichi's land...

582
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,740
I'm sure he's impressed by the shadow of the grass.

583
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,120
Make a thousand yen with this money.

584
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:31,900
You idiot.

585
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,020
Hehehe.

586
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,120
Ah, a piece from Hyotan.

587
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,760
A billion yen from Tanabota is a billion yen.

588
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
If you say so.

589
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,000
Both Kankichi and I are pawns of the coin again now.

590
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,840
Yeah.

591
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,840
Well, all you need to do is pay the special fee.

592
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,180
Right, Dad?

593
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,820
Yeah, that's right.

594
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,800
You idiot!

595
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,200
Hehehehe...

596
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,540
It was a rainy afternoon, and someone was calling me

597
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,880
I looked back and walked

598
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,220
"Mom, please help me!"

599
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,120
I felt a strange feeling at that time

600
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,640
So I walked the red and black tile

601
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,400
I walked the red and black tile

602
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,620
Everyone was a child at one time, but they all forget

603
00:24:52,620 --> 00:25:00,600
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above their eyes

604
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,000
Look at that corner

605
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,620
Everyone is looking at the blue aunt above their eyes

606
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,280
I can see everyone

607
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,500
Let's go

608
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,360
There is a turtle over there

609
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,240
There must be a turtle

610
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,280
Come to our town

611
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,460
Thank you

612
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:34,300
How about this? This is the helicopter I made

613
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,080
It's called "Shouldercopter"

614
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,220
Even if this is a traffic jam, it will definitely be a big hit

615
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,380
I'm a genius

616
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,440
Let's go

617
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,920
Next episode, "Fly, Shouldercopter"

618
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,040
Thank you for watching

619
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,920
Thank you for watching

620
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,760
Thank you for watching

621
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,300
Thank you for watching

622
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,400
Thank you for watching

623
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,040
Thank you for watching
