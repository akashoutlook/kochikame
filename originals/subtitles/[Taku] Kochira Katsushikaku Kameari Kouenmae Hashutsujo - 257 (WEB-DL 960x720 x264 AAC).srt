1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,700
When watching TV, look to the right of the TV.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,540
When watching TV, look at the TV, and then look at the TV with the cover of your eyes, and then look away from it.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,520
Those who have no money, come with me!

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:23,800
Come here!

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,140
I'm not here, but I'm worried

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,800
Look at the blue sky

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,900
White clouds

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,980
They'll get better eventually

9
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,260
You're a jobless guy, come to me

10
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but I'm worried

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,420
Look at the red clouds

12
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:11,980
They're burning

13
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,680
They'll get better eventually

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,380
I know, I know, I know

15
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,500
I know, I know, I know

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,760
If you know, then come to me

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm the 0-0-4th, a robot police officer who was made by the police chief's efforts

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,660
I was assigned to the police station before Kameari Park

19
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,500
But I don't know what to do

20
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,340
I'm just a doji

21
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm a pain in the ass to the god Ryoichi-senpai

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,760
The name I was given seems to be useless

23
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,980
But the god did his best for me who was used as an obstacle

24
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,160
I managed to not get into trouble

25
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,940
Thank you, god

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,540
They're developing a new robot police officer

27
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,520
I'll do my best too

28
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,780
The robot police officer of the burning flames

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,760
Here you go

30
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,980
Thanks, Damedaro

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,440
No

32
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,540
I'm sorry. It's my job

33
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,320
No, it's normal for the robot to help humans

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,960
But it really helps

35
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,940
Damedaro is here

36
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,400
To sign-off the railings

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,080
Terai suddenly stopped working.

38
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,380
Please take care of Terai until he comes back.

39
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,560
Yes, I will.

40
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,000
It seems like Senpai is back.

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,720
Alright!

42
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,900
Who are you?

43
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,280
I'm Robot Officer Development 005.

44
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,320
Any complaints?

45
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,560
I don't have any complaints.

46
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,780
I heard that Robot Officer Development 004 is here.

47
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,760
You're 004, right?

48
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,560
Yes, I am. Nice to meet you.

49
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,400
Don't call me Robot!

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,260
But I'm your junior.

51
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,580
Don't you get it?

52
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,040
Senpai and junior are the rules of human society.

53
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,300
The world of robots is the opposite.

54
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,140
Look! This is my performance report.

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,040
What?

56
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,560
How is it?

57
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,460
It's better than you, right?

58
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,260
New robots have the latest technology.

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,040
It's excellent and great.

60
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,080
Remember it!

61
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,980
Y-Yes...

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,140
I see.

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,760
You have that kind of thinking, don't you?

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,240
What?

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,120
This bicycle looks like Senpai's.

66
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,600
I left it in front of the pachinko shop in front of the pachinko shop.

67
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,180
So I came here.

68
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,500
It's obviously a police item.

69
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,040
It's a police item, right?

70
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,200
What do you mean?

71
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,480
I didn't leave it here.

72
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,520
Where is my bicycle?

73
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,540
While I'm in the middle of pachinko,

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,460
what are you doing?

75
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,020
Damn it, I'll find it!

76
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,440
My bicycle!

77
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,140
God, welcome back.

78
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,720
Why is this bicycle here?

79
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,720
The development 005 has come.

80
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,300
The development 005?

81
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,500
Oh, it's me.

82
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,560
You're a robot officer again.

83
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,440
You!

84
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,800
The unqualified officer who was pachinkoing while working.

85
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,300
I was watching the shop.

86
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,120
Don't imitate me!

87
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,940
Are you motivated?

88
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,160
Robots are stronger if they have power.

89
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,360
Damn it!

90
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,640
Senpai, you can't be so violent.

91
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,800
I just took the punch.

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,180
You did it so well.

93
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,500
Think about the power of the robot.

94
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,980
Ultra Gear!

95
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,380
Damn it!

96
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,160
I missed it.

97
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,880
You're weaker than a human with just your tip of the tongue.

98
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,060
Yes, it's done.

99
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,200
All right, perfect.

100
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,400
Now I can't be a human anymore.

101
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,340
You're a hero.

102
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,280
You can't beat a human with just your tongue.

103
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,120
What do you want?!

104
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,920
There's both good and bad things to say.

105
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,360
What do you mean by just your tongue?

106
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,400
Delete it quickly!

107
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,140
Okay!

108
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,820
The bubble is all over my mouth.

109
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,280
Dumbass!

110
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,660
Are you going to make the exhaust a fire?

111
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,940
Well...

112
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,300
When the temperature rises, the wiring shortens,

113
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,480
and it may cause the fuel to be carbonized.

114
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:12,980
What?

115
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,340
Does that mean...

116
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,020
If you get angry, the fire will be on?

117
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,860
That's what it means.

118
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,460
What a ridiculous blood vessel robot.

119
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:23,980
What?

120
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,600
Who is a blood vessel robot?

121
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,040
A robot that burns with anger is a blood vessel fire.

122
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,440
It's obvious.

123
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:30,700
Okay.

124
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,160
Your name is Fire Robot Doikari Hono Onosuke.

125
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,920
Who is Hono Onosuke?

126
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Don't give me that ridiculous name.

127
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,260
Ryo, don't make me angry.

128
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,900
Don't get angry, Hono Onosuke.

129
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,540
What?

130
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,060
Do you think you can be human?

131
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,880
What's that?

132
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,940
I'll go patrol.

133
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,940
You guys are so obsessed with robots.

134
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,920
You have good memory.

135
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,540
There's nothing I can do about that.

136
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:05,780
Damn it.

137
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,680
They're so annoying.

138
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,640
They're just good people.

139
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,420
There are robots that bite people like you.

140
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,680
So they'll get more angry.

141
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,080
But...

142
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,100
Robots are better than humans.

143
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,120
The speed of calculation of equations and trigonometric numbers doesn't even match with humans.

144
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,440
Humans can't even stand on their feet!

145
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,280
I don't think it's useful for a police officer's job.

146
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,620
For example!

147
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,580
There are plenty of other great things!

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,640
Ah! I got it! Please calm down!

149
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,480
Ah, Chief! Good morning!

150
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,860
Good morning!

151
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,040
O-Good morning...

152
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,480
Oh?

153
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,720
What's wrong, Chief?

154
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,620
What about development 0055?

155
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,040
Huh?

156
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,660
The development 0055 is here!

157
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,600
Yeah! Doikari Honounosuke, you say?

158
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,800
Doikari Honounosuke?

159
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,400
Ryo-chan gave it a name.

160
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,220
He's on patrol with Dametaro-kun right now.

161
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,580
I see.

162
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,220
Chief, don't let that blood-thirsty robot get you.

163
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,500
Y-You did something back there again?

164
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,600
Huh? Back there again?

165
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,260
Anything else you did?

166
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
No, that's just...

167
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,520
You did it, huh?

168
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,280
Actually, before I came here, I came into the walls of the principal's office and...

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,460
You got a job without getting paid!

170
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,400
Y-You're right!

171
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,280
A robot officer must get paid for something!

172
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,020
Huh? You got a job without getting paid for something!

173
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,080
Give us a day off and a payday!

174
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,040
Let's make a human-like union!

175
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,220
That's so reckless!

176
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,040
There's no such thing as a good example.

177
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,220
Then at least make a unit of independent robots!

178
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,860
It's a robot escape room!

179
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,560
I'm sorry for being mocked by humans!

180
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,940
I understand your feelings, but you don't have any achievements.

181
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,000
Then I'll make an achievement.

182
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,640
At that time, it's a robot escape room!

183
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,840
A terrible robot officer has come!

184
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,200
Yes.

185
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,700
That's what happened.

186
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,420
I see.

187
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,740
A robot escape room is a ridiculous idea.

188
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,760
Yes. Kameyari Park Pre-Escape Room.

189
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,900
What? An incident?

190
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,360
Give me 500cc of bleach.

191
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,700
Yes.

192
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,380
So, if you make an achievement, you can make a robot escape room.

193
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,120
I see.

194
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,440
Then you're with us.

195
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,420
Yes.

196
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,440
Thank you for waiting.

197
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,460
Good.

198
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,720
It will be 65 yen.

199
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,820
What?

200
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,460
Yes.

201
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,500
As expected, the bleach is good!

202
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,700
It looks like an incident.

203
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,500
It's a chance to make an achievement!

204
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,640
Come with me!

205
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,340
It will be useless if you don't!

206
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:21,960
Yes...

207
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,980
Officer!

208
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,060
Quickly bring cars with him!

209
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,780
What an aggressive group!

210
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,120
We can't get close by this.

211
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,940
Captain, let's counterattack.

212
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,320
It's not good.

213
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,420
There's a gas factory.

214
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,280
Moreover, there are hostages in it.

215
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,500
I can't do anything about it.

216
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,840
Damn it.

217
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,480
This is the place.

218
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,420
Yes.

219
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Tamedaro, Hanohonosuke.

220
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,640
Leave this to us.

221
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,900
The enemy has a gun.

222
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
No matter how much you're shot with a gun, it's okay.

223
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,180
Because it's a robot.

224
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,720
Are you an idiot?

225
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,540
What do you mean by idiot?

226
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,540
Even if you're okay, what if your hostage is shot?

227
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,900
This blood vessel robot.

228
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,680
You said it again.

229
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,940
You can't make fun of a robot for human habits.

230
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,260
Please calm down, Hanohonosuke.

231
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,520
Senior, don't make me angry.

232
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,300
You bastard.

233
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,900
Don't come over here.

234
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,620
It's noisy.

235
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,640
Did the cash arrive?

236
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,280
What?

237
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,700
Stop.

238
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,180
What's wrong with the hostage?

239
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,300
It's hot.

240
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,640
That eye is serious.

241
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,640
Run away.

242
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,520
Idiot.

243
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,640
Don't go over there.

244
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,420
It's going to explode.

245
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,960
Mr. Hanohonosuke.

246
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,940
There's a pond on the left.

247
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,240
Please go over there.

248
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
Don't come over here.

249
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,760
Go over there.

250
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,460
Mr. Hanohonosuke.

251
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,420
Mr. Hanohonosuke.

252
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,220
Mr. Hanohonosuke.

253
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,520
You die, Sir.

254
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,160
I got it.

255
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,200
Thank you for a hard-fought job.

256
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,540
That's to get lucky.

257
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,700
This time,

258
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,980
Thanks to the robot police, we were able to solve the case.

259
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,160
So, I'll give you this award.

260
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,340
Thanks!

261
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,300
The symptoms are good, but you can build a robot station, right?

262
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,360
Well...

263
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,760
Are you breaking your promise?

264
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,060
Oh! It's burning again!

265
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,860
You can't make me angry, boss!

266
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:08,960
Boss!

267
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,540
I... I got it!

268
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,460
I'll make a robot station!

269
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,520
Yay!

270
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,500
I'll be a big star from now on!

271
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,720
What's going on, boss?

272
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,520
Why is the robot station right next to my house?

273
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,000
There was no other suitable location.

274
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,740
There's no other way.

275
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,100
I'll go to the office, so don't skip it.

276
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Damn it! It's not burning at all!

277
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,100
It's almost a centimeter away from the window.

278
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,260
Hey, Onosuke!

279
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,360
Yeah!

280
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,840
It's a great facility!

281
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,860
I'm not surprised!

282
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,500
Not for long, at any rate.

283
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,280
What's going on, Onosuke?

284
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,140
I finally got a job!

285
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,640
What?

286
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,220
I've finally got a job!

287
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,520
Ooh, I got a job!

288
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,960
You did?

289
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,280
Did they offer you something special?

290
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,130
No.

291
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,840
I was just sitting on my seat.

292
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,920
It's the second research lab!

293
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,840
What's wrong, Damedaro?

294
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,480
Huh? What's this?

295
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,920
Sorry, the fuel spilled and exploded.

296
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,160
This thing is the fuel?

297
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,540
Yes, it's the development 006.

298
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,800
To remove abandoned bicycles and illegal parking, we made a power robot.

299
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,340
I was expecting it, but it's this size after all.

300
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,040
Even so, it's huge. It's sticking out of my body.

301
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,100
Considering the strength and power, it's this size.

302
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,400
We're going to drive it ourselves from now on.

303
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,200
There's a driver's seat on the chest, so we can drive it together.

304
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,160
Sounds interesting. Let me drive it, too.

305
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,860
Sure.

306
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,940
Hey, stop!

307
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,060
Why are you coming?

308
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,060
Leave it to the police.

309
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,120
God, please turn the left steering wheel.

310
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,300
It will start moving.

311
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,300
This?

312
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,000
It's like a classic car.

313
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,580
Whoa! The ceiling is...

314
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,740
Wow! It's standing up!

315
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,180
It's easy to control.

316
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,220
Okay, let's go!

317
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,640
Whoa! It's a powerful movement!

318
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,460
What's it using for fuel?

319
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,720
Nitro.

320
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,920
Nitro?

321
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,820
Nitro is a little vibration that explodes.

322
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,400
Is that it?

323
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,220
Yeah.

324
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,120
Why would you use such a ugly thing?

325
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,240
Because it has the most power.

326
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,100
I'm not kidding. If the robot falls, it'll explode.

327
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,020
Shut up. You have to miss the control.

328
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,760
How can I guess your control?

329
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,000
What? The robot is better at controlling than humans.

330
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,440
You're good at this.

331
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,960
Hey, stop!

332
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,140
If you get burned, it'll explode!

333
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,980
Oh, I see.

334
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,580
I'll get off if I can get on such a dangerous thing.

335
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,480
What's wrong?

336
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,220
It won't open.

337
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,240
What?

338
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,400
God, where are you going?

339
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,300
That's the road!

340
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,140
You bastard. Are you making fun of me?

341
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,160
Hey, stop!

342
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,000
If you make a noise, it'll explode!

343
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,540
W-what are you doing, God?

344
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,040
My robot is going to explode!

345
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
How dare you!

346
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,080
I'm not doing anything!

347
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,440
Don't be stupid!

348
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,680
Don't come near me!

349
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,440
Hey, calm down!

350
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,640
Calm down!

351
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,860
The robot's exit is...

352
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,980
Hey, squid! It's on the road!

353
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,360
What?

354
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,620
I'm going to stop it!

355
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,720
You don't have to say anything!

356
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,860
Stop!

357
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,860
What are you doing? Stop it now!

358
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,340
I'm doing it too!

359
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,200
What's going on?

360
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,180
What's going on?

361
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,420
Is the robot moving on its own?

362
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,820
What?

363
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,960
Please give me a break.

364
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,360
Here, give me your license.

365
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,760
W-wait a minute!

366
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,040
That's...

367
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,200
W-what is that?

368
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,740
Hey, you! Stop!

369
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,280
Stop, you robot!

370
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,680
Stop!

371
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,480
I told you to stop!

372
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,180
Ryo Tsukan-kichi!

373
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,900
What are you doing, you bad guy?

374
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,240
You stupid! What are you doing?

375
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,020
Shut up! I was trying to stop it for the whole time!

376
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,820
You did it so well, Ryo Tsukan-kichi!

377
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,280
Reiko!

378
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,100
What's going on?

379
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,960
I don't know.

380
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,440
If I come back from the library, I'll be in trouble...

381
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,120
What could it be?

382
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,720
This is Tyrannosaurus.

383
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,300
It's the strongest dinosaur on Earth.

384
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,240
So it won't lose to anyone?

385
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,720
Of course!

386
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,060
Tyrannosaurus...

387
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,920
You're awake.

388
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:41,980
No! I can't control it!

389
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,060
I'll destroy it and stop it!

390
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,400
If you can, then do it already!

391
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,140
You were bragging that you're smarter than humans, you idiot!

392
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
What do you mean, idiot?

393
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:51,920
You idiot!

394
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,760
I'm not an idiot!

395
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,140
I'm a dinosaur!

396
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,420
It's burning!

397
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
It's a fire!

398
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,340
Help me!

399
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,220
What's up with this robot?

400
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:02,840
It's burning!

401
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,320
I'm saved!

402
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,220
You're lucky you got into the river.

403
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,320
What's wrong?

404
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,120
You look weird!

405
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,460
I see!

406
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,380
Calm down!

407
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,060
Be careful!

408
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,160
I want to deal with this robot asap!

409
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,120
Ah, did you see me?!

410
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,160
That's why humans are useless.

411
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,660
You're not to be blamed.

412
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,120
I'm sorry,

413
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,380
it's not good to be here with him.

414
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,700
What?

415
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,320
Senpai is?

416
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,840
He's abusing in the car, driving a massive robot!

417
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,280
Our car is damaged!

418
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,180
Ryo...

419
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,480
What about him?

420
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
Ohara-kun, what's going on?

421
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,580
I don't know.

422
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,160
Speaking of which, I heard that the president was very concerned about what happened last week.

423
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:03,860
What?

424
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,600
He said he would take revenge on you someday.

425
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,220
It's unforgivable to destroy the city with such a thing.

426
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,320
It's a big problem, president! A giant robot is coming towards us!

427
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:16,920
What?

428
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,180
What?

429
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,240
Oh, no!

430
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,860
We have to go to the Katsushika office!

431
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,120
What? That's not good! Stop it!

432
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,820
We can't do that! We've been struggling for a long time!

433
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,220
Reiko, turn left!

434
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:36,920
It's a big problem! A giant robot is coming towards us!

435
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,020
We have to stop it as soon as possible!

436
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,060
But when did Ryotsu get the robot?

437
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,540
Oh, right!

438
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,840
He's with the robot!

439
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,660
I heard that the robot officer was on board.

440
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,200
I see! He made the robot officer do it!

441
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,440
Ryotsu's evil spirit and the robot officer's intelligence came together and the devil's invention...

442
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,700
Now!

443
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,340
No matter what you do, stop it here!

444
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,680
It's no good!

445
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,540
That's terrible! The chain is also torn and we're stuck!

446
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,500
Damn it! There's no way to stop this!

447
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,440
SS Team, we've arrived at our position.

448
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,660
If the robot gets within 30 meters, we may attack.

449
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,780
Yes, sir!

450
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,880
We have no choice but to destroy the robot if we come this far.

451
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,820
If everything goes well, the damage will be minimal.

452
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,680
That can't be...

453
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,800
Ryotsu!

454
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,460
How's this?

455
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:42,900
How's that?

456
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,320
Alright, that's good!

457
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,000
The fuel is cut!

458
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,280
You just have to walk another 10 meters to stop.

459
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,760
Alright, well done!

460
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,440
Now Sho's saved!

461
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,320
Shoot if you're only 10 meters away!

462
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,580
Stop it!

463
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,340
No, Taro!

464
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,040
Nitro is being used in that robot's fuel!

465
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,260
What?!

466
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,200
Hey, don't hurry!

467
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,700
We're about to stop!

468
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,740
Nitro is inside the robot!

469
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,720
Stop it!

470
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,660
You idiot!

471
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,880
Showa Katsushika was fully recovered,

472
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,200
but miraculously, no one was injured.

473
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,840
Except for me.

474
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,120
Ryo, I'm sorry.

475
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,980
I didn't think the robot was broken.

476
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,460
I'm really sorry.

477
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,420
Seriously,

478
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,060
this is all because I was with the robot!

479
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,760
What?!

480
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,500
Who's the robot?!

481
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,020
Hurry up, Sho!

482
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,600
I'm sick of being a robot officer!

483
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:14,820
Saya True

484
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,140
"The season of the new year has come!"

485
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,760
"Occult no flesh, the old auditory're on the rise!"

486
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,060
"The season of the new year has come!"

487
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,720
"The season of the new year has come!"

488
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,020
"Name!

489
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,040
"Name! - Kyokushinamiji-ulus..."

490
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,580
"Name! - Kyokushinamiji-ulus..."

491
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,600
"Occult no flesh, the old auditory are on the rise!"

492
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,400
"Name! - Kyokushinamiji-ulus..."

493
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:31,640
"Name! - Kyokushinamiji-ulus..."

494
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,620
"Occult no flesh, the old auditory are on the rise!"

495
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,640
New Year!

496
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,860
Ah, summer has come again this year

497
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,280
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's here

498
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,740
Ah, summer has come again this year

499
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,940
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's here

500
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,840
Big, small waves, small waves, a little bit of a thing

501
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,800
A big, small butt, a little bit of a thing

502
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,860
A big, small butt, a little bit of a thing

503
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:07,420
Ah, the scent of the southern wind

504
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,100
Ah, the scent of the southern wind

505
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,800
Ah, the big, small waves, big, big, big, big, big, big

506
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,720
Next time, we will go on a trip to Kameari Park Exhibition.

507
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,700
The theme of this trip is Tokyo.

508
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,780
First, we will visit the traditional Tokyo,

509
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:38,700
go on a cruise,

510
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,200
and visit the best outlet in Japan.

511
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,500
For dinner, we will enjoy a buffet.

512
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,280
Next time, we will go on a trip to the underground city of Ryosan.

513
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,120
Thank you for watching.

514
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,820
To our town!

515
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Thank you!
