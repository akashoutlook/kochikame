1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,420
The

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,680
Time of the memory sketch

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,260
Please prepare paper and drawing tools

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,440
It's a problem

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,160
Please draw a picture of Ryo's name, Ryo Tsukankichi, without seeing anything

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,800
It seems that I always see it, but people's memories are uncertain

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,580
What kind of hairstyle and what kind of eyebrows did Ryo have?

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,220
Can you draw properly?

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,620
Are you ready?

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,120
Ready, start!

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,240
When you watch TV, please make your room bright and leave

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,040
Come to me, who has no money

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,900
I'm not, but I'm worried

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,200
Come to me, who has no money

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,680
I'm not, but I'm worried

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,940
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,040
It'll be fine in a while

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,880
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,880
I'm not working

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,500
Come to me, you who have no way!

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,560
I don't have it, but don't worry

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,000
Look! The red spider is burning

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,520
It will be somehow in the meantime

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,500
I know, I know, I know

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,760
If you understand, then quietly follow me!

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,620
Tsurupika Ryo

28
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:23,480
Tsurupika Ryo

29
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,160
It's fall already

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,220
On such a sunny day, patrolling outside is the best, isn't it, senpai?

31
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,640
Senpai!

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,540
Oh, if you look away a little, it's like this

33
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,360
I can't work on such a sunny day

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,400
On such a day, I can only take a nap

35
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,620
Sigh, why don't you understand?

36
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,820
My hormones are a wonderful reward

37
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,680
If I use a little bit, I will know its value

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,020
But, isn't it made for Queer Salesman?

39
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,300
That's...

40
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,560
What a phantom!

41
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,040
Very very massiveÂ», I've never seen it!

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,620
I've never been defeated!

43
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,940
I might lose my product to that!

44
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,780
No!

45
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,540
What should I do if the salesman doesn't trust my product?!

46
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,340
This is a match!

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,960
Will his arrogance win or will my deodorant win?

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,480
Let's see!

49
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,500
I did it! My deodorant won!

50
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,860
After all, my product is excellent!

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,660
He seems to be 5 times stronger than my arm.

52
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,760
I might lose my product.

53
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,860
No! My product is the best in the world!

54
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,540
I can't lose to that arrogant guy!

55
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,580
It's a match!

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,320
How about this?

57
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,100
I did it! I won twice!

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,000
This is...

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,700
I won't accept any deodorant!

60
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,940
I can feel the strong will of the world!

61
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,020
This is a strong enemy!

62
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
The biggest enemy for my deodorant is right in front of me!

63
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,700
No, I can't back out here!

64
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,200
If I don't win this match, my product won't be able to reach the top of the world!

65
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,580
How is it?

66
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,060
I'm going to make a fortune!

67
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,640
As expected, it seems that I can't reach the top of the world.

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
But I'm not done yet!

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,440
I did it! I won 10 times!

70
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,880
My product is a real victory!

71
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,240
After all, my deodorant is the best in the world!

72
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,640
But as expected, he was a tough opponent.

73
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,000
I used up a whole bottle.

74
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,960
...Huh?

75
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,660
Hm? I was so absorbed in this until now that I didn't notice it, but...

76
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,140
Could this person be a police officer?

77
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,340
Could it be that I did something ridiculous?

78
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,800
You don't have anything to write anymore, do you?

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,240
Is there anywhere else where you can draw?

80
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,340
Huh?

81
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,300
The one with the head is sleeping.

82
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,320
Isn't that Ryo-san?

83
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,240
No, Ryo-san isn't this slimy.

84
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,640
I feel like he's similar, but...

85
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,360
His head is a bit lonely, isn't it?

86
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,020
I'll draw his head.

87
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,440
How is it?

88
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,740
Nice. I'll draw his beard, too.

89
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,540
How is it?

90
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,540
It's interesting, but the beard...

91
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,520
This one's hair style suits you better.

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,120
How is it?

93
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,760
It's true!

94
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,040
It's a great beard.

95
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,160
It looks like a bear.

96
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,600
That's right.

97
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,000
Then, let's make him a bear.

98
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,920
It's a pain to paint everything.

99
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,380
Then, let's make him a panda.

100
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,440
That's cuter, isn't it?

101
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,760
Done!

102
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,200
It's not that cute.

103
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,240
Yeah. He looks like a man in a panda suit.

104
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,060
Ugh!

105
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,200
Ugh!

106
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,700
Ugh!

107
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,160
I slept well.

108
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,840
I feel like it was noisy around here.

109
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,480
I'll go home soon.

110
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,760
I feel like I can feel everyone's gaze.

111
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,240
I feel like I can feel everyone's gaze.

112
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,240
I'm in trouble!

113
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,280
What?

114
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,320
You're in trouble!

115
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,460
I'm in trouble!

116
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,220
You're in trouble!

117
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,840
Hey!

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,640
Hey! Stop!

119
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,440
Stop it!

120
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,900
Are you all right?

121
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,900
I'm fine.

122
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,700
Sorry, but who is it?

123
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,780
I'm asking you what caused the fight!

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,320
You?

125
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,460
You?

126
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,120
We didn't fight!

127
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,300
What did you say?

128
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:47,840
What?

129
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,340
Is it true?

130
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,640
It's true.

131
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,780
We were just having a little fun.

132
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,460
It's true, isn't it?

133
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,800
It's true!

134
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,700
Don't ever fight again!

135
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,620
Yes!

136
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,600
What's wrong with him?

137
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,240
I don't know.

138
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,360
But I feel like it would be a terrible thing if he opposed us.

139
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,740
I feel like it would be a terrible thing if he opposed us.

140
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,820
I feel like it would be a terrible thing if he opposed us.

141
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,780
I don't know if this will be good enough.

142
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:28,180
I don't know if this will be good enough.

143
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,700
I don't know if this will be good enough.

144
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,400
Yes, I do.

145
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
What are you doing?

146
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,300
What did you do to my child?!

147
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,560
You write in the cartoons about something.

148
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,240
Tell me.

149
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,800
What should I do?

150
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,940
It's autumn already.

151
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,480
It's a cool season.

152
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,680
It's good for a cool guy like Ryotsu.

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,200
And it's even more crowded than before.

154
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,260
Bro, it's been raining a lot lately.

155
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,240
I'll give you a ride on the G1 this time.

156
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,880
Don't be so rude.

157
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,820
What?

158
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,340
I'm sorry!

159
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,520
It's cool.

160
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,020
How was it, Headquarters Chief?

161
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,420
How's my Kazushika office?

162
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,140
The management is doing well.

163
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,840
As expected.

164
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,260
Thank you.

165
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,200
There's an exit over there.

166
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,700
Oh, I didn't want to show it.

167
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,100
Please stop the car.

168
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,080
Yes, sir.

169
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,100
Headquarters Chief, we're preparing for dinner at the library.

170
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,620
It'll be over soon.

171
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,140
I hope Ryotsu isn't here.

172
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,500
Is there anyone here?

173
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,500
I'm glad.

174
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,800
It looks like Ryotsu isn't here.

175
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,900
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

176
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,120
It's Ryotsu.

177
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,460
It looks like a toilet.

178
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,340
Oh, it's the Headquarters Chief.

179
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,440
Oh, it's the Headquarters Chief.

180
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,880
This is Headquarters Chief and Headquarters Chief.

181
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,340
Thank you for your work.

182
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,940
R-Ryotsu, huh?

183
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,800
Yes, I'm Kan Kichi Ryotsu,

184
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,840
the head of the Kazushikaku Kamenari Park Exit.

185
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,180
I-I wonder when you're always like that.

186
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,360
I'm always like that.

187
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,420
Of course.

188
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
The exit is the face of the police.

189
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
As long as I'm here,

190
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,460
10 million people are at ease, Headquarters Chief.

191
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,380
Oh, yeah.

192
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,940
Oh, I can't get over how excited Tonada is.

193
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,880
Oh, I can't get over how excited Tonada is.

194
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,380
I better get him here today.

195
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
I think that's better.

196
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:33,820
I think that's better.

197
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,660
Be careful!

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,360
I think Headquarters Chief was scared of my power.

199
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,660
I think Headquarters Chief was scared of my power.

200
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:45,760
I guess so.

201
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,460
I'm home!

202
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,500
I'm home!

203
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,260
Hey, you're late.

204
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,980
You're Senpai, right?

205
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,160
Who else but me?

206
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,540
You guys seem to have noticed.

207
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,580
How about it? My face is getting a little more powerful, right?

208
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,920
Yeah, yeah.

209
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,360
When a man is over thirty, he can't win with his face.

210
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,140
You can't do anything about it.

211
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,820
How about it? My face looks like Takakura Ken, right?

212
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,160
I-I guess so.

213
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,920
Hey, Ryo-chan, are you really doing that make-up?

214
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,400
I don't know.

215
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,220
Sometimes, Senpai comes up with something really bad.

216
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,080
That's right.

217
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,140
Then, to celebrate Ryo-chan's beauty, let's take a picture together.

218
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,800
Oh, sounds good.

219
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,320
Kei-chan, please.

220
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,240
Ah, okay.

221
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,940
Then, let's go.

222
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:47,980
Okay.

223
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,640
Look, it's coming out.

224
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,860
It's probably a little bit too much, isn't it?

225
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,180
Huh? Which one?

226
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,700
Hmm?

227
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,300
What's with this man with a funny face?

228
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,860
Huh?

229
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,920
Huh?

230
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,460
Is that me?

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,480
Yes.

232
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,360
Huh?

233
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,780
W-What is this?

234
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,100
I knew you wouldn't notice.

235
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,080
You're really acting weird.

236
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,680
Did you think I was?

237
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,580
Y-You don't look so super!

238
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,820
Logitech

239
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,380
Starcast

240
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,720
Click here for the full episode!

241
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,180
Did you notice how it started?

242
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,700
It's just a magic trick.

243
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,280
When did it become like this?

244
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,140
I don't know. I don't remember anything.

245
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,460
When I lost my makeup, I looked like an alien.

246
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,260
You don't have eyebrows, so it's unnatural.

247
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,360
I see.

248
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,720
Do you want me to draw your eyebrows with your eyebrows?

249
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,420
Do that. It's creepy if you keep it like this.

250
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,880
By the way, what kind of eyebrows did Ryo-chan have?

251
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,280
I don't know. I don't usually look at my own face.

252
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,040
Well, was it like this?

253
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,360
I think the atmosphere is a little different.

254
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,360
Please lend me that.

255
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,080
Yes.

256
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,300
I think it was a thicker eyebrow.

257
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,680
Like this.

258
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,920
It looks like a snowman's eyebrows.

259
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,760
It's kind of weird.

260
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,740
I see. It was connected.

261
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,240
That's right.

262
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,260
You can connect it and draw it.

263
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,260
How is it?

264
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,000
Like this.

265
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,080
It's too neat.

266
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,780
Then,

267
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,440
how about drawing a tulip here?

268
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,520
It looks good on you.

269
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,800
If you can do it, draw the sun on it.

270
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,560
Then I'll draw a cute house.

271
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,720
Then I'll add flowers around the house.

272
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,240
It's cute.

273
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,500
Don't play with people's foreheads.

274
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,120
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,600
I'll draw it myself.

276
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,840
I'm scared to get angry with that face.

277
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,860
I'm scared to get angry with that face.

278
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,860
Leave it to you guys.

279
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,980
Are you okay?

280
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,800
I've been dating for more than 30 years.

281
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,200
I can do it.

282
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,540
How about this?

283
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,580
It's a little different.

284
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,860
Then it's the hero of the hero manga.

285
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:22,960
I see.

286
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,620
Both eyebrows were connected.

287
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,400
Like this.

288
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,580
That's right.

289
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,120
Then draw an eyeliner.

290
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,220
Draw an eyeliner.

291
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,880
How is it?

292
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,080
I'm a Kabuki actor.

293
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm lonely, so I'll draw a flower.

294
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,520
I'll draw a flower garden here.

295
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,500
It's not an illustration board.

296
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,320
Don't draw it freely.

297
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,920
You drew it with a color pen.

298
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,420
It's not easy.

299
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,900
I'll draw a name on the back.

300
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,140
It's cute pink.

301
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,960
Then I have to write the address.

302
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,560
That's right.

303
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,920
It's Katsushika...

304
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,220
Don't be ridiculous.

305
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,380
Where is the guy who wrote the address and mission on the back?

306
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,600
I'm back from the library.

307
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,020
Hey, Goburo.

308
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,980
I'm not surprised by that.

309
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,280
I'm sorry, but I was really surprised.

310
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,020
Oh, are you going to put out the stove?

311
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,980
Yes, I'll get it out from Chief Ohara.

312
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,820
I was told to get it out from Chief Ohara.

313
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,180
But I'm weak.

314
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,660
That face won't work for me.

315
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,020
The police chief has a face picture on it, right?

316
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,440
Oh, I see.

317
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,320
I should have seen the police chief.

318
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,060
Ryo, where is the police chief?

319
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,780
I think I left it in my pocket.

320
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,200
You don't have it?

321
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,280
I don't remember putting it out, so it should be in somewhere.

322
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

323
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,280
Oh, I'm sorry.

324
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

325
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:58,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

326
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,740
Watch out!

327
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,540
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

328
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,860
Okay, I think it's all right now.

329
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,980
Dang it!

330
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,540
Hey, why is it only here?

331
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,780
Jealousy!

332
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,820
It's not my fault!

333
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,780
You left the stove here.

334
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,860
Put it there!

335
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,700
Okay.

336
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,940
Isn't that a little strange?

337
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,480
If you think about it, if it's a photo, it doesn't have to be a police photo, right?

338
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,100
Oh, I see.

339
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,140
There should be a photo that everyone took in the summer somewhere.

340
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,180
Where?

341
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,820
It's on the locker.

342
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,840
What?

343
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,500
That one!

344
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,640
Okay.

345
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,560
No way!

346
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:01,760
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

347
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,500
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

348
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,620
The places where Senpai is reflected are all burned cleanly.

349
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,300
This one, too.

350
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,140
This one, too.

351
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,940
This one, too.

352
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,700
Gourmet!

353
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,200
Ryo-san is the one who told me to move the stove.

354
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,520
It's not a big deal.

355
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,160
It's not cold, so don't even think about putting the stove out.

356
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,020
Just put it outside.

357
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,020
I understand.

358
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,360
It's meaningless to put it in such a place.

359
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,860
Did you say something?

360
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,780
It's nothing!

361
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,660
But he's weak.

362
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,620
The only person who seems to have Senpai's photo is...

363
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,160
Maria-san!

364
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,140
Ryo-sama!

365
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,500
Poor Ryo-sama.

366
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,920
She's become like this.

367
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,180
Really?

368
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,480
If you're going to ask for help, do something.

369
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,840
Maria-chan, I asked you over the phone.

370
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,480
Here.

371
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,040
If it's Ryo-sama's photo, I'll have it with all my heart.

372
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,120
Huh?

373
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,860
Endori?

374
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,120
What's this?

375
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,120
Isn't this the photo from the virtual competition?

376
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,660
You can't tell if it's her face or not, right?

377
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,320
It's very cute.

378
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,040
Is there any other photo?

379
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,340
I can tell your face.

380
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,300
Don't worry.

381
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,720
Ryo-sama's photo is organized properly.

382
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,840
And it's in one album.

383
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,680
It's called "Ryo-sama, Maria, Love Album".

384
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,240
I don't care about the name.

385
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,300
Where is that album?

386
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,380
I brought it properly.

387
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
On this desk.

388
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,500
Ryo-sama and my love album...

389
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,400
It's full of heat.

390
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,380
Maria-chan, poor you.

391
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,620
Why are you putting the stove in such a place?

392
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:48,700
What's wrong?

393
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,400
Ryo-san left it outside.

394
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,580
Shut up!

395
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,520
When it comes to this, I can't remember people's faces.

396
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,840
You should be watching it almost every day.

397
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,860
I feel that Ryo-sama's eyebrows are very characteristic.

398
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,520
I think they are thick and connected.

399
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,180
I feel like I want flowers around here.

400
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
And I drew a house here.

401
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,200
Stop it!

402
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,560
I'm sorry, Ryo-sama.

403
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,320
Ryo-san's head looks like he wants to draw a house.

404
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,540
Anyway, this won't work.

405
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,480
Let's prepare a wig and a fake eyebrow.

406
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,360
Something is not right.

407
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,940
It doesn't look like Ryo-sama.

408
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,180
It looks like Mr. Honda.

409
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,040
Then, let's make it like Mr. Terai.

410
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,320
This is strange.

411
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,880
I feel like I'm a small citizen.

412
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,640
I made it like Mr. Sakonji.

413
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,860
No, it's not.

414
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,040
Make it like Mr. Reiko.

415
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,200
Stop it!

416
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,520
Make it like Komachi.

417
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,080
Make it like Nakagawa.

418
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,200
All of them are not good.

419
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,820
How about this?

420
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,520
It looks like Mr. Ohara.

421
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,640
It's the best I've ever seen.

422
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,740
That's right.

423
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,120
I don't like it.

424
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,300
I guess he's not here anymore.

425
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,840
What have I done?

426
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,900
I'm in a bad mood.

427
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,560
I should tell the police.

428
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,040
Excuse me.

429
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,800
Yes, what is it?

430
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,180
I think I've met you somewhere.

431
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,080
Me?

432
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:29,820
Yes.

433
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,440
I don't remember you.

434
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,720
No, I've seen you somewhere recently.

435
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,040
What?

436
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,740
I wonder if your hairstyle is different.

437
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,840
What are you doing?

438
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,760
I'm sorry.

439
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,020
I'm sorry.

440
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,480
I knew it.

441
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,180
I'm sorry.

442
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,540
Yes, goodbye.

443
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,220
Hey, wait.

444
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,100
Wait.

445
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,220
Wait.

446
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,400
Wait.

447
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,140
I'm sorry.

448
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,080
What do you mean?

449
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,920
I wanted to apologize.

450
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,280
Really.

451
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,420
What are you talking about?

452
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,340
I'll apologize honestly.

453
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,620
Please forgive me.

454
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,100
I don't mean to.

455
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,340
I'm sorry.

456
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,840
Really.

457
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,140
What do you mean?

458
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,320
I'm sorry.

459
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,300
You don't have to say it.

460
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,740
I'm sorry.

461
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,240
I'm sorry.

462
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,660
I'm sorry.

463
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,920
I'm sorry.

465
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,860
You don't have to say it.

466
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,020
I'm sorry.

467
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,760
I don't want to apologize to you.

468
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,140
We also sell strong medicine for your health.

469
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,600
I see.

470
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,200
If you apply this medicine to the original shape, it will become the original shape.

471
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,820
Original shape?

472
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,500
But you don't know the original shape and you are struggling.

473
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,700
Is that so?

474
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,320
Hey! What are you doing, Ryo-tsu?

475
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,260
Chief!

476
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,620
Chief!

477
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,400
Chief, do you know my face?

478
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Of course! How many years have you been dating me?

479
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
Well, well...

480
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,420
Rather than that, you have to do something about your face.

481
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,280
I want to do something about it, but I can't remember the original face.

482
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,340
What?

483
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,860
I accidentally got rid of my hair with hair loss.

484
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,400
So you're trying to do as you normally do, but you don't know the original face.

485
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,160
What? Is that so?

486
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,360
If it's Ryo-tsu's face...

487
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:32,920
Hmm...

488
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,560
Hmm...

489
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:35,620
Hmm...

490
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,200
The eyebrows are like this.

491
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,060
See?

492
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,340
The hair is like this.

493
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,600
And...

494
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,680
Oh, it's a head.

495
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,440
How is it?

496
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,840
Wow!

497
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:48,540
Wow!

498
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,660
It's Ryo-sama!

499
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,740
Yes, yes, it's this face.

500
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,940
I feel relieved.

501
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,040
Yes.

502
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,020
It's my face.

503
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,520
Geez, what are you doing with this?

504
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,320
Then, just like this...

505
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,660
It's your head.

506
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,720
This is the head.

507
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,140
And you chose Ryo's hair.

508
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,420
I know!

509
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,300
She said it's my head.

510
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,100
Your head shape looks great, though.

511
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,440
Oh, really?

512
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,340
After all, I'm a man like Ryo.

513
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,980
Sakuya's reputational girl.

514
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,740
Yeah!

515
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,460
So, by the way, your hair is growing fast!

516
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:24,920
Isn't it too fast?

517
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,200
Yeah, it's too fast.

518
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,720
What are you talking about? You should go back to normal.

519
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,940
What, what, what, what?

520
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,380
It's too strong!

521
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,560
I'm sorry!

522
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,920
After all, our product is...

523
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,560
the best in the world!

524
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,700
Hey, Ryouta!

525
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,500
It's not my fault!

526
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,000
My eyebrows are gone!

527
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,180
Like someone calling me

528
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,680
After the rain

529
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,960
I look back and walk

530
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,380
I'm holding my mom's hand

531
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,280
I felt

532
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,380
a strange feeling

533
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,620
So

534
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,240
I tried walking

535
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,760
with the dial

536
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,140
Everyone was a child once

537
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,140
But everyone has forgotten

538
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,180
The politics that looked so great

539
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,040
The blue-faced aunt

540
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,760
in front of me

541
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,320
Turn around and look

542
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,940
That corner

543
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,440
Everyone, everyone

544
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,520
I can see you

545
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,400
There's a turtle over there

546
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,220
Oh, there's definitely a turtle

547
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,820
Everyone, come here

548
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,700
To our town!

549
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,480
Thank you!

550
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,260
Hey, hey, Itaike!

551
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,460
Why are there so many things in your room?

552
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,780
Eh?

553
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,500
You're going to buy it without refusing sales?

554
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,100
Are you stupid?

555
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,600
