Translated by Shion

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,660
I watch the rising sun in the middle of the river

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:24,560
When I kick the stone, it flies to my shoes

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,540
I wonder if I'm going to the gym that I used to go to

5
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,880
I was laughed at for being a naughty boy

6
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:46,000
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, it's a pity that I can't

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,740
The cityscape that doesn't change a single yawn is strangely kind

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,380
From the stream of the Tungari Boshi

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:06,940
To the Kaishaku Tengen, the sun sets

10
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,500
Tomorrow will end like this

11
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
I lost my happiness because of the Katsushika Shiba

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,120
I realized that I was a fool

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,900
Because I was a fool

14
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,700
Ryouzu Kankichi

15
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:50,340
You bastard!

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,200
I'm sorry

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,240
Ryou

18
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,080
Maria! Catch him!

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,820
How dare you!

20
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,360
Forgive me!

21
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,320
Yes, Mr. Ryou!

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,480
Get away, you bastard!

23
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,780
You're tough, Maria!

24
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,140
It's a pleasure to help you

25
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,820
Ryou, who is this?

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,920
He is a wedding thief

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,600
I was at the Asakusa's childhood friend's wedding, and I was caught.

28
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,780
So you're wearing a wedding dress, too?

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,920
It's wonderful!

30
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,460
Yeah, it's hard to go.

31
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,240
What are you doing with a Japanese dress?

32
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,480
I'm going home to the tea party.

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,720
You look good in it.

34
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,980
I'm happy, Ryo-sama!

35
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,120
Stop it in front of me!

36
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,920
I'm embarrassed to go home with this kimono.

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,160
I'm embarrassed to go home with this kimono.

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,360
You can't wear it?

39
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,420
Yes.

40
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
What should I do?

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,340
My parents live nearby.

42
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,660
I'll ask my mother to fix it.

43
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,580
You can meet your mother?

44
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,500
That's great!

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,220
I'm not going to.

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,040
Let me say hello to your parents.

47
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,500
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,620
I'm just going to fix my dress.

49
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,160
You're going to?

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,560
No.

51
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,580
I'm not going.

52
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,660
You're not going?

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,020
No!

54
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,340
Don't say that!

55
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,960
My parents live in Tsukudaniya.

56
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,600
Hey, it's me!

57
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,820
Are you there?

58
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,920
I can't believe you're opening a shop.

59
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,120
Do you have money here?

60
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
You forgot to pay the deposit.

61
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,960
What are you thinking?

62
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,300
It's a troublesome place, so get out of here.

63
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,900
I see.

64
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,540
Hey, father!

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,600
And mother!

66
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,340
You left the pot on the stove.

67
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,160
Ryo?

68
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,140
Yes?

69
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,100
The customer...

70
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,560
Oh, it's you, Kan-chan.

71
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,120
Hey, aunt.

72
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,200
Long time no see.

73
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,720
Oh, no.

74
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,140
Leave it to me.

75
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,860
Okay.

76
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,700
You quit your job and came back to the shop?

77
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,740
Yeah.

78
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,480
Just today.

79
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,060
200g is this much?

80
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,580
It's a little extra.

81
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,660
Nice service.

82
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,360
How much?

83
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,720
What?

84
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,940
It's not written anywhere.

85
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,700
I'm in trouble.

86
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,380
100 yen is fine.

87
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,140
Really?

88
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,160
Yeah.

89
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,320
It's a service today.

90
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,980
It's a shop that I'm doing as a hobby.

91
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,320
Even if it's broken, it doesn't matter.

92
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,920
Then 100 yen.

93
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,480
Thanks.

94
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,180
Kan-chan, the person in the dress earlier,

95
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,160
is she your wife?

96
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,180
No, no.

97
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,940
You're a fool again.

98
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:37,980
Hello.

99
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,560
Long time no see.

100
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,560
You look like a silverfish.

101
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,240
You're still alive.

102
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,420
Are you still alive?

103
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,780
You're still talking about yourself.

104
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,340
Did you become a cartwheel and go back to the store?

105
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,020
No, today...

106
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,420
Kan-chan is getting married.

107
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:52,900
Really?

108
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
No, no.

109
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,020
It's a coincidence.

110
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,520
Good.

111
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,540
I thought I wouldn't be able to marry for the rest of my life.

112
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,000
So I'm not.

113
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,260
I'm done here.

114
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,580
I'll take care of you.

115
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,700
You're a little over the top.

116
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,860
How did you deceive me?

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,420
That's mean.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,320
I mean...

119
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,220
It's so hot!

120
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,860
Really, really hot!

121
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,560
What would you like?

122
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,820
300g of clams.

123
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,840
Yes.

124
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,720
Thank you for waiting.

125
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,360
Ryo-sama, how much is this?

126
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
It's 100 yen for today.

127
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,220
Okay, 100 yen.

128
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,080
That's a good service.

129
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,400
It's different from Gin-san.

130
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,160
Really, really!

131
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,120
If it's so cheap, I'll take this and this.

132
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,500
Oh, right.

133
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,280
Kan-chan, when Gin-san returns,

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,940
tell him that the next trip to the Kero-kai

135
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,780
is decided on June 29th.

136
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,300
June 29th, okay.

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, good luck.

138
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,300
I'm so happy that I didn't have to go to the first class.

139
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,320
Gin-san, Gin-san!

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,240
Huh?

141
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm glad Segare-san found a good wife.

142
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,440
What is that old woman saying?

143
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,080
What is it?

144
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,480
What is it?

145
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:14,980
Huh?

146
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,240
Welcome.

147
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,220
What would you like?

148
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,700
I'd like a pot of inago-tsukuda.

149
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,320
Okay.

150
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,820
Are you free tonight?

151
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,880
If you're free,

152
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,480
why don't you and I go to the Kawasaki Kepa-jo night race?

153
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,260
Oh, Dad!

154
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:39,700
Huh?

155
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,380
Kankichi!

156
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,460
Why are you shopping at your own shop?

157
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,600
Geez!

158
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,760
You met him for the first time, didn't you?

159
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,400
Everyone in my office calls you Maria.

160
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,060
Dad, nice to meet you.

161
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, me too.

162
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,960
By the way, Kankichi,

163
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,620
what's wrong with Mom?

164
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,780
Listen to me.

165
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,400
The shop was empty.

166
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,380
Oh, you're late.

167
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,740
Oh!

168
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, I'm home.

169
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,200
Kankichi!

170
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,100
Kankichi!

171
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,240
Kankichi!

172
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,620
Come back home!

173
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,080
Mom!

174
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:14,840
Mom!

175
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,620
I'm so happy!

176
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,320
Stop it.

177
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,100
Where have you been?

178
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,880
I was shopping.

179
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,260
If you get to the shop,

180
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,320
I'll ask you to help me get my kimono.

181
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,160
I know.

182
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,380
Hey, Maido!

183
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,640
Dad, Dad!

184
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,020
Who's that cute girl?

185
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,260
She's Shono's colleague.

186
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,540
Rumor has it that she's Kankichi's...

187
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,180
Oh, I see.

188
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,200
I knew it!

189
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,880
She's so cute that I can't help but ask her.

190
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,760
I'm sure she's cute.

191
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,380
Mom, are you done?

192
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,120
I'm almost done.

193
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,380
All right.

194
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,140
This is enough.

195
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,340
Thank you.

196
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,980
By the way,

197
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,340
do you like Kankichi?

198
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,180
Yes, of course.

199
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,680
It's not a dream.

200
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,460
Hey, Dad!

201
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,500
Come here!

202
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:10,980
Why?

203
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,920
Dad, you know...

204
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,380
What?

205
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,120
Mom, I'm serious.

206
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,300
Yes, yes, yes.

207
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,760
If you like him,

208
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,300
it's 100% sure.

209
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,220
I'm sure he's determined to take over this shop.

210
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,680
As expected of the eldest son.

211
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,600
He's thinking about what's ahead.

212
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,040
Ms. Maria,

213
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,980
I'm counting on you to take care of Kankichi.

214
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,660
Please.

215
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,680
I'm counting on you.

216
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,340
I'm counting on you.

217
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,520
I'm counting on you.

218
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Please, take care of him.

219
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,920
Why are you saying that?

220
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,480
Maria,

221
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,700
if you're done, let's go.

222
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,620
We're going to send you to Sensoji.

223
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,540
That's right.

224
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,660
Come on.

225
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,460
Yes.

226
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,620
See you.

227
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,340
Thank you.

228
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll be back.

229
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:55,860
Yes.

230
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,420
Oh, I forgot.

231
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,220
Kankichi,

232
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,440
did you decide on the date?

233
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,220
What?

234
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,360
I decided on June 29th.

235
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,880
Oh, June 29th.

236
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,540
Is that so?

237
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,540
You're a big guy.

238
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,480
Is that so?

239
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,580
I always decide when I have to.

240
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,360
Mom,

241
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
let's say goodbye with "Banzai."

242
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,280
Yes.

243
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,200
"Banzai!"

244
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,360
"Banzai!"

245
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,260
"Banzai!"

246
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,080
Stop it.

247
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,660
It's disgusting.

248
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,600
Maria, let's go.

249
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,160
Yes.

250
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,400
"Banzai!"

251
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,120
"Banzai!"

252
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,020
"Banzai!"

253
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,980
"Banzai!"

254
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,380
You're so lucky.

255
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,920
Yes.

256
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,920
You're so happy that you've decided to go on a trip alone.

257
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,820
That idiot.

258
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,320
What's her name?

259
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,560
Maria.

260
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:41,940
Maria.

261
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,060
Maria.

262
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,080
Maria.

263
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,640
"Maria"

264
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,720
"Maria".

265
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,100
"Maria".

266
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,700
Maria.

267
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,200
Maria.

268
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,480
Maria.

269
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,380
Maria.

270
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:48,800
Maria.

271
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,500
Maria.

272
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:49,580
Maria.

273
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,280
Maria.

274
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:50,880
Maria.

275
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,620
Maria.

276
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,440
Maria.

277
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,120
Maria.

278
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,760
Maria.

279
00:09:59,760 --> 00:09:59,960
How about this?

280
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,220
Here you go, father.

281
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,140
How does it taste, father?

282
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,980
It's delicious.

283
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,620
How about this?

284
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,440
How does it taste, father?

285
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,300
It's very nice.

286
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
I'll have some more.

287
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,640
And I started to help Tsukuda.

288
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
And I started to help Tsukuda.

289
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,540
Father, can I have a taste?

290
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,660
Stop!

291
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,640
It's not as good as the 300 years of Ryotsuke.

292
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,880
It's still too sweet.

293
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,480
I'm sorry, father.

294
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,220
Don't cry, Maria.

295
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,500
The road to Tsukudani is long and steep.

296
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,060
Let's go step by step.

297
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,800
Father!

298
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,260
All right.

299
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,020
I'm done!

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,260
Life changes when a girl is born.

301
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,220
I'm done!

302
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,820
I don't like it when you smile alone.

303
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,880
I don't like it when you smile alone.

304
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,620
I don't like it when you smile alone.

305
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,920
If only she was a good mother and daughter.

306
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,100
Sure you do.

307
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,800
This means to us that the number of customers increases.

308
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,460
Good morning!

309
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,580
The wedding of Segare Muray Messi has been decided.

310
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,160
Let's celebrate from the inside out.

311
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,480
I'm sorry to hear that.

312
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,820
Gin finally feel better, doesn't it?

313
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,280
My mother finally escaped.

314
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
You, father.

315
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,640
Mr. Segare finally decided to work hard.

316
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,900
Mr. Segare finally decided to work hard.

317
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,340
I've been looking forward to it since yesterday.

318
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,940
I know, Yoni.

319
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,760
Mother!

320
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,220
Mother!

321
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,060
That Kan-kichi is finally getting married?

322
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,440
Well, if you think about it, he's only five years old.

323
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,040
He's been a destroyer for decades.

324
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,080
He's finally getting married to that evil woman.

325
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,480
If you're ready, please make sure to cry.

326
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,420
All right, I'll make sure to make that day come true.

327
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,080
Thank you very much!

328
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,800
The garden will be given to that phoenix.

329
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,420
What?

330
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:18,500
What?

331
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,220
Wow!

332
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,720
Gin! Gin!

333
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,760
What's wrong?

334
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,620
It's a big deal.

335
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,860
They're going to hold a wedding parade at the store.

336
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,960
This is going to be a blast!

337
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,440
All right, I'll do it!

338
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,140
That's great!

339
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,380
Thank you!

340
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,300
Well, that's about it for today.

341
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,260
I hope you enjoyed it.

342
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,960
See you next time.

343
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,760
Bye-bye.

346
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,720
Huh?

347
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,840
What happened?

348
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,400
Hey, Ryosu!

349
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,820
Why were you hiding from me about your wedding?

350
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,400
Huh?

351
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,560
What?

352
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,180
Your senior is getting married?

353
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,380
No way...

354
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,280
You're kidding, right?

355
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,700
Your father called me yesterday since the wedding day!

356
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,000
W-Wait a minute!

357
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,160
Who are you marrying?

358
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,340
I didn't ask him in detail, but the beautiful woman in Japanese clothes came to say hello to you last week!

359
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm not going with the beautiful woman!

360
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,160
Huh?

361
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,660
Maybe...

362
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,100
Maybe what?

363
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
No, I went to my parents' house with Maria the other day.

364
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:41,820
What?

365
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,400
Haha, that's right!

366
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,560
After I introduced Maria, I was very rude!

367
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,540
What did you say?

368
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,900
It's hard, manager!

369
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,600
Didn't you say you were a man?

370
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,040
Come to think of it, I forgot to say that...

371
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,860
He must have been mistaken for a fiancee.

372
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,260
Then are we getting married?

373
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,020
Oh, I'm so happy!

374
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,300
Hey, wait!

375
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,760
That's not the way to do it!

376
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,860
We're both men!

377
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,820
That's right.

378
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,100
If you miss this day, you can't get married for the rest of your life.

379
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,780
Leave me alone!

380
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,240
But I'm in trouble because I'm in contact with the manager!

381
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,120
Maria, come with me for a while!

382
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,440
Okay!

383
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,020
Manager, I'll take the bus!

384
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,180
Oh, really?

385
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,660
Oh, yeah.

386
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,260
Asakusa! Asakusa, go!

387
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,040
Uh, this isn't a taxi, but...

388
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,140
If you say go, I'll go!

389
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,500
Ah, yeah!

390
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,140
Oh, come on, deal with it!

391
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,340
I got it.

392
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,180
Come on, deal with it!

393
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,820
I'll go now.

394
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,380
I'll go now!

395
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,040
I'll go!

396
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,740
Um, I was just speaking with your friend!

397
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:02,860
A friend?

398
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,360
My friend?

399
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,420
I didn't know there was such a thing as a friend.

400
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,500
This place is...

401
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,320
This place is my childhood friend.

402
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,060
Yes, Kankichi is the eldest son.

403
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,360
It's not a big deal.

404
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,440
But 5 hours is a bit...

405
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
Why don't you take a break for 10 minutes?

406
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,140
Like a big movie.

407
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,100
That's a good idea.

408
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,420
The budget will be quite expensive, but...

409
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,340
How much is it all?

410
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,600
It's already over 10 million yen.

411
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,760
What?

412
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,660
Do we have so much savings?

413
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,860
There's no way.

414
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,200
I know.

415
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,040
We didn't even think about marriage.

416
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,660
We didn't think about marriage.

417
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,700
Don't worry.

418
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,400
We can get 1000 people to join the wedding.

419
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,400
Yeah.

420
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,480
It's 30,000 yen per person, right?

421
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,660
It's 30 million yen per 1000 people.

422
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,700
If we raise the budget, we'll make 20 million yen.

423
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,960
I see.

424
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,320
As expected of you, old man.

425
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,400
The more you call, the more budget you have.

426
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,620
Hahaha.

427
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,420
We have a budget, so let's make the budget more flashy.

428
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,320
How about a parade in Asakusa in 5 minutes?

429
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,680
That's a good idea.

430
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,580
We can do a three-way carnival.

431
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,020
We can do a three-way carnival.

432
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,540
We can do a three-way carnival.

433
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,720
It'll be so much fun!

434
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,320
How about a parade on the Sumida River?

435
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,600
Yeah, that's a good idea.

436
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,400
Let's call 500 people and have a party!

437
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,260
The ceremony will be held at midnight.

438
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,920
It's a 24-hour wedding.

439
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,220
That's a good idea.

440
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,160
That's a good idea.

441
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,280
That's a good idea.

442
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:23,760
That's a good idea.

443
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,680
That's a good idea.

444
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,800
What's this?

445
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,500
What's this?

446
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:27,760
Oh, shit.

447
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,800
You're already doing business, aren't you?

448
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,160
You're making a festival.

449
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,720
You even made a signboard.

450
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,760
You're so good at the wedding.

451
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,600
You don't even know how to put it on the signboard.

452
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:38,820
You do it everywhere.

453
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,080
Whenever you see a signboard, you like to call it Mr. Ryo.

454
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,740
That's the lady who got a bardziej?

455
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,800
The

456
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,380
You..

457
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,600
You're funny, isn't it?

458
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,440
Shut up!

459
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,080
You're funny, isn't it?

460
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,540
What's wrong with you?

461
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,640
Do you know where our parents are?

462
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,800
I guess it's the Gachon Museum in the Gachon Temple.

463
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,500
You're not the only one who has a rang-up.

464
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:58,800
Not even Mr. Ryo has one?

465
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,080
Not even Mr. Mr. Ryo has one?

466
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,020
What?

467
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,560
What?

468
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:04,700
Not even Mr. Ryo has one?

469
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,360
Coven went out.

470
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,220
Good!

471
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,080
It's the appearance of the man you want to know!

472
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,780
Uh.

473
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,120
That's right!

474
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,060
Put this on!

475
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,540
With that in mind.

476
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,600
The size is just right.

477
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,780
The new work come to the school is okay.

478
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,400
At least it's a five-hour wedding.

479
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,520
It's boring to have so many changes.

480
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,940
My father has to talk to you.

481
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,640
Yeah.

482
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,120
What is it?

483
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,240
Maria is here too?

484
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,660
I have to introduce you to everyone.

485
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,120
Dad, when will I get married?

486
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,600
Don't be stupid.

487
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,580
What are you talking about?

488
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,000
I told you that the date was decided on June 29th.

489
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,780
June 29th?

490
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,120
That's the date of the trip to Keirokai.

491
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,000
What?

492
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,680
You misunderstood me.

493
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,420
But I'm going to marry her.

494
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,260
You can't do that.

495
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,260
Maria is a man.

496
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,480
You're kidding me.

497
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,980
That's ridiculous.

498
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,620
Then check it out yourself.

499
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,720
No.

500
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,400
This is...

501
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,520
It's a lie.

502
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,460
It's not true.

503
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,920
You still don't get it?

504
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,620
What is this?

505
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,100
It's the same thing as your father.

506
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,640
You see, the person you love is not in love with him.

507
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,640
This is more like it.

508
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,220
Maybe...

509
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,480
You have to stop it.

510
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,800
He's in love with you.

511
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,400
I'm not.

512
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,580
Get out of my way.

513
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,900
Don't worry about that.

514
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,420
Don't say that.

515
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,180
You'll get married soon enough.

516
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,660
So...

517
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,580
Get away.

518
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,920
I know you're crying.

519
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,680
The wedding is already decided.

520
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,740
You're the one who decided it.

521
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,400
I didn't say it was wrong.

522
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
What are you going to do?

523
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,820
I don't know that.

524
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,380
I don't care if you're a man or not.

525
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,280
Get married.

526
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,080
Don't be ridiculous.

527
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,220
You're giving up on the 30 million yen of the wedding?

528
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,140
What?

529
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:16,980
Oh, shit.

530
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,160
You're trying to make money at my wedding.

531
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,340
Let me go.

532
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,600
What are you doing?

533
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,600
It's still in the middle of the meeting.

534
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,200
It's nothing.

535
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,320
I'll be there soon.

536
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,060
I see.

537
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,380
I see.

538
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,540
So how much will you make with the expenses?

539
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,240
You don't say.

540
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,300
Yeah.

541
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,540
We can't quit either way.

542
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,400
It's been so exciting.

543
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,320
I can't help it.

544
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,440
Let's get it done at this point and get the ceremony.

545
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,580
We can make a lot of money.

546
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,240
But if we get caught, it'll be a big deal.

547
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,040
Don't worry.

548
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:56,580
I'll get it done.

549
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,440
I'm always ready to help you.

550
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,960
Absolutely.

551
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,380
Thanks.

552
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,620
See you later.

553
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,180
You're so sweet.

554
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,180
You almost did.

555
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,140
See you.

556
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,240
See you.

557
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,400
See you.

558
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,460
Bye.

559
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:19,480
Bye.

560
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,400
Bye.

561
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,440
Wait.

562
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,900
I've got something to tell.

563
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,100
I've got something to tell.

564
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,500
What?

565
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,480
We will now head to the venue.

566
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,320
It's all thanks to all of you that we got married like this.

567
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,900
I wonder if it's really okay.

568
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,100
Don't worry, we've got our hands on it.

569
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,440
Everyone in Gocho,

570
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,660
I'm Ryosu Gan-nichi, the one who makes noise every time.

571
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,220
As expected of Kan-chan!

572
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,180
Sanja Festival, Sanba Carnival, and the fireworks festival.

573
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,380
It's going to be a big event.

574
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,980
Look, they're even broadcasting it on TV.

575
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,800
That's right! They're going to keep on moving!

576
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,440
They're going to take the house!

577
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,660
The cars will go to the shopping street and enter the Gachon Temple.

578
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,700
Here, the Gachon Temple is a place where thousands of people can be gathered.

579
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,540
It's faster than the time of the year.

580
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,380
Let's start with the banquet.

581
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,580
In reaching the Gachon Temple, the

582
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:53,880
івa-ko many of us got together.

583
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,160
They're getting excited!

584
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,040
- Awww!

585
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,700
- Awww!

586
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,120
Ahhh, I'm so happy!

587
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,040
So, Kan Zoom, can't be here any more?

588
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,100
Aㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏ

589
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,460
Excuse me, everyone!

590
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,620
This was all a surprise!

591
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,800
Surprise?

592
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,260
Oh, indeed, I got a little tricked!

593
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,000
You guys are good at fooling me.

594
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,080
I can't marry you.

595
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,960
You guys fooled me.

596
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,300
I was surprised.

597
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,140
You are all lying.

598
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,000
What are you thinking?

599
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,880
I'm not going to lose.

600
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,580
I'm not going to lose.

601
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm not going to lose.

602
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,280
It was a good chance for us to meet.

603
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,140
Don't fool me.

604
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,140
Don't fool me.

605
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,560
You guys are good at fooling me.

606
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,020
You guys are good at fooling me.

607
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,680
You guys are good at fooling me.

608
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:15,860
You guys are all lying.

609
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,820
I'm sorry.

610
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,540
Did you fool me?

611
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,340
I'm sorry.

612
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,900
Mr. Ju.

613
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,940
He's unconscious.

614
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,320
Mr. Ju.

615
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:38,480
I'll pay you back.

616
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,060
No. I won't pay you back.

617
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,240
I caught a thief the other day.

618
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,320
I failed to leave it to him.

619
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,740
I don't know.

620
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,140
Mom, let's go home.

621
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,340
I can't believe he's a snob.

622
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,040
Dad, let's go home.

623
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,400
Let's go home.

624
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,040
I can't.

625
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,700
I won't pay you back.

626
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,660
I can't pay you back.

627
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,120
I won't.

628
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,720
A ten-year-old policeman from the police station will come to the police station?

629
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,260
A ten-year-old policeman from the police station will come to the police station?

630
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,600
Leave it to me.

631
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,740
I take care of you.

632
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,840
You won't be embarrassed.

633
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,500
I'll teach you to be a policeman.

634
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,600
I'll teach you to be a policeman.

635
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,280
Kyo-san's Newcomer Training.

636
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,500
I look forward to working with you!
