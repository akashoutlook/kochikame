1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,640
I look up at the sunset floating in the middle of the river

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,340
I take off my love stone and fly to the end

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,460
I wonder if I'm going to be jogged

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,920
I was laughed at by the captain of the taiko

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,040
I'm fine anywhere

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,300
Even if I'm a man, I have no choice but to fight

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,780
The cityscape that doesn't change even if you are a devil is tender

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,460
The sun is already going down because the crows are crying

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,140
I'll take the yakitori

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,700
I'll take the beer

12
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,800
I wonder if I can enjoy this

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,120
I check the bill again

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,940
But the sunset is falling

15
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,140
Tomorrow will end as well

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,440
The year-end-thrills will also lose their happiness

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,460
I found it's just me who realized, eh

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,060
The Little Ryo-chan

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:38,900
The Little Ryo-chan

20
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,840
Nice. I want to go back to being a kid and play with my friends.

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,820
Hey, Ryo-san!

22
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,680
Hey, Chief! I didn't skip school!

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,520
I want to make the world a better place!

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,360
You think you can fool me with your lies?

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,220
You idiot!

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,480
If you keep spilling oil here, you'll lose your salary!

27
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,980
Go back to work!

28
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,500
Okay!

29
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,340
I got a fever after running so fast. I can't take it anymore.

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,440
Help me!

31
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,680
A kid?

32
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,680
Kids are great.

33
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,280
They have a lot of toys to play with.

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,440
They don't have any bad bosses.

35
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,360
Don't say that, kid.

36
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,360
Ezaki! Don't show your face!

37
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,200
Calm down.

38
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,060
The fact that you're angry is proof that you're short on calcium.

39
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
Eat this stew and replenish your calcium.

40
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,080
Thank you very much!

41
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,560
So, what are you doing here?

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,780
This is a bad invention, isn't it?

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,020
This is an invention that was created for you.

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,560
It's a brilliant and wonderful invention that remains in the human market.

45
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,360
How hard have you been to buy this?

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,960
Stop looking at me and show me what you've got!

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,500
I see. What is this invention?

48
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,620
It's a pumpkin!

49
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,460
Is it candy?

50
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,020
Yes, it is.

51
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,000
If you're so young, you can say candy.

52
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,560
This is a brilliant and brilliant invention.

53
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,140
Hey, that's enough. How are you going to eat that candy?

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,420
It's just the first thing that comes to mind.

55
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,840
Let's see this.

56
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,340
Wow, the frog is weak!

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,840
And then, if it's a bird, it's like this!

58
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,240
It became an egg!

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,020
Now you understand?

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,440
This can make the one who licked it come back to life!

61
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,560
Which means, if the tiger eats it...

62
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,000
...it becomes a child.

63
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,660
How about that? This is a very, very, very revolutionary invention!

64
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,260
Give it to me! Give me that candy too!

65
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,520
I know! This invention is for adults like you.

66
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,720
Don't hesitate to lick it!

67
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,160
Now I can become a child again!

68
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,380
Huh?

69
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,720
Whoa! It's a child!

70
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,220
Of course! My invention is perfect!

71
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,320
I'm going to make a child's life a living hell!

72
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,960
That's awesome!

73
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,720
Hey! I want to be licked too!

74
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,240
Who are you?

75
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,720
It's okay, it's okay.

76
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,960
Here I go!

77
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,820
Wow!

78
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,720
Wow!

79
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,800
Wow!

80
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,040
I've never seen anything like that!

81
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,060
Okay, here I go again!

82
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,380
I'm a child, so I can take the train and the bus without any problems!

83
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,420
I'm a child, so I can take the train and the bus without any problems!

84
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,000
So, a child can also be a woman, right?

85
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,280
Yay!

86
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,180
I'm good at everything except for the job and my jobless boss!

87
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,240
Ryo!

88
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,140
Where's Ryo?

89
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,080
Why hasn't he come back?

90
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,240
Uncle Mooharam!

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,180
After getting so mad at me,

92
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,040
What's wrong?

93
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,460
Honda, did you see Ryo-tsu?

94
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,100
Hm?

95
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,540
Senpai?

96
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,560
No, I didn't see him.

97
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,380
That stupid guy.

98
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,760
Where is he selling oil?

99
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,880
There's no other way, chief.

100
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,520
Because it's Ryo-san.

101
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,320
What?

102
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,500
That's right.

103
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,280
You can't tell a bad person anything, right?

104
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,420
Hmm, Senpai's bad human-like attitude is full of money.

105
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,700
Let's give up on Senpai.

106
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,820
If you say so.

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,860
If you say so, that's true.

108
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,020
I'll just ignore it.

109
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,800
That's right.

110
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,380
Oh, chief.

111
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,560
I bought some delicious buns.

112
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,720
There are only five of them, so let's eat them secretly.

113
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,960
Oh, that sounds fun.

114
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,160
Then I'll put some tea in.

115
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,160
Those guys.

116
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,720
Don't think they'll just live like this.

117
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,860
Excuse me.

118
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,680
One kake-soba, special tempura soba, and oinari.

119
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,100
Three more croquettes.

120
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,620
It was delicious.

121
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,380
Right, papa?

122
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,060
Huh?

123
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,720
Oh.

124
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,720
Here.

125
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,100
Bye-bye.

126
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,640
Thank you for the meal.

127
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,560
How was it?

128
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,260
It was all 1,060 yen.

129
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,880
Huh?

130
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,040
What?

131
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,740
Did you pay the price?

132
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,960
No.

133
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,600
2,060 yen for the kake-soba and 3,080 yen for the special tempura soba.

134
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,160
With the oinari and croquettes.

135
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,480
W-Wait a minute.

136
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,940
Why did you have to pay for that girl?

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,040
What are you talking about?

138
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,700
She's your child, right?

139
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,780
What?

140
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,420
I'm satisfied.

141
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,400
All right.

142
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,140
The other guys are going to do the same.

143
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,180
Let's go!

144
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,020
Let's go!

145
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,600
Let's go!

146
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:06,620
Let's go!

147
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,380
What?

148
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,560
That's so annoying.

149
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,480
Come with me.

150
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,820
Wait for me.

151
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,840
The frog's head is moving!

152
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,740
What's wrong, Boku?

153
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,620
What are you doing?

154
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,020
It's a feast!

155
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,200
Hurry up and open the cat bowl!

156
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,280
I don't want to do this!

157
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,940
Plum, plum, plum!

158
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,620
That was fun!

159
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,640
Kids are the best!

160
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,940
Kids are the best!

161
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,700
Oh, the new house is open!

162
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,420
All right!

163
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,940
Yes, boy.

164
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
You can't let the kids in.

165
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,420
Hey! I'm not a kid!

166
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,120
I'm...

167
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,620
Oh, I see.

168
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,200
I was a kid then.

169
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,160
That means...

170
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,700
If I don't grow up,

171
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,220
I can't drink and play the pachinko?

172
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,020
Kids are more inconvenient than I thought.

173
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,900
Found you!

174
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,580
Boku, where are you from?

175
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,420
Can you come to the station?

176
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,180
You don't have to be afraid.

177
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,260
Two of us?

178
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,220
You know him?

179
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,200
He's kind of grumpy.

180
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,080
Everyone was seeing each other

181
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,880
through his mischief.

182
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,240
It's a mischief for kids,

183
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,160
but할 dad's mischief.

184
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,160
Now it's Ryozu, it's a nosy situation.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,500
So, what's your name?

186
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,700
U-- Um...

187
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,980
Actually, my dad and my mom

188
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,440
are at work.

189
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,840
They haven't come home!

190
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,240
Well...

191
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,600
I was so lonely, so I did that. I'm really sorry.

192
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,620
It's okay. I didn't know that there was such a situation.

193
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,160
I'm sorry. I couldn't understand your feelings.

194
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm disqualified from the police. It's pathetic!

195
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,320
Great success. All of them are good people, so they are weak in this kind of story.

196
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,720
Okay, I understand.

197
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,400
Let's stay at the escape room until our fathers come back.

198
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,200
That's right. Let's do that.

199
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,980
This is not lonely anymore.

200
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,840
The sisters are with us.

201
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,980
But what about the night?

202
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,160
Then I'll stay at my house at night.

203
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,460
What are you saying? I'll take care of this child.

204
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,800
No, it's me.

205
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,780
Me? You can be spoiled by thinking that your sister is your mother.

206
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,680
What?

207
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,620
No, it's me.

208
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,840
Then you can take care of it as a replacement.

209
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,700
I see. As expected of the chief.

210
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,960
These people are also good people.

211
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,880
Anyway, I'll let you stay here for today.

212
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,860
It's a small room, but I won't make you feel lonely.

213
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,400
Yes, yes.

214
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,600
Why do I have to go back to Nico Nico Ryo?

215
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,520
That bastard!

216
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,520
He's hesitating to make a speed change in front of me!

217
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,280
He's being fierce!

218
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,540
Stop! Don't stop!

219
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,400
Stop!

220
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,020
So you ended up going to the Noto Peninsula?

221
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,420
I'm sorry. I found a speed violation and my body moved on its own.

222
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,360
Poor thing.

223
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
Then let's go to my house tonight.

224
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,600
Really? Yay!

225
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,600
What is this?

226
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,800
Where is the house?

227
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,680
It's over there.

228
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,320
It's so big.

229
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,340
It's for your health.

230
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,580
If you rely on a car or a plane or any other useful tool, your body will get numb.

231
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,860
No way.

232
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,060
Let's run.

233
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,880
Let's sweat together.

234
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,800
Hey, wait!

235
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,920
I'll give you five hours today.

236
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,560
Five hours?

237
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,080
The wind feels good.

238
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,020
Wow, that was great!

239
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm so tired.

240
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,720
Kei-chan, you can't do that.

241
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,720
I'm just a kid.

242
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,600
I was just so used to the place I wasn't aware of it.

243
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,600
I'm making sure that I'm OK.

244
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,320
I can't take it anymore.

245
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,760
I want to live in a normal house.

246
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,820
So tonight it's our turn.

247
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,840
After all, this is a normal house and we need to be safe.

248
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,400
So you can rest in peace.

249
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,940
Oh, yeah...

250
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,000
Are you okay? Be careful of your feet.

251
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,260
That's my line.

252
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,740
Don't step on it!

253
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,980
Please be careful of the open door.

254
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,540
I'm going to get a little in from this station, but please be patient.

255
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,480
What? Then what was it until now?

256
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,440
Can you ride more than this?

257
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm used to it, but it's still hard for children.

258
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,800
It seems that only I am here.

259
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,540
Let's go to my sister's house from today.

260
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,220
Hmm...

261
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,680
I think I can do it easily.

262
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,180
Oh!

263
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,020
It's a normal room.

264
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,640
You can use it freely.

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,580
If you have something else, don't hesitate to go.

266
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,400
Yes, I understand.

267
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,760
All right.

268
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,620
I can live as good as I want here.

269
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,340
Hey, it's heavy.

270
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,040
Move away!

271
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,940
Oh, it's exposed.

272
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,320
Oh, Seara.

273
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:10,840
Were you there?

274
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,600
Seara is happy to have made friends.

275
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,620
No, it's not that.

276
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,780
Then,

277
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,280
Seara, please do you a favor.

278
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,940
Hey, wait a minute!

279
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,800
Uh, uh?

280
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,660
Uh-huh?

281
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,800
Uh ...

282
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,920
It's a butterfly.

283
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,200
Wait, wait.

284
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,480
Hmm...

285
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,120
It seems that he is mentally very tired.

286
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,720
What's wrong?

287
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
It's difficult. It's a young age.

288
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,400
That's right.

289
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,340
But what if she goes on like this, she'll be alone again.

290
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,960
Okay, then come to my house today.

291
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,860
Right?

292
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,720
No, I'll be nice and say no.

293
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,800
Oh, you know difficult words.

294
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,760
I've been wondering about it all along, but I've seen that face somewhere.

295
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,580
What are you saying, uncle? It's just my imagination.

296
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,520
I see.

297
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,300
As expected of the chief, he's sharp.

298
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,960
I have to be careful not to make a mess.

299
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
I'm home.

300
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,300
I'll be in your way.

301
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,600
Welcome.

302
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,920
I've prepared a room, so take your time.

303
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:35,980
Okay.

304
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,260
Eat a lot.

305
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,100
Looks delicious.

306
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,060
Thank you.

307
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,480
Thank you.

308
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,020
Home made food is the best.

309
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,960
Here's your change, madam.

310
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,920
Good morning.

311
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,600
Good morning.

312
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,340
What's wrong with her?

313
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,980
She's still sleeping.

314
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:10,940
What?

315
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,420
Get out.

316
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,220
What?

317
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,580
What?

318
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,980
Adopt a child as soon as possible.

319
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,200
Start radio exercise.

320
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,060
1, 2, 3, 4.

321
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,000
Come on, cheer up more.

322
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,440
1, 2, 3, 4.

323
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,840
Why am I doing this?

324
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,100
What is this?

325
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,300
Let's eat.

326
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,160
Idiot!

327
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,980
Before you eat, you should put your hands together and eat!

328
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,760
I-I'm sorry.

329
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,700
Don't get lost. You're being rude.

330
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,760
Yes.

331
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,420
It stinks.

332
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,340
Idiot!

333
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:05,460
Idiot!

334
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,480
You don't know how to use chopsticks.

335
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,120
Start practicing properly from today.

336
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,100
O-Okay.

337
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,740
I'm a customer.

338
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,140
Did you say something?

339
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,800
N-No.

340
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,440
Idiot!

341
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,420
Is there anyone who's been rolling around since noon?

342
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,840
Children, play outside!

343
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,000
O-Okay!

344
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,160
That's why I didn't want to go to the chief's house.

345
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,260
What?

346
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,000
I see. As expected of the chief.

347
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,480
Isn't it a little too strict?

348
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,700
Not a little. I don't want to go back to that house anymore.

349
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,280
Okay, I'm going home soon.

350
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,240
Idiot!

351
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,020
Oh, today is...

352
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,480
What are you talking about? Let's go.

353
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:52,840
What?

354
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,080
Thank you for your hard work.

355
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,100
Thank you.

356
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,380
Thinking about the things I did after I got home is so hard.

357
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,060
Hm?

358
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,080
Hm?

359
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,660
Oh, a new item came in.

360
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,500
I have to go buy it now.

361
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,340
I'm so out of work right now.

362
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,460
Hm.

363
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,700
Hm?

364
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,460
It's food!

365
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,720
Oh, I'm hungry.

366
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:34,900
Hm?

367
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,820
Ah, ah.

368
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,520
I'll eat it.

369
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,440
I'll eat it.

370
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,120
Now, keep eating.

371
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,520
Y-Yes.

372
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,860
How is it? Is it good?

373
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,100
Yes.

374
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,440
I see, I see.

375
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,200
Now, keep eating.

376
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't hold back.

377
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,880
Ah, ah.

378
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,740
Hmm, strange.

379
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,500
I suddenly changed my attitude.

380
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,900
Is it my imagination?

381
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,300
W-What?

382
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,340
I saw this earlier.

383
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,680
But why is it here?

384
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,980
Is that good?

385
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:17,900
Huh?

386
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,900
Um, wh-why?

387
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,900
Well, somehow.

388
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,020
What?

389
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,980
I-I don't know.

390
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,460
I can't believe it.

391
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,960
The manager bought me something.

392
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,600
Oh, oh, and there was a bath.

393
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,500
Um, can I come in with you?

394
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,180
What?

395
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,400
Huh?

396
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,160
What's wrong?

397
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,440
Oh, no, no.

398
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,900
Nothing.

399
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,260
Strange.

400
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
It's definitely strange.

401
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,040
Suddenly, you became so kind.

402
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,580
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,420
I was strict.

404
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:54,960
What?

405
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,000
When I look at you, I always remember Ryotsu.

406
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,340
Huh?

407
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,160
Ryotsu is my subordinate.

408
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,920
This is a useless guy.

409
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,180
His manners are not polite.

410
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,000
His attitude of living is also the worst.

411
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,460
If I leave you alone like this,

412
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,460
I'll become a bad adult like Ryotsu.

413
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,380
When I think about it, I've become strict.

414
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,320
Huh?

415
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,760
I-I can't get angry.

416
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,940
I'm not Ryotsu now.

417
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,460
But...

418
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,500
Huh?

419
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,980
But, after all, children are nice.

420
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,240
I have a daughter, but I don't have a son.

421
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,660
If I had a healthy son like you, I would have taught him various things.

422
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,340
Oh, I see.

423
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,460
That's what that face meant.

424
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,240
That's why you became strangely kind.

425
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,180
That's why you became like this.

426
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,340
That's why you became like this.

427
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:02,500
You're not Ryotsu.

428
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,160
You're Ryotsu.

429
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Uh, Ryotsu.

430
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,560
T-That means...

431
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,180
You're Ryotsu.

432
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,860
Ryotsu?

433
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,740
Ryotsu?

434
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,540
No, Ryotsu.

435
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,060
That's what he meant.

436
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,920
He's Ryotsu.

437
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,560
And he's Ryotsu.

438
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,200
Ryotsu!

439
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,800
Ryotsu!

440
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,240
Ryotsu!

441
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,420
Ryotsu!

442
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,900
Ryotsu!

443
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,900
I'll buy it for you.

444
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,360
Then, you'll need a radio, a plastic model, a game, a TV, a DVD...

445
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,180
Yeah, yeah...

446
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,320
And then, you'll need a bicycle, an air gun, and a new cell phone.

447
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,100
And then...

448
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:44,040
Oh, right! You'll need a computer.

449
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,180
Right, Dad?

450
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,800
Buy it, buy it...

451
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,580
What?

452
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,220
Ryo-tsu.

453
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,080
What are you talking about, Dad?

454
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,440
I'm not Ryo-tsu!

455
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,600
I'm your son!

456
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,460
When did you...

457
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,120
Did the candy effect go out?

458
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,340
I see.

459
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,920
So that child was you after all.

460
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,320
You see, there are various reasons for this.

461
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,460
All the causes are in the candy that I made!

462
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,880
Shut up, you idiot!

463
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,520
I'll take this!

464
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,000
You idiot!

465
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,040
You idiot!

466
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,140
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

467
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,180
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

468
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Hey, you idiot!

469
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,580
That's it, stop!

470
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,380
Stop, stop!

471
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,060
Hey, stop!

472
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,000
Stop!

473
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,820
Hey, stop!

474
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,140
You idiot!

475
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,600
Hey, stop!

476
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,020
Hey, stop!

477
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:46,580
Can I have a candy?

478
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,680
I'm a fish that bites the sand.

479
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,740
Jyugem Jyugem

480
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,880
I'm a fish that bites the sand.

481
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm always wearing sandals.

482
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,260
I'm always a scandal.

483
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:03,860
Don't worry.

484
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,360
I play with a cool nail.

485
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,160
Everyday.

486
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,760
I threw it in the trash.

487
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,680
I threw it in the trash.

488
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,100
I threw it in the trash.

489
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,120
I threw it in the trash.

490
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,640
I'm just stupid.

491
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,740
I'm a good-for-nothing and poor.

492
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,660
I'm just stupid.

493
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,340
I'm not poor.

494
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,580
I always try my own way.

495
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,020
How about that?

496
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,900
A single iron in a book.

497
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,240
I'm the oil.

498
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,680
I run around and escape.

499
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,140
I'm a Noel in a camel's head.

500
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,120
I'm in the middle of nowhere

501
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,960
and there's a ludicrous typhoon

502
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,740
and a precise round trip.

503
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,380
Ki-are-ri

504
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,540
I'm gonna come on and make you right down!

Chousuke!

524
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,000
I love festivals!

525
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,600
When I hear festivals, I can't stand or stand!

526
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,500
I can't stand eating yakisoba with Mikoshi Katsui!

527
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,820
Hey, Lemon!

528
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,880
I'll teach you how to enjoy festivals!

529
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,400
Next time, "Memories of the Yatai"
