1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:03,920
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:13,780
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm watching the sunset floating in the middle of the sea.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,140
I'll fly to the place where the love stone was broken.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,480
I'll fly to the place where the love stone was broken.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,980
I laughed at the captain of the taiko.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,640
I'm fine somewhere.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,200
I'm fine somewhere.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,020
I'm fine somewhere.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,920
The crows are crying and the rain is falling.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,260
The crows are crying and the rain is falling.

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,640
The crows are crying and the rain is falling.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,940
Is there an overcast sky?

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,880
From the tips of the cap's flow,

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,420
To the brothers and sisters in the temple.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,660
The sun sets.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,620
Tomorrow is over soon.

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,980
But the pain and happiness is gone.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,180
But the pain and happiness is gone.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,520
sensei

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,740
Show your favorite comedy

23
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,680
Soon, Minamisenju. Minamisenju.

24
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,340
The exit is going to Ueno to the left side.

25
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,700
Seeing you "30327".

26
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:42,920
You're so stubborn.

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,240
I'm curious about the first-class cash of G2.

28
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,860
Yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,200
Oh, right.

30
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,700
Hey, young man!

31
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,040
This is a priority seat.

32
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,740
I'll give you two seats from this year.

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,340
Wait a minute.

34
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,200
Shut up!

35
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,620
What did you say?

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,240
Here we go!

37
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,060
Here you go.

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank you very much.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,140
No, no.

40
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,700
You're welcome.

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,600
You're feeling good after doing a good job.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,900
This is a good place to get a first-class cash.

43
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,080
First-class cash?

44
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,180
Good night.

45
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,060
Hey.

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,740
We're sleepy.

47
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,220
We'll stay here.

48
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,760
Okay.

49
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,540
There's an zum-

50
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,440
Hey, hey, hey!

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,160
Oh.

52
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,260
I'm in a hurry.

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,440
I gotta sleep now.

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,280
What?

55
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:05,900
Alyoshen?

56
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,860
On the roof of a car waiting for the bus.

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,680
On the roof of a car waiting for the bus.

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm clear.

59
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,360
Hey, hey, hey!

60
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,260
Come to me!

61
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,420
Ryo-san!

62
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,480
Is this a race?

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,680
Yes, it's a race.

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,940
Patrols are hard, right?

65
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,840
Well, you can do your best.

66
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,660
Ryo-san, if you get it right, please treat me.

67
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,460
Okay.

68
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,640
Tch, was that a police officer?

69
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,400
Look.

70
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,400
Idiot!

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
What's the point of fighting a high school student?

72
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,880
W-wait a minute, chief.

73
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,740
I'm not bad.

74
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,540
That's a fair defense.

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,980
He said it was an over-defense.

76
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,940
You're really...

77
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,980
But...

78
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,800
Anyway, I'm not allowed to go home for a week.

79
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,420
That's all.

80
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,160
Chief!

81
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,180
Senior, it's no use going any further.

82
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,440
It's because the chief put his head down in many places when he lived at home.

83
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,320
Damn it, that kid!

84
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,340
All right, if that's the case...

85
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,460
Senior, are you going to revenge?

86
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,200
I'm going to make a plamodel thoroughly.

87
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,480
That father is not allowed to go home.

88
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,160
Damn it, that kid.

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,380
I'm going to make a plamodel thoroughly.

90
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,380
What a good kid!

91
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,880
You guys are all...

92
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,020
Well, you asked for it.

93
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,660
We are...

94
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,520
Jijiranger Green!

95
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,020
Jijiranger Yellow!

96
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,560
Jijiranger White!

97
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,700
Jijiranger Blue!

98
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,840
Jijiranger Red!

99
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,080
All five of us...

100
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,380
...are the Jijiranger of the Super-Bashii!

101
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,280
Hey, you're not gonna wait?

102
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,140
What's with you? You're so annoying.

103
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,040
Anyway, when you got on the subway, you were sitting in the front seat.

104
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,040
Then what's the point of saying that?

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,040
Moreover, you were supposed to be banned, but you even hung up on your phone!

106
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,920
Even if you're allowed to, we won't let you get angry!

107
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,140
You're going to be sent to the police station in front of Kameari Park!

108
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,960
You're so annoying!

109
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,240
Shut up!

110
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,200
Are you alright?

111
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,540
I'm fine.

112
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,260
Hey, young man, I think you really made us angry.

113
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,720
Green, you can't do this!

114
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,160
Yes, sir.

115
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,000
What?

116
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,020
Hey, you!

117
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,320
You want to fight?

118
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,860
I finally got my revenge for what I did yesterday.

119
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,820
You're not going to fight with that?

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,180
You're so naive, young man.

121
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
Come on, let's fight!

122
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
What are you doing?

123
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,760
What are you doing?

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,360
It's the last blow.

125
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,840
Hey, young man, don't hit me!

126
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:40,640
You're going to be punished, young man!

127
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,200
Hey, you!

128
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,040
Stand up!

129
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,500
Come here!

130
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:50,620
You come here!

131
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,040
The Banquet!

132
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,540
You come here!

133
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:58,640
The Banquet!

134
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:58,720
Ugh!

135
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,840
Even if the convenience store clerk forgives us,

136
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,040
we, the Hikari team, won't!

137
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,780
Let's go!

138
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,160
What if the little children who love you copy you?

139
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,400
Cool your head and reflect!

140
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Then, everyone,

141
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,060
justice will always win!

142
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,040
We are...

143
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,440
The Searching Hikari Team G-Ranger!

144
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,600
Hey, wait!

145
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,160
It's a secret!

146
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,340
You!

147
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:52,920
You're not going to stand up and read a book at the bookstore, are you?

148
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,820
That's not so bad!

149
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,380
You're not going to stand up and read a book at the bookstore, are you?

150
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,860
You'll have to buy a book that has the same contents as the regular ones,

151
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
and lock the room when you get back home.

152
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,880
Then you'll get a clean look at it.

153
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,900
Don't be so rude!

154
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,920
You're not going to stand up and read a book at the bookstore, are you?

155
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,220
You're not going to stand up and read a book at the bookstore, are you?

156
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,840
You're not going to stand up and read a book at the bookstore, are you?

157
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,560
Well, let's do it.

158
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,180
But I'm tired already.

159
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,060
Oh! The Hikari Team!

160
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,440
How is it?

161
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,840
Cool! Cool!

162
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,180
Thank you!

163
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,660
Justice always wins!

164
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,600
We are the "Gigi Rangers of the Underworld!"

165
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,220
So cool!

166
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,620
Would you like to take a picture with us?

167
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,480
Here's the cheese!

168
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:50,880
These are the members of the "Gigi Rangers of the Underworld" who are causing commotion around the world.

169
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,720
They are trying to show off their morality and rules to the young people who don't follow their rules.

170
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,360
Some of them praise them, but some of them complain that they've gone too far.

171
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,000
They also say that they are being pushed to the toilet in front of Kameari Park.

172
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,900
We can't let them pass.

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,200
As soon as we find them, we'll arrest them.

174
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,000
What?

175
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,700
What's wrong, Reiko?

176
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,780
Doesn't that Gigi Ranger Green look like someone?

177
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,140
The Gigi Rangers of the Underworld

178
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,960
It's Ryo-Ryotsu!

179
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,300
This is enough.

180
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,520
Who's that? You're so noisy.

181
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,780
It's me.

182
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,160
R-Ryotsu!

183
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,580
What's wrong?

184
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,780
What's going on?

185
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,740
What are you doing?

186
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,520
Ryo-Ryotsu, you've been misled!

187
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,180
You're going to invite your friends to the local police station and do something stupid!

188
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,340
What?

189
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
I'm the Gigi Ranger who wants to go to the underground town!

190
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,440
You want to go to the underground town?

191
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,200
Gigi Ranger?

192
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,540
What's going on?

193
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,660
Do you still plan to kill me?

194
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,920
Wait a minute!

195
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,880
I really don't know anything!

196
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,300
You don't know even if you see this?

197
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,960
I don't dress like this!

198
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,740
Really?

199
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,180
You've been charged with the house arrest.

200
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,380
I'm not kidding!

201
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,380
I didn't leave Ryo when I was on the house arrest!

202
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,040
I made this!

203
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,700
All of this?

204
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,600
Yes!

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,960
Do you think you have time to go out and do such a stupid thing?

206
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,060
Chief...

207
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh...

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,840
I'll prove my innocence!

209
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,620
I'll catch the Ikari-Squad with my own hands!

210
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,120
All right!

211
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,280
If you say so, then catch me!

212
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,340
Yes!

213
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,360
The Gigi Ranger of the Ikari-Squad appeared in Asakusa, Chushu.

214
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,280
It's about 3 kilometers in radius.

215
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,600
Master Ryo, we should patrol thoroughly within that range, right?

216
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,460
That's right!

217
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,060
Listen!

218
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,780
Those who do not follow social rules must be marked thoroughly!

219
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,020
Yes!

220
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,160
It was forbidden by the law to track even non- Mccapers!

221
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,180
If you understand, go away!

222
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,140
Yes...

223
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes...!

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,280
It...

225
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,540
Me!

226
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:45,900
Master Ryo!

227
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,040
You have finally managed to escape!

228
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:47,860
Where am I?

229
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,840
We are at the shrine!

230
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,340
We speak of the fallen hoping!

231
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,380
Okay, I'm on my way.

232
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,940
Nagagawa, can you hear me?

233
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,380
The Hikari team is in the shrine's vicinity.

234
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,660
Stop it!

235
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,880
You think you can stop me?

236
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,980
Young man, you're going to be a scapegoat before the Kamenari Park.

237
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,600
Stop right there!

238
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,660
Don't move!

239
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,780
I can't run anymore!

240
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,540
You're in my way!

241
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,440
It's Momosu's Natsuki!

242
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,460
Oh no!

243
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,120
Oh no!

244
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,020
Maria, follow White!

245
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,780
I'll follow Green!

246
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,580
Yes, sir!

247
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,120
Damn it!

248
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
Hey, wait!

249
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,680
What?

250
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,300
He's hiding somewhere.

251
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,080
Yo, Kankichi. What are you doing?

252
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,420
You're a policeman, but you're peeking into other people's houses?

253
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,960
Hey, Mr. Tatami.

254
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,580
You're still alive, aren't you?

255
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,620
I'm working hard like this.

256
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,860
I'm doing my best.

257
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,840
That's good.

258
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,240
By the way, Mr. Gen.

259
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,800
Have you seen a weirdo in green tights?

260
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,360
I don't know.

261
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,720
I just finished work and came out.

262
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:31,960
I see.

263
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,860
Did something happen?

264
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,340
Well, there's a group of young people who don't follow social rules.

265
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,680
That's not true.

266
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,620
That used to happen a lot in the past.

267
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,440
By the way, I used to be beaten by Mr. Gen often.

268
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,220
That's because you guys did something wrong.

269
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,020
No, I didn't do anything wrong.

270
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,480
I was beaten even if it wasn't bad.

271
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,320
When I was scolded for picking up persimmons from Mr. Gen's house,

272
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,860
he said, "If you want to eat persimmons, come here."

273
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,020
So I did what he said.

274
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,120
After all, I was beaten.

275
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,260
Is that so?

276
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,700
Hey, I don't have time to talk about such a useless thing.

277
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,640
See you later.

278
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,240
Hey, how was it?

279
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,860
I was caught up in the empty space in the castle.

280
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,240
I got into a pit.

281
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,840
Me, too.

282
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
I thought I was caught up in the empty street.

283
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,020
But the old man who was there was an old man from the shop.

284
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,680
I let him go.

285
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,680
Old man?

286
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,380
I met an old man when I lost sight of him.

287
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,160
By the way, I met your grandfather, too.

288
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,020
Ryo, what's wrong?

289
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,580
Oh, nothing.

290
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,680
I'm sorry to have helped you today.

291
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,240
I'll do it by myself from tomorrow.

292
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:46,880
See you.

293
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,600
Hey, Senpai.

294
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,280
Where're you going?

295
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,660
I'm going to your hotel.

296
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,540
Oh, that's fine.

297
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,580
I've been waiting there for a while.

298
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,480
Get back here!

299
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:05,600
I 'll check it out.

300
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,500
Yes, please move it.

301
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,140
Don't'me take it easy.

302
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,840
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

303
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,540
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

304
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,100
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

305
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,560
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

306
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,140
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

307
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,700
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

308
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:28,940
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

309
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:28,980
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

310
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,360
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

311
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

312
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,680
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

313
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,760
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

314
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,020
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

315
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:50,820
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

316
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,320
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

317
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,320
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

318
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

319
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,260
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

320
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,280
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

321
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,460
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

322
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:01,540
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

323
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:01,700
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

324
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,520
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

325
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,720
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

326
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,780
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

327
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,380
I'm going to take a walk with my friends.

328
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,780
They won't listen.

329
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,400
I'll do one.

330
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,380
Okay.

331
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,240
Genza, hang in there.

332
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,000
He's got a heart attack and has a pacemaker.

333
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,180
Hurry up and get your phone!

334
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Are you okay, Genza?

335
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,580
Somehow...

336
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,540
You're good, old folks.

337
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,400
30 minutes left.

338
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,580
I guess I can use it.

339
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,120
There are still people who can't keep up with their manners.

340
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,520
What should we do, Kanbei?

341
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,760
There's no other way.

342
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,840
Let's use that thing.

343
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,520
Hello? Hello?

344
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,680
He hung up.

345
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,120
Why is he out of the country?

346
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,980
He's using a machine to turn his cell phone out of the country.

347
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,080
What a scary old man.

348
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:22,300
The old man is there.

349
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,420
There's no doubt.

350
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,560
Even if I tell the numbers, there's no doubt it's them.

351
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,560
But I want proof that they won't move.

352
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,240
There they are!

353
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,080
Is that true?

354
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,360
Okay.

355
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,740
There's no doubt about it.

356
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,620
There must be a skull on the body.

357
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,280
It's him.

358
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,900
I saw the skull.

359
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,240
The old men are getting more and more frivolous.

360
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,000
The old men are getting more and more frivolous.

361
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,620
The old men are getting more and more frivolous.

362
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,520
The old men are getting more and more frivolous.

363
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,120
I knew it.

364
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,120
Wait!

365
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,660
What are you guys?

366
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,540
You heard me right. We are...

367
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,100
T-Ranger Green!

368
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,720
T-Ranger Blue!

369
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:37,840
T-Ranger Yellow!

370
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,320
T-Ranger White!

371
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,740
T-Ranger Blue!

372
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,580
T-Ranger Red!

373
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,900
All five of you!

374
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,000
Sabachii Karantai T-Ranger!

375
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,640
You're in the way. Get out of the way!

376
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,960
I can't do that.

377
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,660
A week ago, I was in the subway station's garage.

378
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,580
I was trying to get a call from you.

379
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,560
I was trying to get a call from you.

380
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,300
I was trying to get a call from you.

381
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,840
I was trying to get a call from you.

382
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,380
What?

383
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,120
I don't know.

384
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,980
Don't lie.

385
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,960
What do you think?

386
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,960
This face looks familiar, right?

387
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,440
You are...

388
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,160
It's the Genzo who was with Ume who was kicked down the stairs.

389
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,160
Wait, old man!

390
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,480
Hey, old man.

391
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,140
You made me feel embarrassed on the train.

392
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,600
Stop it.

393
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,000
You're the one who's wrong.

394
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,080
Shut up.

395
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,960
You're a jerk.

396
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,140
Ume!

397
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,500
Are you alright?

398
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,020
Get a grip.

399
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,220
Ume can't play the game because of the injury at that time.

400
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,060
I see.

401
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,520
I see.

402
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,260
That's because the old man fell down the stairs.

403
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,080
Are you going to get better?

404
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,500
What do you mean?

405
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,760
I'm going to replace you with the Katsushikaku Kameari Park Exhibition.

406
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,940
What?

407
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,400
What?

408
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,160
What's wrong with you?

409
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,820
I don't know what you're saying.

410
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
Alright, alright, alright.

411
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:14,960
Get out of here!

412
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,540
Or I'll beat you up in the street!

413
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:16,880
Wait!

414
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:17,940
Huh?

415
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,020
Old ranger, Black, on duty!

416
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,680
What?

417
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,000
Disgusting.

418
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,140
What are you doing on your own?

419
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,380
What?

420
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,320
If you underestimate me, this is what will happen!

421
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,340
Did he just say "Jijiranger Black"?

422
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,240
I don't know.

423
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,500
Don't worry about that, just do it!

424
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:56,180
Let's go, Hewako Ichido!

425
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,660
There you are!

426
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,220
Taking an exit before Kamey почかめやり公園, you're quarreling!

427
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:24,980
And what are you thinking!?

428
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,560
Your state isn't like this, Omino!

429
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,160
All of you just give him a big punch!

430
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,860
I can't stop laughing!

431
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,880
I can't stop laughing!

432
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,140
Stop it, stop!

433
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,060
Justice always wins.

434
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,440
We will win!

435
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,620
Let's go, Jijiranger!

436
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,900
Thank you, Jijiranger Black.

437
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,400
You saved me.

438
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,180
No, by the way, Black.

439
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,200
Who are you?

440
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,340
You're already awake.

441
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,080
Kankichi...

442
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,820
Come on, you're getting old.

443
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,080
Don't overdo it, Kanbei.

444
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,780
What?

445
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,900
It means you saw through everything.

446
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,100
What are you doing?

447
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,400
If Kankichi is going to get arrested, I'm going to kill him.

448
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,380
Now, put it on the table.

449
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,180
I don't know anything.

450
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,620
I just killed an idiotic young man.

451
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,840
Kankichi...

452
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,700
I, Jiranger Black, will be leaving today!

453
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,560
See you!

454
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,940
I see.

455
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,900
But I can't use my power like that.

456
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,080
I can't.

457
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,360
Chief, that's right.

458
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,100
About the old men...

459
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,780
I won't ask you about that.

460
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,960
Chief...

461
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,680
Enough.

462
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,820
Here, drink.

463
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,100
Okay.

464
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,800
Here.

465
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,740
In the old days, there were adults who scolded young people for their bad behavior.

466
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,520
Since when did the adults in Japan...

467
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,160
forget to scold young people?

468
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,340
That's why I'm so happy.

469
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,920
Because there's a chief who always scolds me.

470
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,660
Idiot!

471
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,580
Hey, chief!

472
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,660
Don't you get it, Ryotsu?

473
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,460
Don't get it wrong.

474
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,140
Your goldfish is not yet melted.

475
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,680
Please forgive me, chief!

476
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,180
Please drink, Mr. Naizawa!

477
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,280
Someone is calling me.

478
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,680
Who's calling you?

479
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,160
Don't you get it?

480
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,320
Don't you get it?

481
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,120
No one is calling me.

482
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,180
I don't even know how to say my name!

483
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,200
I can't hear you.

484
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:09,380
You know what it is...

485
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,440
I know it?

486
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,140
This is why I'm going to the farms.

487
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,840
All right.

488
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:20,760
Thank you.

489
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:30,540
Everyone was a child once, but everyone has forgotten

490
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,960
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above his eyes

491
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,320
Turn around and see that corner

492
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,700
Everyone can see everyone

493
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,700
There is a wall there

494
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,720
There must be a wall

495
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,780
Everyone come to our town

496
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,120
There is a wall there

497
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,020
There must be a wall

498
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,920
Everyone come to our town

499
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,040
There's a bicycle hat shop

500
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,200
A butcher next door

501
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,380
Is there this shop that cut my hair without taking money?

502
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,560
Where to go?

503
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,140
What's that little mouthy ganko dad, Is arrived at Hikarajima?

504
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,960
That's okay

505
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,620
What's that?

506
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,420
The next time we'll spread the world

507
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,240
Baseline w

508
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,260
See ya

509
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:37,540
Let's go!!

510
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,700
There's a wall over there

511
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,520
Oh, there's definitely a wall

512
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,660
Everyone, come to our town

513
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,200
Thanks!!!
