1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,240
LoneWolf

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,140
"When watching TV, turn the room on to make it bright, and try to look away."

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,740
"I can't see!"

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,920
"Who's here?"

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:20,920
"These two are the only people in " "To

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,460
the ones who have no money, come to me!" "I

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,580
have no money, but now I'm worried."

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,940
Look at the blue sky, the white clouds

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,100
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,720
You know, don't you? You know, don't you?

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,140
If you know, then just keep quiet and follow me!

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,960
Momoderela

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,720
The famous work, Momoderela

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,920
Cheers!

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,080
Ah, Senpai.

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,480
What are you doing here all the time?

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,880
You're doing an old man home visit every year, right?

18
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,160
I was discussing what to do for the play.

19
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,660
A play for the old man?

20
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,220
You do that every year? I didn't know that.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,780
I'm a volunteer.

22
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,660
I don't know you, but I invited you.

23
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,160
I'm not going to cooperate with you.

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,900
You're a man of money, after all.

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,560
Of course.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,180
A multi-talented professional who can sing, dance, and laugh like me

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,600
can't do it for free.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,700
What's this picture?

29
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,580
Momotaro and Cinderella?

30
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,920
I didn't expect him to do a play like this at an old man's home.

31
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,520
You're not going to do it for free, are you?

32
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,440
Don't interrupt me.

33
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,180
I thought I'd say something as an entertainer.

34
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,180
Other than us, the children in the nearby kindergarten will participate in the play.

35
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,700
So we're playing a play that's easy for both the elderly and children to understand.

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,840
But there's no Momotaro or Cinderella.

37
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,780
There's no such thing.

38
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,440
The fairy tale is educational, and last year's Kaguya was a big success.

39
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,480
What's good about education?

40
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,240
I think it's just a bad influence on children.

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,920
Especially this Momotaro.

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,200
What?

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,220
Momotaro is a classic Japanese fairy tale.

44
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,900
It's too unrealistic for human beings to be born from a peach.

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,360
Even if the seed of a peach changes suddenly, it will never become human.

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,820
If the seed changes into a human, Yaoya won't stop being noisy.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,460
Yaoya!

48
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:53,880
Yaoya!

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,940
Yaoya!

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,200
Yaoya!

51
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,880
Yaoya!

52
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,980
Momotaro is a mythological fairy tale.

53
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,020
Let's say there's a human in the peach.

54
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,940
Cut the peach into two.

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,200
Do you understand?

56
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,620
Um...

57
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,420
Then, should I cut it?

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,040
The knife will hit the peach.

59
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,860
No!

60
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,160
So, the peach inside...

61
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,780
When you cut it, you have to stick it on the side.

62
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,540
It's normal to not think that much.

63
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,340
Seriously.

64
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,520
That's not true.

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,460
Basically, there are too many contradictions in this story.

66
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,880
First, a large peach flows from the side of the head to the side.

67
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,220
That's true, but...

68
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:44,740
Don't you think so?

69
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,700
No.

70
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,220
Momotaro is inside the peach.

71
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,720
It's unnatural for it to float.

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:50,780
It's natural.

73
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,440
It's natural to roll around the bottom of the river.

74
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,520
I'm sure there was air inside the peach.

75
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,220
Then let's say it's floating again.

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,840
The baby inside is this big, and the size of the peach is this big.

77
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,000
It's creepy when you say it in real life.

78
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,220
Usually, when such a big peach flows,

79
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,740
"Ryohei! Peach, peach, peach!"

80
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,020
First of all, you'll be surprised.

81
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,260
You'll never think of eating it at home.

82
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,040
Well, I guess so.

83
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,780
Let's say you gave it to your grandma and brought it home to eat.

84
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,500
But you'll eat the fruit after lunch, right?

85
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,300
Usually, yes.

86
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,880
You might forget about it and rot away.

87
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,880
It's an old story, so it's convenient to talk about it.

88
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,060
So you don't have to be born from a peach,

89
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,880
just pick it up at the shrine and it's fine, right?

90
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,520
Then let's call Momotaro.

91
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,220
Momotaro won't become Momotaro.

92
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,880
I picked it up in the peach season,

93
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,140
so I named it Momotaro.

94
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,940
I can make a lot of things.

95
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,400
And this demon taizhi.

96
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,440
He suddenly goes to attack Onigashima.

97
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,220
He attacks the demon and takes the treasure and goes home.

98
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,000
He's doing the same thing as the robbers.

99
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,960
Even if the demon is a bad guy,

100
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,680
if he does this now,

101
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,360
Momotaro and his friends will be arrested for sure.

102
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,860
Furthermore, the liars are the liars.

103
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,660
The liars?

104
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:16,900
What are the liars?

105
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,320
I think it's a monkey and...

106
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,780
A dog.

107
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,820
A rat.

108
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,260
I don't think they're useful for animals like pets.

109
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,500
The monkey scratched, the dog bit him,

110
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,540
and the rat poked his eye and killed the demon.

111
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,940
The enemy is a terrible demon like Chief Ohara.

112
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,900
Are you kidding me?

113
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,540
You'll get beaten up by a flower bud.

114
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,860
That's true.

115
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,400
If I were Momotaro,

116
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,800
I would never take such a weak person.

117
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:43,940
If I were Momotaro,

118
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,400
I would definitely take him.

119
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,600
First, the lion.

120
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,560
Then the tiger.

121
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,500
Then the grizzly.

122
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,240
This is Chief Ohara.

123
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,840
Hey, don't!

124
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,160
Don't come near me!

125
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,440
Senior!

126
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,820
Ryo-chan!

127
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,800
Bebe-chan!

128
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,100
You're not supposed to use me for your image.

129
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,020
Damn it, what the hell are you doing here?

130
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,320
The boss is coming for us again.

131
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,740
So the chief can be a monkey, a dog, or a pig.

132
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,600
But you can't really be a chief

133
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,780
Komachi, if you're a monkey,

134
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,740
do you think you'll be a chief?

135
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,460
What?

136
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,840
I don't want to be a goldfish.

137
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,580
I know!

138
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,180
Yeah?

139
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,460
Go and kill the demons.

140
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,680
You might die,

141
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,460
but you can't be a chief with a goldfish alone.

142
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,780
You've got to have money.

143
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,820
Yeah, right.

144
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,260
Or a diamond, or a trademark.

145
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,040
Home for two hours.

146
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,500
I'd like a new motorcycle.

147
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,020
I don't know about the rich Nakagane and Reiko, but that's the character.

148
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,740
Oh, it's Volvo.

149
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,900
Ryo-tsu, let's meet up for the survival game next week.

150
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,280
I came to the right place.

151
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,480
If you were Momotaro, what would you do if you got on this demon island and exterminated the demons?

152
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,040
First, change Momotaro's costume.

153
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,700
Costume?

154
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,900
Set up the best flag in Japan, wear this flashy outfit, and attack the enemy right away.

155
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,340
Immediately find the demons and meet them at the return point.

156
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,660
If this is the case, I will attack at night.

157
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,140
The ship is also a landing destination.

158
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,720
Of course, only in the best clothes.

159
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,560
As expected of the former Green Belly.

160
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,300
So, do you land from the back of the island?

161
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,540
It's naive.

162
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,880
Maybe there...

163
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,640
It's a minefield.

164
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,460
I see.

165
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,160
Then how do you attack?

166
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,380
You land here and here.

167
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,340
First, use the shield instead of the flag.

168
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,000
Drop the main gun and destroy the enemy's main camp.

169
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,380
Then, even if the dog is a dog, release Doberman at once.

170
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,860
In addition, put the gorilla inside the castle, not the monkey.

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,200
This triple attack will shake the enemy's forces.

172
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,780
Take the treasure there and run away.

173
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,820
This is the "Island Storm Strategy."

174
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,240
Wonderful, Bulba.

175
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,940
There is no such old-fashioned story.

176
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,940
After all, it's better to make Cinderella.

177
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,560
You can give dreams to children and the elderly.

178
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,440
I'm not kidding.

179
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,100
Where in Cinderella can I give you a dream?

180
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,000
That's because Cinderella is beautiful.

181
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,880
Among the dozens of beautiful women, I was in the eyes of the prince.

182
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,860
I'm in the eyes of the prince.

183
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,860
If you're ugly, you can't even draw a flower.

184
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,320
You should be angry.

185
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,780
Why are you pointing at us?

186
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,440
Do you mean we're ugly?

187
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,660
Well, don't get excited.

188
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,840
For example, if you like Cinderella's hard-working appearance before she transforms, it's true love.

189
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,060
Choose a bad sister.

190
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,700
If you choose a bad sister and marry her to change you, this is true love.

191
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,280
Cinderella has solved the lesson that only beautiful women can be happy in the world.

192
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,660
How can you say that you have a dream?

193
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,400
And this is also full of lies.

194
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,460
When the magic was over 12 o'clock, the dress and the carriage were gone.

195
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,940
Why didn't the glass shoes disappear?

196
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,300
If you say so, it's true.

197
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,460
That's true.

198
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,140
If you give up the room and leave the glass shoes, the size of the shoes should be 24 cm.

199
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,460
If you look all over the country, there should be 50,000 women with the same size of feet.

200
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,800
Cinderella alone is not realistic at all.

201
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,800
You're complaining too much.

202
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,700
Then what kind of play should we do?

203
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,440
Okay.

204
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,280
Then I'll write a script that combines Momotaro and Cinderella.

205
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,740
What?

206
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:09,960
What?

207
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,200
This is definitely better.

208
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,440
The About a Most recorder

209
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,260
The About a Most recorder

210
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:39,460
The About a Most recorder

211
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,300
♪ I'm gonna cry, cry, cry, cry ♪

212
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,240
Ryo-tsu, Kankichi, what are you doing?

213
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,520
I'm making the costumes, but the script isn't finished, so I can't act.

214
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,960
Hey, sorry, sorry. The script's finally done.

215
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,300
Everyone, remember the lines right away!

216
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,400
Ladies and gentlemen, and otossan, okkasan.

217
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,440
Next up is a super old story by Broadway's Matsuo, delivered by the Katsushika family.

218
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,220
"Momoterela, Hajimari Hajimari!"

219
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,880
Momoterela, I've never heard of it.

220
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,840
Me neither.

221
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,200
Once upon a time, there lived an old man and an old woman.

222
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,880
What's with this face? It's all about makeup.

223
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,840
Why am I an old woman?

224
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
I'm an old woman, after all.

225
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,780
Hey, don't say that!

226
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,780
One day, the old man was on his way to the mountains.

227
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,980
The old woman went to the river to wash.

228
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,540
While the old woman was washing in the river,

229
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,420
a huge peach came down, and...

230
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,500
"Donbraco, donbraco," right?

231
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,140
Ouch!

232
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,680
It came down from the sky.

233
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,200
That can't be true!

234
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,140
Ouch!

235
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:04,980
Ouch!

236
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,400
Ouch!

237
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,060
There were also four.

238
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,660
That sounds like a peach.

239
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,860
But weren't there only one peach?

240
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,040
She said, "Momoterela," so there were four!

241
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,800
So the old woman brought her the peach to her home.

242
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,760
Then the old man...

243
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,720
Oh, this is a beautiful peach.

244
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,360
Let's cut it and eat!

245
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,940
Grandpa?

246
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,380
An unbelievable scene happened,

247
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,120
Suddenly, the heartless old man...

248
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,900
...sneezed.

249
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,860
That's all I have to do.

250
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,600
Old man! Come back!

251
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,120
The old woman ran away with four babies.

252
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,780
But she couldn't help raising the babies.

253
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,360
The old woman gave birth to her own breasts and gave them to the babies.

254
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,440
You can't do that in front of people.

255
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,140
Excuse me.

256
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,200
The old woman had a lot of wrinkles, so her breasts didn't come out.

257
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,740
What are you talking about?

258
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Then you have to give her a name.

259
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,540
First of all, you're so cool, so you should be called DiCaprio.

260
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,720
That's a good name.

261
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,540
But you didn't give her a good name, so you gave birth to her breasts.

262
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,720
That's all.

263
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:36,680
You gave birth to a baby boy, called Pteranodon.

264
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,580
His names are Momotarou, Momojiro, Momoe, and Momoko.

265
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,080
The little boys grew up quickly, and Momotarou became a childlike boy.

266
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,060
"H jap, jap!"

267
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,740
Momoko grew into a beautiful daughter of a working man.

268
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,880
Momojiro became a mathman.

269
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,880
They all left the house.

270
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,780
Uwaaaah!

271
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,800
Uwaaaah!

272
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,440
Uwaaaah!

273
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,020
I'm home.

274
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,840
Big news! Big news!

275
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,660
What's wrong, Momoe?

276
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,860
Tonight, a swimming competition for women will be held at the castle, led by the prince.

277
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:15,940
What?

278
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,620
If the prince sees me there, I might become a bride.

279
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,180
Oh!

280
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,380
Prince, you're not talking about Japan, are you?

281
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,460
In this age of globalization, there's no such thing as just Japan.

282
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,520
It's global.

283
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,100
Oh, this is...

284
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,980
Huh? Grandma, why did you suddenly turn young?

285
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,580
I'm a beautiful girl who's in fashion now.

286
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,880
Eh? And why doesn't Momoko have a swimsuit?

287
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,900
I'm poor, so I could only buy two swimsuits.

288
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,520
It's because you're beautiful, isn't it?

289
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,260
Actually, Grandma...

290
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,780
I was jealous of the beautiful Momoko, and I bullied her.

291
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,820
She's such a bad girl.

292
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,380
It's your script, isn't it?

293
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Anyway, I'm going to catch the prince's heart with this nice body.

294
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,600
Yeah!

295
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,400
Hey, what's wrong with Momotaro?

296
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,120
Ah, Momotaro...

297
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,100
Momotaro was taken by a turtle who saved him, and he went to the Ryubu Castle to get a leave of absence.

298
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,280
Long ago, long ago, Momotaro...

299
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,120
A turtle came to help a turtle...

300
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,480
That's Ureshima Taro, isn't it?

301
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,560
That's Momotaro, so it's fine.

302
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,980
Oh no, it's my turn...

303
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,940
Oh, it's a pity that I'm the only one who's free...

304
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,360
Hey, hey, you poor girl.

305
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,740
Ah, you...

306
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,860
What are you doing?

307
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,060
Entering the lower position on your own!

308
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,160
By the way, what are you?

309
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,340
Don't suddenly put in the ad-lib.

310
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,180
Huh? I'm a street-walking lover.

311
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,920
Momoko, do you want to join the swimming competition with girls?

312
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,920
Yes!

313
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,040
Then I will grant your wish.

314
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,020
"Mahariku Maharita"

315
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,840
A pumpkin will become a horse and a mouse will become a mouse.

316
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,460
One, two, three!

317
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,740
"Mahariku Maharita"

318
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,700
I want to be a glass bikini.

319
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,620
One, two, three!

320
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,780
Wow!

321
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,620
Thank you! Thank you!

322
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,320
Momoko, you must return at 12 o'clock.

323
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,360
I understand.

324
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,760
The magic will dissolve and return to the original "Boro".

325
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,820
No, the glass bikini will become transparent.

326
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,320
Stop it!

327
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,720
I'm kidding.

328
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,540
You see, it's a problem if you don't make it in time for the last train.

329
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,880
Momoko entered the castle to find the prince.

330
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,200
I'm the prince of this country,

331
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,840
looking for a bride.

332
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,580
So I gathered a young girl

333
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,940
and decided to open a swimming competition full of girls.

334
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,180
"Ushiyoshi Ushiyoshi Ushiyoshi!"

335
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,620
I don't want to play this kind of role.

336
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,220
Ouch!

337
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,440
Hey, "derai"

338
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,060
I played your best role.

339
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,480
Do it properly!

340
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,280
I got it!

341
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,160
"Uchiyoshi Ushiyoshi Ushiyoshi Ushiyoshi!"

342
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,620
Aikiba, let's start!

343
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,580
This is good!

344
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,700
Who should I choose?

345
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,760
That girl!

346
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,920
Marry me!

347
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,360
Come on, come on, you're a man!

348
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,000
You're a man, not a man!

349
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:55,740
What?

350
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,120
Momoko is going to go home at midnight

351
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,300
and she's going to drop the glass bra.

352
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,540
She'll look for a girl who suits her

353
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
and finally find Momoko.

354
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,140
Is that right?

355
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,400
I don't like this!

356
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
We can't just drop the bra!

357
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,700
That's right!

358
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,680
And we're so jealous of her

359
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,660
that we're going to be demons

360
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,960
and take her home.

361
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,120
Why are we the ones

362
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,780
who have to hold the swimming competition

363
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,920
when there are so many women?

364
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,400
Hey, hey, hey, wait!

365
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,640
Let's go home!

366
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,900
Let's go home!

367
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,720
It's starting to get really crazy.

368
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,680
By the way, what's wrong with Momotaro?

369
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,260
Nakagawa! Terai!

370
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,960
I'm counting on you!

371
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,340
♪ Momotaro from long ago ♪

372
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,160
♪ I'm the best Momotaro in Japan ♪

373
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,520
♪ I came back from Ryugu Castle ♪

374
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:03,620
♪ I'm the best Momotaro ♪

375
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,620
All right!

376
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,460
Kennon!

377
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,300
I sandwiches!

378
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,680
Momotaro!

379
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:14,840
Momotaro!

380
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:14,920
Momotaro!

381
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,040
Momotaro!

382
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,360
Momotaro!

383
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,440
Momotaro!

384
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,620
Momotaro!

385
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,420
Momotaro!

386
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:17,620
Momotaro!

387
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,240
Momotaro!

388
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,100
Momotaro!

389
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,320
Momotaro!

390
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,540
I'm sorry for being so cool, but it's hard to continue this play.

391
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,200
It's finally my turn.

392
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,200
Help me!

393
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,780
I won't let you run away!

394
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,260
It's finally a battle!

395
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,560
This year's play is unexpected and interesting!

396
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,760
What?

397
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,660
Maybe everyone...

398
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,460
Is everyone enjoying this play?

399
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:49,920
Is everyone enjoying this play?

400
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,420
What's with this music?

401
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,080
Oh no!

402
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,900
I might have called Captain Bakuryuu with a real radio with this equipment!

403
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,540
Target found!

404
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,400
Prepare to launch the missile!

405
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,700
Stop!

406
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,080
Fire!

407
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,800
The End

408
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,220
This year's play is impressive!

409
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,100
Amazing!

410
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,900
Another Orio 2!

411
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,540
You did it on purpose!

412
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,300
Orio 2!

413
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,500
What are you doing?

414
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,100
What are you doing?

415
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,940
This year's play is really fun!

416
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,780
It's fun!

417
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,500
End!

418
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:48,740
End!

419
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,360
Go on!

420
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,140
Next!

421
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,640
End!

422
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,680
End!

423
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,400
End!

424
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,480
The End

425
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,300
I'm telling you the facts!

426
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,480
Everything I know!

427
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,060
Everything I know!

428
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,960
What's wrong, senpai?

429
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,940
I'm all wet.

430
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,920
The brakes are broken.

431
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,520
The brakes are broken.

432
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,340
The bike broke into one part.

433
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,540
You should change your clothes.

434
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,020
I'm all wet.

435
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,080
I'm sorry!

436
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,800
Wait a minute.

437
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,580
I'm counting on you.

438
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,140
Even if something happens, we can't go out.

439
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,700
We can't just wear the equipment naked.

440
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,860
What? A monk? Are you copying?

441
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,040
That's right.

442
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,240
You don't need a copy machine or fax to go to the temple, do you?

443
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,600
If you have such extra money, you can pay it back.

444
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,820
Even if you tell me, you should tell the chief.

445
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,780
A massage machine is more useful.

446
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,900
I was surprised.

447
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,200
I was copied.

448
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,960
What a disgusting composition.

449
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,720
But this is interesting.

450
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,200
Let's try a lot of things.

451
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,680
Ryu, let me iron it.

452
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Oh, no!

453
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,980
What are you doing?

454
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,560
No, it's a misunderstanding.

455
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,680
It's a little experiment.

456
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,440
I don't know.

457
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
I'm in trouble.

458
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,680
I'm in trouble.

459
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:14,800
I'm in trouble.

460
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,020
I was treated as a pervert.

461
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,180
Of course.

462
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,020
But what are you doing?

463
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,340
I just played.

464
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,000
I found an interesting game.

465
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,540
Use the chief's photo.

466
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,600
Expand this and match it with the copy I just copied.

467
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,960
The chief's full picture is completed.

468
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,740
Isn't it interesting?

469
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,920
That's too much, senior.

470
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,740
That chief...

471
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,100
The chief is here?

472
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,440
I have a phone call.

473
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,960
It's in the book.

474
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,860
Don't scare me!

475
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,880
It's the manuscript I forgot yesterday.

476
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,820
Please send it to the library immediately.

477
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,120
But it's become a convenient era.

478
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,760
Mr. Ohara's essays in the library

479
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,200
are very popular.

480
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,560
I also put in effort to write.

481
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,460
Is the director's manuscript

482
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,280
in the copy machine?

483
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,980
I think so.

484
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,620
Director's manuscript?

485
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,420
It's an essay I wrote on the theme of

486
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,540
Japanese art.

487
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,340
I can't believe it!

488
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,000
What's the copy paper

489
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,200
there?

490
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,180
It's the director's manuscript.

491
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,100
Move!

492
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,060
As I thought.

493
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,940
No. If I send something like this!

494
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,900
It will be in the book.

495
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,220
I will get it!

496
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,880
It's the power.

497
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,320
I can't send it.

498
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,040
It seems that the copy

499
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,600
has already been sent.

500
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,320
Idiot!

501
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,360
I didn't notice because the cover was on the back.

502
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,020
I tried to explore this work a little.

503
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,820
The manuscript has arrived.

504
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,400
That's good.

505
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,520
I've been sent pictures one after another.

506
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,140
Will this be posted?

507
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,500
Yaaay!

508
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,960
ah

509
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,980
the summer of this year has arrived

510
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,800
it has come it has come

511
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,520
it has come it has come

512
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,420
the summer of this year has arrived

513
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,640
it has come it has come

514
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,180
it has come it has come

515
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,020
my voice keeps on singing

516
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,520
in the southern wind

517
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,440
I praise my large chest

518
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,360
like the father's piece

519
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,660
at this height

520
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,200
ah

521
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,720
the summer of this year has arrived

522
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,840

What? Dera is a healing type?

550
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,900
Plus, it has a healing ability 30 times greater than a dolphin!

551
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,920
This is it! It's truly a healing type.

552
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,560
You can't use this guy.

553
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:40,880
I don't have a choice.

554
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,380
Alright, I'll take care of it.

555
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,040
Next time, "Take care of it and get rich!"

556
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:46,720
Please watch!

558
