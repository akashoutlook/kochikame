1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
Hina-kun is Winnie the Pooh!

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,480
Do you have any tricks?

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,260
If you're watching TV,

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,120
light up the room first and stay away from it.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,600
Hina-kun is Winnie the Pooh!

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,200
This is the end of the rain that someone is calling,

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,660
I walked while looking back at the rain that seemed to stop

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
"Mom, please help me!"

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,340
I felt a strange feeling at that time

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,620
So I tried to walk only in the dark part of the Ake-do-gai

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:56,080
I tried to walk only in the dark part of the Ake-do-gai

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,860
Everyone was a child once, but they all forget

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:08,820
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above their eyes

14
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,140
Turn around and look at that corner

15
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,600
Everyone is a political scientist

16
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,020
You can meet everyone

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,560
There's a wall over there

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,360
There must be a ordeal

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,540
Everyone, come to our town

20
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,560
"Thank you!"

21
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,880
"Chis!"

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,320
"One!"

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,400
"Stop!"

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,600
"One!"

25
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:46,820
Japan!

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,580
Japan!

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,580
Japan!

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,960
Japan!

29
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,220
We did it!

30
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,400
The team that will leave the Kameari Park

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
will be appointed as the representative of the Katsushika City!

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,540
We did it!

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:03,940
We did it!

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,720
Let's go!

35
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,880
Let's go!

36
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:08,320
Let's go!

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,120
Let's go!

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,720
The Kameari Park's Exhibition Room.

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,060
Yaaah!

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,720
Shoo!

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,380
Shoo!

42
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,900
My "Suzume Gaishi" has no enemies.

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,920
Ouch!

44
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,080
Ouch!

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,680
Damn it!

46
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,320
I won't let this grudge go to waste!

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,220
"Miteore Kameari Park's Exhibition Room"!

48
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,300
Kendo in one shot!

49
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,020
Kendo in one shot!

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,080
Ouch!

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,360
Ouch!

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,680
That's cheating, Yama-san!

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,320
My sword is for practice!

54
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,940
Prepare yourself!

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,380
You idiot!

56
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,500
Ouch!

57
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,560
Chief, what are you doing?

58
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,380
It's a cowardly attack.

59
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,020
Which one is cowardly?

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,780
There is no such thing as a crazy Kendo

61
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,340
aiming for the shin!

62
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,700
Because if you fight seriously,

63
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,440
it's a great deal.

64
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,840
But if you just want to win,

65
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,520
you can't do anything about it.

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,600
Come on, Ryotsu.

67
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,020
I'll beat you up.

68
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,440
Look!

69
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,580
Chief Ohara and Ryotsu are going to fight!

70
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,640
As expected of Ryotsu,

71
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,280
he can't beat Chief Ohara.

72
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,000
Come at me, no matter where you're from.

73
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,040
Okay!

74
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,400
I'll do it!

75
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,580
Oho?

76
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,360
I'll do it!

77
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,620
Damn it!

78
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,920
I don't have a chance!

79
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,380
Oh!

80
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:53,900
Chiyoko Shimakura!

81
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,500
Now!

82
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,560
You fool!

83
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,780
I'll beat you!

84
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,820
Listen, Ryotsu.

85
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,620
It's a battle against yourself and Kendo.

86
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,540
If you have a sense of balance.

87
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,660
There's no way you're going to lose to a wicked sword like you!

88
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,000
As expected of Chief Ohara!

89
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,860
He's amazing!

90
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,100
He's so convincing!

91
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,840
He's got a lot of power

92
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,860
Chief Ohara's sword is the best in Katsushika

93
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,980
Ohara-kun, you're doing great

94
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,300
Please do well in the main event

95
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll do my best

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,300
If I can get V2 last year

97
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,500
I'll be a great leader among the chiefs

98
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,180
Ha ha ha ha

99
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,800
Damn, Chief

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:37,960
Chief

101
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,860
If I wear this and do this

102
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,120
Oh, I did it! I found my weakness!

103
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,400
What are you doing, senpai?

104
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,160
Another new game?

105
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,760
You're not getting tired of it, are you?

106
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,120
No, this is a simulation of Kendo

107
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,480
Oh, this is...

108
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,120
I got it! It's to beat the rival Shibamata Shou

109
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,360
Good

110
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,420
What?

111
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,680
To beat the chief!

112
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,960
To beat the chief?

113
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,460
That's right

114
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,120
I've input all the moves of the chief in the previous match

115
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,980
Now I know all of the chief's movements

116
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,960
Got it?

117
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,440
This is the chief

118
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,480
And this is me

119
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,540
For example, if I go in from the front

120
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,820
Then, in the case of the chief

121
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,600
I'll avoid the left with 80% probability

122
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,380
I'll aim for the right side without a break

123
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,340
Senpai's face is a mess

124
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,520
But, at this time, the chief's counterattack is only a two-way pattern of Kote or Do

125
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,340
There's no face at all

126
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,080
Oh

127
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,740
So, if I step in like this and do Do

128
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,800
One!

129
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,920
Oh

130
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,120
Here you go, I win

131
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,040
That's right

132
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,980
You studied it well, Ryo-san

133
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,940
But, if I beat the same team's chief, it can't be helped

134
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,640
You don't understand it at all!

135
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:05,760
It's true

136
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,720
You're being arrogant

137
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,560
Look at this, chief

138
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,380
It's me!

139
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,040
I'm sorry

140
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,320
I'm sorry

141
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,740
I'm sorry

142
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,460
I'm sorry

143
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,020
I'm sorry

144
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,220
I'm sorry

145
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm sorry

146
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,540
I'm sorry

147
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,580
I'm sorry

148
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,740
I'm sorry

149
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,320
I'm sorry

150
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,560
I'm sorry

151
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,520
Then, I'll go now, chief

152
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,940
I won't lose to a sword that has a distorted heart like you!

153
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,240
You're looking at me.

154
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,540
Watch me.

155
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,620
It's just like the simulation!

156
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,380
It's a fish!

157
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,500
One!

158
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,820
Yes!

159
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,660
The chief lost.

160
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,060
No way!

161
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,760
It's Ryo-san's one-on-one victory.

162
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,120
I lost.

163
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,100
I'm sorry for the sword that has a distorted heart.

164
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,260
My sword is in Ryo's hands.

165
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,000
You're still not trained enough, chief.

166
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,140
There's more to it.

167
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,100
What was your training like?

168
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,760
Um, chief...

169
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,140
Senpai used a computer to see the chief's position.

170
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:32,860
He analyzed it.

171
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,300
What did he say?

172
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,060
The chief is so stubborn that he can only make certain moves.

173
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,760
This is also a great strategy.

174
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:40,940
Eh?

175
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,940
I lost anyway.

176
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,680
I wasn't trained enough.

177
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,840
I'll start over.

178
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,840
Excuse me.

179
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,680
Oh, Ohara-kun.

180
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,980
Ohara-kun.

181
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,220
Will you come to the next sword competition?

182
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,600
Without you...

183
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,400
What?

184
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,360
What?

185
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,140
I'll be fine if I'm here.

186
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,640
I'll be sure to win the V2 next year.

187
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,020
However, Shibamata-sho, who lost last year, prepared a secret weapon this year.

188
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,720
A secret weapon?

189
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,440
Rumor has it that Kojiro Sasaki will participate in it.

190
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,080
Eh? Kojiro Sasaki?

191
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,580
Do you know him, Kei-chan?

192
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,940
Yes, he's famous.

193
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,660
Nakagawa-an.

194
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,080
Is he that strong?

195
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,260
Speaking of Kojiro Sasaki,

196
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,780
he's a genius who won the national tournament and high school university,

197
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,920
and he's also a professional swordsman.

198
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,300
He's also a swordsman who uses a skill called hiken suzumegaeshi.

199
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,360
Suzumegaeshi?

200
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,500
Not Tsubamegaeshi?

201
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,060
Yes, it's a terrible skill.

202
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,280
By the way, look at his face.

203
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,060
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

204
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,460
I'm Kojiro Sasaki.

205
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,160
What?

206
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,260
Ha, ha, ha, ha, hamburger.

207
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,160
I'm not surprised. He's a good man.

208
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,180
So this is Kojiro Sasaki.

209
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,620
He's a strange man.

210
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,400
Don't stand behind me!

211
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,700
Chief Shimamata.

212
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,600
You've been behind me since a while ago.

213
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,160
Hello, Chief Tonda.

214
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,100
Did you see that? This man is Chief Shimamata's secret soldier.

215
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,660
A hedgehog.

216
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,780
He's strange.

217
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,560
But why does he have to be with Chief Shimamata?

218
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,760
I mean, he was scouted by me.

219
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,280
What? How dirty!

220
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,020
This year, Chief Shimamata will be the champion.

221
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,460
And Gan is...

222
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,700
He's definitely strange.

223
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,040
Don't stand behind me!

224
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,760
Chief Shimamata

225
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:56,780
What was that?

226
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,440
Nobody was there.

227
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,640
You!

228
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,840
You tried to shoot me from behind, didn't you?

229
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,660
No, it's not...

230
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,560
No, you didn't!

231
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,460
Right?

232
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,380
Right?

233
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,200
Yes.

234
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,740
You're lucky.

235
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,680
If you had been 3.5 mm away, you wouldn't have been alive.

236
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,140
Hey!

237
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,060
You're too strong!

238
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,360
What did you just say?

239
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,860
I'm forcing you to do it.

240
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,260
Ryo.

241
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,740
I see.

242
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,560
You really want to see my hedgehog.

243
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,400
I didn't say that!

244
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,020
But if you saw it, you'd die.

245
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,180
Is that okay?

246
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,260
I can't help it.

247
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,880
Just once.

248
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,500
Don't talk to me without permission!

249
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,660
Yes!

250
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,320
Jack! Hedgehog!

251
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,200
Hedgehog!

252
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,380
Go to hell!

253
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,440
Hurry!

254
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,440
Go to hell!

255
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,300
I had another reckless fight.

256
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,660
Hey!

257
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
You were aiming for that fly, weren't you?

258
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,400
You!

259
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,840
You really made me angry.

260
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,220
But you didn't scratch the fly.

261
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,380
And you said you were a bad dog.

262
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,220
I was born in Hiroshima.

263
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,760
Bad dog!

264
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,200
Don't be phony!

265
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,780
Calm down!

266
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,020
I had a grandfather's death.

267
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,120
He was afraid of killed.

268
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,160
It's you.

269
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,860
절대

270
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,180
You're so tough.

271
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,040
Of course.

272
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,400
What?

273
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,260
Who are you digits?

274
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,660
Mark!

275
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,500
I'm Mark, the black cat.

276
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,420
And I'm the black cat.

277
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,160
I'm the black cat.

278
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,560
Hello Max!

279
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,740
Hi Abs!

280
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,160
There's nothing to see here.

281
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,740
Nobody there?

282
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,700
Listen, the place of the duel is Ganryu Island.

283
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,560
Ganryu Island?

284
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,100
That place where Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirou had a duel.

285
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,460
It's far away, so it's 30 minutes by train from here.

286
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,380
Ganryu Mountain.

287
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,540
It's 9:00 a.m.

288
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,800
Alright, goodbye.

289
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,120
Hey, don't decide on your own.

290
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,560
Well, I'll think about it when it comes to the winning greeting.

291
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,800
It's Nishinotatsu!

292
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,460
I told you it's me!

293
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,880
A half-boiled egg.

294
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,980
I don't get it.

295
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,080
I can see that you're stupid.

296
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,640
If this happens, we'll win against the Shibabata Shogunate.

297
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,020
If we win, we'll get a special bonus.

298
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,160
Really, Shoujo?

299
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,940
I'm counting on you, Ryo-tsu.

300
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,900
Everyone, leave it to me.

301
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,240
I'll definitely beat the Shibabata Shogunate and win.

302
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,460
But what are we going to do about the duel?

303
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,960
That's right, Ryo-chan.

304
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,120
What?

305
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,360
I don't care.

306
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,500
I have a plan.

307
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,160
Hmm.

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,140
I've been to Ganryu Mountain so early in the day.

313
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:09,980
I'm not a stranger.

314
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,900
I can't be your leader.

315
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,660
I'm sure I'll win the first major sword competition.

316
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,920
In order to win the first major sword competition,

317
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,340
I'll use this tree and keep it here.

318
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,680
This is my plan.

319
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,640
Look, Sasaki Kojiro.

320
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,220
Hehehe.

Too late! Too late!

345
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,620
Hey!

346
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,100
Sorry, sorry. I overslept.

347
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,120
Musashi! No, Ryotsu! I was waiting for you!

348
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,580
I'm...

349
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:29,600
Wait!

350
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,360
Don't do that!

351
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,340
Kojiro, you're gonna lose.

352
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,180
What?

353
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,260
What's this?

354
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,020
It's the trap I set up yesterday.

355
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,100
I got into it.

356
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,520
How cowardly!

357
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,080
You're so cowardly today.

358
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,840
It's over!

359
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,000
What?

360
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,660
Why did you drop it here?

361
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,060
Tomugi, I set it up too.

362
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,300
You're so cowardly!

363
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,260
There are no rules in the martial arts.

364
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,360
You have to be prepared.

365
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,620
Let's go!

366
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,100
What?

367
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,740
What?

368
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,300
What should we do?

369
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,340
What the heck?

370
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,660
You're the one!

371
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,040
You bastard!

372
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,800
This is...

373
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,840
This is...

374
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:28,880
Damn it!

375
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,740
Char Siu...

376
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,860
Melon!

377
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,520
Damn it!

378
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,620
Damn it!

379
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,080
Damn it!

380
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,180
Damn it!

381
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,940
Damn it!

382
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,060
Damn it!

383
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,900
Damn it!

384
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,500
Damn it!

385
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,600
Damn it! Damn it!

386
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,460
Point!

387
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,600
Goal!

388
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,980
One point!

389
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:53,900
How about that?

390
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,160
Huh?

391
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,080
You were playing Legas, so it's okay.

392
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,100
Are you a professional baseball catcher?

393
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,760
This is also a game of the law!

394
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,780
Kannonmen!

395
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,720
Handa Goten!

396
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,800
Doremi Asora!

397
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,340
Wait! Wait! Wait!

398
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,320
Tanma!

399
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,760
Tanma is the first!

400
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,060
Oborozuki!

401
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,140
Tsuki!

402
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,700
Gomoku!

403
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,160
Soba!

404
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,640
Gomoku and Soba are different!

405
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm not particular about the game.

406
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,680
I'm not particular about the game either.

407
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,420
I'm not particular about the game.

408
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,260
I'm not particular about the game.

409
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:21,820
Hehe!

410
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,120
Oni-san, this way!

411
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,400
Damn! Wait!

412
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,600
You've come with me.

413
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,660
You're a heavy pot.

414
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,180
Idiot!

415
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,340
There are a lot of bombs in this forest!

416
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,040
I'll settle this at once!

417
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,580
Tㅋㅋㅋ

418
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,520
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

419
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,200
Kill me-soba!

420
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,800
Senpai, are you really okay?

421
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,120
What?

422
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,620
What?

423
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,220
But I thought he was going to do the same thing.

424
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,800
Well, he couldn't make it here with a much heavier shot.

425
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
Now, we'll have a competition against the police station.

426
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,260
Yes!

427
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,620
Everyone did a great job. It's finally the final round.

428
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,100
Leave it to me.

429
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,680
But the final round is that Shibamata-sho, isn't it?

430
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,080
Last year, I won because Chief Ohara was there.

431
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,480
I won because of that chief.

432
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,700
It's okay.

433
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,720
I'm counting on you.

434
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,620
Yes, sir. Don't forget the bonus.

435
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,740
I know.

436
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,720
Chief Ohara didn't come after all.

437
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,380
Yes.

438
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,440
We'll have the final round now.

439
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:07,500
The team to compete is the Shibamata-sho team, who won last time, and the Katsushika-sho team, who won last time.

440
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,880
Please come forward.

441
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:10,900
Yes, sir.

442
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
What's this?

443
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,860
Why? Everyone has the same face.

444
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,560
Kojiro has five people?

445
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,520
This is the trump card of the Shibamata-sho.

446
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,740
The Sasakki Six Brothers.

447
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,020
The eldest son, Koichiro Sasakki.

448
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,160
The third son, Kosaburo Sasakki.

449
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,160
The fourth son, Koshiro Sasakki.

450
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,380
The fifth son, Kogoro Sasakki.

451
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
The sixth son, Korokoro Sasakki.

452
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,580
The fifth son, Harumageddon.

453
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,220
And the second son, Kojiro Sasakki.

454
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,460
That's all for the Sasakki Six Brothers.

455
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,440
Is he a Muttsugo?

456
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,760
Are you guys a bunch of morons?

457
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,980
What are we going to do, Ryo?

458
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,000
I can't believe we have six fools like him.

459
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,880
But we have no choice but to do it.

460
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,460
That's right. We have to do it no matter what.

461
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,720
One.

462
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
I'm sure you'll be fine.

463
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,660
Leave it to me.

464
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,100
If I win, I'll get double the bonus.

465
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,620
Double?

466
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,440
Because I have to do my best as the head of the O-Hara club.

467
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,740
Okay, I got it. I'll do it.

468
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,540
You have to do it.

469
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,920
Okay, double, double.

470
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,460
Hajime!

471
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,260
One.

472
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,840
Ryo-tsu is the captain.

473
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,100
Amazing! Ryo-chan!

474
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,740
My power is amazing when the wind blows.

475
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,880
I'm so happy!

476
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,880
Hey, don't copy my jokes!

477
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Hey, Kokoro, do it quickly!

478
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,500
Good job, Ryo-san!

479
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,320
Ryo-chan!

480
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,580
Senior!

481
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:07,080
Amazing, Ryo-chan!

482
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,000
Four of us are out!

483
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,800
There's only one left, Senior!

484
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,480
Even so, I'm a little tired.

485
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,980
But there's only one left.

486
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
One more and I'll get a special bonus.

487
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,080
Damn it!

488
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,720
Please, big brother!

489
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,440
Leave it to me.

490
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,940
Oh, it's a double-dealer.

491
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,140
This guy...

492
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,360
He seems to be pretty tired.

493
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,680
Fuse Akira, the brother's revenge!

494
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,540
Hajime!

495
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,520
Prepare yourself!

496
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,780
Double-dealer!

497
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,760
Double-dealer!

498
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

499
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,380
Ah!

500
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:45,560
Ah!

501
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:45,940
Ah!

502
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,120
My arm...

503
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:48,880
There!

504
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,820
My arm...!

505
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,580
Ah!

506
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,680
Ryo-san!

507
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,160
Ryo-san!

508
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:55,840
Ryo-san!

509
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:55,980
Senior!

510
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:56,780
Ah!

511
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,940
Hahahaha!

512
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,080
Hush beef!

513
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,600
You did it, big brother!

514
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,140
Damn it!

515
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,240
The bonus is...

516
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,360
Next, the general, Maie!

517
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:06,940
Huh?

518
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,400
Ah...

519
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,260
I'm sure Chief Ohara went somewhere.

520
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,200
That means...

521
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,640
The prize is ours.

522
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,100
Hahahaha!

523
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,120
Wait!

524
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,240
I'm the general of the Katsushika team!

525
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,100
Ah!

526
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,840
Chief!

527
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,660
Chief!

528
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,880
Ohara-kun!

529
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,380
Chief Ohara!

530
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,280
Chief, you're on the same side as me!

531
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,460
We're now on a different side!

532
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,840
I'm so happy!

533
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:57,240
Ohara-kun, I'm sorry!

534
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,140
I'm sorry!

535
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,020
We're done for!

536
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,320
Chief!

537
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:01,940
Chief!

538
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,080
Chief!

539
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,040
He's the best in both defense and attack.

540
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,580
Looks like there's no room for a needle to pull.

541
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,180
He must have been practicing.

542
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,900
The reports say that he improved.

543
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,560
What's up?

544
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,080
Gyo, finish him off!

545
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,080
Double Suzu-me Daishi!

546
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,680
A chest!

547
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,200
Digan! Same pattern!

548
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,840
He'll be done for!

549
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,260
- стал! - Construction!

550
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,440
I got you!

551
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,460
I got you!

552
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,320
One!

553
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,080
I did it!

554
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,600
The winner is the team that won before the Kamihari Park,

555
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,160
I did it!

556
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,900
I did it!

557
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,500
Our winner!

558
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,440
Chakashi!

559
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,660
Everyone, you did well for me.

560
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,260
What are you saying?

561
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,460
The chief has successfully overcome his weakness.

562
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,820
Yeah, you did well by getting injured.

563
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,980
No, it's all thanks to the chief that we won.

564
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,980
Ohara-kun, you did well.

565
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,520
You are the pride of the Katoshika-shou.

566
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,620
Now, it's a special bonus.

567
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,920
Bonus?

568
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,920
No, Chief.

569
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,220
I didn't do it for that.

570
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,420
I did it for you.

571
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:30,580
Chief,

572
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,080
I'll give you the bonus.

573
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,580
You can't do it.

574
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,400
You lost.

575
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
And you said that it's all thanks to the chief.

576
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,700
No way!

577
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,120
Chief, that's wrong.

578
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,740
It's all thanks to me that the chief has overcome his weakness.

579
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,340
I did my best until I got injured.

580
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,200
The chief said he doesn't need it,

581
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,000
so give me the bonus.

582
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,120
Chief, you did well!

583
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:08,500
Let's carry on.

584
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,800
You are the chief!

585
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,820
Ohara-kun, the chief is still hungry.

586
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,580
You must have eaten a lot of the food that I had taken 0:01:44.000,0:02:40.000 You must have eaten a lot of the food that I had taken 0:02:41.000,0:02:42.000 So you will still eat!
