I bought from your company.

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,820
There are other companies.

33
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,740
Let's wait 15 seconds.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,960
Okay.

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,600
I'll sell it at the price you offer.

36
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,140
Thank you.

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,760
I'll send you the details from Nakagawa Secure.

00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,960
I'll send you the details from Nakagawa Secure.

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,620
See you.

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,180
President, you look tired.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,240
You should take a break.

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,620
We have 7 minutes until the end of the day.

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,240
Yes.

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,440
What's the next schedule?

45
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,920
We meet with Mikimatsu Nakagawa in 2 minutes.

46
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,880
After that,

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,740
you will get some sleep for 5 minutes.

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,940
Ah, the old man in Hawaii?

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,680
Yes.

50
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,620
After the storm, we will talk on the phone with the French president.

51
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,680
After arriving at Heathrow Airport,

52
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,540
we will have a lunch with the members of the English Chamber of Commerce.

53
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,720
we will have a lunch with the members of the English Chamber of Commerce.

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,360
After that,

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,580
we will meet with Mikimatsu.

56
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,760
But this is the upper part of the Atlantic Ocean.

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,640
But this is the upper part of the Atlantic Ocean.

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,920
Hello!

59
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:54,520
Hello!

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,280
Hey!

61
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:58,860
Hey!

62
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,100
Hey, Ryuuichiro!

63
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,400
Hey, Ryuuichiro!

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,860
Oh.

65
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,060
Mikimatsu-sama, we apologize.

66
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,440
I'll come back now.

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,400
No, it's fine.

68
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,060
5 years ago, when I promised to give you a date,

69
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,460
I was going to show her off.

70
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,380
But she dumped me.

71
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,400
So I don't have anything special.

72
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,220
I haven't seen her in a long time.

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,640
I'm satisfied with just seeing your face.

74
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,180
You can go to sleep now.

75
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,580
Yes, thank you very much.

76
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,280
See you again, Yuichiro!

77
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,340
No! I slept so much!

78
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,740
Where is Mr. Mijimatsu?

79
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,100
He went home 2 minutes ago.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,040
What?!

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,440
I can work 72 hours a day, but I can't believe I made such a mistake!

82
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,920
Nakagawa Family's Home Corruption

83
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,860
Nakagawa Family's Home Corruption

84
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,480
Nakagawa Family's Home Corruption

85
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,440
What?! You're going to quit being a police officer?!

86
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,560
What's the meaning of this, Nakagawa?!

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,280
My father suddenly said he was retiring as president of the Nakagawa Group,

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,740
so I was appointed as his successor.

89
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,200
Why does that father who loves work more than the meals he eats at the restaurant?

90
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,220
My father, who used to say, "I can work 72 hours a day,"

91
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,420
has been working for 71 hours a day.

92
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,240
I slept for 55 minutes.

93
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,400
My father, who is strict with others, decided to retire because he had to be strict with himself.

94
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,640
What?!

95
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,560
Only 5 minutes?!

96
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,460
Nakagawa, so you're really going to quit being a police officer?!

97
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,160
Yes. I thought I had to follow my father's footsteps one day,

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
but I didn't know it was so soon.

99
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,940
I still have a lot of things to do as a police officer, so I'm very confused.

100
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,300
Nakagawa!

101
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,120
What are you talking about?!

102
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,840
Is there anyone who would refuse to be the president of the Nakagawa Group,

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,140
which has a net profit of over 100 trillion yen?!

104
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,500
Ryo-chan, do you want me to quit being a police officer?

105
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,000
No! I don't want you to quit, either.

106
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,200
But as a distant relative,

107
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,140
I've always thought that Nakagawa is the right successor to the Nakagawa Group.

108
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,880
When did you become a Nakagawa relative?

109
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,720
I don't like it, Bucchan.

110
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,240
This is how I and Nakagawa are related.

111
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:18,880
Huh?!

112
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,640
My younger brother Kinjiro's wife's mother's father's younger brother's husband

113
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,620
is the son of Nakagawa's uncle's younger brother's daughter.

114
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,100
I-I don't get it...

115
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,640
Anyway!

116
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,980
I believe that Nakagawa is the only man who can become the leader of the Nakagawa Group

117
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,300
and rebuild the world economy!

118
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,160
Sen-Senpai!

119
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,780
Did you buy me that much?!

120
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,740
Of course!

121
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,080
I'm going to do anything to make you the president!

122
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,940
That's right! From today onwards, I'll be your secretary!

123
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,280
Senpai!

124
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,200
Nakagawa!

125
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,620
Say something!

126
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,120
Ryo-chan, aren't you thinking of something weird again?

127
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
You're so rude!

128
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,760
I don't know if you're thinking of such a thing!

129
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,600
Look closely!

130
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,560
Ryo!

131
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,920
What are you going to do with the police job?

132
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,120
Of course, I'm going to quit.

133
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,560
Is that really okay?

134
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,480
Yes.

135
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Nakagawa, let's go!

136
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,700
Y-Yes!

137
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll become the vice president when I become the president of the Nakagawa Group!

138
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,580
Alright, Nakagawa, let's go! Are you ready?

139
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,360
Y-Yes!

140
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,260
Then, are you really not going to get your retirement back?

141
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,260
Yes.

142
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,160
I think you're the only one who can make the big Nakagawa Group.

143
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,240
Since you said you're going to quit,

144
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,800
I don't have anything to say to you.

145
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,340
But you're still young,

146
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,660
so there's no way you can do your job.

147
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,340
That's not true!

148
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,900
Oh, you're here.

149
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,760
Keiichi!

150
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,320
I'm sorry to bother you.

151
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,400
Hello.

152
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,980
Oh, it's Ryo-chan.

153
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,760
Who is this man?

154
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,860
He's Keiichi's superior.

155
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,920
No, I quit the police job.

156
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,440
Here you are.

157
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,460
Here you are.

158
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:12,920
Here you are.

159
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,440
Here you are.

160
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,820
I'm going to be the vice president of the Nakagawa Group.

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,100
What do you mean by vice president?

162
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,400
Keiichi hasn't been appointed as the president yet.

163
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,460
I'm going to tell you the truth.

164
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,300
The current president has appointed Nakagawa as his successor.

165
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,660
Then I'll ask you this.

166
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,620
Keiichi,

167
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,960
are you really going to be able to do your father's job?

168
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,040
Well...

169
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,180
I can!

170
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,040
Then,

171
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,680
try to be the president for 72 hours.

172
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,800
If you can do that,

173
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,040
I'll accept you as the president of the Nakagawa Group.

174
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,240
I understand.

175
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,580
Senpai,

176
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,760
72 hours is too much.

177
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,480
What are you going to do with your weakness?

178
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,220
I'll do something about it!

179
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,700
Keiichi,

180
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,780
you can do it.

181
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
I'm looking forward to it.

182
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,500
Y... Yes.

183
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,460
Wake up!

184
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,320
Nakagawa, wake up!

185
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,260
What time do you think it is?

186
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,040
Senpai?

187
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,800
Eh?

188
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,280
It's still before dawn.

189
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,640
Senpai, it's still 5:30!

190
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,180
Shut up!

191
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,400
Open it!

192
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,640
Senpai,

193
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm going to change my clothes.

194
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,980
Please wait a moment.

195
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,100
Oh, come on!

196
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,140
Change your clothes in the car!

197
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,720
No way!

198
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,240
Have a seat.

199
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,180
All right.

200
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,620
You have to wear this until you get to the airport.

201
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,420
What?

202
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,100
That much?

203
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,260
We've arrived in Washington.

204
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,920
We have a breakfast meeting with the president.

205
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,280
You're going to the White House?

206
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,500
That's right.

207
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,380
Excuse me.

208
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,100
What?

209
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,440
I just got a call.

210
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
The landing is delayed because of the confusion at Washington International Airport.

211
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,020
What?

212
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,440
I won't be able to attend the next meeting in Los Angeles.

213
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,240
Are you going to go with that hand?

214
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,620
I'll go with my own hands.

215
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,600
Senpai, let's not do this.

216
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,300
Don't you dare say that!

217
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,660
Hey!

218
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,700
You can do it!

219
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,820
Yes!

220
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,660
I'm drowning!

221
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,680
I have to go further!

222
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,800
Darn it!

223
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,140
I ended up in the water.

224
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,220
Senpai, are you alright?

225
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,680
Yeah, I'm fine.

226
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,540
Wait, don't shoot! Nakagawa, say something!

227
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:36,740
Y-Yes!

228
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,280
I'm Nakagawa Keiichi, and I'm going to be having breakfast with the President.

229
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,300
He's my secretary, and he's not suspicious.

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,920
Thank you. Thank you very much.

231
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,320
Mr. Ryuichiro's son, huh. I'm glad to meet you.

232
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,880
Me too. It's an honor to meet you.

233
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,260
President, I'd like to ask you about the water that's on the side of the Rocky National Park,

234
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,180
which the Nakagawa Group is going to be selling.

235
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,960
Oh, the water that's going to be selling as Rocky's delicious water.

236
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,340
Of course, yes!

237
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,020
Thank you very much.

238
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,120
Now then, let's go have breakfast.

239
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,040
Yes.

240
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,420
Wow, looks delicious!

241
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,000
Nakagawa, stop right there!

242
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,020
Look! You went over 10 minutes with that trouble just now.

243
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,140
No way! I haven't even had a bite yet!

244
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,060
You're a jerk!

245
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,340
If you're eating, you won't make it to the next meeting in Los Angeles!

246
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,260
Come on, let's go!

247
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,960
Well then, President, I'll be going now.

248
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,540
I-I'm sorry!

249
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,360
Oh, he's just like Ryuichiro, he's a super businessman!

250
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,600
Thank you. That was a very good deal.

251
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,500
Nakagawa, this way!

252
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,420
Oh, Senpai!

253
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,580
What's wrong? Are you going down the emergency exit?

254
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,400
No! The next meeting is at the building next door.

255
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,480
It's faster to go from here.

256
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,180
I left a rope here, so you can cross here.

257
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,400
Eh? You cross by rope?

258
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,920
You're a former police officer, you can do it.

259
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,240
It's so high!

260
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,220
It's faster to go down the elevator, after all.

261
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,860
If you're a bloodthirsty person, you can do it!

262
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,320
Yes!

263
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,440
You're a lifesaver.

264
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,460
Are you really going to do it?

265
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes!

266
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,300
Hey, you!

267
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:12,880
Ouch!

268
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,960
I wish I could've become a fireman!

269
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,780
Okay, this place went well too.

270
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,040
Now, the next meeting is in Japan.

271
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,300
Huh.

272
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,700
Oh no!

273
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,720
Nakagawa! Let's eat in 3 minutes!

274
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,180
Ugh, you killed me.

275
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,180
Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp.

276
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,020
Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp.

277
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,200
Ha!

278
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,440
I knew you were going to rush.

279
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,400
What's wrong, Nakagawa?

280
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:41,820
You haven't eaten!

281
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,460
I'm too hungry to eat.

282
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,180
The next meeting is in France.

283
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,220
You have to eat to strengthen your body.

284
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Senpai, enjoy your meal.

285
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,840
Well, I'm sorry.

286
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,820
What are you going to do about me?

287
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,420
Eat up!

288
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
"Merc..."

289
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,060
"Merci..."

290
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,480
"Merc..."

291
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,060
"Merc..." "Okay! The contract is done!"

292
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,500
"Merc..."

293
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,940
"Nagagawa! Sign it!"

294
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,580
"S-Sign it?"

295
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,500
"That's right! Sign it in the contract!"

296
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,900
"I'm sorry."

297
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,260
"Here, sign it."

298
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,480
"Oh... sign it..."

299
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,920
"That's right. Sign it there."

300
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,000
"Okay."

301
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,600
"Yes, that's okay."

302
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,980
"Send 1 million tons of sake."

303
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,140
"Go back to Hell. Next is China."

304
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,340
"Okay."

305
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,660
"Sign it."

306
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,480
"Okay, the contract is done! Next is Kenya."

307
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,520
"Are we still going?"

308
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,640
"Of course! What are we going to do with this much money?"

309
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,500
"We can't be the leader of the Nagagawa Group!"

310
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,040
"S-Senpai, we're done."

311
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,820
"Okay, get on the helicopter first."

312
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,500
"Nagagawa! Go back to headquarters and report the progress."

313
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,520
"Okay."

314
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,040
"Hey, Nagagawa! Don't sleep!"

315
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,680
"Y-Yes, sir."

316
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,000
"Be strong! It's only been 50 hours!"

317
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,720
"We're here, Nagagawa."

318
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,580
"Sleep in the conference room. I'll take you there."

319
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,380
"That's it."

320
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,540
"It seems that Keiichi-kun still can't do it."

321
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,040
"If this continues, we'll have to gather the top members of the Nagagawa Group and decide who will be the successor."

322
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,460
"Yes."

323
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,400
"The meeting place is in Tokyo."

324
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,020
"Some of you will be the candidates."

325
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,720
"Let's list the candidates."

326
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,020
"Hey, wait!"

327
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,320
"Don't give up just because you failed once!"

328
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,280
"Give Nagagawa another chance!"

329
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,000
"But..."

330
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,560
"If you're the candidate, it's fine."

331
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,420
"Hmm."

332
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,160
"Okay, I won't fail next time."

333
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,980
"What? You can't use the runway?"

334
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
"Are you stupid?"

335
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,220
"I'm sorry."

336
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,160
"I'm out of money today."

337
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,140
"You can't be stupid!"

338
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,740
"You just want the washing alone!"

339
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,900
"You can't be stupid."

340
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,900
"He's here!"

341
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,260
"Hey!"

342
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,720
"What?"

343
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,600
"How could you?"

344
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,920
"The

345
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,140
"What?"

346
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,180
"Why would you anything?"

347
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,220
"What the hell do you mean?"

348
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,780
Wow!

349
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,180
It's been 20 years since I've been to Japan.

350
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,500
Well then, shall we open a meeting to choose the successor of Ryuichiro?

351
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,280
I thought that Keiichi would be good, but it seems that he is still a weakling.

352
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,460
It seems that he was a weakling.

353
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,360
For the time being, as a result of talking with everyone here, five people have been chosen as candidates.

354
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,220
Introduce yourself from Eichi.

355
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm Eichi Nakagawa, the head of Nakagawa Business Administration.

356
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,100
I'm in charge of the first-hand trading.

357
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,500
I'm Juichi Nakagawa, the vice-tower of the Nakagawa Bank.

358
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,540
I'm Nakagawa Kofu, the vice-tower of the Nakagawa Bank.

359
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,260
I'm Nakagawa Kofu, the vice-tower of the Nakagawa Bank.

360
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,660
I'm Nakagawa Kofu, the vice-tower of the Nakagawa Bank.

361
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,580
Hi! I'm Tsurumatsu, the grandson of Miki Masaji, and I'm playing in Hawaii.

362
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,600
Nice to meet you!

363
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,760
That's great, Tsurumatsu!

364
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,300
I'm Keiichi Nakagawa, a local official in Tokyo.

365
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,260
Please take care of me.

366
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,220
That's great, Nakagawa!

367
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,180
Ryuichiro, you're going to choose from these five people, how are you going to decide?

368
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,240
Can't you choose one of me?

369
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,740
How about that, everyone?

370
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,080
Then, as the president, you must pursue profits for the employees and their families.

371
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,620
I'll give these five people one million yen each.

372
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,820
One million yen!

373
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,720
You will compete to see how much you can earn with that one million yen a day.

374
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,060
You can do it however you want.

375
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,520
I understand.

376
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,120
I'll do my best.

377
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,380
I'll double it to two million yen.

378
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,080
Aloha!

379
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,140
I'll do my best.

380
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,200
The Chinese spring market went down by five dollars.

381
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,100
It's a buy.

382
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,600
The oil price in Hokkaido is moving.

383
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,380
Alright, it's time to sell.

384
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,580
The euro-to-dollar market is rising.

385
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,620
For now, buy about ten million euros.

386
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,980
Ahahaha!

387
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,060
I won again!

388
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm going to increase!

389
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,500
It's my last chance!

390
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,220
Aloha!

391
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,820
Well!

392
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,500
The germs from the hot market of Naftak are all throbbing.

393
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,880
Buy 50 million yen!

394
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,680
Alright, run away.

395
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,860
That's it!

396
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,500
Run!

397
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,060
Hey, Sanba.

398
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,000
Sanba, get out of here!

399
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
I'm lost again.

400
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Even though I bet ten million yen!

401
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,340
Senpai!

402
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,080
We already lost 9.9 billion! What are we going to do?

403
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,520
We still have the final race!

404
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,500
If we do this, we'll be aiming for a super big hole!

405
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,580
Nakagawa, Ichikabachika's 181 points!

406
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,240
Buy one billion! It'll be double!

407
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,400
Eh? Is it okay to buy such a big hole?

408
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,400
It's okay!

409
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,020
Leave the strong man of Dotanba to Ryo Tsukankichi!

410
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,840
Yes, I understand. Please!

411
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,780
Let's announce the winners!

412
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,160
First place, Tsurubatsu! 3.5 billion!

413
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,500
Second place, Eiichi! 3.12 billion!

414
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,780
Third place, Baron! 2.5 billion!

415
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,400
Fourth place...

416
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,840
Even so, the fifth place will be eliminated.

417
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,700
Fourth place, Keiichi! 2.0 billion!

418
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,620
11th place, 199 billion.

419
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,020
It's only a billion difference!

420
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,260
So 11th place is disqualified.

421
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:58,820
Next is Keiichi.

422
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,220
Next is the main office building in Tokyo!

423
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,440
This way.

424
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,400
Boss, stop working and play with me.

425
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,000
S-Sorry. P-Please get off.

426
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,820
A boss shouldn't lose to a secretary's charm.

427
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,540
Nakagawa is not that kind of person.

428
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,340
This way.

429
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,780
Boss, buy a leather coat.

430
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,820
It's a bit expensive.

431
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:28,920
Please.

432
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,500
Okay. Let's go!

433
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,240
That idiot.

434
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,340
As expected of Mikimatsu's grandson.

435
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,820
Tsurubatsu took out the beauty secretary, so he couldn't try the next person.

436
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,020
It can't be helped. Since Tsurubatsu is disqualified, next.

437
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,240
Ready!

438
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,520
Ready!

439
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:58,340
One, two, Tsk!

440
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,940
And once back to the stage.

441
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,620
Tsk!

442
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,040
Tsk!

443
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:10,960
Tsk!

444
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,300
Tsk!

445
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,320
I'm just a passing mongrel!

446
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,400
Keiichi, what are you doing?

447
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,840
Keiichi is disqualified.

448
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,360
You and Keiichi will have to challenge your last challenge.

449
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,300
As the president, you have to overcome any kind of hardship and reach the top of the world.

450
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,280
And then, the next battle will be...

451
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,740
...Everest!

452
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,780
I'm getting further and further away from the top.

453
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,380
Everest is certainly the top of the world, but...

454
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,400
...the guy who grew up in Hawaii, Tsurumasu, gave up before he could climb it.

455
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,020
My son climbed Everest once in his student days.

456
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,540
Maybe it was a good idea to challenge him.

457
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,100
I will try to crush anyone who climbs to the top by 5:00 p.m.

458
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,820
I'm just a passing Everest mongrel!

459
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,900
I'll roll this stone...

460
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:32,440
What the...

461
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,820
Help me!

462
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,940
Baron!

463
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,060
I...I heard my senior's voice...

464
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,780
It stopped.

465
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,420
Baron!

466
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,560
There are only three minutes left.

467
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,760
Nakagawa, are you okay?

468
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,360
Is that the top?

469
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,900
Two more minutes!

470
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,480
Two more minutes?

471
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,560
Yes.

472
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,980
Yes.

473
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,600
Yes.

474
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,480
Nakagawa, hang in there!

475
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,560
Almost there!

476
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,560
Who are you?

477
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,140
I'm Everest mongrel.

478
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,080
One minute left!

479
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,140
30 seconds left!

480
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,440
Nakagawa, hang in there!

481
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,740
Sen...Senpai...

482
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,860
10 meters left!

483
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,580
Hang in there!

484
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,260
Yes!

485
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,580
Nakagawa, hang in there!

486
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,820
10 seconds left!

487
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,840
10 seconds left!

488
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,360
5 seconds left!

489
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,400
4 seconds!

490
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,280
3 seconds!

491
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,400
2 seconds!

492
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,440
1 second!

493
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,220
All!

494
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,520
Just 5 seconds!

495
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,940
You did it, Nakagawa!

496
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,980
Sen...Senpai...

497
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,300
Well done!

498
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,200
Now you're the president and I'm the vice president!

499
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:56,920
Eh?

500
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,260
Keiichi!

501
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,500
Good job!

502
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,120
What's wrong?

503
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,300
I'm sorry for climbing up, but I found out that my clock was 5 minutes late.

504
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,940
What?

505
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,760
In other words, I was working 72 hours a day!

506
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,720
So I'm withdrawing the president's retirement declaration!

507
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,020
What happens to Nakagawa?

508
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,900
Keep being a policeman!

509
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,240
Don't mess with me!

510
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,220
My hard work so far is nothing!

511
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,340
What are you going to do?

512
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,020
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have a business trip, so I'll be rude to you!

513
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,420
Keiichi!

514
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,040
See you in a few years!

515
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,100
Hey!

516
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,260
Wait!

517
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,160
Sounds like your father.

518
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,960
But now I can continue being a policeman.

519
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,900
Nakagawa!

520
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,600
You're back!

521
00:22:59,220 --> 00:22:59,700
Yes.

522
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,500
I look forward to working with you again.

523
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,700
By the way, where's Ryo-chan?

524
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,840
Here.

525
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,500
Who?

526
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,660
Me again!

527
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,760
Oh, this is Ryo-san, a distant relative of Nakagawa.

528
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,080
Do you need anything?

529
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,420
So, I was wondering if it would be okay to go back to the police station.

530
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,860
You don't have a seat anymore.

531
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,180
Nakagawa!

532
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,220
You can use that seat every day!

533
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,400
I see...

534
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,280
Hey, chief!

535
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,320
Please forgive me!

536
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,540
Idiot!

537
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,540
If you want to go back like that,

538
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,420
you'll have to work there for a while!

539
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,200
No!

540
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,860
No!

541
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:54,520
It's raining like someone's calling me.

542
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,540
It's raining like someone's calling me.

543
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,000
It's raining like someone's calling me.

544
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,940
But I didn't have to go out yet!

545
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,320
I'll be back!

546
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,800
Akino-san...

547
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,300
Thanks!

548
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,460
Take this.

549
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,660
Thanks!

550
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,820
Here's a lot of soldiers...

551
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,280
Well,

552
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,700
Thanks.

553
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,840
Take care.

554
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,900
Hey, what is this?

555
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,960
That's a old będzie!

556
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,340
I've got to use this.

557
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,940
I'm sure that Kameari will be there!

558
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,020
Come on, everyone!

559
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,320
I'm sure that Kameari will be there!

560
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,720
To our town!

561
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,900
Oh!

562
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,100
Mai-chan!

563
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,800
There is Kameari!

564
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,680
Oh!

565
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,480
I'm sure that Kameari will be there!

566
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,240
Come on, everyone!

567
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,880
To our town!

568
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,940
Thank you!

569
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,180
Oh, no!

570
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,580
I've been caught by the shop's gang!

571
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,300
They forced me to work part-time and tried to pay the debt!

572
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,700
That's so mean!

573
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,980
And why?

574
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,200
Why is Shiratori the partner of the part-time job?

575
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,260
Next time on Ryotsu vs. Shiratori

576
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,700
Part-time job is a big mess!

577
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,860
Thank you for watching!

578
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,700
There is Kameari!

579
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,700
Oh, I'm sure that Kameari will be there!

580
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,040
Come on, everyone!

581
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,660
To our town!

582
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,800
Thank you!
