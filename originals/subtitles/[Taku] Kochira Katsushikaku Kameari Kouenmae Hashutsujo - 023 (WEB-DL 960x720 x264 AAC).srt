No, that's weird!

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,940
Okay! It's done!

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,800
Thank you for your hard work on your New Year's interview!

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,980
After that, we're gonna refurbish everything on the stage!

27
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,960
Thank you for your hard work.

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,020
Ryo, you've been working all day long since the dawn of the new year.

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,780
Of course.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,560
Unlike Nakagawa and Reiko, I'm working hard on the construction site.

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,280
I'm burning with a hot mission to protect the safety of the people even during the New Year.

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,340
What's so funny?

33
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,500
Dad, just kidding.

34
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,340
What?

35
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,160
I know. You took too many summer vacations last year, and you're having your New Year's Eve party.

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,920
You knew that, didn't you?

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,720
Well, let's go home.

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,720
Ryo, what are you going to do from now on?

39
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,860
I'm going to have a cold drink and go to bed.

40
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,920
There's no New Year's Eve party at the chief's house this year.

41
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,360
That's strange.

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
I met the temple lord at the first temple day yesterday.

43
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,760
He said he would go to the chief's house for a annual worship with a new dress.

44
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,300
What a mistake!

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,460
The chief said he would go on a family trip without his parents and children.

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,140
New Year's Eve party?

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,820
Yes, the annual New Year's Eve party at the chief's house.

48
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,860
When is the New Year's Eve party next year?

49
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,000
Next year is the end of the year.

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,340
I was looking forward to eating Osechi at the chief's house during the New Year.

51
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,320
I was looking forward to eating Osechi at the chief's house during the New Year.

52
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,080
Ryo, you're exaggerating.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,760
Well, don't be so disappointed.

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,180
It's been a long time since we went on a hot spring trip with our parents and children.

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,380
You care about your family more than your friends, don't you?

56
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Don't say that.

57
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,040
I'm old, and I can't travel without my parents and children.

58
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,900
Well, that's what it is.

59
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,360
Everyone, the New Year's Eve party is next year.

60
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,060
Yes.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,520
Really?

62
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,440
Now that I think about it, I feel like everyone was very uncomfortable.

64
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,740
I wonder if they were just thinking about me.

65
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,880
All right.

66
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,280
Is this the house of the chief's house?

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,880
I'm Ryo-tsu.

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,840
Congratulations.

69
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,980
By the way, the chief has an errand to do.

70
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,860
What?

71
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,740
What?

72
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,540
What?

73
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,600
What?

74
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,460
You did it, Captain.

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,900
You made me a fool.

76
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,460
Damn it!

77
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,160
If you do that, I'll eat any and everything you want!

78
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,520
I won't forgive you!

79
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,500
Ryo, are you in a trance?

80
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,040
This is a bloodbath.

81
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,460
Happy New Year!

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,640
You're here.

83
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,480
I'm counting on you this year too.

84
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,960
Hiromi, you're so cute.

85
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,620
Reiko, you look great in this.

86
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,620
Thank you.

87
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,860
Huh?

88
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,700
Hasn't Senpai come yet?

89
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,460
You know, Papa...

90
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,840
Hiromi, I don't want to think about him since New Year's.

91
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,740
Anyway, Nakagawa,

92
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,340
get in the car.

93
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,400
Did you park the car in front of the house?

94
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,380
Yes.

95
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,260
It's a small place, but get in.

96
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:21,980
What?

97
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,200
Captain, why are you closing the window in the daytime?

98
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,900
It's a spell of demon payment.

99
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,980
Demon payment?

100
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,360
Ouch!

101
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,040
Senpai, please forgive me.

102
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm going to the first wedding with my sister.

103
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,240
You can always go to the first wedding,

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,800
but this is the only New Year's party for you.

105
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,240
Don't talk nonsense.

106
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,720
Aren't you upset?

107
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,080
You're not invited to the first wedding.

108
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,300
Of course.

109
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,140
I'm part of the White Squad.

110
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,060
I'm not a dispatcher.

111
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,160
Don't say silly things.

112
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,820
You're my best friend.

113
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,260
Just take me to my boss' house.

114
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,600
Ouch!

115
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,260
Senpai!

116
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,180
Ouch!

117
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,420
Ouch!

118
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,060
Ouch!

119
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,720
Ouch!

120
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,700
Ouch!

121
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:11,860
Huh?

122
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,700
Hmm?

123
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,700
Hmm?

124
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,880
Hehe!

125
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,320
Hehehe.

126
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,480
You're a tough guy in the beginning of the New Year.

127
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,080
I got it.

128
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,460
Get on the car!

129
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,540
Let's go!

130
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,480
Yeah!

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,040
Oh, sorry.

132
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,020
Oops.

133
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,400
What's wrong, Nakagawa?

134
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,860
The engine sound is Honda's CBX, right?

135
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,520
Maybe you're here, too.

136
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,460
What?

137
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,720
You're already coming to me?

138
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,300
You're good at listening to the devil's voice.

139
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,360
Listen!

140
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,480
No matter what happens, don't speak up or show up.

141
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,780
Hmm.

142
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,820
Hmm?

143
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:11,820
Hmm?

144
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,480
Damn it!

145
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,400
You're a tough guy.

146
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,540
I guess I went on a family trip after all.

147
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,880
That can't be true!

148
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,140
Look at that.

149
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,060
Huh?

150
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,200
What's that?

151
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,000
You're using a cheap hand to cover it with a sheet.

152
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,920
Hey!

153
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,180
Oh!

154
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,240
It's a Ferrari F50!

155
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,980
It's different from the one you always ride.

156
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,680
It's different from the one you always ride.

157
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,180
It's definitely Nakagawa's Ferrari.

158
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,880
Really?

159
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,240
Maybe it's the neighbor's car.

160
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,640
Look around you!

161
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,140
Where do people live?

162
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,360
Look at the license plate, too.

163
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,420
Hmm?

164
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,740
It's a boy's license plate.

165
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,540
Nakagawa, you know,

166
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,640
even though he lives in Tokyo,

167
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,960
he's dressed up and using all his cars as boy's license plates.

168
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,380
Yeah.

169
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,740
All right!

170
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,020
Shhh!

171
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,640
Ohana?

172
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:09,760
Ohana?

173
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,020
I'm a past delivery.

174
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,220
A delivery, please.

175
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,940
Ohana, come out, please.

176
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,300
You're so obvious.

177
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,340
I'm not sure what to say.

178
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,080
Damn it.

179
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,640
He's just trying to get rid of me.

180
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,340
The curtains are closed.

181
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,460
He's on a family trip.

182
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,160
Oh!

183
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,600
The enemy is in there.

184
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,260
What?

185
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,960
Look at this.

186
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,840
Isn't this just an electric meter?

187
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,660
Look at the meter.

188
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,980
If you're a homeless,

189
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,880
your phone and refrigerator should only be working.

190
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,100
The meter won't work like this.

191
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,140
I see.

192
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,740
Everyone,

193
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,840
how about some sukiyaki?

194
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,300
Sounds good.

195
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,420
I'm just tired of cooking.

196
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,400
I'll help you.

197
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,640
Chief!

198
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,820
I know you're in there!

199
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,800
He's so persistent.

200
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,680
Hurry up and put us in!

201
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,680
Dad, I'm sorry.

202
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,280
Just put us in.

203
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,220
No!

204
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,200
You may not know this,

205
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,300
but he's making the house messy on New Year's Day.

206
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,680
If I do this,

207
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,080
he'll make my bonsai useless.

208
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,540
If I do this,

209
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,620
he'll make the tatami weaker.

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,180
If I scold him,

211
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,260
he'll have my face stained with ink.

212
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,760
And then he'll make the whole room black.

213
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,540
I won't let that man enter the house again.

214
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,240
I don't want to see him.

215
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,980
He's making me a scarecrow.

216
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,880
I don't know what to do.

217
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,440
You're surrounded!

218
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,460
Give up and come out!

219
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,460
I don't care.

220
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,020
He doesn't seem to react at all.

221
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,980
Damn it!

222
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,600
If you're going to do that,

223
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,780
I'll use my strong hand.

224
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Your strong hand?

225
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,060
It's quiet now.

226
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,240
It seems you've given up.

227
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,420
No.

228
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,600
When I'm full,

229
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,940
you'll have a bad habit.

230
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,520
So don't worry.

231
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,160
Is it power outage?

232
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,800
There's no way I'm going to build electricity on New Year's Day.

233
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,220
The gas in the kitchen has stopped suddenly.

234
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,320
What?

235
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,240
They're all doing the same thing.

236
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,860
Senior,

237
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,740
let's stop here.

238
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,080
Shut up!

239
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,360
If this happens,

240
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,480
I'll eat your food.

241
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,180
Geez.

242
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,360
What a stubborn guy.

243
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,060
It's fine if you reverse the water corridor and the sewer corridor

244
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,600
to panic,

245
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,520
but smash the door and get out as quickly as possible.

246
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,920
Wait, senior.

247
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,520
Senior,

248
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,000
that's no good.

249
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,360
The chainsaw is...

250
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,160
It's all right.

251
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,720
Don't worry.

252
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,660
What?

253
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,560
You only have to break the minimum.

254
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,380
I don't feel at ease at all.

255
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,740
I can't go.

256
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,260
Let's go!

257
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,360
Ryo!

258
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,940
Chief, please don't open it suddenly.

259
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,440
Life is shortening.

260
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,180
I'm the one who's shortening my life.

261
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,000
Senpai, what are you doing here with a chainsaw?

262
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,920
What are you doing here with a chainsaw?

263
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,000
The door...

264
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,440
No, I mean...

265
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,140
I was asked to clean the bathroom.

266
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,860
Liar!

267
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,140
I've never asked you to do that.

268
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,740
I don't like it.

269
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,320
I forget it when I get older.

270
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Right, Honda?

271
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,240
Yes.

272
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,600
No, no, no!

273
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,600
Chief, didn't you go on a hot spring trip?

274
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,700
Huh?

275
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,380
That's...

276
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,180
Well...

277
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,600
I couldn't get a ticket because of a travel agency.

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,580
So I'm staying at home.

279
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,520
Then why are you staying at Nakagawa?

280
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,440
Well...

281
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,740
I was suddenly bored, so I called Nakagawa and Reiko.

282
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,460
Of course, I contacted you and Nico-Nico Ryo.

283
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Unfortunately, I'm on leave.

284
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,320
Of course!

285
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,340
I've been on the escape route for a long time.

286
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,980
Is that so?

287
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,580
I was just being careful.

288
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,840
Well, it was a coincidence.

289
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:25,900
It's a coincidence.

290
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,920
Let's go somewhere, Honda.

291
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,580
Chief, of course, I don't mind.

292
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,940
Oh, yeah.

293
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,740
I'm glad you came to Chiba to clean the bathroom.

294
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,480
Then, let's start cooking!

295
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,300
Oh, before that...

296
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,420
Thank you for waiting.

297
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:51,900
Hmm.

298
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,820
It's a good thing you came to clean the bathroom.

299
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,680
I brought it so that you wouldn't be in trouble if something like this happened.

300
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,900
Honda, it's a little rude to look like that.

301
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,180
Well, it's okay.

302
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,760
It's the chief's house.

303
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,860
Ryo, remember what to do.

304
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:23,880
Mr. Ryo, Mr. Honda.

305
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,920
Happy New Year.

306
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,440
Come on, sit down there.

307
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,080
Hello.

308
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,860
No, congratulations to all the group members.

309
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,020
Congratulations.

310
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,360
You're a good-looking man.

311
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,740
You look good in a Japanese dress.

312
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,340
Why are you talking about that?

313
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,280
If you're wearing such a nice kimono and coming to the New Year's party,

314
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,940
I'd like you to say something to me.

315
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,460
Honda, I'm happy to have a really good colleague.

316
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,900
You're happy to have a good colleague, right?

317
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,100
Senpai.

318
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,860
Ryo, stop being so annoying.

319
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,420
What did you say?

320
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,600
Well, it's New Year's Eve, so let's have fun.

321
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,540
I'm tired of New Year's dishes, so I'm going to make sukiyaki.

322
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,400
What do you think?

323
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,620
What kind of punishment are you doing?

324
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,500
You're eating Osechi food for New Year's Day.

325
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,740
This is the Japanese custom, right?

326
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,520
Chief.

327
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,860
But...

328
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,260
There's no such thing as Osechi food in the field.

329
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,920
I'm trying to make my husband rest during the New Year's holiday.

330
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,820
I'm putting in a lot of things that I feel like, and I'm not doing any New Year's work.

331
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,380
It's a Japanese old-fashioned wisdom to eat it.

332
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,140
But it's not something Ryo would do, is it?

333
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,220
Even if it's about Osechi, it's clear.

334
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,740
"Homumaki" is "yorokobu".

335
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,600
"Kuromame" is "mame ni hataraku".

336
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,100
"Ebi" is "engimono".

337
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,160
It all has a proper meaning.

338
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,120
What do you think of making it a sukiyaki from the New Year's Day?

339
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,960
New Year's Day in Japan is definitely Osechi!

340
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,800
It seems that the Osechi is ready, so it's better to serve it.

341
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,720
It seems so.

342
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,520
Mom, there's still some Osechi left, right?

343
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,000
Give me that.

344
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,900
Yes, sir.

345
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,120
Yay!

346
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,520
Here's Osechi!

347
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,540
We're going to make sukiyaki here, so you can eat Osechi there.

348
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,520
What?

349
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,680
Unsurprising!

350
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,480
Don't make it here!

351
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,780
Well, I just needed the Osechi to come down.

352
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,380
Here it comes!

353
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,920
All right, I'll serve it.

354
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,880
Thank you!

355
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,580
What?

356
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:31,980
...

357
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,940
I didn't notice any of your friends here...

358
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,040
That's because I had it all.

359
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,580
The rest is over there.

360
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,520
Oh!

361
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,100
Kuro-mame , Kobu-maki , Kamaboko . . .

362
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,140
The Osechi's comrade-in-arms, right?

363
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,520
The best three are still left.

364
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,980
The main character's non-existent hotpot dish is not good.

365
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Looks delicious!

366
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,420
All right, it's been a long time.

367
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,880
Uh, uh, uh, chief!

368
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,500
Let's eat.

369
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,200
Itadakimasu!

370
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,440
Um, chief!

371
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,240
Huh? What?

372
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,440
If you don't mind, can I help you with your sukiyaki?

373
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,620
I've made your favorite hotpot dish.

374
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,420
I'll leave the sukiyaki to you until you finish eating.

375
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,640
All right.

376
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,700
I'll eat the hotpot, right?

377
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,920
Of course.

378
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,080
Good.

379
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,200
I was wondering how to get rid of the remaining hotpot.

380
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,680
It's perfect for cleaning up the mess.

381
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,040
Ryo-chan's stomach is as strong as a caterpillar.

382
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,800
That's right.

383
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll introduce you to the one who's a little hurt.

384
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,240
More importantly,

385
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,420
I'm going to eat the hotpot.

386
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,220
Before you finish eating,

387
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,840
you should eat the meat.

388
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,920
Yes, yes.

389
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,500
I can finally eat sukiyaki.

390
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,280
Itadakimasu.

391
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,360
There's only one piece of meat!

392
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,780
Damn it!

393
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,540
What?

394
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,560
It's too bad.

395
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,880
I was faster.

396
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,380
I was faster.

397
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,500
No, I was faster.

398
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,080
Honda, aren't you?

399
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,800
Honda, I'm telling you.

400
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,320
No, no, no.

401
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,560
It's the same.

402
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,120
It's better to avoid meat when you're older.

403
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,580
It's for your health.

404
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,440
You're the one who ate the hotpot so much.

405
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,900
Don't do that!

406
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,220
You bastard.

407
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,460
Even if you get used to the meat, it won't work.

408
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,360
I'll see what you can do.

409
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,200
I'll see what you can do.

410
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,100
You two aren't children!

411
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Oh, right.

412
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,760
What if the winner eats.

413
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,080
Winner?

414
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,880
How about a victory with a kalta, like a shogatsu?

415
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,020
Sounds interesting.

416
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,420
Sounds good.

417
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,460
There was a police kalta.

418
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,420
Police kalta?

419
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,360
I did it with my sister yesterday.

420
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,100
If you walk the police, you'll be in trouble.

421
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:08,900
Well,

422
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,200
"A moment of caution, and a lifetime of injury."

423
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,340
It sounds good, doesn't it?

424
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,860
Kalta like that is not interesting.

425
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,040
What do you think?

426
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,300
Let's do it with my kalta.

427
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,780
Did you bring kalta?

428
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,560
Yes.

429
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,660
I made it when I was on a holiday.

430
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,320
You're on a holiday?

431
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,500
Are you going to do a kalta game?

432
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,500
Are you not going to do it?

433
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,280
I'll do it.

434
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,760
I'll definitely win and you won't eat meat.

435
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,160
No, I'll be the last one to eat meat.

436
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,360
You're not going to do it.

437
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,780
I'll eat meat.

438
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,560
So, I'll go now.

439
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,280
Ah....

440
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,100
What's wrong?

441
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,260
Aren't you going to read it?

442
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,700
I can't read it.

443
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,780
Mr. Nakagawa, you go ahead.

444
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,080
I don't care who it is.

445
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,680
Read it now.

446
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,520
I understand.

447
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,780
"One day, I will eat a big pie from Reiko."

448
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,980
What did you say?

449
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,280
Oh, uh, no, I...

450
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,540
Yes!

451
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,720
Chief, you should write it down first.

452
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,940
What are you doing?

453
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,740
Idiot.

454
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,200
Next.

455
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,120
The name is definitely Ryotsu Kankichi.

456
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,760
What?

457
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,400
Take this!

458
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,000
I like this one the most.

459
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,340
It's just made by a senpai, but it's a mess.

460
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,760
You're so grumpy.

461
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,880
Chief Ohara, you're so grumpy.

462
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,440
What are you doing?

463
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,180
Yes!

464
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,600
It was right in front of you, but it was a shame.

465
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,960
My home, the temple of the Lone Hell.

466
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,060
Not yet.

467
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,080
There it is!

468
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,080
You're so naive, Chief.

469
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,220
You're a master of Karta.

470
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,680
You're not my enemy.

471
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,660
This Karta is a lie!

472
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,580
I made it myself, so you're definitely more advantageous!

473
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,640
You're going to make a mess because you lost?

474
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,660
No, it's not like that.

475
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,400
The handwriting is dirty and hard to read.

476
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Only you know. It's unfair.

477
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,280
Chief, where are you going with the drawing?

478
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,060
I'm making it fair.

479
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,040
I'm going to make it messy.

480
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,200
What?

481
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,120
Are you going to make a mess all over the house?

482
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,680
It's fair to make a mess.

483
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,040
Okay, that's good.

484
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
We'll find Nakagawa to read it here.

485
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,220
When he finds it, he'll bring it and ask Nakagawa to check it.

486
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,880
Sounds interesting.

487
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,880
Okay, let's start.

488
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,360
Yes...

489
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,300
Nakagawa, the one who likes to do it.

490
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,640
The one who likes to do it.

491
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,800
What?

492
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,320
Stop!

493
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,280
All right!

494
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,460
I found it!

495
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,880
Damn it!

496
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,120
Kankichi Ryoz, the best in Kameari.

497
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,860
Honda, more insolent than Tora.

498
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,340
You did it, Ryo!

499
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,940
Pachinko, a big fever!

500
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,220
You're better at raising wages than increasing blood pressure, Chief!

501
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,200
Oh, my...

502
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,480
Ryo has 20 cards, and the leader has 19.

503
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,600
The remaining cards are two.

504
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,120
I can't believe I lost to Jyotsu.

505
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,440
I remember.

506
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,660
There's a toilet.

507
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,020
It's a school on the second floor.

508
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,360
Don't eat only the lunch box.

509
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,900
It's the toilet!

510
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,660
Damn it!

511
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,000
You!

512
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,020
Now I win!

513
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,000
Now I'm in.

514
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,300
You're using dirty tricks.

515
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,440
I'll give you the last card.

516
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,960
I'll reverse it.

517
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,320
This year.

518
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,540
You're so cowardly.

519
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,800
This time I win!

520
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,880
What?

521
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,140
It won't open.

522
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,300
You're so naive.

523
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,560
I put a lock on the book.

524
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,380
Damn it!

525
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,840
I lost.

526
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,180
I lost.

527
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,740
You're so singular.

528
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,180
What?

529
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,060
There's no lock.

530
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,660
That's strange.

531
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,340
Does that mean the leader can't go in?

532
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,360
Alright!

533
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,800
Sorry.

534
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,540
You're so slow.

535
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,940
You went outside.

536
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,620
Huh?

537
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,420
Nothing.

538
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,880
What's that noise?

539
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:04,420
What's going on?

540
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,060
What's going on?

541
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,340
What's going on?

542
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,680
Damn it!

543
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,980
My book!

544
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,760
Chief, you're a bit late.

545
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,560
I won.

546
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,840
Well, Chief, you did a great job in the end of the year.

547
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:25,960
I did.

548
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,880
Well, next year's New Year's Day...

549
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,060
Next year's New Year's Day...

550
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:37,200
I won't let you win!

551
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,580
This is what happened this year.

552
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,520
Watch it again this year.

553
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,440
Here in Katsushikaku, Kameyari Park, Exit 1.

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,960
Your father's sick?

555
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,780
I'm sure he's just a little sick.

556
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,320
It's nothing serious.

557
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,100
He'll get better after a few days of sleep.

558
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,940
Unfortunately, I'm so moved.

559
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,220
I can't let him go through the housework.

560
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,080
Next time, "The Most Irresponsible Parent and Child in Japan."

563

Even if it rains, tomorrow will be sunny

564
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,680
Bye bye, let's wash our hands

565
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,780
I say goodbye to the unpleasant things

566
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:19,000
Oh yeah, let's live as we like

567
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,800
Let's live, there's something good

568
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,160
Outside the door, the sun is calling
