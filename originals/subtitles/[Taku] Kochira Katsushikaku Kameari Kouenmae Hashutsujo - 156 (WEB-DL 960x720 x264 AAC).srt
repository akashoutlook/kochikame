Ohara-kun, I'll be grateful if you go.

78
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,560
Yes, I will accompany you.

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:03,920
Thank you.

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,820
Wow, I'm glad you're so happy.

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,400
Really, really.

82
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,320
Oh, by the way, where is Ryo-chan?

83
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,100
Ryo-san paid the ticket fee for the trip.

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,100
Huh?

85
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,700
Mr. Terai!

86
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,160
What did you just say?

87
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,860
So, the trip fee for the trip was 300,000 yen.

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
By the way, the fee should be Mr. Terai's duty.

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,100
The payment for the trip is...

90
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,020
Why are you saying that, senpai?

91
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,000
No, because Ryo-san told me to go.

92
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,480
So, 300,000 yen?

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,620
Did you give it to him?

94
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:38,860
Yes.

95
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,760
I'm sorry, but...

96
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,080
Let me have 300,000 yen.

97
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,380
I don't think you can live in peace.

98
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,520
Attention, the train is about to depart.

99
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,140
Are you okay, Ryo-san?

100
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,340
It was the money you paid to the travel agency, wasn't it?

101
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,080
I'm okay.

102
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,760
I just borrowed 300,000 yen.

103
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,360
You borrowed it?

104
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,880
You're going to put it all in this one race?

105
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,880
It's a three times more expensive race.

106
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,580
If you return 900,000 yen, you can return 300,000 yen.

107
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,400
The gate has opened!

108
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,180
The 11th train has a beautiful start.

109
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,360
The most popular Yamano Hope continues to mark the 2nd most popular Harahorohirehale.

110
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:19,940
Alright!

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,660
Good!

112
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,860
It's going as expected!

113
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,260
The goal is 10 meters away!

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,740
I got 600,000 yen!

115
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,940
Good job!

116
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,840
What a surprising development.

117
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,180
The most popular Yamano Hope goes straight to the finish line.

118
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,400
What are you going to do, Ryo-san?

119
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
300,000 yen is too much!

120
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,280
What are you going to do?

121
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,000
Ouch!

122
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,040
I couldn't read the finish line.

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,080
Darn it!

124
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm going to use this to my advantage.

125
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,660
Ryo-san!

126
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm sorry.

127
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,600
I'm sorry.

130
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm sorry.

131
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,440
I'm sorry.

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,200
I'm sorry.

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,300
I'm sorry.

135
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,160
I'm sorry.

136
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,540
I'm sorry.

137
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,220
I'm sorry.

138
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,380
You can read what's going to be the result.

139
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,860
What will be the punishment if you give up that?

140
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,780
Well, everyone told me that.

141
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,620
I see.

142
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,680
But it is's really hard for the director to say you can't travel anymore.

143
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,820
In that case, I'll give you money to travel for your poor family.

144
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,100
I'm not even having to spend money on the light of a house.

145
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,980
Really?

146
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,240
You must be starving to death from all this.

147
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,760
Poor president and president.

148
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,100
They stopped traveling because of someone.

149
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,880
Poor thing.

150
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,340
A coupon for a hot spring trip.

151
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,760
Yes. Two for 2,000 yen each.

152
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,740
That's too much.

153
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,680
2,000 yen for a place near you is too much.

154
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,120
It doesn't matter if it's cheap.

155
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,820
It doesn't matter if you don't have food.

156
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,760
You can sleep outside.

157
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,020
What about a return ticket for the ski bus?

158
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,380
That sounds good! Let's have it!

159
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,540
President, president.

160
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,820
Enjoy the hot spring trip.

161
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,280
I'll relax for the first time in a while.

162
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,900
I'm counting on you, everybody.

163
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,360
Isn't Haya late?

164
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,480
I think so.

165
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,140
President, president.

166
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,420
This way, please.

167
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,560
I've been waiting behind the book since just now.

168
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,820
That's true.

169
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,340
We have to open the front door in a hurry.

170
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,820
That's true.

171
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,340
I'll be back.

172
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,420
Have a good trip!

173
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,860
Ryo seems to have paid for it.

174
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,980
It seems that it was our labor.

175
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,780
That's right. It's okay.

176
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,380
What's this?

177
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,360
What happened to Haya?

178
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,540
If it's Haya, he might get involved in a serious matter.

179
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,900
But now she's weak, so...

180
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,080
The function can be improved by repeating a little.

181
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,300
And now we will move to the bus.

182
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,760
To the bus?

183
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,500
Yes.

184
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,780
The bus is waiting just ahead.

185
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,880
You'll take part in a sports event.

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,660
It's at the last minute.

187
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,240
We'll be traveling by bicycle.

188
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,340
We'll all do the same.

189
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
We're both working for your health.

190
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,140
That's fine.

191
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:39,760
Okay.

192
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,160
Ryo will give us directions.

193
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,180
Yes, I'm Ryo-tsu Kankichi. I'll be your tour conductor for this trip.

194
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,620
Ryo-tsu, are you still on the bus?

195
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,780
No, just a little bit more. Just a little bit.

196
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,940
What do you mean, a little bit?

197
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,060
You haven't been running for over 30 minutes, have you, Ohara?

198
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,300
Ohara...

199
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,280
That was close. We were just about to leave the bus.

200
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,060
Well, what's the seat number?

201
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,960
That's strange. There's no H-Q-10.

202
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,400
Oh, I see. It's the seat that fits the budget.

203
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,520
Chief! Chief! This is the seat!

204
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,540
A support seat?

205
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,140
It's like a school trip.

206
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,820
It's nostalgic, isn't it?

207
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,560
The red light means it's windy.

208
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,380
Ryo-tsu, Ryo-tsu.

209
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,460
Yes, what is it?

210
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,300
How far are we going to the destination?

211
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,540
Well, it's supposed to be at 6 am tomorrow morning.

212
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,180
6 am!?

213
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,480
That means we'll be sleeping here.

214
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,100
I'm afraid I'll have a backache.

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Isn't that a great chance?

216
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,780
Midori, do you want some snacks?

217
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,900
Thank you.

218
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,500
I have beer.

219
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,900
Thank you.

220
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,960
Oh, and some shikamono, too.

221
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,780
Yes.

222
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,820
Hey, you two.

223
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,440
Thank you.

224
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,560
Hey, you two.

225
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,780
You're so cute.

226
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:28,940
You're so cute.

227
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,360
I want to go to the bathroom.

228
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,600
Oh, you want to go to the bathroom?

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,680
Yes, yes.

230
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,580
Here you go.

231
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,100
I can't calm down, Chief.

232
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,040
This is a strange invitation trip.

233
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,080
Hey, everybody!

234
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,660
Thank you for taking the ski bus!

235
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,560
Enjoy this trip to the fullest!

236
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,260
Yay!

237
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,160
Oh, there's an adult snowboarder among the young ones!

238
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,520
There's an adult snowboarder among the young ones!

239
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,060
Oh, there's an adult snowboarder among the young ones!

240
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,040
It's very rare!

241
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,360
This reminds me of something I've wanted to ask you.

242
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,780
Could you introduce yourselves?

243
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,780
Could you turn on your microphone?

244
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,380
Could you turn on your microphone?

245
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, I'm just a bit confused by what just happened.

246
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,580
I'm Kazushika....

247
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:10,680
Oh, I'm Kazushika....

248
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,440
I think it will be a bad idea to call out the name of the police when we're here.

249
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Yeah, I guess.

250
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,020
How do you say your name?

251
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,140
Well, I'm Tonda Gomez, President of an ice snorkeling company.

252
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,980
Well, I'm Tonda Gomez, President of an ice snorkeling company.

253
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,620
I'm Tonda Gomez, President of an ice snorkeling company.

254
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll give him aomania if he makes me lead the way.

255
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,300
Mr. Tokuto, please call him Mr. Tsunawatari!

256
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,900
Yes, Mr. Tsunawatari!

257
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,860
And this is Mr. Daijirou Ohara, who has just been restored and is standing in the steam.

258
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,480
Please call him Osaki Makkura.

259
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,440
And this is a useless human called Ryo Tsukanki, who has been fired from the company due to his use of money.

260
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,480
Please call him Mr. Human Disqualified.

261
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,260
Mr. Human Disqualified!

262
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,780
Mr. Tsunawatari!

263
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,120
Mr. Osaki Makkura!

264
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,180
Mr. Tsunawatari!

265
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,820
Isn't this great?

266
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,100
This is where the boss will do a gag on his father.

267
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,880
Oh, he's going to do it?

268
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,500
This will make him even more popular.

269
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,680
Friday is the Friday for Friday.

270
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,480
This is bad, boss!

271
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,640
Everyone is being fired!

272
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,520
It's a mess!

273
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,320
This is where the new president will be.

274
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,300
I'm going to make a great gag!

275
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,140
You're going to do what?

276
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,740
I'm going to make a great gag that will calm everyone down!

277
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,300
The bed is a bed!

278
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,820
The cat is sleeping!

279
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,180
I'm going to make a gag that will make the back door look better.

280
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,100
A story about fire.

281
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,380
A story about Heaven.

282
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,140
The story about that world.

283
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,460
The story about that world.

284
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,680
And the story about that world.

285
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:48,800
But this is not the end.

286
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,840
I'm sorry.

287
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,660
I'm sorry.

288
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,680
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,700
In these ways,

290
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:14,700
people are awesome.

291
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,060
I'm sorry.

292
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,660
I'll be happy to help them.

293
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,620
Oh, that's a good.

294
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,080
What am I supposed to do?

295
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,600
Where is he?

296
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,120
He can't sleep anywhere.

297
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,420
I found the silver world!

298
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,960
I slept well this morning.

299
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,260
My head hurts from lack of sleep.

300
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,500
I was woken up after 10 minutes.

301
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,960
I will show you the first place.

302
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,620
I will show you the first place.

303
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,440
This is the room.

304
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,700
I heard there is a hot spring hotel.

305
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,000
It's not bad, isn't it?

306
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,280
I can't say it's luxurious.

307
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,700
Actually, there is a problem.

308
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,640
He and the other 8 are in the same room.

309
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,300
What?

310
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,920
Ryo!

311
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,600
Can we rent another room?

312
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,040
It's difficult because there are many people skiing in this season.

313
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
But, they are very nice people.

314
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,520
Right, chief?

315
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,500
I understand.

316
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,820
I'll negotiate with them.

317
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,420
You don't have any money, but you want me to stop you?

318
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,340
Actually, I lost my money on the way.

319
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,260
I'm very sorry.

320
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,580
I can survive only the rain and wind.

321
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,020
I don't care if it's a horse house or anything.

322
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,580
I'm sorry.

323
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,640
Please give me a night's rest.

324
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,520
Is it really okay to stay here?

325
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,740
Yes, if you can stop me.

326
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,040
Chief!

327
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,660
Chief!

328
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,960
I'm fine!

329
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,240
I'm glad you're okay.

330
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm really okay.

331
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,080
I think this warehouse is good.

332
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,900
It's cold in here.

333
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,260
But, I think it's better to stay here.

334
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,920
Well, that's true.

335
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,140
Ryo, what about the meal?

336
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,380
Yes, I'll ask him.

337
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,000
What?

338
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,260
You want me to eat?

339
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,480
That's right.

340
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,460
I can't eat without drinking on the third day.

341
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,900
I'm dying.

342
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,200
Please.

343
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,280
I'll pay the rent and do whatever I want.

344
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:30,880
I'll work.

345
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,940
That's right.

346
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,120
If you can, you can put me in the main line.

347
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,540
Ryo.

348
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,900
Chief, what's going on?

349
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,660
Why are we doing this?

350
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,820
Well, it seems that the rumor that we are the people who were taken away from the restaurant has spread.

351
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,480
Then, the person in the inn kindly said, "It's a problem, right?

352
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,520
If you don't mind, you can work at my house."

353
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,940
He said that, and he said, "No, it's okay."

354
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,000
I refuse, Chief.

355
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,260
I refuse, Chief.

356
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,600
That's right.

357
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,640
Hey, don't talk nonsense and hurry up!

358
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,360
Yes, sir!

359
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,960
Go and ask him!

360
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,820
Yes, sir!

361
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,520
Next is Umenoba!

362
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,400
We can eat rice, too.

363
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,520
I'll eat it!

364
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:38,220
Well, the food after physical labor is delicious.

365
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,140
No, it's true.

366
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,380
Well, that's good.

367
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,540
After that, there will be plenty of physical labor.

368
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,640
I'm going to take a bath!

369
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,840
Bath?

370
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,480
Uh…

371
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,700
I guess we can join you once the cleaning is over.

372
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,100
But this isn't a safe trip.

373
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,700
Well, Chief.

374
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,880
But...

375
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,320
Let's finish it quickly.

376
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,380
Ouch!

377
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,740
You're a bunch of old-timers in the bus!

378
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,740
You're a bunch of old-timers in the bus!

379
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,520
You're a bunch of old-timers in the bus!

380
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,920
We're here to...

381
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,660
clean up.

382
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,640
We're here to... clean up.

383
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,120
You're in trouble.

384
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,620
I'm sorry.

385
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,840
We don't allow anyone to enter our baths.

386
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,960
No way.

387
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,840
We can't go into the hot springs.

388
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,320
We're in trouble.

389
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,580
We can't do anything.

390
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,740
I'm sorry.

391
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,340
We're in trouble.

392
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,680
I'm sorry.

393
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,980
I'm sorry.

394
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,520
Chief!

395
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,620
Let's go to the hot springs.

396
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,480
Let's go to the hot springs.

397
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,780
But you're not allowed to enter the baths.

398
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,120
But you're not allowed to enter the baths.

399
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,640
No, the locals told me.

400
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,080
There's a famous bath that you can enter for free in this mountain.

401
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,720
Let's go.

402
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,880
Let's go.

403
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,280
Let's go.

404
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,000
Is there really a bath like this?

405
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,380
I mean, the hot springs are far away.

406
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,580
That's why I can enter the baths for free.

407
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,460
I'm sorry.

408
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,420
There's a hot spring around here.

409
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,820
There's a hot spring around here.

410
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,500
Go away! Go away!

411
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,140
Wait!

412
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,400
Chief Kataoka!

413
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,280
Hey!

414
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,260
You're in trouble!

415
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,260
Oh, that's the Sukibe family!

416
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,120
Huh?

417
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,480
Ah, this is a snowboard restricted area!

418
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,340
You have to slide with your hands!

419
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,740
Let's go!

420
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,400
What?

421
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,280
I'm not going to look!

422
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,240
Let's aim.

423
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,980
You have to slide with your hands!

424
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,060
Yes, yes!

425
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,800
Okay, we're almost there. Let's go.

426
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,380
You're so mean.

427
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,400
Oh, here it is.

428
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,700
Someone's in here.

429
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,100
Oh, it's a snowboard.

430
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,760
It's bad if it's a girl.

431
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,460
This is a love bath.

432
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,460
Excuse me.

433
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,640
A love bath with a monkey!

434
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,540
Well, one of them.

435
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,980
Here, chief.

436
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,260
Yeah.

437
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,460
Well, I'll...

438
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,920
This is a key!

439
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:15,920
I'm in!

440
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,100
You bastard!

441
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,820
It's a fight between a monkey and a gorilla.

442
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,080
You're right.

443
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,340
It's a flow.

444
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,780
The voices of the children earlier...

445
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,300
What?

446
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,100
Hey!

447
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,100
Hey!

448
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:35,480
Are you okay?

449
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,620
Where's Midori?

450
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,340
Where's Midori?

451
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,340
What?

452
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,620
What?

453
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,300
Are you involved?

454
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,480
Where was that girl when she was involved?

455
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,640
Remember it now.

456
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,140
Hurry up!

457
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,660
Well, she was slipping behind me.

458
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,420
Where?

459
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,640
I think she was there.

460
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,780
Okay.

461
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,280
Are you okay?

462
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,220
Answer me.

463
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,860
Hey! Can you hear me?

464
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,820
We should contact the local police.

465
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,900
We won't make it in time.

466
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,120
If we get caught, we'll be at the limit of 15 minutes.

467
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,840
15 minutes?

468
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,680
If we get caught in 15 minutes, will Midori die?

469
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,200
No way!

470
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,660
Don't worry about it.

471
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,160
We'll find her.

472
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,860
You guys should also believe in us and find her.

473
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,600
Yes!

474
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,380
She's not here.

475
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,400
Did she run down there?

476
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,000
Or is she on the other side?

477
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,220
It's already been 10 minutes.

478
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,780
Do you know her phone number?

479
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:38,900
What?

480
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,100
Over there!

481
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,860
Midori!

482
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,460
She's okay. She's breathing.

483
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,400
Hey, get a grip!

484
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,500
Hey!

485
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,820
Okay, she's fine now.

486
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,320
That's good, that's good.

487
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,740
Hey, what's wrong with you?

488
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,100
Hey!

489
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,040
Hey, wait!

490
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,760
It's been a long day, hasn't it?

491
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,940
Oh my, I don't remember days like this one, Director.

492
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,420
No, I was thinking the same thing.

493
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,140
We took care of the case in the limelight, without giving up.

494
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,340
You two had a strong sense of justice, huh?

495
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,560
Police!

496
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,700
Huh?

497
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,360
Crazy!

498
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,000
It was a pretty tough job.

499
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,580
Yeah, the case was a big one after all.

500
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,460
If we had done it wrong, we would have been fired.

501
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,940
We were both so young.

502
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,980
Being young was our only weapon.

503
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,300
Yes?

504
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,560
Good evening!

505
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,700
Thank you for your help earlier.

506
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,220
Thank you for your help earlier.

507
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,920
And thank you for saying all the rude things.

508
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,080
Thank you for your help earlier.

509
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,460
No, it's okay, Ohara-kun.

510
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,400
I don't care anymore.

511
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,800
They are very reliable, aren't they?

512
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,980
Yes, I respect them for being so polite on the spot.

513
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,840
Um, are they really police?

514
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,340
Hmm? No...

515
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,680
I'm sure they are.

516
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:53,900
I'm sure they are.

517
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,760
They kept the office secret, didn't they?

518
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,060
Well, let's go there.

519
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,120

I have a bucket in my hand

549
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,340

00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,980
I love myself like this

558
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,860
Every day is no problem

559
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,580
My heart is beating

560
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,800
Monday

561
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,440
I love myself like this
