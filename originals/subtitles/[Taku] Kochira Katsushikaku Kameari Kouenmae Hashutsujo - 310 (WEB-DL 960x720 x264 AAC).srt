1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,400
I looked up at the sunset floating on the river

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,480
I kicked the pebble and flew to the end

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,680
I wonder if I'm going to the taiko that I jockeyed

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,480
I laughed at the fact that it was still a joke

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,460
No matter how much I cheer up, it's just for fun

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,380
The cityscape that never changes even when I'm moaning is tender

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,460
The crow is crying, so the hat is shaking

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,920
I'm a yakitori hobari

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,460
I'm a yakitori hobari

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,640
From the

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,960
I'm a yakitori hobari

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,460
I'm a yakitori hobari

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:02,920
I'm a yakitori hobari

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:15,740
I'm a yakitori hobari

16
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,580
From the

17
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:36,160
I'm a yakitori hobari

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,860
I don't think anyone will be happy if I show them my hobbies, like weddings and family articles.

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
I think it's useless to make it because it's just me who's on it.

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,120
Thanks to you, I've been getting a lot of return every month.

21
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,560
I've read you guys, and you're young and fresh.

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,080
I want you to make a Getsuhika that the writers will be happy to read.

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,500
Are we going to make it?

24
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,420
Yes, I hope you can accept it.

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,560
Sounds fun. Let's do it.

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,860
Okay, I understand.

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,240
Please accept it.

28
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,120
It's the first renewal, so I'd like to have a flashy special.

29
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,140
Then why don't you do a special about Nakagawa, the number one handsome man who wants to marry in the book?

30
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,980
That's good.

31
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,660
And the special about Ryo-tsu Kankichi, the number one man who doesn't want to marry for 20 years.

32
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,180
That's good. If you bring those two, everyone will pay attention to them.

33
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,020
Then I'll write Nakagawa-san's article.

34
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,140
Wait a minute. I'll be in charge of Nakagawa-san's article, so you should be in charge of Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,540
No way!

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,700
It can't be helped. Let's decide by rock-paper-scissors.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,480
Okay, let's do it.

38
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,840
Rock, paper, scissors.

39
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,620
Yeah!

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,840
Why isn't it working?

41
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,720
Don't be disappointed.

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,140
I'm gonna make it.

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,920
If it's a man's article, you can write it as much as you want.

44
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,780
Then I'll explain the worst part of Ryo-tsu Kankichi thoroughly.

45
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,660
I can't stand this smell.

46
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,960
I thought it was a miserable meal for a week until the payday.

47
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,520
I'll eat a decent meal for the first time in a week.

48
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,480
The sixth day.

49
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:35,680
I'll eat all you want!

50
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,760
The sixth day.

51
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,400
I can't eat!

52
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,780
You're here!

53
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,240
The seventh day.

54
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,940
The seventh day.

55
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,440
I'm sorry that I'm late.

56
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,060
The seventh day.

57
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,080
The seventh day.

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,880
The seventh day.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,480
On the third day, I was able to announce that it was a she-eating meal.

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,820
I got it!

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,600
A stolen cat!

62
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,700
I got it!

63
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,980
Wait!

64
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
I got it!

65
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,460
I got it!

66
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,520
I got it!

67
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,500
I got it!

68
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,580
I got it!

69
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:23,980
Damn cat!

70
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,340
I got it!

71
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,340
Give me back my cat!

72
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,920
Ow!

73
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,660
I got it!

74
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,440
I got it!

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:41,540
You bastard!

76
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,720
Wait!

77
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,580
Wait!

78
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,560
Damn it!

79
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,880
I killed the last one!

80
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,280
Damn it!

81
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,040
You're the worst!

82
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,220
You're the worst!

83
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,320
Come on!

84
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,880
I can't believe you're still here!

85
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,220
Hey,

86
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,880
This is bad!

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Look at this!

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,580
You're the number one man

89
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,280
Ryo Tsukankichi is so mean!

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,040
Who took this photo?

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
That guy is Ryotsu-san?

92
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,520
Looks like a elephant.

93
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,940
Who are they?

94
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,200
They are new members of this year's spring.

95
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,960
Hey, hey! Don't talk to each other!

96
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,840
Ah, they're here!

97
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,160
They're looking at me like I'm looking at something dirty.

98
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,300
They disappeared in an instant.

99
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,520
Damn! They're the ones who are going to do this!

100
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,180
What's up with you?

101
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,820
Don't be so nosy! You're the one who started this!

102
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,160
It's not me!

103
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,680
Hey!

104
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,240
I'm in charge of this, and you're in charge of Naoko!

105
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,620
Naoko? Damn you!

106
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,060
Hey, Naoko!

107
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,360
Oh, Ryotsu Kankichi.

108
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,860
You put this picture on the wall and made me draw a bow!

109
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,680
What are you so excited about?

110
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,540
You just made me do what I wanted to do.

111
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,340
You're the one who's been doing the worst things all day.

112
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,760
Even so, it's cowardly to hide it!

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,340
And it's a violation of privacy!

114
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,700
I'll blow it up!

115
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,000
Stop it! Let go!

116
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,720
It's not me, Senpai.

117
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,240
Chief? Director?

118
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,260
Idiot!

119
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,300
You don't have to yell like that!

120
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,820
I don't care if you yell. What's the matter?

121
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,940
Do you need my explanation?

122
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,860
Well, it's about the violation of privacy!

123
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,800
But that picture!

124
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,940
You knew that I wasn't allowed to do it, so you ate the bow of the park!

125
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,400
Well, I was just worried about the amount I would pay.

126
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,360
Who says "you"?

127
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
You hussy!

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,880
I'll lick you!

129
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,100
Listen! Don't be so harmony!

130
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,420
Come here!

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,920
You've been lecturing me for 3 hours.

132
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,760
Damn it.

133
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,200
This is all Naoko's fault.

134
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,140
If this continues, I'll revenge for her!

135
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,760
Osaki, good job!

136
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,980
Senpai, why do I have to do this?

137
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,600
Don't complain. Let's go!

138
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,660
I'm very excited!

139
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,720
Hey!

140
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,000
And this guy was working at a store that looked so nice.

141
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,560
No way, even if it's a lot, it's not.

142
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,500
No, there's no doubt about it.

143
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,960
Okay, I'll take a decisive picture.

144
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,460
Senpai, even if it's a lot, it's impossible.

145
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,740
This is the only way to get in.

146
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,040
You wait here.

147
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,340
It's definitely impossible.

148
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,860
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,820
It hasn't started yet.

150
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,000
Well, it's not that.

151
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,640
I saw the flyer for hiring a staff member.

152
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,740
You're kidding, right?

153
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,200
Yes, it's super serious.

154
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,440
This is not a monster house.

155
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,360
Look in the mirror and come out.

156
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,820
No, don't eat.

157
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,480
What?

158
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,480
Thank you.

159
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,380
Let's go, Honda.

160
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,260
What's wrong?

161
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,860
It's a rental video.

162
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,300
I came to return the video I borrowed.

163
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,040
What?

164
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,200
You're in a confusing place.

165
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,060
Hi, John.

166
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,120
Hi, Naoko.

167
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,940
Good evening. How are you?

168
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,820
I'm fine, thank you.

169
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,320
You look very close.

170
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,980
I thought you were a man,

171
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,220
but you're dating such a foreigner.

172
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,820
I'm going to a cafe.

173
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,340
Let's go, Honda.

174
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:56,840
Yes.

175
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,220
A Naba eel entering the station.

176
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,400
Hey, give me that toy.

177
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,140
What?

178
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,920
Welcome.

179
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,100
There it is.

180
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,100
Coffee.

181
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,040
Yes, please.

182
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,440
How would you like your coffee?

183
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,080
With sugar and cream, please.

184
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,280
How many spoonfuls of sugar do you like?

185
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,220
One, please.

186
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,480
Thank you for waiting.

187
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,000
Thank you.

188
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,220
Here you are.

189
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,360
Thank you.

190
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,720
How would you like your coffee?

191
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,580
I don't know what you're talking about.

192
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,800
I wonder if it's okay, senpai.

193
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,380
Yes, according to the weekly weather forecast,

194
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,400
we'll keep an eye on you.

195
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,100
Please, one more.

196
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,140
Thank you for waiting.

197
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,260
Delicious.

198
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,160
See you again next week.

199
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,960
Bye.

200
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:08,980
Bye.

201
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,700
What's that?

202
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,660
That was a quick answer.

203
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,100
Thank you.

204
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,640
Hey, you.

205
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,500
What?

206
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,960
Well, you and Naoko are...

207
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,180
How about...

208
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,240
Well, um...

209
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,100
Please speak in Japanese.

210
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,920
What? You can speak Japanese?

211
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,240
What's your relationship with Naoko?

212
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,300
I'm a teacher and student of English.

213
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,440
What?

214
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,800
Senpai, what's going on?

215
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,600
I was just having an English lesson.

216
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,940
Oh, you were learning English.

217
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,920
That's surprising.

218
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,020
Damn it, Naoko.

219
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,180
He's got some weakness.

220
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll catch you.

221
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:02,520
Bye, Sensei.

222
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,880
Bye, Sensei.

223
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,320
Really?

224
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,120
Ahh, you really quote me.

225
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,320
Are you sure?

226
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:10,540
Bye, Naoko.

227
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,600
That little punk said you should get泡.

228
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,360
What's surprises, right?

229
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,300
I can do it when I'm serious.

230
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,320
Why don't you wear the shoes when you go out?

231
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,680
Tell me when you're free.

232
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,160
No, I'm free...

233
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,140
If he's a man, he'll be mistaken for a stalker.

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,060
I think this one is more suspicious.

235
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,180
Don't talk nonsense. Let's go.

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,960
I think he woke up from the sailor suit the other day.

237
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,600
Where are you going?

238
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,500
I think he's going back to the village because his family said it was Yokohama.

239
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,000
Let's stop this coolness.

240
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
What are you laughing at?

241
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,160
That's the seat of the elderly.

242
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,920
Young people, stand up. That's healthier.

243
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,400
Yes.

244
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,840
Young people these days don't get on it, do they?

245
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,060
Yes.

246
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,200
In the ship.

247
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,200
Chieze.

248
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,880
Hayako, cheese.

249
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,380
They are waiting for us.

250
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,860
Senior, don't talk like that because it's gross.

251
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,560
What did you say?

252
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,480
Someone is coming.

253
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,280
What?

254
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,100
What? You were dating that little boy?

255
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,500
He seems to have a serious heart.

256
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,420
What?

257
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,780
You're already breaking up?

258
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,580
What a girl.

259
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,420
Let's go.

260
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,840
Yes, sir.

261
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,500
Seriously?

262
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,160
What?

263
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,820
Jolly.

264
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm counting on you.

265
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,240
Mamoru!

266
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,460
Why are you standing here?

267
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,840
Come on, let's go home.

268
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,960
Let go of me.

269
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,760
Mamoru!

270
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,040
Mamoru has been being possessed by you all this time,

271
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,820
and he's been bothering you.

272
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,680
It has nothing to do with you.

273
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,500
She's a very good woman.

274
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,000
Now,

275
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,960
you two can leave now.

276
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,860
If you don't leave, I'll have to pay you back.

277
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,720
Hey!

278
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,300
What are you doing?

279
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,200
Let go of me!

280
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,060
Come here.

281
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,500
I said, let go of me!

282
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,540
Don't be so quiet.

283
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,080
I'll listen to you in a quiet place.

284
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,760
Somehow,

285
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,100
Kumoyuki is getting suspicious.

286
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,800
Yeah.

287
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,620
It's pretty cute when you look at it.

288
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,500
If you don't want to get hurt by that face,

289
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,700
go home now.

290
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,460
Do you two know who I am?

291
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,960
I'm a police officer.

292
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,100
I'm scared of the police,

293
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,460
so I won't be pulled by them.

294
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,380
He's a good guy,

295
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,260
but he's not a good match for me.

296
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,640
This is bad.

297
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,660
Senpai,

298
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,260
let's go help them.

299
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,500
Wait.

300
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,880
Stop it.

301
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,820
Mamoru.

302
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,580
What are you doing to the leader?

303
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,820
I asked you to get rid of him,

304
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,540
but you didn't say anything about violence.

305
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,660
Shut up!

306
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,360
Mamoru.

307
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,120
Are you okay?

308
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,040
What are you doing to your brother?

309
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,120
Brother?

310
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,240
You said he was your brother.

311
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,000
Mamoru,

312
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,020
I've never heard of a police officer's sister.

313
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,160
You're so funny.

314
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,480
I'll beat you up

315
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,740
with my siblings.

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,860
Wait a minute.

317
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,520
What are you doing?

318
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,120
We're just passing girls.

319
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,360
This is disgusting.

320
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,860
Why are you so rude?

321
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,600
If you give violence to your brother,

322
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,240
they won't keep quiet.

323
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,480
Something weird is coming.

324
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,680
Hey,

325
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,600
beat them up.

326
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,740
Yes sir.

327
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,580
This one.

328
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,220
You're strong.

329
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,320
Damn it.

330
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,960
Brother.

331
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,740
Don't look at me.

332
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,240
If you approach more,

333
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,660
I'll beat you.

334
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,100
Nice.

335
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,620
Oops.

336
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,740
Brother.

337
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:09,940
Relax.

338
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,080
Fuck.

339
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,360
Keep this in mind.

340
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,960
Ryo, Tsukankichi, let's thank him for now.

341
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,460
Eh? How did you know?

342
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,160
Senpai, take it easy.

343
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,280
Oh, no.

344
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,600
By the way, why are you guys here?

345
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
That's...

346
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,740
Oh, right, there was a cosplay party nearby.

347
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,200
Right, Hayako?

348
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,500
Y-You're right.

349
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,840
You guys...

350
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,500
You're so...

351
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:45,680
You have a hobby?

352
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,740
Hey, why are you guys involved with them?

353
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,620
I'm the one who wants to know that.

354
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,020
I was trying to get Mizuki out of that group.

355
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,280
Mizuki?

356
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,680
Kimura Mizuki.

357
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,880
Ah, the one who used to come to our house a lot.

358
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,180
Last year,

359
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Ryo's parents got divorced,

360
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,200
and he became a thug.

361
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,340
I thought he wouldn't come to high school anymore,

362
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,280
so I was hanging out with them.

363
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,620
So I was trying to get him out of the group,

364
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,620
pretending to be a friend.

365
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,380
If that's the case,

366
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,520
why didn't you tell us honestly?

367
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,540
Mom was worried too.

368
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,620
Well, well.

369
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,460
Mamoru-kun, you like that Mizuki kid, right?

370
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,840
I-I'm not like that.

371
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,280
He's a good guy.

372
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,000
I've liked animals and flowers since I was a kid.

373
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,480
Then why didn't you tell him

374
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,080
to quit directly?

375
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,900
I did. But...

376
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,280
Shut up.

377
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,020
You're going to be with that kind of people.

378
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:45,700
You can't do that.

379
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,740
I don't understand how he feels.

380
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,000
Just leave me alone!

381
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,300
Mizuki!

382
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,000
Mizuki...

383
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,660
That's why I

384
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,080
wanted to understand how he feels.

385
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,460
So you joined the group.

386
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,160
What a good brother.

387
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,160
He's still a kid.

388
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,840
Okay, Mamoru. Can you get well?

389
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,880
A man has to get well

390
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,320
for the sake of his loved ones.

391
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,740
Sometimes, you have to work hard for them.

392
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,720
I'm asking you

393
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,460
if you have the courage.

394
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,100
I do.

395
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,520
Okay. Then leave the rest to me.

396
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,180
Jo-Johnny!

397
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,440
Jim, don't worry.

398
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,360
I'm not here to beat you up again.

399
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,680
Mamoru wants to fight you directly.

400
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,660
What?

401
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,520
Are you stupid?

402
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,880
Mamoru can't beat Johnny.

403
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,120
That's not true. I've tried.

404
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,840
I can't beat him.

405
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,980
You're so stubborn.

406
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,380
I have a condition.

407
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,200
If Mamoru wins,

408
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,480
I want to get rid of him

409
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,420
from your group.

410
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,280
Okay?

411
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,300
That's not a joke. Why would I...

412
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,480
Shut up!

413
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,080
If I win,

414
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,240
I'll run around Yokohama

415
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,480
naked.

416
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,580
Ryotsu...

417
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,860
That's funny. I'll take that challenge.

418
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,040
That's not funny.

419
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,240
What's wrong?

420
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,200
You're already asleep?

421
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,760
Not yet.

422
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,140
You can't do that.

423
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,800
He never fought with anyone.

424
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,280
Hang in there, Naoko.

425
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,180
If you go out here,

426
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,400
everything will be over.

427
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
I'll finish you off.

428
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,580
Why? Why would you do such a stupid thing?

429
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,440
I'm doing this

430
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,740
for the sake of our promise.

431
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,020
Promise?

432
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
When we were in elementary school.

433
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,660
When we were in elementary school.

434
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,520
I'm thinking of becoming an animal doctor

435
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:01,980
when I grow up.

436
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,520
Mizuki likes animals,

437
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,760
so she'll be able to do it.

438
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,140
Really?

439
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,340
Really.

440
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,100
Thank you, Mamoru.

441
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,280
I'll definitely become one.

442
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,640
I'll cheer for you. It's a promise.

443
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,460
Promise?

444
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,540
To make Mizuki realize

445
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,480
her old dreams.

446
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,760
That's it.

447
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,420
That's it.

448
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,940
I'm not done yet.

449
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,560
I'm not done yet.

450
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:43,580
You...

451
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,640
It's not over yet.

452
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,580
It's not over yet.

453
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:48,700
You...

454
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,700
What the hell is this?

455
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,320
This is really bad.

456
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,180
It's fine. You win.

457
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,300
Mizuki!

458
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,760
You have freedom.

459
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,880
Do whatever you want.

460
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,640
Let's go.

461
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,640
Mamoru!

462
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,080
Mamoru!

463
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:17,240
Mamoru, I'm sorry.

464
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,620
I'm really sorry.

465
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,940
It's fine.

466
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,700
Ryozu.

467
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,080
What?

468
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,420
I...

469
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,680
You won.

470
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,640
You're a man among men.

471
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,980
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,720
I'm sorry.

473
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,000
You don't have to be so harsh,

474
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,820
but you can't be so harsh on me.

475
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,560
It's fine.

476
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:48,860
I'm fine.

477
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,720
I'm fine.

478
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,640
I'm fine.

479
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,460
I'm fine.

480
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,760
I'm fine.

481
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,780
I'm fine.

482
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
I'm fine.

483
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,940
I've already checked you out. You're a pretty good sister.

484
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,840
I don't want to.

485
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,720
Senpai!

486
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,060
Senpai, I'm in trouble!

487
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,260
What's wrong?

488
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,920
Look at this.

489
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,080
What is this?

490
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,180
Nana-chan will look at you with a strange look. What are you doing?

491
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,040
Naoko!

492
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,800
What is this, senpai?

493
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,520
Naoko! What is this?

494
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,100
Here's the camera. You must have forgotten it in Yokohama.

495
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,640
Let's go, Komachi.

496
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,260
Yeah.

497
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,860
See you.

498
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Hey, wait!

499
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,000
Damn it! Remember this! I'll definitely take a picture of you in a embarrassing way!

500
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:54,500
I'm a girl who's called by someone.

501
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,180
You're a crazy girl!

502
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,120
I'm a girl who's called by someone.

503
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,620
You're a crazy girl~!

504
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,160
You're a crazy girl~!

505
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,240
I'm gonna take this.

506
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,620
Well, that's the way it is.

507
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:07,680
Well, that's how it is.

508
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
This is a miracle!

509
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,100
Teruha~!

510
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,980
Kuroutsuka!

511
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,940
I don't want you to go!

512
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,100
Everyone was a child once, but they all forget

513
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:38,040
Politicians with a big face and a blue aunt above their eyes

514
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,440
Turn around and see that corner

515
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,080
You can meet everyone

516
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,140
You can meet everyone

517
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,880
There's a camera over there

518
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,240
There's a camera for sure

519
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,840
Come on, everyone, to our town

520
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,100
There's a camera over there

521
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,360
There's a camera for sure

522
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,920
Come on, everyone, to our town

523
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,040
Thank you!

524
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,740
Come on, everyone, to our town

525
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,820
Thank you!
