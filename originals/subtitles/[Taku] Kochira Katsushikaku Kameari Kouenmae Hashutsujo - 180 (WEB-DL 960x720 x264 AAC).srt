1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:04,340
"The End"

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,880
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,340
Make the room bright and try to get away

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:25,260
It's like someone is calling

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,180
After the rain

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,520
Walking while looking back

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,400
Put your hands on your mother

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,740
I felt it at that time

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,440
A strange feeling

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,320
So I tried walking on the black tile of the Akegogai

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,400
I tried walking

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,320
Everyone was a child once

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,640
But everyone forgets

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,240
Politicians with a great face

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,780
And a blue aunt above their eyes

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,120
Turn around and look at that corner

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,800
You can meet everyone

18
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,340
There is a wall there

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,220
It's a wall

20
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,780
It's a wall

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone come to our town

22
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,680
Thank you!

23
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,340
"The End"

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,120
"The End"

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,740
"The End"

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:41,520
"The End"

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:42,600
"The End"

28
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:43,700
"The End"

29
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,640
"The End"

30
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,840
"The End"

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:48,980
"The End"

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,720
Did you see her?

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,340
"The End"

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,580
You should be proud of yourself

35
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,180
You should be proud of yourself

36
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:05,820
"The End"

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,180
"The End"

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,680
"The End"

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,140
"The End"

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,000
"The End"

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,600
"The End"

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,540
"The End"

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,100
"The End"

44
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,940
This is the girl I met when I was delivering the newspaper.

45
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,620
Delivering the newspaper?

46
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,720
Ryo-chan?

47
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,360
Yeah.

48
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,300
Really?

49
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,100
I can't believe it.

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:27,960
Why?

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,980
Because Senpai is the type to make money easily.

52
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,180
Delivering the newspaper early in the morning and delivering it one by one, right?

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,840
Not delivering it one by one.

54
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,060
Yeah, sorry about that.

55
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,420
What's the reason?

56
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,380
My best friend was doing it.

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,740
I was scouted by him while I was doing it.

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,760
Really?

59
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,780
Yeah.

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,940
What was her name again?

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,900
Tsuyoshi.

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,480
Yeah, Tsuyoshi.

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,040
Hey, Kankichi!

64
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,140
It's you again!

65
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,060
Stand in the corridor!

66
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,660
Yes, sir.

67
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,880
When I'm in the corridor,

68
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,500
I'll make sure to meet the girl.

69
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,000
Wait.

70
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,580
No, no, no.

71
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:18,840
No, no, no.

72
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,750
No, no, no, no, no, no.

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,600
Why?

74
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:24,560
The girl's purpose was to hide,

75
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,660
It was really dangerous.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,360
But she didn't hide anything, right?

77
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,540
Who is it?

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,540
He's Kankichi!

79
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,720
I know.

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,520
What kind of boy do you think he is?

81
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,620
I'm Tekano.

82
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,160
I've been seeing this girl for many years.

83
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,540
At least just for a while, yeah?

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,740
I mean-

85
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:46,800
You bastard!

86
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,100
Well, I sometimes lose.

87
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,620
Tsuyoshi's family lost their father last year due to illness.

88
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,880
Tsuyoshi, his younger brother and sister, and his mother went to work.

89
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,220
So Tsuyoshi was also delivering newspapers to help his family.

90
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,300
What's this? Why are you so noisy?

91
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,380
It's Kankichi. He's going to deliver newspapers from today.

92
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
He can't wake up early.

93
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,520
I'm going!

94
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,540
Before delivering newspapers, it's our job to put the ads in between the newspapers.

95
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,100
This is a lot of work.

96
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,180
See you!

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,760
Newspapers! Newspapers! Newspapers!

98
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,080
I'm in charge of about 60 newspapers.

99
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,660
If I forget to deliver them, I'll be fired, so I had to do it.

100
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,640
Thank you.

101
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,020
He eats well in the morning. This is his fifth meal.

102
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,400
It can't be helped. I've been working since morning.

103
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,020
I can't help it. I have to pay for food.

104
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,000
It's not home. The house where the young man lives will be popular in the neighborhood.

105
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,280
No.

106
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,600
With a proud son, both my father and mother are...

107
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,840
This kid is...

108
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,240
Who does he look like?

109
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,940
By the way, when I was passing by the shrine on the way to deliver,

110
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,220
I saw a lot of old newspapers being thrown away.

111
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,300
I picked them up, packed them in between the newspapers, and brought them home.

112
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,980
My heart was beating so fast.

113
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,680
Are you okay?

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,440
I'm seriously injured.

115
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,160
The police car comes and the ambulance comes, so it's a big mess.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,540
However, here, they say that if a newspaper is found, they will be pardoned, so they are hiding a newspaper that is desperately scattered.

117
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
You. Hurry up and get on the ambulance.

118
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,460
I'm fine. I have a job, so I'm fine with this.

119
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,000
Because you're bleeding from your head.

120
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,500
Oh, is this it?

121
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,340
This was out from before. I have a lot of bloodshot hair, so it came out immediately.

122
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,780
It's a mental accident, isn't it? But the victim?

123
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,680
I'm fine, look! As you see, nothing happened.

124
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,600
Let's go for a drive.

125
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,540
That boy is amazing.

126
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,260
The truck was 70 km away.

127
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,060
The L-Horn was not found out, but it was cracked by the right hand bone.

128
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,420
My father was angry because I broke the bicycle.

129
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,720
He was about to die because the temperature was 40 degrees.

130
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,680
But he still gave me a good feeling.

131
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,080
He is a professional.

132
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,580
He also gave me a job.

133
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,600
It's difficult to find a house without a lot of people and to use the L-Horn.

134
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,280
However, my collection rate was 100%.

135
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,520
It's amazing when money gets involved.

136
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,680
I was stuck until I collected money.

137
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,420
It's like a detective.

138
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,960
Thanks to him, I was able to get a job in a difficult district.

139
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,200
There was a guy who saved a lot of money and moved for a year.

140
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,980
Of course, he will follow me.

141
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,460
But he is a elementary school student, so he is completely despised.

142
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,060
He is not willing to pay at all.

143
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,700
So please pay a year's salary.

144
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,800
Shut up, kid!

145
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,640
I will pay! I will pay now!

146
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,260
I had a friend who looked scared.

147
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,340
Thank you.

148
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,040
As expected of Ryo.

149
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,940
At that time, the big sister of a university student at another delivery company was a hot topic among everyone.

150
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,700
I talked to her yesterday.

151
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,580
Really?

152
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,720
Yes.

153
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,840
What did you talk about?

154
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:50,060
I said "hello" and she said "hello" and I said "goodbye" and she said "goodbye".

155
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,820
That's all?

156
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,680
Yes.

157
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,340
Idiot! I talked about it.

158
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,560
Don't talk about it.

159
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,740
Exactly.

160
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm so jealous.

161
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,920
One day.

162
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,620
I was in a hurry and I fell asleep.

163
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:13,940
Oh!

164
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,980
I became friends with a famous lady.

165
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,620
Hello.

166
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,440
Hello.

167
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,100
You always slip away.

168
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,060
Yes.

169
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,320
Are you a elementary school student?

170
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,180
I'm in the fifth grade.

171
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,160
You always fly at a great speed.

172
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,960
I have a wide range of things to receive.

173
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,580
You are doing your best every day.

174
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,940
No, not really.

175
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,520
Here you are.

176
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,240
Oh, thank you.

177
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,300
I love chocolate.

178
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,580
It's a little bitter for adults.

179
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,220
It's hard to stop raining.

180
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,200
Yes.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,900
I was in a hurry and I fell asleep.

182
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,120
I was in a hurry and I fell asleep.

183
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,140
I was in a hurry and I fell asleep.

184
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,940
I was like that when I felt like it didn't matter if it rained.

185
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,240
It's ready.

186
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,380
That's good.

187
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,280
Yes.

188
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,880
That's good.

189
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,460
You have my regards.

190
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,320
Bye.

191
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,780
See you.

192
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,500
See you.

193
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,100
As expected, chocolate was a little bitter.

194
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,140
You have good memories.

195
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,120
After that, I started drinking it.

196
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,060
She's a new person in March of next year.

197
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,860
I don't know if she graduated and went back to the country or got a job.

198
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,580
You do meet people.

199
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,700
But Ryo, what happened to that blonde girl?

200
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,300
Oh, right.

201
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,160
There's a rich house in the area where I deliver.

202
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,940
The End

203
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,620
Okay, who's going to answer this question?

204
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,440
Hey, Kankichi!

205
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,780
Stand in the corridor!

206
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,500
What?

207
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,840
P-chan!

208
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,260
What's wrong?

209
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,280
Ka-chan!

210
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,620
Tsuyoshi's mother has fallen.

211
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,300
He's in a lot of pain.

212
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,220
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,000
You shouldn't push yourself too hard.

214
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,040
Please rest for the time being.

215
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,320
Okay.

216
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,320
See you.

217
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:30,140
Hey, Tsuyoshi.

218
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,160
Uncle...

219
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,860
Thank you.

220
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,100
Hey, Tsuyoshi.

221
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,460
I talked to your mother.

222
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,280
You don't know what's going to happen if you don't tell her.

223
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,140
Okay.

224
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,320
So, why don't you just leave the house?

225
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,940
You don't have to hold back.

226
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,660
I want to see you both.

227
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,160
Tsuyoshi.

228
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,360
I want a piece of the food.

229
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,760
Oh, it's going to be okay.

230
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,800
He has gone.

231
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
He's not going to say anything.

232
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:12,940
He'll just stop the eating.

233
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,760
Oh, let's leave him be.

234
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,360
I'm so sorry.

235
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,380
It's okay.

236
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,020
I'll be fine.

237
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,900
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,720
Sorry.

239
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,980
See you.

240
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,100
This is the first time I've run this much.

241
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,240
Me too.

242
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,400
Thank you for saving me.

243
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,720
My name is Flora.

244
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,620
Nice to meet you.

245
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,360
I'm Tsuyoshi.

246
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,600
I'm Kankichi.

247
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,100
By the way, why are you being chased?

248
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:08,900
Who are they?

249
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,060
That's...

250
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,180
A bodyguard?

251
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,500
I was in the house all the time without being allowed to go outside.

252
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,860
Every day?

253
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:20,700
Yes.

254
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,100
So that's why you ran away.

255
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,660
Yes.

256
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,600
But the people in the house are worried.

257
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,940
My parents are not at work.

258
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,920
I'm always alone at home.

259
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,880
If that's the case, leave it to us.

260
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,040
Right, Tsuyoshi?

261
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,420
Yes, that's right.

262
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,020
We'll go with you today.

263
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,840
Really?

264
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,100
Yes.

265
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,240
I don't need your support.

266
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,120
Thank you, Kankichi, Tsuyoshi.

267
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,080
Then you live in the inn where Doberman lives.

268
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,460
What's wrong with your house?

269
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm a newspaper delivery guy.

270
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,080
You always fly at a high speed.

271
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,520
Do you know that?

272
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,720
But the other day, I was too fast, I was hit by a dump truck, and I got a lot of eros.

273
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,320
Eros?

274
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,380
Don't say such strange things.

275
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,380
I'm a big fan of you.

276
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,220
You're my favorite.

277
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,320
I'm a big fan of you.

278
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,580
I'm a big fan of you.

279
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,400
I'm a big fan of you.

280
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,760
I'm a big fan of you.

281
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,060
I'm a big fan of you.

282
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,800
And you're making me fall!

283
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,740
You idiot!

284
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,580
Idiot!

285
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,360
Why are you so quiet?

286
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:27,900
Don't laugh.

287
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,400
Neusal

288
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,540
Did you enjoy your time here?

289
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,460
Awesome.

290
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,240
I want to stay here like this.

291
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,520
You three can escape far away.

292
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,500
Ugh.

293
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,600
Really?

294
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,900
Tsuyoshi...

295
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,760
Ah, just kidding.

296
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,620
Just kidding.

297
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,900
What the...

298
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,140
My lady, where did you go? I'm so worried.

299
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,040
It's all right. We're safe.

300
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,380
By the way, who are you?

301
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,000
I was helped by these people who were lost on the road.

302
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,380
They gave me a meal and sent me here.

303
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,100
Thank you, my lady.

304
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,860
Thank you for your help.

305
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

306
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,460
That's right.

307
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,180
I'll invite you to the next Wednesday's garden party for this.

308
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,520
That's good, right?

309
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,840
That's already...

310
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,740
If you say so...

311
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,620
Oh...

312
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,620
If you say party, will there be a great feast?

313
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,480
Isn't that so?

314
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,660
Idiot!

315
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,760
Sorry.

316
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

317
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,120
Where's the guy who's playing around in the middle of the money?

318
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,940
If you do this, I don't think you'll understand even if you think you're a rich man.

319
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,800
Yes.

320
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,020
Oh, my God.

321
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,500
Oh, um, I have something to talk to you.

322
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,880
Oh, you're going back to the country.

323
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,180
Yes.

324
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,040
You've got a lot of trouble, too.

325
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,600
Well, you can do it over there.

326
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,520
Yes.

327
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,220
Then I'll make up for what I've done so far.

328
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,300
Hey, Tsuyoshi.

329
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,640
Is the party going to be a dance after all?

330
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,160
I wonder.

331
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,640
I don't know what to do.

332
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,520
I don't dance.

333
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,900
Hey, Tsuyoshi.

334
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,960
Shut up.

335
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,040
Party, party, party.

336
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,980
I can't go to such a strange place.

337
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,740
What?

338
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,780
A party is a gorgeous place.

339
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,160
It doesn't suit me.

340
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,920
But if you don't go, Flora will...

341
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,400
Then you can go by yourself.

342
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,920
I'm not going.

343
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,080
Tsuyoshi, what's wrong with you all of a sudden?

344
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,460
Shut up.

345
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,140
What?

346
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,740
You're just like a fool from a while ago.

347
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,440
It's embarrassing.

348
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,340
What?

349
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,400
Can I step on Flora's feelings?

350
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,900
I'm just trying to date a rich girl.

351
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,740
I don't want you to go to someone like you.

352
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,260
So I'm telling you not to go.

353
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,460
I'm telling you.

354
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,340
It's been this long since I've done something for you.

355
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
I'm totally in for it with you.

356
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,380
As you wish.

357
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,360
See ya.

358
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,800
What?

359
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,280
You stupid Tsuyoshi.

360
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
Come to me with a bang.

361
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,900
You fool.

362
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,040
From the next day, Tsuyoshi has not appeared in the delivery room.

363
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,720
Did he say he quitted?

364
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,620
Really?

365
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,860
Yeah.

366
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,980
Yeah, he's going back to Japan.

367
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,400
Next Wednesday, 4 a.m. Ueno-hatsu.

368
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,020
You can pick him up if you want to go.

369
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,500
Garden party?

370
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,740
I'm starting to laugh.

371
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,380
Mom, this shirt is so hard to wear.

372
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,620
What are you saying?

373
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,540
If you dress up like that, you'll be in trouble.

374
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,540
Right, dad?

375
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,960
Well, yeah.

376
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,920
But you're a big shot with a girl friend with blue eyes, Kankichi.

377
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,920
You've become internationally known for your beauty.

378
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,800
You'll get married soon.

379
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,620
What are you talking about?

380
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,260
You're too quick-witted.

381
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,060
I'm just saying.

382
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,640
But you did something bad, didn't you?

383
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,440
You said you were moving today.

384
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,200
It's okay, that guy.

385
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,860
He's mean.

386
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,540
He tells me to go to the party alone.

387
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,920
And he doesn't tell me to move.

388
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,180
That guy has nothing to do with it.

389
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,560
That's not right, Kankichi.

390
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,380
I'm sorry to say goodbye to you.

391
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,580
I know I should have said that.

392
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,600
But he…

393
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,700
You know what?

394
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,260
If you knew he was moving, you wouldn't go to the party with Ugiki.

395
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,440
But I'm not going to you.

396
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,380
If you don't go to the party, you won't be able to meet that girl.

397
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,480
That's why I didn't tell you to move.

398
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,320
I told you on purpose.

399
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,980
Why don't you make me cry?

400
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,860
I understand, Kankichi.

401
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,540
Let's have a party for Tsuyoshi.

402
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,820
If a girl cries, I'll have to pay for it.

403
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,140
Thank you for inviting me today.

404
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,440
Oh, thank you, Gankichi.

405
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,200
What a beautiful flower.

406
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,660
What happened to Tsuyoshi?

407
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,060
He's been out of business for some reason.

408
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,460
I'm sorry about that.

409
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,000
Let's go, Tsuyoshi.

410
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,260
Thank you.

411
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,800
Oh, thank you for having me here.

412
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,160
Gankichi, could you dance with me?

413
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:39,040
Oh, please!

414
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,400
Sorry, Flora.

415
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,000
Kankichi!

416
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,380
Ryukan, let's go home!

417
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,840
Hey, Kankichi!

418
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,920
"I miss you so much that I want to give you up."

419
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,620
"You're so far away from me."

420
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,280
"You're so faint."

421
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,600
"I feel you."

422
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,220
"I feel you."

423
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,460
"You laugh at me."

424
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,160
How long will it take?

425
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,760
About 30 minutes.

426
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,500
Maybe a little longer.

427
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,220
"You're so strong."

428
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,260
"You're so strong."

429
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,780
Kankichi!

430
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,900
Tsuyoshi!

431
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,860
Take care, Tsuyoshi!

432
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,680
You too, Kankichi!

433
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,180
Kankichi!

434
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,440
Tsuyoshi!

435
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,980
Tsuyoshi!

436
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,820
Tsuyoshi!

437
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,580
Tsuyoshi!

438
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,420
Flora!

439
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:38,420
The best memory in Japan was being friends with two boys.

440
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,320
The best memory in Japan was being friends with two boys.

441
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,460
They were both kind, nice, and small gentlemen.

442
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,640
I will never forget them.

443
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,300
Kankichi, Tsuyoshi. Thank you.

444
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,240
Well, that's it.

445
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,000
What a wonderful memory.

446
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,160
Is that so? Is this girl Flora-hime?

447
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,800
She was a beautiful girl. She could have been an actress.

448
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,740
I've seen her a few times.

449
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,140
Really?

450
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,300
Yes.

451
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,460
Oh, I remember.

452
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,380
I saw a picture of her with her.

453
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,060
What?

454
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,040
Look. Flora-hime is next to me.

455
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,740
This is her?

456
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,180
No way.

457
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,820
No, that's not true.

458
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,640
No, it's not.

459
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,860
No, it's not.

460
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,780
No, it's her.

461
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,140
No, it's not.

462
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,660
I admit it.

463
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,760
You've grown up.

464
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,640
You're kind and lovely.

465
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,860
You're getting old.

466
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,280
No, it's not.

467
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,480
It's her.

468
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,880
Shall we call her and check?

469
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
No, it's not.

470
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,280
Even if she admits it, I will never, never, never admit it.

471
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,260
Then, I'll call her back.

472
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I really should have done it sooner if not now.

473
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,260
What?

474
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,460
A rat too weak?

475
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,840
Go, go, White Bear.

476
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:25,880
