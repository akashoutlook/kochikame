1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,800
VGP

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,340
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,120
Make sure your room is bright and far away

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:22,540
The sunset of the stream

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,700
I see in my mind

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,420
When I kicked the stone, it flew to the shoe

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,940
I wonder if it's going to be a joke

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,300
I laughed at the same time

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,880
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm a Katsushika Kameari

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,400
The cityscape that doesn't change even a single yawn is strangely kind

12
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,740
From the waterway of Tongari Boshi

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,440
The sun sets to Kaishakuten

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,340
Tomorrow

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,680
I'm going to

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
end this way

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,100
I'm a Katsushika Kameari

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,760
I'm happy again

19
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,080
I lost it and realized

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,720
I'm such an idiot

21
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,700
To the world that passes by, Kaki Genki

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,000
What?

23
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,020
It's not what?

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,020
It's today's promise, right?

25
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,860
Uguisuka?

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,620
What?

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,580
You idiot

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,140
Uguisuka?

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,700
It's today

30
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,160
It can't be that you forgot

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,460
I already paid for it

32
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,880
I don't forget

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,680
I made it

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,520
I see

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,300
I'll come pick it up in the evening

36
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,960
Hey

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,280
It's a mess

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,520
I shouldn't be doing this

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,140
Uguisuka?

40
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,860
It's a mess

41
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,180
It's raining in full swing.

42
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,080
Senpai, what are you doing?

43
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,960
I'm bending the bamboo pole.

44
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,800
If you look at it, you'll understand.

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,900
I'm asking you what you're doing with the bamboo pole.

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,020
I'm making a basket for the Uguis.

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,500
I forgot about it last month when my father at the bird's nest asked me to.

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,540
A bird's nest?

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,500
It's that cage, right?

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,440
You idiot!

51
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,200
The one I'm trying to make is not that cheap!

52
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,560
It's this!

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:51,640
This?

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,180
I made it with a friend before, but my father at the bird's nest liked it very much.

55
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,680
He promised to make ten of them for 500,000 yen.

56
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,240
What? That much?

57
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,000
That's 50,000 yen each.

58
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,060
This one needs a lot of skill.

59
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,540
Even 50,000 yen is cheap.

60
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,780
Where? I just need to heat it and bend the bamboo pole, right?

61
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,260
Then try it!

62
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,240
Sure. It's easy.

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,060
I'll show you.

64
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,460
Look at this. It's not as easy as it looks.

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,400
Move away!

66
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,960
I have to make nine more by evening.

67
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,820
But I've been bending it one by one like this.

68
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,360
I won't make it by evening.

69
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,700
That's right.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,980
That's enough.

71
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,440
I made ten Uguis.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,360
It's a wonderful idea.

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,860
It's dangerous, senpai.

74
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,020
I'm watching you. It'll be fine.

75
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,540
You're going to say that and take your eyes off me right away.

76
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,300
That's right.

77
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,140
Shut up, you guys. You don't have to say "it's okay".

78
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,360
Senpai!

79
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,320
That was a quick fire.

80
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,440
That's why you don't have to pour water on me.

81
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,100
It's your choice.

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,460
Senpai, this place is dangerous.

83
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,200
Why don't you use my rest room?

84
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,040
You're so noisy.

85
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,400
What's up with you?

86
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,620
Hey, Reiko!

87
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,480
What now?

88
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Put this away.

89
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,060
It stinks!

90
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
Why does Ryo-chan's clothes stink so much?

91
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,000
Senpai has worn that uniform for about ten years.

92
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,260
That's why I can't be popular with girls.

93
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,480
That's enough.

94
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,380
Isn't it?

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,320
Don't you smell something?

96
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,260
Don't you smell something?

97
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,200
Don't you smell something?

98
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,120
Don't you smell something?

99
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,060
Senpai!

100
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,080
What are you doing?

101
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,740
We're going to get burnt.

102
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,500
Oh, really?

103
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,560
But, Reiko.

104
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,020
How much are these newspapers and magazines worth?

105
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,920
How much are these newspapers and magazines worth?

106
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,960
I was going to get a new one, but I forgot.

107
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,700
I forgot to put them here.

108
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,420
It's not just my fault.

109
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,040
Now, let's get back to work.

110
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,420
W-w-wait a minute, senpai.

111
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,680
What's so noisy?

112
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,180
There's a lot of paper in this room, so it's dangerous.

113
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,260
Can you clean the office?

114
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,960
I cleaned the rest room.

115
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,000
Sorry, Kenji.

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,860
Hey, Ryo.

117
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,120
Hey, Ryo.

118
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,680
Are you going to stay like that forever?

119
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,140
It's a snowy day.

120
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,880
Nobody's coming.

121
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,680
Besides, I told you to do it here.

122
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,200
I told you to do it here.

123
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,700
I'm sure it's Reiko.

124
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,820
That's true, but...

125
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,580
Hey, I'm here to deliver the newspaper.

126
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,400
Hey, don't open it suddenly.

127
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,700
It's cold, isn't it?

128
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,620
Ouch!

129
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,160
Ryo, be careful.

130
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,520
The hot water in the can won't burn on a day like this.

131
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,020
It's cold, so please close it quickly.

132
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,080
Yes, sir.

133
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,120
I'll bring it right away.

134
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,140
What?

135
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,500
I ordered one can, but...

136
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:33,860
What?

137
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,080
No, that's not...

138
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,920
Oh, this was one.

139
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,480
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,020
I brought seven cans.

141
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,820
I see.

142
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,120
Then, leave them.

143
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,100
They'll be needed anyway.

144
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,980
I'll leave them.

145
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,220
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,140
Besides, it's our 10th anniversary,

147
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,720
so we'll only have two cans left.

148
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,940
Th-thank you very much.

149
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,540
See you later!

150
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,440
Are you putting it here?

151
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,860
Because Ryo is using fire over there.

152
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,480
It's safer over here.

153
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,720
That's right.

154
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,300
But if you make a mistake,

155
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,100
it'll burn in an instant.

156
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,540
Ryo!

157
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,600
I'll put it in the restroom,

158
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,420
but don't use fire over here!

159
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,580
I know!

160
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,900
Sir Ryoji!

161
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:29,680
Come in!

162
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,640
Oh, it's Mr. Honda!

163
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,880
I'm busy right now.

164
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,440
He's running away.

165
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,400
Can you please take care of my luggage?

166
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,040
I know you're in a hurry.

167
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,700
It'll be a big problem if you get hurt.

168
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,540
Yes, I don't mind.

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,280
I see, then...

170
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,580
I'll be in a hurry!

171
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,920
I-it can't be...

172
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,620
Gasoline?

173
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,140
That's right, but...

174
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,220
Honda, hurry up and put it out!

175
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,820
It's cold!

176
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,600
Mr. Honda!

177
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,100
The gasoline inside will burn

178
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,780
around the candle light.

179
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,220
I'll do it!

180
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,400
Anyway, I'm cold.

181
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,180
I'll bring the rest soon.

183
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,320
What?

184
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,140
Is that all you have?

185
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,260
Yes.

186
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,640
I sold it at the stand there,

187
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,780
so I finally got it back.

188
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,040
What?

189
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,160
A small fuel shop.

190
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,240
Gasoline burns like an explosion,

191
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,340
unlike oil.

192
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,360
If I make a mistake and cause a fire,

193
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,640
I'll be in trouble.

194
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,880
Ryo!

195
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,120
Don't use fire in the restroom!

196
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,160
I know.

197
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,700
I know you.

198
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,860
I finally got the second one.

199
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,320
I'm going to make more and more.

200
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,420
What?

201
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,600
What was that?

202
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,760
It was an accident.

203
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,820
Are you all right?

204
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,700
Sorry,

205
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,920
my tire slipped.

206
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,380
The road surface is starting to freeze.

207
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,740
It's starting to get hot.

208
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,840
Yes, that's all we need.

209
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,980
Excuse me, sir.

210
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,180
I have a request.

211
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,760
What is it?

212
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,600
Could you take care of the

213
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,160
It's dangerous to carry it in this snow.

214
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,720
Yes, it's fine.

215
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,260
What kind of luggage is it?

216
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,240
It's dynamite.

217
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,140
It's dynamite.

218
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,400
It's dynamite.

219
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,540
It's dynamite.

220
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,180
It's dynamite.

221
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,980
It's dynamite.

222
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,600
It's dynamite.

223
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,940
It's dynamite.

224
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,660
Great.

225
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,780
Good to know.

226
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,320
Is it a box?

227
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,120
No, there are 144 boxes.

228
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,940
Hurry up and close it.

229
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,040
I'm cold.

230
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,060
Please be careful, sir.

231
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,380
It's dynamite.

232
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,600
It's okay if the box doesn't burn.

233
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,420
It's not okay.

234
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,740
Then if the snow stops I'll come and get it.

235
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,620
That's a lot of work.

236
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,260
The restrooms are full of old newspapers, soy oil, gasoline, and dynamite.

237
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,740
What if we get caught in the fire?

238
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,100
Ryo, you have to be careful of the fire!

239
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,880
I know, I'm telling you!

240
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,900
The surroundings are so noisy, I can't concentrate.

241
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,300
That's enough.

242
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,020
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,260
Excuse me.

244
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,300
Yes, what is it?

245
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,560
Would you mind stopping the car at the back of this bus stop?

246
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,940
If we keep going like this, we'll get caught in the snow.

247
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,220
We really can't go, but it can't be helped.

248
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,320
Good. We can't leave it in a place where it's not good.

249
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,700
Is that car loaded with something?

250
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,160
Yes, it's a tank lorry full of natural gas.

251
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,280
I see.

252
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,500
Hey, everyone, get going!

253
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,600
It's not just one car!

254
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,020
Soy oil, gasoline, and dynamite?

255
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,720
And a tank lorry full of natural gas.

256
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,460
If we really get caught in the fire...

257
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,520
I don't want to imagine it!

258
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,580
Reiko, calm down!

259
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm leaving today!

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,920
What?

261
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,460
Don't stop me, Kecchan!

262
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,080
A-a mountain of matches!

263
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,360
What is this?

264
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,440
It's an old match that we played with when we thought we'd have a place to sleep.

265
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,340
It's just a box, isn't it?

266
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,080
That's what Ryo-chan said.

267
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,820
It's fine. It's a collection because it's got all the stuff in it.

268
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,140
But there's also a box that's in the back.

269
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,860
In the back?

270
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,080
Are you talking about the rest room full of dynamite?

271
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,160
Huh?

272
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,080
Huh?

273
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,260
Hey, what are you doing up there?

274
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,380
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!

275
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,900
What the hell is that?

276
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,340
It's supposed to make a noise!

277
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,720
It's a fire!

278
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,880
It's a fire!

279
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,800
It's a fire!

280
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,320
Next Episode

281
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,620
As expected, Major Bakunin!

282
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,940
Alright, I can see you!

283
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,620
The one in front of the park is there!

284
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,100
Now it's time to end this one with a warm welcome!

285
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,560
Have at it!

286
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,600
Raja!

287
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,560
Whoa!

288
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,120
Yaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!

289
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,980
A-A natuurlijk!

290
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,200
So, Shion?

291
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,560
I-It's Niyao?

292
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,640
Hahaha!

293
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,560
What do you say you visit me for?

294
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,320
This is a very nice greeting.

295
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,960
It's been a while since I saw you guys in front of the park.

296
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,200
I thought my heart was going to stop.

297
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,080
Come to think of it, what's up with Ryotsu?

298
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,560
He's always so quiet, but he's so quiet today.

299
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,100
What are you doing?

300
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,860
Shut up! I'm busy. I'm going to talk to him.

301
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:53,920
You!

302
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,540
No one has ever listened to me and lived for free!

303
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,580
I-if I were to be fired...

304
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,300
Ah! Stop it, Captain Bakuryuu!

305
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,420
We'll apologize for Ryotsu's offense!

306
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,180
You two...

307
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,620
Don't you dare talk about Ryotsu.

308
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,380
Y-yes, sir!

309
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,620
Please, I beg you.

310
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,560
Okay.

311
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,740
Thank you, Captain Bakuryuu!

312
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,020
You're not supposed to do that.

313
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,860
And then...

314
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,660
I'm just a light.

315
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,820
Don't scare me, Captain!

316
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,680
But if you make this bigger, it'll be a firecracker.

317
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,540
Too bad, it's out of gas.

318
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,140
What are you doing here, Captain Bakuryuu?

319
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,800
I was planning to go to the military training center,

320
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,160
but because of the storm, the helicopter flight is in danger.

321
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,340
So this is the worst situation.

322
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,460
You're not telling me you're going to ask for a military helicopter, are you?

323
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,380
I'm not talking about that.

324
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,660
I'm just asking for a weapon or ammunition.

325
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,500
Hey, UZI!

326
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,060
I-I can't believe it...

327
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,520
I'm grateful for everyone's help before the show.

328
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,980
Well, goodbye!

329
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,380
See you later, Captain Bakuryuu.

330
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,740
What should we do?

331
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't know what to do.

332
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,820
There are so many weapons and ammunition on the roof.

333
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,080
The tankload of gas-filled tanks surrounding us.

334
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,520
Dynamite, soaps, and gas are all over the break room.

335
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,520
And Captain Bakuryuu's weapon is...

336
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,060
I can't take this anymore!

337
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,140
U-um...

338
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,460
Kei, let's leave this place together!

339
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,300
Reiko, calm down.

340
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,980
If we leave this place, Senpai will be left here alone.

341
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,360
If we leave Senpai here, what will happen?

342
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,520
Then the hundreds of meters will be blown away.

343
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,020
Kei, let's stop making Ryo's birdcage.

344
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,320
Right now, the only thing Senpai can think about is a 500,000 yen birdcage.

345
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,360
When the money is together, do you think Senpai will listen to us?

346
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,920
Right, I can't tell anything to Ryo right now.

347
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,500
But...

348
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,540
Don't let it all fall apart, Reiko-san.

349
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,580
We need to get this right here.

350
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,380
Be careful.

351
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,500
I can't protect peace.

352
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,940
I understand, Kei.

353
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,540
Then, I'll bring you some tea.

354
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,760
Reiko!

355
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,420
It smells like fire!

356
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,760
Kei, something's burning!

357
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,820
What?

358
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:27,760
Ah!

359
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,940
Reiko, the fire extinguisher!

360
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,460
Where? Where? Where?

361
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,420
It's suddenly getting cold.

362
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,920
Ah! My clothes!

363
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,280
I'm sorry. It's all wet.

364
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,840
And the stove.

365
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,900
If it's like this, I can't use it anymore.

366
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,740
I'll bring you a new one.

367
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,520
Hurry up.

368
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,020
Well, well.

369
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,160
What do you want?

370
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,400
I'll go get the clothes, so Kei, go get the stove.

371
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,040
I understand.

372
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,800
But it's dangerous for two people to leave the fire station at once.

373
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,020
That's right.

374
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,220
I'm in trouble.

375
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,240
Konnichiwa!

376
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,820
Maria!

377
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,840
Hello!

378
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,640
What's wrong?

379
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,700
I came to clean up the traffic up to here, but it snowed and blocked the road, so I came.

380
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,280
Reiko!

381
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,420
Isn't it just right?

382
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,740
That's right!

383
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,660
Maria, I have a favor to ask you.

384
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,100
I'm sorry, but...

385
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,080
While we're out for a while,

386
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,240
would you keep an eye on Ryo-chan so that she doesn't do anything dangerous?

387
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,680
What?

388
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,140
Only Ryo-sama?

389
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:35,980
Yes!

390
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,680
I'm happy to!

391
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,880
Maria, take care of the rest.

392
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:42,700
Yes.

393
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,860
Let's hurry, Kei-chan.

394
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,600
Yes.

395
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
The next day.

396
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,200
The next day.

397
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,640
The next day.

398
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:52,980
The next day.

399
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,080
The next day.

400
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,120
The next day.

401
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,860
The next day.

402
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:55,960
The next day.

403
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,680
The next day.

404
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,480
The next day.

405
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,040
The next day.

406
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,400
The next day.

407
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,060
The next day.

408
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:11,040
Ryo-ohashi!

409
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,460
worried!

410
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,660
werd

411
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,140
I'm sorry I'm late!

412
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,920
I'm very sorry,εν

413
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,960
Oh, right! I brought something really nice!

414
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,620
I'm sure Ryo-sama will be happy too!

415
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,180
Ta-da! A firework!

416
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,960
Winter fireworks are very romantic, right?

417
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,940
Yeah.

418
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
Go ahead and do it.

419
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,200
Okay!

420
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,320
Is the exhaust pipe okay?

421
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,460
We can't see the fire truck or the Batcar, so I think it's okay.

422
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,680
I'm worried that I can't see it with my own eyes.

423
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,580
It's safe, Reiko-san!

424
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,680
That's great! Maria-chan was watching Ryo-chan!

425
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,420
Let's go!

426
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,840
Ta-da!

427
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,180
Ryo-sama, look!

428
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,420
Isn't it wonderful?

429
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,120
Isn't it?

430
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:11,900
Wow!

431
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,220
No, no, no!

432
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,920
Maria-chan, stop!

433
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,900
Why are you doing fireworks in the room?

434
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,420
Because it's cold outside.

435
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,660
Maria-chan, look carefully in the room.

436
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Reiko-san, what is this?

437
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,720
By the way, there are fireworks in the break room and on the roof.

438
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,020
What?

439
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,380
Isn't it difficult to do fireworks?

440
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,860
That's right! That's why I stopped it!

441
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,240
Yes!

442
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,380
Yes! This is a trabajo before the play!

443
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,040
Oh, I'm coming right up!

444
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,800
Senpai, call!

445
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,460
Hmm? What?

446
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,640
Hello?

447
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,140
Oh, is it Kotori?

448
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,100
What?!

449
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,100
So, today is this ceaseless day, right?

450
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,880
I can't just go to take it.

451
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,180
So, I'm gonna go to take it tomorrow!

452
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,920
Hey!!

453
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,660
Bye!

454
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,060
Oh.

455
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,680
Oh. Damn!

456
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,380
Stop it, stop it!

457
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh, me, darn it!

458
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,760
-That's a relief. -I guess.

459
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,200
-Doesn't it smell strange? -It doesn't smell like fireworks.

460
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,440
I don't think so, but...

461
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,860
-It must be because you turned off the candle. -I'm sure it is.

462
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,600
Ryo, have you stopped making bird cages?

463
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
Shut up! Damn it! I made them myself.

464
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,860
Oh, how scary. You're really a god of the birds.

465
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,180
-Let's take a nap. -Sure. I'll make some tea.

466
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,660
-I'll help you. -I'll help you.

467
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,940
-I'll help you. -I'm already feeling the heat.

468
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,700
Oh, no! I forgot to turn off the candle.

469
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,080
Oh, no! The fire is gone! The gas is leaking!

470
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,800
-The fan! -It can't be!

471
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,820
The fan is leaking!

472
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,980
The fan is leaking!

473
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,360
-What should we do? -We have to open the window.

474
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,380
Let's leave this place quietly.

475
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,680
Thank you for your hard work.

476
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,880
Why are you here on a snowy day? You're so serious.

477
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,360
It's just a job. Why are you here naked?

478
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,360
Well, it's a lot of things.

479
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,920
Ryo, doesn't it smell?

480
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,280
Yeah. Maria was playing with fireworks here a while ago. I was lighting candles.

481
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,160
Oh, I see.

482
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,960
Oh, Ryo, I can do that too.

483
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,760
What? What?

484
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,020
It's something Ryo used to do at the year-end party.

485
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,760
I can do it now that I've practiced.

486
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,460
Oh, that? Okay, okay, I'll do it. I'll watch.

487
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,420
I'm glad Ryo turned off the fire.

488
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,640
If it was on, it would have been a big deal.

489
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,760
I should warn you not to use the fire until the gas completely goes out.

490
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,840
I should warn you not to use the fire until the gas completely goes out.

491
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,460
I should warn you not to use the fire until the gas completely goes out.

492
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,620
Senpai!

493
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,280
Here we go, Ryo!

494
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,700
All right! Light the fire with your fart!

495
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,140
All right! Light the fire with your fart!

496
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,340
Terai, your fart is too strong.

497
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,640
This is the worst situation.

499
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,340
Why did it become like this?

A cell discovered that can't prevent any kind of disease from my body, right?

516
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,560
So if I can create a medicine that works for anything,

517
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,420
it can be worked on.

518
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,900
So I'm the treasure of the world

520
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,500
Thanks for watching
