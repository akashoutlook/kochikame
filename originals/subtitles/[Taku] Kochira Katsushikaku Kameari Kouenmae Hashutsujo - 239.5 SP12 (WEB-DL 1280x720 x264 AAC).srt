00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
Episode 1: The

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,360
Is it Nagasaki?

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,140
That's right.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,420
You have something to do in the Nagasaki prefecture.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,780
What?

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,340
To me?

7
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,380
Did you do something, Ryo?

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,240
Hmm?

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,840
When you say Nagasaki, it's Nagasaki Champon's Nagasaki, right?

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,680
That's right.

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,520
It was raining in Nagasaki today, Nagasaki.

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,140
Hmm, I don't remember.

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,500
You caught a thug who was aiming for only high-class cars last week, right?

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,620
Oh, by the way, is that guy related to Nagasaki?

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,140
He was arrested in Nagasaki.

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,380
It seems that he was dismantled and sold in Southeast Asia.

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,020
So I wanted your testimony of being arrested.

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,880
What?

19
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,120
It was like that.

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,480
I thought my senior was arrested.

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,920
Hey, why don't I have to be arrested?

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,240
Because Ryo-chan's rampant behavior is national.

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,460
Well, you can just make that kind of story a joke.

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,800
What's that?

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,600
It's obvious.

27
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,660
It's the flight fee and the hotel fee.

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,840
I don't want to be fooled anymore.

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,800
Idiot.

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,100
That's my own money.

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,720
Hey, that's not.

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,000
I'd like to say that, but I sent it from the other book.

33
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,100
Hmm.

34
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,920
It's a place to stay and a place to stay in Nagasaki, Tokyo.

35
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:21,940
What?

36
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,620
Aren't you going by plane?

37
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,220
What?

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,300
The budget is small for the county and the city.

39
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,160
Just send it and I'll be grateful.

40
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,900
Hey, by the way, Nagasaki was a thousand years ahead, wasn't it?

41
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,500
Next to Iwate or something?

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,400
Hey, dad, one more drink.

43
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,340
Are you okay, Ryo-san?

44
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,380
What's wrong?

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,220
My body?

46
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,060
Money?

47
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,080
I don't have money.

48
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,320
What?

49
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,420
There is money here.

50
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,080
There is.

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,620
But this can't be used.

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,140
Do you understand, dad?

53
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,580
I don't understand.

54
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,220
Well, the money is okay.

55
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,420
Oh, Senpai, were you here?

56
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,980
Oh, my wallet is here.

57
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,660
What are you talking about?

58
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,960
Don't worry.

59
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,880
I'm going next.

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,480
What?

61
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,180
Please take care of this payment.

62
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,380
What?

63
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,180
Thank you.

64
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,180
Thank you.

65
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,300
Thank you.

66
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:22,900
Thank you.

67
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,160
Thank you.

68
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,360
Thank you.

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,400
Thank you.

70
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,900
It's terrible, Senpai.

71
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,620
I haven't even had a sip, and you're paying me only money.

72
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,380
Hey, sorry, sorry.

73
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,080
I drank too much while waiting for you.

74
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,080
Here, drink.

75
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,120
Of course, I'll drink.

76
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,440
It's not my money.

77
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,020
Senpai, there's no money left.

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,660
I don't feel like drinking.

79
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,860
Me, too.

80
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,320
Me, too.

81
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,720
I drank it all.

82
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,660
I drank it all.

83
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,740
Senpai, it's terrible.

84
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,640
It's terrible.

85
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,360
You were wrong, don't cry.

86
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,500
Wait.

87
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,380
If you search, I'll give you two 100-yen pot pieces.

88
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,720
I drank it all.

89
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,360
Oh, look at the problem.

90
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,540
Look, I have money.

91
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,500
Senpai.

92
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,240
Okay, I'll blame you now.

93
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,060
By the way, this money...

94
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,800
Senpai, let's go shopping.

95
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,060
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
Well, it'll work out somehow.

97
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,280
Please do something about it.

98
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,160
Huh?

99
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,320
You used up all your travel expenses?

100
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,480
I'm so sorry.

101
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,020
Please, Nakagawa!

102
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,380
Give me back 50,000 yen!

103
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,680
I'll pay you back next month!

104
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,260
But...

105
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,960
No, Kassha.

106
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,360
Huh?

107
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,980
You used it yourself,

108
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,920
so you should be paying for it.

109
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,480
Reiko, don't say such nonsense!

110
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,740
How about you use it yourself

111
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,540
as much as you're responsible for it?

112
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,040
You bastard.

113
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,200
If I let you say it...

114
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,480
What?

115
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:52,640
What?

116
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,280
Huh?

117
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,720
Well...

118
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,900
What are you doing here?

119
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,100
Chief!

120
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,960
I was discussing the economy of Japan.

121
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,620
Huh?

122
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,360
Huh?

123
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,480
Chief.

124
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,500
I'd like to get a three-day leave.

125
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,660
Why?

126
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,020
I rarely get the chance to do so,

127
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,000
so I thought I'd go to Nagasaki

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,500
and spread my knowledge.

129
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,360
Oh, I see.

130
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,300
I don't mind that.

131
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,100
Well, then.

132
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,340
I'll pay you back soon.

133
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,600
What's that?

134
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:21,700
What's that?

135
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,500
You must be very well prepared.

136
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,280
Well, whatever.

137
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,640
I'll just get a good salary for today.

138
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,760
Hehehe.

139
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,320
Senpai, are you going by bicycle?

140
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,160
I don't have money.

141
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,200
There's no other way.

142
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,740
Are you serious?

143
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,800
It's my man's will.

144
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,380
I have to do it.

145
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,840
All right.

146
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,460
See you.

147
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,440
Once you decide, you can't go back.

148
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,620
Oh, come on.

149
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,380
Huh?

150
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,620
Huh?

151
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,080
Huh?

152
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,800
It's already 12:00.

153
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,140
We've already arrived near Odawara.

154
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,860
Yotsuya!

155
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,260
I thought you rode a long distance

156
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,680
to Shinjuku,

157
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,200
but are you still in Tokyo 23-9?

158
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:07,880
Shit!

159
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
Tokyo Hirosugi!

160
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,200
I've finally arrived at Suginami.

161
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,700
Shibuya, I'm back.

162
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,280
This is going to take longer than I thought.

163
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,100
I have to make up a plan.

164
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,440
All right! Let's go with this one!

165
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,100
I did it!

166
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,060
Yahoo!

167
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,980
See? Even if you don't have money, you can do anything with your head!

168
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,340
What?

169
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,240
How much is the cost of a bicycle?

170
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,560
It's not just a thrill to ride a bicycle on the highway!

171
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,680
Oh no!

172
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,280
High-speed electric massage!

173
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,220
What are you doing?

174
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm teaching the children what they shouldn't do.

175
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,800
Hmm.

176
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,860
By the way, do you know where Nagasaki is?

177
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,720
I don't know, but why don't you go to the sea for now?

178
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,080
I won't get lost if I go along the sea.

179
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,300
Oh, that's right. Thank you.

180
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,780
Oh, the sea. It's Enoshima.

181
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,860
Oh, I can't walk anymore. I'm going to fall.

182
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,120
I'm going to fall.

183
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,060
I'm going to fall.

184
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,440
Yes, this is Honda.

185
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,440
Oh, Senpai. How can I help you?

186
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,220
I'm looking for a car.

187
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,220
Hello? What's wrong, Senpai?

188
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,120
Please hurry. It's Enoshima.

189
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,300
Enoshima? Did something happen?

190
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,480
It's no good.

191
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,160
Senpai, be strong!

192
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm begging you. Please hurry.

193
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
Senpai! Senpai!

194
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,240
Hey, let's go now!

195
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,120
Hey, let's go now!

196
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,460
Hey, let's go now!

197
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,400
Hey, let's go now!

198
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,780
Hey, let's go now!

199
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,920
Hey, let's go now!

200
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,420
Senpai!

201
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,880
Senpai!

202
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,360
Oh, Honda.

203
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,400
After a short sleep, I'm tired.

204
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,880
I'm thirsty. I thought I could help you, so I brought you a juice.

205
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,640
That's all?

206
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,080
Are you going to Nagasaki?

207
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,620
Yes.

208
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,360
You can send me to Nagasaki ticket office.

209
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,780
It's such an honorable work.

210
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,560
You can just go to Nagasaki.

211
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,080
It doesn't matter how far it is.

212
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,740
Well, don't hesitate.

213
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,000
Let's go!

214
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,740
Oh? He can't go.

215
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,340
Oh...

216
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,620
Oh?

217
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,100
You didn't throw missed an empty can, did you?

218
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,160
You are a policeman, right?

219
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,360
No. I'm sorry. I was going to put it in properly.

220
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,860
It's not like a man to make excuses.

221
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,580
It's the worst thing to do if you don't protect your manners.

222
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,520
I told you I was going to put it in properly.

223
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,360
What's with that face?

224
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,980
If you're wearing a police uniform, you're probably scared.

225
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,160
Don't underestimate this truck lady, Haruyo.

226
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,700
If you have any complaints, wash your face and come back.

227
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't yell at me. I'm not a trashy crow.

228
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,280
You're the one who looks like a gorilla who fell into the mud.

229
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,640
What? A gorilla wearing a police uniform?

230
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,480
That's so weird. Your belly is boiling tea.

231
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,600
You don't like it? Then boil it.

232
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,940
I'll boil it.

233
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,860
Whether it's tea or coffee, bring me a kettle.

234
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,520
It's a fight.

235
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,760
Hey, should we get drunk?

236
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,660
In return, treat me to tea.

237
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,520
Pick it up.

238
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,420
Pick up the cigarette you just threw away.

239
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,060
I can't hear you.

240
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,780
Just shut your mouth.

241
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,700
Don't mess with me.

242
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,680
You're so broad-minded.

243
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,600
Shut up!

244
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,100
Don't talk back to me.

245
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,220
Let go of my hand.

246
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,360
You're a strong lady.

247
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,040
I'm not. I'm scared.

248
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,960
I said let go of my hand!

249
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,980
What?

250
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,060
This guy!

251
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,640
Let go of me.

252
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,820
Don't fight with him!

253
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,440
You're messing with me.

254
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,660
Don't be a coward. The woman is your opponent.

255
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,460
You don't have to do anything unnecessary.

256
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,560
I see.

257
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,600
It's a pretty good game.

258
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,120
Are there no trash cans to throw them out?

259
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,200
Leave it to me. That's the job of the police.

260
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,680
It's a police job.

261
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,280
I see. I'll leave it to you.

262
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,800
Honda, the cars in the line are in the way of the passage.

263
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,540
Bring them to the roadside.

264
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,920
Yes!

265
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,620
Hey, Mr. Gorilla!

266
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,180
The empty can is in the trash can.

267
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,340
Who is Mr. Gorilla?

268
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,400
It was overwhelmed.

269
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,480
It was overwhelmed.

270
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,140
What a woman truck.

271
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,480
It's cold.

272
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,940
We came all the way to Hakone, but there is no hot spring.

273
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,440
Then, we should go to drink yesterday.

274
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,920
Don't say that.

275
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,700
The cold is so strong.

276
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,780
However, there are mountains everywhere.

277
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,340
I'm from Hakone.

278
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,060
Don't you get lost on the road?

279
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,440
We're going west.

280
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,480
I see Mt. Fuji on the right.

281
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,180
I see Mt. Fuji on the right.

282
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,480
I have to see the map.

283
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,800
Shut up!

284
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,560
It's the sea.

285
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:55,200
It's the sea.

286
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,440
It's a mess.

287
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,220
What?

288
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,720
What shall we do, senpai?

289
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,300
We can't do anything.

290
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,400
The next step is gasoline.

291
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,400
Let's ask the bus to give us the gasoline.

292
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,500
The gas in the bus is not gasoline.

293
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,160
It was a joke.

294
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,160
After all, I'm hungry.

295
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,360
Speaking of seaweed, it's eel.

296
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Is it eel?

297
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,680
It's painful.

298
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,500
Eel! Eel! Eel!

299
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,280
I can't change my stomach.

300
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
What's wrong with your stomach?

301
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,840
My stomach?

302
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,280
Yes, your stomach!

303
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,700
My stomach!

304
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,680
Senpai!

305
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,660
I love my stomach too much!

306
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,220
My navel is moving to my back!

307
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,580
Senpai!

308
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,500
Ouch!

309
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
This is no good!

310
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,680
Honda!

311
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,000
Get me some water!

312
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,980
Senpai, get me some water!

313
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,620
Yes!

314
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,000
Senpai, I brought you some water!

315
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

316
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,020
Senpai, are you okay?

317
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
My stomach is moving to my back.

318
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,380
Let's go eat eel.

319
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,440
Huh?

320
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,100
Yes.

321
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,100
What?

322
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,940
Wow!

323
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,240
It looks so delicious!

324
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,460
Let's eat!

325
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,260
Yum!

326
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,720
Yum!

327
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,840
Here you go.

328
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,420
But Senpai, you're a bad person.

329
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,020
You had money, didn't you?

330
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,460
Well, that's it for today.

331
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,600
Now, drink!

332
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,080
Eat!

333
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:26,900
Oh!

334
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,920
I ate!

335
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,880
He drank.

336
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,720
Next, we'll take a bath.

337
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,300
We'll have a hot spring.

338
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,680
We'll have a hot spring bath!

339
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,680
I'm the best!

340
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,980
Senpai?

341
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,660
Eat!

342
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,640
I drank.

343
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,160
I'm the best!

344
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,920
I'm the best!

345
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,500
Now, you, greedy bastard!

346
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,860
The next step in a fine yoga bath is peeing.

347
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,900
Don't you hate

348
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,240
a man who can't hold it?

349
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,640
That's awful.

350
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,340
Hey!

351
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,280
What happened to you?

352
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,320
What?

353
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
I said I'm the worst!

354
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,700
I said I'm not good enough.

355
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,780
You can even reflect on yourself, you gorilla man.

356
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,360
You.

357
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,800
Look at this.

358
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,120
And this one.

359
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,200
Look. You're the one who made a mistake.

360
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,600
I did it.

361
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,360
Sometimes, you make such a mistake.

362
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,020
You're so short-tempered.

363
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,700
That's called being hasty.

364
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,020
When you take a bath, make sure you're sure if you're in the right position or not.

365
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,740
Make sure you're sure.

366
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,400
Ouch!

367
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,900
Ouch!

368
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,240
Ouch!

369
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,160
Oh no!

370
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,780
Please be careful.

371
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,460
It can't be helped. I'm a human being.

372
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,840
See you later.

373
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,800
Be careful.

374
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,940
He was a pretty nice guy.

375
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,860
Let's go.

376
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,580
What?

377
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,480
Don't be so nervous.

378
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,560
Nagasaki is still a long way to go.

379
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,120
Oh, by the way, where's my bike?

380
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,080
Senpai, could it be at the hotel?

381
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,980
Don't worry.

382
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,400
Just pay me back before it runs out.

383
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,480
What?

384
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,500
Did you buy my bike for the money I put in the nightclub?

385
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,640
That's terrible.

386
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,280
The bike...

387
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,140
The nightclub...

388
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,080
It can't be helped.

389
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,700
You were having fun, weren't you?

390
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,900
But my bike...

391
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,000
How can I make it work?

392
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,180
Are you going to Nagasaki?

393
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,020
Well, I guess...

394
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,580
Senpai, can you stop for a second?

395
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,640
Damn it.

396
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,260
I can't go hitchhiking in my uniform.

397
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,740
The sun went down just by walking on the boat.

398
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,420
I'm getting hungry.

399
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,120
Senpai, what are you going to do today?

400
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,880
What are you going to do?

401
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,820
Do you still have money?

402
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,240
Hey, Senpai, what are you doing?

403
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,700
Oh, shut up.

404
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,680
Leave it to me.

405
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,280
Leave it to me?

406
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,000
It's over there.

407
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,120
Let's go over there.

408
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,120
What?

409
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,980
Here it is.

410
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,600
I just remembered.

411
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,440
This is my relative's house.

412
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,480
Relative?

413
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,540
Senpai's?

414
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:23,980
Yes.

415
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
My father's cousin's third son-in-law.

416
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,080
His wife's cousin's cousin's house.

417
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,540
Oh.

418
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,160
Good evening, sir.

419
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,820
Is there anyone here?

420
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,500
Yes.

421
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,120
Who is it?

422
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,480
It's been a while, sir.

423
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,100
You?

424
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,140
You look fine.

425
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,280
How many years has it been?

426
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,400
This house hasn't changed at all.

427
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,080
Hey, Honda, come in.

428
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,520
Good evening.

429
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,680
This is my friend, Honda.

430
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,860
He said he wanted to see you, so he followed me.

431
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,240
Oh, right.

432
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,460
Is there an aunt?

433
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,280
She's in the back.

434
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,360
That's good.

435
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,540
That's good.

436
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,980
What's the story about her?

437
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,480
"Aunt, I'm here to play in Tokyo."

438
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,680
Good evening.

439
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,540
My house is the same as ever.

440
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,520
It's the same as ever.

441
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:07,960
Good.

442
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,540
Good.

443
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,480
She's from Tokyo.

444
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,840
Your youngest brother.

445
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,340
He must be in Tokyo.

446
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,900
Then, my Hiroshi.

447
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,400
Yes, Hiroshi.

448
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,340
That's Hiroshi.

449
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,260
Who is Hiroshi?

450
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,480
Good.

451
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,240
Good.

452
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,340
He remembered me.

453
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:23,460
He remembered me.

454
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,240
Oh, I see.

455
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,560
Hiroshi.

456
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,160
He's changed a lot.

457
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,480
I didn't know.

458
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,400
That's right.

459
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:29,860
That's right.

460
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,800
That's what everyone says.

461
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,660
He's changed.

462
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,460
He's changed.

463
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,760
Is my cousin, Heisuke, doing well?

464
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,960
I'm fine.

465
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,400
I'm fine.

466
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,540
Heisuke died.

467
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,660
Yeah.

468
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,200
Yeah.

469
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,080
He died in good health.

470
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,720
Did you get hungry?

471
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm so hungry that I'm falling down.

472
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,700
Oh, my.

473
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,460
Let's have dinner.

474
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,660
You.

475
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,040
No, for Hiroshi.

476
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,660
I know.

477
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,140
It's been a while.

478
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,440
I'm sorry.

479
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,440
I think I made a request.

480
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,340
That's not true.

481
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,820
Well, the old lady is considerate and kind.

482
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,380
The old man is happy.

483
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,200
Well, that's a little...

484
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,940
He's a really funny person.

485
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,640
Hiroshi.

486
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,940
There are still many topics.

487
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,400
Let's drink at night tonight.

488
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,060
Yes.

489
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,200
Let's drink at night.

490
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,540
Today is the day of the festival of the old man.

491
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,020
You're welcome.

492
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,880
Then, I'll go to the festival.

493
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,100
I'll go.

494
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,520
That's all.

495
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,780
I see.

496
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,740
I'm really sorry.

497
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,560
Thank you.

498
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,540
You're welcome.

499
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,640
I'm sorry.

500
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,700
I'm sorry.

501
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,040
I'm sorry.

502
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,220
I'm sorry.

503
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,280
Well.

504
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,620
Hey.

505
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,580
I'm sorry.

506
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,040
Okay.

507
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,160
That's all.

508
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,100
That's good.

509
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,380
I told you, I'm good at it.

510
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,720
Is there anything else?

511
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,040
Really? But...

512
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,020
It's okay. It's okay.

513
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,840
You can use the roof or the water, or anything.

514
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,080
Here's your tea.

515
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,480
Thank you very much.

516
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,960
So, are you going to Kyushu?

517
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,520
Yes. I have some business.

518
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,000
It's a mess here and there, but I'll be fine if you take care of it.

519
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,960
I'll come again, so I'll do it again then.

520
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,340
They're sleeping so well.

521
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,260
They're good people, but they're fooling me.

522
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,400
Well then, be careful.

523
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,460
Here's your lunch.

524
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,540
Oh, thank you.

525
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,660
It's still a long way to Kyushu.

526
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,100
Well, I've been taking care of you.

527
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,200
See you.

528
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,340
Come again when you get home, Hiroshi.

529
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,480
Okay.

530
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,100
See you.

531
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,960
Senpai, please go ahead!

532
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,160
Um...

533
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,100
What's wrong? Did you forget something?

534
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,440
No. Actually, Hiroshi is...

535
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,420
It was fun to say that we had a lot of fun.

536
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,560
Yeah.

537
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,200
Well then...

538
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,380
If you think about it, Hiroshi is still in junior high school.

539
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,720
That's right.

540
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,000
I see.

541
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,420
Thank you for your help.

542
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,960
Hmm...

543
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,200
Senpai!

544
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,920
Ha-ha-ha.

545
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,920
I guess you're having a good morning, Senpai!

546
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,560
What?

547
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,800
Now, let's get ready and go for a walk to Nagasaki!

548
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,340
Let's go!

549
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,460
Huh?

550
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,300
Senpai, I can't walk anymore.

551
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,980
Don't say such a bad word.

552
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,680
What's wrong with your energy?

553
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,160
Well, my legs got tired...

554
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
I can't walk a single step.

555
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,000
If you think you can walk, you can walk anywhere.

556
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,620
You're going to Nagasaki, right?

557
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,100
Come on!

558
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,280
But I'm not even in Nagoya yet.

559
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,480
Nagasaki is impossible.

560
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,640
Come on!

561
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:05,920
No!

562
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,340
I told you I'd go with you.

563
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:09,900
No!

564
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,080
What are you doing there?

565
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,220
You're so lucky that you shared your bike with me.

566
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,920
But you saved me.

567
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm lucky that I'm on my way to Nagasaki.

568
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,280
I'm so lucky.

569
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,380
You're so lucky that you're on your way to Nagasaki.

570
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,100
You're so lucky that you're on your way to Nagasaki.

571
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,260
You're so lucky that you're on your way to Nagasaki.

572
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,160
You can do it if you do.

573
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,900
How long do you think it takes?

574
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,880
I'll do it if you say so.

575
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,920
You can't, can you?

576
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,620
I can.

577
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,040
I'll do it even if I have to do it now.

578
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,320
No no no.

579
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,960
Zenbu- наверное なにするんですか?

580
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,600
Don't do it.

581
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,640
Shut up.

582
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,360
Let go of me.

583
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,580
N-n-ne-

584
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,720
Don't stop me, fool.

585
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
What is this?

586
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,720
What's this?

587
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,780
What? A cat?

588
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,820
Meow

589
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,320
Hey! Don't lick me like that!

590
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,400
Hahaha, it seems you like Senpai

591
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,240
What's your name?

592
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,100
Tamasaburo

593
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,300
Hey, stop it!

594
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,000
If you're a human, you're a scum, you know

595
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,540
Meow

596
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,640
But Senpai is just like you

597
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,600
I'm not kidding! I don't look like this!

598
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,300
I'm a woman who's more in love with men than women

599
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,040
You're a woman, Tamasaburo

600
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,640
What?

601
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,280
Hey, stop it!

602
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,160
He's not getting away at all

603
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,840
He won't be able to get off

604
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,220
I can't help it. I'll ride you to Nagasaki

605
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,800
I can't help it. I'll put you on

606
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,440
Hey! Don't lick my nose!

607
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,680
Hachoo!

608
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,460
Crap!

609
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,760
Hey, Goran, don't sleep on your knees!

610
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,060
Don't sleep in the car. It's heavy.

611
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,860
Hey, wake up, Tamasaburo!

612
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,580
Another run and you're in Nagasaki.

613
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:54,380
What's wrong? You've been quiet for a while.

614
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,900
Kanda?

615
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,320
Yeah. Four years ago.

616
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,220
Get out!

617
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,320
Get out!

618
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,900
You're not a parent or a child.

619
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,580
You're just an outsider.

620
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,680
Yeah, I'm going out.

621
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,760
I can't stay with a stubborn old man like you.

622
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,160
You're so stubborn that even men can't run away from you.

623
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
You can't run away.

624
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,260
I ran away because you're a man and can't run away.

625
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,800
Then don't take advantage of my advice.

626
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,440
I don't like what you don't like!

627
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,540
Well, well, father and Haruyo, please calm down a little more.

628
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,100
You're so stubborn! I've already decided!

629
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,300
Once you've decided, the God of Heaven will not change your mind.

630
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,140
I'm a father, too!

631
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,740
Oh, Haruyo!

632
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,520
Don't you worry!

633
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,460
Oh!

634
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,540
Hmm...

635
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,200
"I'll be a father, too."

636
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,160
Did you choose your father's favorite husband as your husband?

637
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,480
It's obvious.

638
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,560
You're so naive.

639
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,660
I have to do everything my father wants me to do.

640
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,580
Why did you suddenly decide to go back to the village?

641
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,500
I was told that I had fallen.

642
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,860
And I had a job to come to.

643
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,180
So I thought I'd try to get a job.

644
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,260
For four years.

645
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,220
I worked hard.

646
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,320
I worked hard.

647
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,140
And finally I bought this truck.

648
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,040
"I'll be a father, too."

649
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,760
Oh, you had a hard time.

650
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,560
Well, yeah.

651
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,320
Now, it's time for the Gravaen.

652
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:47,900
Oh!

653
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,160
"I'll be a father, too."

654
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,300
Sorry, Tamasaburo.

655
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,480
I'll be back soon.

656
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,800
So please wait quietly in this situation.

657
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,240
Then, how are you feeling?

658
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,400
I don't think I'm doing that well.

659
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,000
I can't get up very well.

660
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,040
What if I just fall asleep?

661
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,260
I'm worried about my mother.

662
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,680
Ah!

663
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,600
Is today a festival?

664
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,520
Yeah.

665
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,840
A festival of reflection.

666
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,800
"Fantasy festival"

667
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,560
"The festival of reflection"

668
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,160
The boss is also in the fishing team, but he used to be the captain.

669
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,780
He drank too much alcohol.

670
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,160
He can't go to the festival, so he's not doing well.

671
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,040
If you show your face, you might get better.

672
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,860
I know.

673
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,380
Then don't be upset here.

674
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,700
If you know, it's unnecessary care.

675
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,860
Let's go.

676
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,220
What are you doing?

677
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,480
Where are you going?

678
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,200
To your father's place.

679
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,500
Wait a minute.

680
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,460
I haven't decided yet.

681
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,700
Wait a minute.

682
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,160
You idiot.

683
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,360
That's why you came back to Nagasaki.

684
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,400
Or is it better to be a priest?

685
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm your father.

686
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,060
I'm like your father.

687
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,560
If you don't do as you want, you won't feel better.

688
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,080
If you don't like it, I'll take you with me even if it is tied up.

689
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,920
Ryo.

690
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,720
My truck.

691
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,860
It's a truck thief.

692
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:50,860
Stop.

693
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,100
You can't take it.

694
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,320
-Sanakaburo! -Sanakaburo!

695
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,420
Sanakaburo!

696
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:00,520
Senpai!

697
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,120
I won't let you do that!

698
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,820
Excuse me.

699
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,020
I'm a cop, but I'm tracking down the truck.

700
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,080
Lend me that motorcycle.

701
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:15,820
Yes.

702
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,020
Yes.

703
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,400
I won't let you get away!

704
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,300
Now, get on it!

705
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,140
Huh?

706
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,600
Y-Yes!

707
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,620
Let's go!

708
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,860
Oh, no!

709
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,800
Sir! Are you all right?!

710
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,440
Help!

711
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,560
Tamasaburo!

712
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:57,880
Go!

713
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,060
I wonder if this is going to be okay!

714
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,300
Hey, you cop! Stop the car!

715
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,800
Stop the car!

716
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:15,900
Yeah!

717
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,740
Hey!

718
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,280
Tamasaburo!

719
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,530
You bastard!

720
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,740
- -Darn you, stupid cat!

721
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,840
You bastard!

722
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,560
ARGHHH!

723
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,620
U-Ugh!

724
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,780
Tamasaburo!

725
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,980
Where? Where are you?

726
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,380
Tamasaburo!

727
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,880
Haruyo!

728
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,760
I'm counting on you!

729
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,720
Senpai!

730
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,560
Tamasaburo!

731
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,740
Sorry, I must have scared you!

732
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm glad you're safe!

733
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,340
Tori!

734
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,820
Senpai!

735
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,800
Tamasaburo!

736
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,020
That was a great blow.

737
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,080
I'm so happy.

738
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,660
Ryo?

739
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,920
Hmm?

740
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,780
Thank you.

741
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,620
Huh?

742
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,200
So that's all right...

743
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,080
"Dad, I'm going to the grocery store."

744
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,580
"Oh."

745
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,540
"Huh?"

746
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,580
"Nyaa."

747
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,080
"Oh, Tamasaburo."

748
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,400
"Sorry."

749
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,420
"Oh."

750
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,500
"Hello."

751
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,220
"Um, what is it?"

752
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,480
"Oh, nothing."

753
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,860
"Hey, what are you doing? Hurry up!"

754
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,260
"Ah."

755
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,700
"H-Haruyo!"

756
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,560
"Dad, Dad!"

757
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
"Haruyo, Haruyo has come back!"

758
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,240
"What?"

759
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,300
"He's at the entrance now."

760
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,120
"Are you waiting for him?"

761
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:54,840
"What?"

762
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,340
"He's moved. Let him go home."

763
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,000
"No way."

764
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,040
"Dad."

765
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,880
"W-What are you doing? I'm not feeling well. Please go home."

766
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,680
"I didn't come back because I wanted to. I just happened to be here."

767
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,080
"I'll go home."

768
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,360
"Wait!"

769
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,220
"Who are you?"

770
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,420
"Hehehe."

771
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,540
"Well, you've heard me out."

772
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,060
"Ryo-san."

773
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,380
"That's a big deal. You have nothing to do with it."

774
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:35,920
"But you know, this is the end of our relationship. I'm engaged to your daughter."

775
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,760
"W-What?"

776
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,340
"Ryo-san."

777
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,080
"Say it again!"

778
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,160
"Yeah."

779
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:48,520
"So we're engaged to each other. Love, love. Yeah!"

780
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,440
"Haruyo, is that true?"

781
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,800
"It's true. Right, Haruyo?"

782
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,620
"Don't touch my daughter so easily!"

783
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,260
"Oh, you're not a red-haired stranger?"

784
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,020
"Huh?"

785
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,680
"If you're moved, you're not a parent or a child, right?"

786
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,480
"Kuh."

787
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,140
"If you're against it, you should be moved first."

788
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,640
"You're making a big deal out of it."

789
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,340
"Umm, let's just make a few excuses."

790
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,720
"Well, then. We'll live happily together."

791
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,920
"It's a nuisance to have such a stubborn father."

792
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,720
"No!"

793
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,560
"I won't forgive you!"

794
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,260
"What do you mean by that?"

795
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,480
"We can get married on our own will."

796
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,380
"No, no, no, no!"

797
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,340
"Haruyo is my daughter!"

798
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,040
"It's too late now."

799
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,540
"Then, shall we go?"

800
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,180
"Wait!"

801
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,160
"I can't let my daughter be a coward like you!"

802
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
"Then, who do you want?"

803
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,060
"If your daughter is a man who can handle your glasses,

804
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,300
you don't mind if she doesn't?"

805
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,160
"I just want my daughter to be happy."

806
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,520
"You're moved?"

807
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,980
"Umm..."

808
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,960
"If you really want your daughter to be happy,

809
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,240
you should let her do what she wants."

810
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,120
"You're just obsessed with your pride and will."

811
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,400
"You don't understand how my parents feel!"

812
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,040
"You stubborn old man!"

813
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,060
"You can't say anything!"

814
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,480
"You're a man with a long eyebrow!"

815
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,240
"You're a fossil from the late ages!"

816
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,220
"You're a human in the hands of a man!"

817
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,060
"You're a man in the hands of a man!"

818
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,560
"You're a pumpkin!"

819
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,400
"You're a pumpkin!"

820
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,340
"You're a pumpkin!"

821
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:27,640
"You're a pumpkin!"

822
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,240
"Dad..."

823
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,360
"Dad!"

824
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,180
"Dad!"

825
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,840
"D-Dad!"

826
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,880
"Dad!"

827
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,020
"Dad!"

828
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:36,700
"Dad!"

829
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,300
"Dad!"

830
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,640
"Dad!"

831
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:40,860
"Dad!"

832
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,360
"Dad!"

833
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,300
"Dad!"

834
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:48,540
"Dad!"

835
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,820
"Dad!"

836
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,580
"Dad!"

837
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,660
"Dad!"

838
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,440
Father...

839
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,620
That's good.

840
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,720
Eh?

841
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,260
Wait, Ryo-san!

842
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,380
Thank you.

843
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,880
Thank you, Ryo-san!

844
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,100
Hey, stop it!

845
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,280
The play is over!

846
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,320
Play?

847
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,320
That's what I'm saying, so don't worry.

848
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,240
I knew it.

849
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,000
Haruyo is a noodle eater.

850
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,300
She's a noodle eater.

851
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,380
But...

852
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,840
If you're a person like Ryo-san,

853
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,640
would it be okay to go to a wedding?

854
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,260
Huh?

855
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,980
Don't joke around!

856
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,320
I'm glad, father.

857
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,180
You got on the ship you've been wanting to get on.

858
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,560
Yeah.

859
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,220
It's all thanks to Haruyo.

860
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,720
I'm going to stop going back to Tokyo.

861
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:10,980
Huh?

862
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,840
I'm going to get a ship ticket and live here.

863
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,580
I-I see.

864
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,140
Hey, Ryo-san!

865
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,820
I want to ski on your dad, too!

866
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,980
I just got on the ship!

867
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,480
We'll have lots of fun today!

868
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,260
Hi!

869
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,580
Dad!

870
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,180
There's a sukiyaki that your dad likes on the ship.

871
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,680
Is that so?

872
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,160
You're a good-for-nothing.

873
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,120
Eh?

874
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,820
Eh?

875
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,620
...

876
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,260
If you're a person like Yose, can I go to see you?

877
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,240
Ah, um, what...

878
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,780
Huh?

879
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,320
Ah, ah, ah, what?

880
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,240
Why is Dolphin Dekka here?

881
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,400
Ah, it's a dolphin.

882
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,580
What's wrong?

883
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,460
Ah, no, nothing. Let's pretend I didn't see it.

884
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,600
Ryo, what did you say just now?

885
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,000
Ah, um, um...

886
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,000
What?

887
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:39,300
Ah, ah, ah, amazing.

888
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,180
Why is Dolphin Dekka here?

889
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,200
What's wrong?

890
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,300
No, nothing. Let's pretend I didn't see it.

891
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,760
Ah, um...

892
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,020
What?

893
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,180
Huh?

894
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Why is Dolphin Dekka here?

895
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,820
What's wrong?

896
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,820
No, let's pretend I didn't see it.

897
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,520
Do you have something to talk about?

898
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,380
No, um, I'm about to...

899
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,800
Um...

900
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,940
Tamasaburou!

901
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,720
Meow.

902
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,640
Ah!

903
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,180
Meow!

904
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,480
Ken!

905
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,240
H-Haruyo!

906
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,020
What?

907
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,160
When did you get back?

908
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,900
Today.

909
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,180
I...

910
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:41,580
I went to Haruyo's house right after I got back from the port.

911
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,060
But Haruyo was no longer there.

912
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,380
Ken...

913
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,260
Are you going on a foreign ship? When are you coming back?

914
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,240
I can't tell you.

915
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,900
Haruyo!

916
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,160
You idiot! Why didn't you say you'd wait for me?

917
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,900
I was an idiot. I've been regretting it ever since.

918
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,140
Ken...

919
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,560
Um...

920
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:25,840
If you're fine, would you stay by my side? Forever?

921
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,760
Are you sure? Haruyo.

922
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,140
Yeah...

923
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,960
Oh, yeah, there's someone I want to introduce.

924
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,640
Ryo...

925
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,020
What?

926
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,440
I didn't say I wanted you to know...

927
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,100
What?

928
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,160
Now, you're gonna tell me what?

929
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,620
But you have to stay by my side.

930
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,720
Oh.

931
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:15,940
What?

932
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,660
You didn't want to come, either?

933
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,540
So, I'm here...

934
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:17,800
Huh?

935
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,760
What are you doing?

936
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,420
Oh, a rat.

937
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,420
Hey, Tamasaburo! Come back here!

938
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,000
Everyone, thank you for waiting.

939
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,160
The annual fireworks show is about to begin.

940
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,340
Please look forward to it.

941
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,700
Senpai, where did you go?

942
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,540
Mr. Honda.

943
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,220
Oh, Haruyo. Do you know Senpai?

944
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,420
We were looking for him, too.

945
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,020
Oh, right. I'll introduce him.

946
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,660
Mr. Ken Yasukura.

947
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,080
Hello.

948
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,760
We're getting married.

949
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,600
What?

950
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,920
Oh, you know that he's gone, don't you?

951
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,600
Hey, Tamasaburo!

952
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,160
I did it.

953
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,280
Here we go.

954
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,520
What's this?

955
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,320
Hey, Tamasaburo!

956
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,780
If you keep waiting, I'll...

957
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,940
All right, let's get started.

958
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,800
Let's fight!

959
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,560
All right!

960
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,660
Oh, wow!

961
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:44,180
I'm sure Senpai's watching this fireworks show somewhere.

962
00:41:51,500 --> 00:42:04,360
Mr. Nagasaki, the kid is dangerous.

963
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,240
Let's freaked out.

964
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:06,480
Yoroshiku!

965
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:06,760
You're sc緒 befoe!

966
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,660
You're now on the attack team of the police.

967
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,500
And now I'm a member of the police?

968
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,020
I won, I won.

969
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,120
It's my fault.

970
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:13,660
Do it!

971
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,160
I'll get you.

972
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:14,760
He must be playing with the fog tail.

973
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,100
When he comes back, I'll take a lot of it.

974
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,520
Ah!

975
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,180
Yes, this is Kameyari Park Exhibition.

976
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,040
Uchya!

977
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,900
Gyotsuka!

978
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,980
Idiot! Where are you now?

979
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,260
I'm in Hakodate right now.

980
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,580
Hakodate?

981
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,900
Why are you in a place like that,

982
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,400
That was Hakodate where I was hit by fireworks in Nagasaki

983
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,880
and got caught in an airplane and got off.

984
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,460
What are you talking about?

985
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,720
Anyway, please send the money to the chief.

986
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,840
I don't know anyone like you anymore.

987
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,700
Just be a crab in Hokkaido.

988
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,220
Chief! Chief!

989
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,640
No way!

990
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,060
How can I get home from here?

991
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,940
I'll ask them.

992
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,540
What?

993
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,180
Somehow I don't want to be an idiot with luxury cars.

994
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:33,740
If I break the road at the corner turn, the moon will run away.

995
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,960
"This is not all."

996
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,860
I still haven't seen it.

997
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,200
Don't worry

998
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,520
Even if you lie and cheat

999
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,480
You're sometimes helping someone

1000
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,600
Baby, do you know me?

1001
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,460
I'm heading for tomorrow

1002
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,840
With a nice breath

1003
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,580
Don't get sick

1004
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,860
I'll do what I have to do

1005
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,620
With a cute breath

1006
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,000
What's hard to understand

1007
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,760
Is the war I want to show you

1008
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,560
I hope it's better than seeing you again
