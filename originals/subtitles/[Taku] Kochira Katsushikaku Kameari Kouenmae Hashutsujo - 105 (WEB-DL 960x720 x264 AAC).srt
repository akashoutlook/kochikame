1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,600
"I'm a little lonely"

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,340
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:13,120
Make the room brighter and try to look away

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,460
"I'm a little lonely"

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,860
I look at the sunset floating in the river

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:33,820
When I kick the pebble, I jump to the shoes

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:41,820
I wonder if I'm going to the gym that I used to do

8
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,340
"It's as it is" I laughed

9
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,840
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,020
I have to win

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,880
I have to make a fuss

12
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,260
The cityscape that doesn't change is strangely gentle

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,760
From the main street of Tongari-boshi

14
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,360
To Kaishakuten

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,420
The sunset falls

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:23,360
Tomorrow is already over

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,380
Why is it over?

18
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,780
If I win, I will be happy again

19
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,440
I lost and I realized

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,620
Because I'm stupid

21
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,620
Bonus Contest 3

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,360
Long-lasting poverty

23
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,940
The collapse of the financial institutions that continue to exist

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,480
All the companies in Japan are suffering from business crisis

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,860
Yes, I know

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,840
It is true

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,480
our sales got a rise

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,620
We could only do it when the World cup actually took place

29
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,600
The satellite antennaes got popular

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,040
But we've lost our goods

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,860
However, the reason we are suffering

32
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,700
Is merely the power outage of the government

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,080
But the greatest cause is this man

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,940
Because he always brings the product

35
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,860
And don't eat the money

36
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,540
He's never going to pay the debt

37
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,940
That man is not a bad guy

38
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,460
And he will be given a bonus!

39
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,440
Can you accept this, gentlemen?

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,180
This year, this man will take the bonus!

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,700
Prepare yourself, Ryotsu Kankichi!

42
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,580
Yes sir!

43
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,560
Now, we will start the 25th Ryo-tsu Kankichi Bonus Battle.

44
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,220
Wow, that's great.

45
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,920
Kikuchi, did you run away from your wife again?

46
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,760
Yes, this time, my wife is serious.

47
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,820
If I fail to collect the debt...

48
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,560
If I fail again, I will be just a servant for Ryo-san.

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,400
Everyone has the same problem.

50
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,820
So, what new weapons have you prepared this year, Bramoya?

51
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,440
Last year, you watched Ryo-san's movements thoroughly in the Peeping Eye operation, right?

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,200
Yes.

53
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,460
Before that, you watched Ryo-nabi and...

54
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,640
The new weapon to collect debt against Ryotsu Kankichi, Shaking X!

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,660
This year, you have prepared more new weapons than before, right?

56
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,700
Sorry.

57
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,880
I couldn't win against the current situation.

58
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,400
I didn't have time to test and develop new weapons.

59
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,980
What?

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,240
Then, this year, I don't have new weapons.

61
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,280
I don't have a chance to do it from the beginning.

62
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,540
Then, how can you collect debt from Ryo-san?

63
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,880
I don't have time to test and develop new weapons.

64
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,340
Don't worry.

65
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,960
I don't have new weapons, but I have a plan.

66
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,840
Plan?

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,240
It's called ABCD Enclosure.

68
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,040
ABCD Enclosure?

69
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,840
Yes.

70
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,860
This ABCD will catch up to Ryotsu Kankichi.

71
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,400
I don't understand. It seems to be amazing.

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,840
Oh.

73
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,740
Ryotsu Kankichi.

74
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,580
This year, you will not have a single yen left.

75
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,620
You will get a bonus.

76
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,320
Are you sick, senpai?

77
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,060
Shouldn't you go home and rest?

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,220
Idiot.

79
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,500
Tomorrow is the bonus day.

80
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,460
If you get a bonus, you have to buy a special machine for the number of units.

81
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,080
You can't sleep.

82
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,720
I see.

83
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,180
The bonus hunting season is coming this year.

84
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,040
There is no bonus hunting season this year.

85
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,260
But what about the people of the shopping street?

86
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,000
There is a special strategy to hide them.

87
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,840
This year, I won't give them even a single yen.

88
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,580
I won't worry about it.

89
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,340
I see.

90
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,240
I didn't imagine I would ustedes from this year to shake into the bank.

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,440
It's me.

92
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:40,940
Oh.

93
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,660
It's Maria.

94
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,420
Ryo-sama, today's your bonus day, right?

95
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,880
Why don't we have dinner together?

96
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,620
I'd like to have your treat.

97
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,300
Sure!

98
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,120
By the way, Ryo-sama.

99
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,240
When are you going to get the bonus?

100
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,220
I've been waiting for you at the library.

101
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,080
Actually, I'm going to deposit it into the bank this year.

102
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,260
To cover up for the debt collection.

103
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,880
Then where are you going?

104
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,060
I'm going to the Sucharaka Bank in front of the station.

105
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,720
I just found the total amount of the bonus.

106
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:10,900
That's...

107
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:10,940
Ugh!

108
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,140
- Stop there! - What's wrong, Ryo-sama?

109
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,820
Wait!

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,960
Wait!

111
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,180
You're crazy!

112
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,260
Oh, he got me.

113
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,860
That-that-that...

114
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,660
I'll soon have to kill him for getting the bonus.

115
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,580
Um, I'm under arrest this time, right?

116
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,860
Yeah, of course.

117
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,520
Please.

118
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,900
Okay, good idea.

119
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,040
Wait a minute.

120
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,960
If I arrest him here, I'll have to go to the office.

121
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,780
I'll go to the office now.

122
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,640
Ryo, catch him!

123
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,440
I thought it was definitely a debt-taking machine, but I'll let you off today.

124
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,120
Why? I was trying to steal money.

125
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,820
He's saying that he likes me, the victim.

126
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,440
No way!

127
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,980
There are things that make a country happy, such as gratitude.

128
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,660
I'm really happy today because of the public service worker's bonus payday.

129
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,980
So, it's not a crime.

130
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,920
I won't do it again.

131
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,620
Please.

132
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Please arrest me.

133
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,880
What?

134
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,220
Please.

135
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,180
Please.

136
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:27,960
Please.

137
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

138
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,020
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

139
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,400
Stop it, hey!

140
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,100
What are you doing?

141
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,160
I'm going to investigate in the police station from now on.

142
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,800
I'm going to investigate in the police station from now on.

143
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,620
Please.

144
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,460
Hey, idiot, just go to the verb.

145
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,940
We've been there!

146
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,180
Over there!

147
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:46,820
I have the bonus!

148
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,280
Don't move there!

149
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,160
It's our job!

150
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,880
Why are they here?

151
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,060
Please quickly go to theas.

152
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,820
I can't go there.

153
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,640
Ready!

154
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,420
What?!

155
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,120
What the hell were you doing?

156
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,160
Huh?!

157
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,160
I'm going to make them go out of control so that I won't sit still.

158
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,520
You're too cowardly to make others stand up!

159
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,020
You're too cowardly to make others stand up!

160
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,140
There's a bonus!

161
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,700
Don't you dare!

162
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,140
I won't let you win!

163
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,580
Please take me with you!

164
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,340
You're not a police officer!

165
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,940
What the hell!

166
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,580
What happened to you?

167
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,800
I think the human set something on me.

168
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,260
How did the human set something on you?

169
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,900
What are you guys doing now?

170
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,480
I was in a low order.

171
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,580
Oh no! I forgot the key I had.

172
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,560
Oh, have you been using the mitad?

173
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,540
If you had, why did you tells us that it's a Wolven?

174
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,520
Let's try to go see the police.

175
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,040
This guy is too loud with us.

176
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,400
I wouldn't dare could die because I tried to get a mitt from him.

177
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,120
I wouldn't dare could die because I tried to get a mitt from him.

178
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,800
How could I maybe get it?

179
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,560
What if it's a spy hired by a gang of money-grabbers?

180
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,880
We'll spy on Ryo-san.

181
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,920
Understood.

182
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,380
And you'll be the one to contact us as soon as you find him.

183
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,760
If that's the case, it's dangerous to be with him.

184
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,700
We must get out of here as soon as possible!

185
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,740
Hey!

186
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
You're going to the police, aren't you?

187
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,740
Are you still here?

188
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,160
Wait a minute!

189
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,680
What's going on, Bulba?

190
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,400
I want the key to my desk.

191
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,120
It's in the back of my desk drawer.

192
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,020
Oh, I see, Ryo-san.

193
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,920
So, where should we take it?

194
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,420
Under the bridge at the north of Nagagawa Bridge.

195
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,900
Understood.

196
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,900
Why do we have to hide in a place like this?

197
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,700
Hey, sir.

198
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,840
Shin, keep it down.

199
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,240
Here he comes.

200
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,240
I've been waiting for you.

201
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,080
Oh, you've been waiting for us, huh?

202
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,880
Looks like you're ready to pay the debt.

203
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,840
What?

204
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,740
Why you guys?

205
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,900
It's you, after all!

206
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,060
Take this!

207
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,860
Are you going to do it again?

208
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,820
I won't eat the same thing!

209
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,460
I won't eat it!

210
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,500
I won't eat it!

211
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,560
Ryo-san, there's no room for you to run away anymore.

212
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,220
I'll be quiet and go to the police station.

213
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,400
Damn it!

214
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,620
Let's get in!

215
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,720
It's midwinter!

216
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,840
Don't be so stubborn!

217
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,220
If you want to be arrested by me, follow me!

218
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,400
I can't believe you're going to jump into the river.

219
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,080
You can run away no matter how hard you try.

220
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,380
My iron-barred ABCD armor!

221
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:06,720
My iron-barred ABCD armor!

222
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,120
I can't believe you're going to jump into the river.

223
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,360
I can't believe you're going to jump into the river.

224
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
I thought I was going to die!

225
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,280
Stop fooling around!

226
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,980
If you're a member of the enemy, you must have some idea!

227
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,640
You're the one who called the enemy earlier!

228
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,020
What do you mean?

229
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,200
You're taking the debt!

230
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,560
How much do you get if you let me go to them?

231
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,180
No, it's not like that!

232
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,840
Then what is it?

233
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,360
I'm the one who's getting chased by the debt!

234
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,080
Then what is it?

235
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:45,380
Then what is it?

236
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,880
Then what is it?

237
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,140
What?

238
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,380
This is my company.

239
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,260
You're the president?

240
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,200
Yes, I got a bonus.

241
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,500
My name is Ichimonna.

242
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,820
My name is Ichimonna.

243
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,500
He's not smart.

244
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,200
He's about to go bankrupt due to this accident.

245
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,160
I went to the bank to ask for a loan today, but they refused.

246
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,280
I see.

247
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,460
The employees haven't paid their salaries for three months.

248
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
I'm a bad guy.

249
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,420
Why did you think you'd be arrested?

250
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,660
I thought that other people would take over the business.

251
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,580
I thought it would be better if they did.

252
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,120
If the president is arrested, the company will lose its trust and go bankrupt.

253
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:35,960
I see.

254
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,540
Think about what's going to happen next and act.

255
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,320
I'm sure the president will do well.

256
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,560
I'm often told that I'm not planning well.

257
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,760
President!

258
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,620
Hey, everyone's doing their best.

259
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,000
Keiko was upset earlier, so she dropped out of school.

260
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,640
What did you say?

261
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,240
Hey, Keiko, what's up?

262
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,400
She's my only daughter.

263
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,500
She's in elementary school.

264
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,360
She's in the third grade now, but she's weak.

265
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,680
Oh, wait.

266
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,120
You can't show your daughter this kind of school.

267
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,640
I'm sorry.

268
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,520
Keiko, are you okay?

269
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,340
Dad.

270
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,640
How are you feeling, Keiko?

271
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,480
I just had a little dizziness. I'm fine now.

272
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,140
Oh, really?

273
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,540
Dad, what about that girl?

274
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:25,520
Huh?

275
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,220
That girl arrested my dad.

276
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,340
Ugh!

277
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:29,980
What?

278
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,900
To be honest, there's no point in hiding it.

279
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,920
That's right.

280
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,280
Arrested?

281
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:36,960
Yeah.

282
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,500
Arrested her. She was a member of a fan club.

283
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,820
Do you know about the old sumo wrestler?

284
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,200
Oh, my dad loved sumo.

285
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,660
He said he didn't want to see it now.

286
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,880
I used to like it.

287
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,500
Well, I liked it.

288
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,620
Oh.

289
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:57,840
Yeah.

290
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,720
That's right. Let's have some snacks.

291
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,720
Hey, snacks.

292
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,700
I don't have any.

293
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,220
What?

294
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,480
When kids come back from school, they have snacks and soba.

295
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,280
No, I can't even eat enough for a meal every day.

296
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,540
When I was a kid, I had snacks.

297
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,820
It's okay.

298
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,100
I don't really want to eat right now.

299
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,580
Plus, you'll buy me a great present for Christmas next time.

300
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,240
Mika's house set.

301
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:25,740
Mika's house set.

302
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,500
Mika's house set.

303
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,820
Oh. Mika's house set.

304
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,780
Mika's house set.

305
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,120
So you don't have to worry if I can't eat snacks.

306
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,220
Hey, come here.

307
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,500
Hey, it costs tens of thousands to get a full set.

308
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,640
You have debt, don't you?

309
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,040
That's true.

310
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,860
Oh, Mika's house.

311
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,340
Thank you, Mom. I wanted this.

312
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,840
I bought it because Yumi was a good girl.

313
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,100
Come on. Let's go.

314
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,620
I'll buy it for you next Christmas.

315
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,800
I'll buy it for you next Christmas.

316
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,220
Really?

317
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,620
Yeah.

318
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,240
Yay! I hope Christmas comes soon!

319
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,360
You're completely unpredictable.

320
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,620
You'll be the one who gets sad later.

321
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,480
I know that, but...

322
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,800
Hey.

323
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,540
What?

324
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,760
Why are you two so attached to each other?

325
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,880
T-This is the rule of the Taihou fan club.

326
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,700
If we see each other after a long time, we'll stick together and get rid of the sumo.

327
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,600
What?

328
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,160
Hey!

329
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,820
Hey!

330
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:26,720
Hey!

331
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,220
Hey!

332
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,880
Hey!

333
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,140
Where's your wife?

334
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,340
She's living with her daughter.

335
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:35,980
Ouch!

336
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,680
If you go to jail, you'll be left alone, Keiko-chan!

337
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,040
I-I see.

338
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,060
Think about what's going on.

339
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,800
I was hoping that my daughter would be taken care of by her relatives.

340
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,520
Everyone's having a hard time right now.

341
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,360
They need a relative to take care of them.

342
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,620
Besides, it's best for children to live with their parents.

343
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,540
Don't think that you'll ever be taken care of again!

344
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,940
Got it?

345
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,740
Yes.

346
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,080
I won't do it again.

347
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,160
Alright.

348
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,960
So, this is the only problem left.

349
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,300
I'm sure they're trying to get to the station.

350
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,700
What should we do?

351
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,220
That's right!

352
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,040
We have a good idea!

353
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:22,160
Is this my family's motorcycle shop?

354
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,780
Yeah.

355
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,120
If we use the tools over there, we'll be able to remove it, right?

356
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,380
Got it.

357
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,900
I'll go pick you up in a minute.

358
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,040
Corona

359
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,640
Yes.

360
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,420
Yes.

361
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:43,820
Yes.

362
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,340
Yes.

363
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,420
Yes.

364
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:45,880
Yes.

365
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,040
Yes.

366
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,660
Yes.

367
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,220
Yes.

368
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,820
Yes.

369
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,340
Yes.

370
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,360
Yes.

371
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,020
Yes.

372
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,100
What are you talking about? Get us on board!

373
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,760
We can't ride three more people!

374
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,800
Are you going to betray us?

375
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,480
I'm doing this for my boss!

376
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,840
I'm going to become a human being on this machine!

377
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,220
Damn it!

378
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,540
That's right! Become a human being, Ryo-tsu!

379
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,780
You betrayed us with the Bulbaba!

380
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,700
Ryo-sama! Stop making more mistakes!

381
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,120
M-Maria, you too!

382
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,200
I...

383
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,060
It seems the time has finally come to be considerate, Ryo-san.

384
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,140
I see. So Maria and the others were telling you where I was.

385
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,880
Today's a bonus day, right?

386
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,700
Yes, I understand.

387
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I understand. We'll be there soon.

388
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,260
Exactly. Do you understand the horror of the ABCD envelope, Ryo-san?

389
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,900
The ABCD envelope?

390
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,420
A stands for Asato Ai's A.

391
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,680
I'm sorry, Ryo-sama. This is a chance for you to become a human being.

392
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,340
Become a clean body without any impurities, and with me...

393
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,220
I'm not joking!

394
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,620
B stands for Volvo Saigo's B.

395
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,180
I've been hired by the shop.

396
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,100
I've been hired once.

397
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,700
I'll do my best until I'm hired.

398
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,680
And D stands for Honda's Da-no...

399
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,440
D.

400
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,180
That's pretty bold.

401
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,120
And Volvo starts with V, not B!

402
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,640
Don't worry about the details!

403
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,580
Wait. Then who's C?

404
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,960
If it's a name with a C...

405
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,480
It's a name with a C.

406
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,120
Terai?

407
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,640
Nakagawa?

408
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,640
Reiko?

409
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,520
No.

410
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:48,880
Ohara?

411
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,360
It's not them.

412
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,020
It's not you, is it?

413
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,300
No, it's not me.

414
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,320
It's the C.

415
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,300
It's this guy!

416
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,840
Sorry to keep you waiting.

417
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,440
Sakonji Tatsunosuke Sanjou!

418
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,040
Where's the C?

419
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,940
If you flip the Tatsunosuke's horn, you'll get it.

420
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,880
How annoying.

421
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,160
Now's your chance to hit your boy again.

422
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,620
I'll show you how to do it.

423
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:23,540
If that's the case, these non-sold DOKIMEHO goods are all yours, Sakonji-kun.

424
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,760
Thank you very much.

425
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,740
So, you bought them, didn't you?

426
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,740
Huh?

427
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,700
By any chance, you guys also...

428
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,060
I-I didn't get a model gun or anything.

429
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,860
A year's worth of shoujo manga and a bare ticket to an amusement park...

430
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,040
A-a high-class este's invitation...

431
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,240
I knew it!

432
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,200
Ryotsu...

433
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,580
You know this, don't you?

434
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,500
As a mania, you can't miss this opportunity.

435
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,260
Right, Dori-!

436
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,540
Dori, Dori, Dori, Dori!

437
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,300
Dori, Dori, Dori, Dori, Dori, Dori, Dori, Dori, Dori!

438
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,960
Almost time.

439
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,020
Our wishes of years are about to come true.

440
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,220
Ugh!

441
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,300
D- damn!

442
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,600
We can't run away with something like this!

443
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,340
S-sorry.

444
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,600
That's right!

445
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,900
Take this!

446
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,560
Take that!

447
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:14,940
I'm also a card!

448
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,820
This room!

449
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,720
He just fell asleep.

450
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,680
He's weak. Don't make a fuss.

451
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,320
I'm sorry.

452
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,720
I came here to talk about that.

453
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:37,980
Listen to me.

454
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,280
She's his daughter.

455
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,720
But she's a very mean family.

456
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,320
His company is not doing well.

457
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,560
His salary hasn't been paid for months.

458
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,980
He's suffering from a bad life.

459
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,320
His wife is sick.

460
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,940
His daughter is sick.

461
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,220
But he doesn't have money to buy her medicine.

462
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,060
That's so mean!

463
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,580
He even tried to commit a crime.

464
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,740
Is that true?

465
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,120
Yes, almost.

466
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,480
Is there anyone more unfortunate than him?

467
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,840
No, there isn't.

468
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,620
I've decided.

469
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,840
I'll give you this bonus.

470
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,480
I'll give it all to him.

471
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,640
Is that okay?

472
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,520
A man doesn't have a second word.

473
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,760
You should use it carefully.

474
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,000
Okay.

475
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,760
Do you understand?

476
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,540
Yes, of course.

477
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,200
Ryo!

478
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,020
As expected of you, Ryo.

479
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,140
I was just a little scared.

480
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,760
Ryo, I've got you back.

481
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,200
Being robbed of my model gun is not good.

482
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,060
I'll go get the key.

483
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,240
Save the weak.

484
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,900
It's my way to life.

485
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,060
I'm Ryo.

486
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
You're a good boy.

487
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,500
I heard you, Senpai.

488
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,540
I have all the bonuses.

489
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,740
The owner of the town fair is about to go bankrupt.

490
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,980
It's amazing.

491
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,280
It's not easy to do it normally.

492
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,060
I don't have the right to give a bonus to someone else.

493
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,860
You fool.

494
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,760
But...

495
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,660
I just temporarily left it there to fool the debt collector.

496
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,720
He should know that.

497
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,500
I'm going to go and collect it.

498
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,300
I knew it would be like that.

499
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,460
Yes.

500
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,300
Mr. Ryoichi.

501
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,260
Thank you so much for yesterday.

502
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,760
It's not thank you.

503
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,880
Here.

504
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,500
Oh.

505
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,900
Thank you so much.

506
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,700
Don't give me a hand.

507
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,820
It's the bonus I gave you yesterday.

508
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,060
I told you I know.

509
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,180
Yes, of course.

510
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,740
I know what you did.

511
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,760
The bonus is the salary of the employees and the company's debt.

512
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,800
And I gave it to you as a Christmas present for your daughter.

513
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,760
Well, then.

514
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,440
No, my bonus is...

515
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,920
Yes.

516
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,160
Ryoichi's love was not wasted even by a penny.

517
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,260
I used it all.

518
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,480
I told you I know.

519
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,600
That's what I meant.

520
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:25,980
I'm back.

521
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,580
Oh, Ryoichi's uncle.

522
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,900
Keiko was so happy last night.

523
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,180
Thanks to Ryoichi, Mika-chan's house was changed.

524
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,300
Well...

525
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,780
Yes.

526
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,280
This is a present.

527
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,400
Present!

528
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,460
Th-This is...

529
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,560
My daughter drew it with all her might. Please accept it.

530
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,680
This is my bonus for this year.

531
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,320
Let's play, grandpa!

532
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,220
No, I'm playing with dolls!

533
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,700
The End

534
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,920
If you gather up everyone here

535
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:51,400
It's like a dream, the final energy

536
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,700
Looking at tomorrow, believing in yesterday

537
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,500
Drawing the universe, standing on the ground

538
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,640
A turtle-like star is spinning, drawing a circle

539
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,500
Isn't that good?

540
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,200
There's no reason to say it!

541
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,280
Damn it! That Honzara guy!

542
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,480
He's not my wife, but he's messing with Kyoko!

543
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,800
I'm getting angry!

544
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,740
In this case, I'll use the technique of the Ryotsu-ryu Migawari to trick him!

545
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,420
Next time, Honzara Migawari!

546
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,660
I'm counting on you!
