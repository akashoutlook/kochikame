1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,140
I look up at the sunset floating on the river

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:29,980
and fly to the place where I found my love

4
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,220
I laughed the

5
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:36,400
Like the nice sound of the good energy somewhere

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,740
meets the putst

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,540
and even the evil blond

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,060
The cityscape is a bit gentle

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,300
Theará

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,400
The symposiums were hung by the слыш pushing the window

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,220
There is the

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,760
The Master.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,980
What the

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,080
what's the matter?

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,520
Zarwell.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,200
The memories of the "Yatai"!

17
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,900
How is it?

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,720
Oh, Reiko-kun, it looks good on you.

19
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,360
Chief...

20
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,800
Is this fine?

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:49,880
Is this fine?

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,720
Is something wrong?

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,900
No, it's just...

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,680
Kei-chan, the kimono of a man should be closed lower.

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,780
I did what you told me to do!

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,000
By the way, I can't see Ryo-san running to the fire.

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,360
Ryo-chan is going to pick up Lemon-chan.

28
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,600
Thanks for waiting!

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,220
Oh, cute!

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,760
Yeah, it looks good on you.

31
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,560
Really?

32
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,300
That's the spirit of the Edo area!

33
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,020
Is that so?

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,620
There are many people, so don't get separated.

35
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,580
Yeah!

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,180
Alright, let's go!

37
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,820
If we don't hurry, we'll miss the shrine maiden!

38
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,440
Wait, Ryo-chan!

39
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,440
I'm going!

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,440
Even though it's a secret, be careful not to get drunk or fight.

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,400
Yes!

42
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,240
That's good.

43
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,680
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

44
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,480
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,740
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

46
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,600
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

47
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,100
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

48
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,600
Nice!

49
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,040
How is it?

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,760
It's quite good.

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,900
Eh, don't you also feel dizzy because you wanted to get up?

52
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,000
No, I'm playing Lemon's role.

53
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,080
Or so you might say...

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,720
I can see that you're holding back.

55
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,940
Kankichi!

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,580
What?

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,420
I want to hit that big taiko, Lemon!

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,600
Me?

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,480
Okay, leave it to me!

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Hey, let me hit this one too!

61
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,200
Oh, Ryo-san, that's good.

62
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,900
Don't hesitate.

63
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,420
Okay, here, Lemon.

64
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,440
Don't hesitate, just hit it as hard as you can.

65
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,680
Yeah!

66
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,300
Good, good!

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,300
That's the way!

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,400
You're on the right rhythm!

69
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,560
You're a real adult.

70
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,860
Goldfish scooping, huh?

71
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,740
Okay, that's it!

72
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,320
Lemon, let's go get some goldfish!

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,860
And then we'll go and get some dolls!

74
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,460
Senpai, you're really good.

75
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,980
Let's go!

76
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,900
Goldfish scooping is all about spirit!

77
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,960
Let's go!

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,460
Let's go!

79
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,440
Let's go!

80
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,500
Let's go!

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,320
Let's go!

82
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,060
Let's go!

83
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,440
Let's go!

84
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,200
Let's go!

85
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,320
Now we have a lot!

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,680
How's that?

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,100
Please, don't bother!

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,540
It's gonna break!

89
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,100
Yeah!

90
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,000
It's gonna be great!

91
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,960
Don't underestimate a innocent police officer!

92
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,020
I'm here!

93
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,020
I'm sorry!

94
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,040
Here it is!

95
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,400
So much!

96
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,940
I feel like I've forgotten something.

97
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,920
Oh, no! What did I do?

98
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,540
Lemon!

99
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,740
Hey, Lemon!

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,840
Where are you? Lemon!

101
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,080
Lemon!

102
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,160
What's wrong, senpai?

103
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,640
What's wrong? What's wrong?

104
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,380
Didn't you see Lemon?

105
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,860
Lemon was looking at candy craftsman Nessie.

106
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,280
I saw him at the cotton candy shop.

107
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:33,840
I see.

108
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,360
Lemon!

109
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:40,840
Huh?

110
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,760
There he is!

111
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,000
Lemon!

112
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:43,820
Huh?

113
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,900
No, no.

114
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,360
Lemon!

115
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

116
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,080
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,520
Maybe it's Kan-chan.

118
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,440
What?

119
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,260
It's Miharu!

120
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,100
It's Miharu!

121
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,940
You were at a candy shop with that maiden old lady?

122
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,140
Yes, it's been a while.

123
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,180
To meet her at this place.

124
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,420
Lemon!

125
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,600
"I'm so happy!"

126
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,180
"I'm so happy!"

127
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:23,660
"I'm so happy!"

128
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,620
"It's over!"

129
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,620
"What's this, Kankichi?"

130
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,520
"Are you here to see the festival?"

131
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,120
"Well, after class, I can go to the shrine!"

132
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,120
"Well, after class, I can go to the shrine!"

133
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,480
"Hey!"

134
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,180
"Oh, well..."

135
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,340
"Oh, well..."

136
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,360
"I'm so happy!"

137
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,840
"We're starting the child shrine!"

138
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,200
"Come on!"

139
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,340
"Yes!"

140
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,500
"Oh!"

141
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,360
"Hurry up! Hurry up!"

142
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,600
"We need to find the best spot!"

143
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,420
"Yeah!"

144
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,520
"Yari! You're the best!"

145
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,320
"I'm the best!"

146
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,460
"Hey, that's great!"

147
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,220
"Oh, Bunta and Akira from Tonorimochi!"

148
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,740
"But... The HISA is at first..."

149
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,480
"Oh,53!

150
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,540
"Hey, Yari...

151
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:30,980
"Hey, Yari...

152
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,320
"Hey, Yari...

153
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,040
"Hey, Yari...

154
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,500
"Hey, Yari...

155
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,420
"Hey, Yari...

156
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,740
"Hey, Yari...

157
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,000
"Hey, Yari...

158
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,840
"Hey, Yari...

159
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,020
"Hey, Yari...

160
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,340
Let's go!

161
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,120
Let's go!

162
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,420
Let's go!

163
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,280
Let's go!

164
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,320
You're really something!

165
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,320
Yeah!

166
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,080
It's hot!

167
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,480
It's hot!

168
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:08,800
It's hot!

169
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,580
It's hot!

170
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,220
It's hot!

171
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,760
All right, Chinkichi!

172
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,680
chinkichi!

173
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,380
It's an attack from God Wind!

174
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,580
What?!

175
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,020
Yeah!

176
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,940
Go!

177
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,460
That's it.

178
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,040
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

179
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,980
I told you not to carry the mikoshi to the fight!

180
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,040
You are not allowed to carry mikoshi!

181
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,420
It's boring that mikoshi is not allowed to be carried even though tomorrow is the real festival.

182
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,060
What, you can just sneak it in and carry it.

183
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,580
What?

184
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,060
It's strange.

185
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,340
There are always yakisoba and okonomiyaki stalls there.

186
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,420
Oh, from Miharu's grandmother.

187
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,640
Maybe something happened to her.

188
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,680
I think we should go to the back of this shrine.

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,800
Let's go!

190
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,760
Yeah!

191
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,460
No, grandma, you have to sleep.

192
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,820
When I hear that festival, my body starts moving on its own.

193
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,720
Didn't I tell you not to move?

194
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,360
I'm fine for a bit.

195
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,280
What's wrong?

196
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,400
What?

197
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm so sick of this.

198
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,120
Grandma!

199
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,060
Hey, what's wrong?

200
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,960
Let me go.

201
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,100
I have to go to the shop.

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,880
You can't do that.

203
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,280
I have to go to the shop.

204
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,560
Otherwise, I may not be able to get the place.

205
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,420
Is that what that gorilla is saying?

206
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,120
I don't care about the place.

207
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,680
He will take care of all festivals around here.

208
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,880
I prefer to find a place for myself.

209
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,560
I always thought the best idea was to leave the shop,

210
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,420
but I didn't have time to do that.

211
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,940
That's what makes us lovable.

212
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,420
You're right.

213
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,220
Good.

214
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,320
We'll do it instead.

215
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,540
What?

216
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,980
If we do it, we can do it.

217
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,520
As promised, we'll show the shop.

218
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,040
Okay?

219
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,280
All right.

220
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,740
What a nice idea!

221
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,360
All right.

222
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,680
I will help you, too.

223
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,780
Grandma, rest in peace and rest.

224
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,180
You two.

225
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,880
You guys...

226
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,440
I won't forgive you for your half-hearted work.

227
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,780
I'm counting on you for today's Yoimiya and tomorrow's Honmiya.

228
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,500
Leave it to me!

229
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,920
Thank you, Kanchan, Ton-chan, and Chinkichi-kun.

230
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll be waiting for you.

231
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,320
Okay, everything's ready.

232
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,760
We've turned on the lights, and we've prepared the propane.

233
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,660
Then let's start cooking. First, let's prepare the Okonomiyaki flour and vegetables.

234
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,160
Miharu-chan, prepare the packs and the chopsticks.

235
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:16,900
Okay.

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,160
Ton-pei, light the fire. Let's start with the yakisoba.

237
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,160
Chinkichi, use the fire to lure the customers in.

238
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,740
Okay!

239
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,700
Fire!

240
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,760
The fire is too strong!

241
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,240
No, no, no! Don't drink the water!

242
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,280
"The highest mountain in the Akagi Mountains,

243
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,760
couldn't be separated from the cute, innocent you guys!"

244
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,500
Don't stay there…

245
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:16,100
Kankichi, the Okonomiyaki became a monkfish.

246
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,080
I was too indecisive.

247
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,600
Today, I'll use the flour…

248
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,320
Ebonhe

249
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,880
Yeah it looks pretty good!

250
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,320
Now here we go!

251
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:36,900
Yeah!

252
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,660
Welcome!

253
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,900
Ah, Sanba!

254
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,000
Why do you guys have to be doing this!

255
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,400
It's not that important! Something happened!

256
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,060
Huh?

257
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,340
Huh? I don't know what it is, but it's a pretty cheap restaurant.

258
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,360
Kan-chan.

259
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,020
Shut up. You're in my way. Go home!

260
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,260
What's with you? We're trying to buy it for you.

261
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,220
That's right! We're customers!

262
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,180
Customers are gods.

263
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,120
You're so sweet. Did you say something?

264
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,120
No, nothing.

265
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,120
Three yakisoba, please. I'll serve you.

266
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,820
Good.

267
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,680
Here you go.

268
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,220
Here you go.

269
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,340
You did it, Kankichi.

270
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,760
You're in my way.

271
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,400
It's a special yakisoba with red pepper and red pepper paste.

272
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,360
Hey, you guys.

273
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,900
What the hell is this?

274
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,820
A bearded gorilla.

275
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,680
The End

276
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,300
The End

277
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,260
This is where Mrs. Tomei's yakisoba should be.

278
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,340
What are you talking about?

279
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,800
Yeah, yeah. Who are you going to refuse to open a shop?

280
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,720
Kankichi.

281
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm going to help the shop with Mrs. Tomei.

282
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,240
What?

283
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,400
Sorry.

284
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,180
Don't be so rude.

285
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,340
I'm not rude.

286
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,560
I'm going to beat up the bearded gorilla.

287
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,180
There's no need for a bearded gorilla.

288
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,520
I'm sorry, bearded...

289
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,720
No, Kankichi.

290
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,580
What's wrong? Are you drunk?

291
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,680
Yeah.

292
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,820
It's true.

293
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,060
It's like Mrs. Tomei and her granddaughter are there.

294
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:35,820
Oh.

295
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,320
Oh.

296
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,140
My grandmother can't go out of the shop.

297
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,380
I can't go out of the shop.

298
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,340
I can't go out of the shop.

299
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,460
I can't go out of the shop.

300
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,020
So I open the shop as an extension of this.

301
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,740
I can't go out of the shop, so I can't go in.

302
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,560
The problem is that we're not thinking of giving up.

303
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,820
That's why I'll only open the shop.

304
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:57,840
I can't.

305
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,400
Well, you old man.

306
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,360
If you don't go out of the shop, I'll break the whole house down.

307
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,620
Because, there are no shortage of young people in the school.

308
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,080
Yes, but...

309
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,240
What are you talking about?

310
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,460
I'm running the shop instead of you.

311
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:09,520
What?

312
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,600
Do you understand what you're saying?

313
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,360
Oh, I see.

314
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,600
But it's not a child's play. It's not a play.

315
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,580
We're not playing.

316
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,540
No matter what you say, I won't get out of here.

317
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,820
Me too.

318
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,520
Me too.

319
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,100
Big brother.

320
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,740
You're a good boy.

321
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,060
You're a good boy.

322
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,120
I'll let you go today.

323
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,040
But if you're in trouble, be ready.

324
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,040
I'm about to puke.

325
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,400
Thank you, Kan-chan, Ton-chan, and Chinkichi.

326
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,200
What? I'm not scared of a hedgehog.

327
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,900
Kan-chan.

328
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:03,960
What?

329
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,440
It's okay. It's okay.

330
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,620
I'm just a little nervous.

331
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,800
Yeah.

332
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,220
You're so noisy.

333
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:28,940
You did a great job.

334
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,220
Thank you.

335
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,960
I thought it would be easier.

336
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,880
It was all about failure at first.

337
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,060
What? It's a big deal for the first time.

338
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,960
That's right. Tomorrow is the real night.

339
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,480
I'll do my best from morning.

340
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,080
You can rest in peace.

341
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,540
Yeah.

342
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,640
Yeah.

343
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,760
Yeah.

344
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,500
Yeah.

345
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,240
Yeah.

346
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,660
Yeah.

347
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,780
Yeah.

348
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,300
Yeah.

349
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:58,640
Yeah.

350
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,160
Yeah.

351
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,240
Yeah.

352
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,160
Yeah.

353
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:03,920
Yeah.

354
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,240
Yeah.

355
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,120
Yeah.

356
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,160
Yeah.

357
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,180
Yeah.

358
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,600
It was so cool.

359
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,240
Yeah.

360
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,080
What will happen to the stall if that happens?

361
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,920
It's been a while since we've been here.

362
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,880
We'll protect it!

363
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,060
Are you serious, Kankichi?

364
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,240
What if the storm blows up the stall?

365
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,960
We'll be out of business!

366
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,180
Shut up!

367
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,620
Why, grandma?

368
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,620
You don't have to go that far.

369
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,000
Just a little bit is enough.

370
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:09,200
We're going to do it.

371
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,400
I don't want to just sit around and do nothing.

372
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,460
Tan-chan!

373
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,860
Me too! Me too!

374
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,680
Kankichi!

375
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,060
Kankichi!

376
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,220
Kankichi!

377
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,800
Kankichi!

378
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,860
Kankichi!

379
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,100
Kankichi!

380
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,240
Kankichi!

381
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,340
Kankichi!

382
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,580
Kankichi!

383
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,400
Kankichi!

384
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,480
Tan-chan!

385
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,560
Tan-chan, what's wrong?

386
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,980
Do you want to go?

387
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,460
Yes.

388
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,100
Peek-a-boo!

389
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,240
Peek-a-boo!

390
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,740
Peek-a-boo!

391
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,100
Peek-a-boo!

392
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,180
Peek-a-boo!

393
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,220
Peek-a-boo!

394
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,180
I did it!

395
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,580
I'm going to tie the firewood to the tree with this string!

396
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,660
Hang in there!

397
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,380
Alright!

398
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:22,820
Ugh!

399
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,560
Alright!

400
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,260
We're going to be fine for a while!

401
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,240
We have to be patient until morning!

402
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,780
We can't sleep!

403
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,980
Y-Yeah!

404
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,860
We're going to be blown off!

405
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:45,860
Yeah!

406
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,180
It's our stall!

407
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,760
Ewww!

408
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,200
Ugh!

409
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,480
My seat!

410
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,260
Damn!

411
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,580
It's no good!

412
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,140
The other stalls will be blown off!

413
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,580
Ugh!

414
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,380
What should we do?

415
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,860
If other stalls get blown off, this won't be a festival!

416
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,880
And we can't protect all of the stalls on our own!

417
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,640
Ugh!

418
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,280
What should I do? Damn! What should I do?

419
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,460
Who is it? What are you doing there?

420
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,820
You guys...

421
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,820
Higun... Gorilla...

422
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,280
If we get kicked out of the store, we won't be able to hold the festival anymore!

423
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,860
Gather the ropes and tie the people in the store together!

424
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,940
Gather as many young people as you can!

425
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,800
Yes sir!

426
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,140
Oh, and...

427
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,780
Take off your kappa.

428
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,520
Yes sir!

429
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,360
Damn, you've seen it all.

430
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,880
Let's go, you guys.

431
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,680
Come on, do your best!

432
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,400
Huh?

433
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,300
Tomorrow is the festival too.

434
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:19,960
Yeah!

435
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,920
Ah, bubor.

436
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,320
I see...

437
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,100
You really did it, right?

438
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,740
Thank you.

439
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,460
I did it too, did I not?

440
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:01,840
Yeah!

441
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,060
We did our best.

442
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,940
Watch out!!

443
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,620
Yes sir!

444
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,320
What are you doing?

445
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,760
That happened?

446
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,520
Kan-chan was very manly at that time.

447
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't think about it later.

448
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,500
I don't need to do this.

449
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,900
I'm always at the station.

450
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,140
Come and play with me sometimes.

451
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,660
Yes.

452
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,520
Bye bye.

453
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,500
Lemon, lemon.

454
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,620
Kankichi!

455
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,180
What?

456
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,180
Kankichi, you were here.

457
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,820
I looked for you.

458
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,600
You're right, Ryu-chan.

459
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,940
It was a lot of people.

460
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,240
I said I was looking for you.

461
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,560
You're right.

462
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:49,920
You're really good to me.

463
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,640
I mean, I'm better than you.

464
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,080
But it was fun.

465
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,500
The festival.

466
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,440
I see.

467
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,000
Here we go.

468
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,640
Kan-chan's children.

469
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,920
It's like her.

470
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,000
Really.

471
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,080
When she's doing that, she's like Ryu-chan's child.

472
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,460
You're right.

473
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,060
Okay, Lemon.

474
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,540
You can make your own cotton candy over there.

475
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,100
Want to go?

476
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,180
Really, Kankichi?

477
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,660
Okay, let's go.

478
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,500
Yeah.

479
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:37,700
*

480
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,080
*

481
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,920
*

482
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,880
*

483
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,080
10 games, 10 games, I'll write down my thoughts and then go to sleep

484
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,920
I always wear sandals, always have scandals, don't worry

485
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,360
Don't worry

486
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,520
I play the Kooner every day

487
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,660
Every day

488
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,940
I threw my boredom away in the end-of-the-year book

489
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,800
I'm an idiot with no sense of purpose

490
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,520
I'm innocent, I'm poor, that's a piece of cake

491
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:22,800
Right?

492
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,940
I just do what I want, whatever I want

493
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,960
One lightning strike and a smoke from under my head

494
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,540
If I run and run away, it's right on the camera

495
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,620
It's perfect

496
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,860
On a flower- flavored head

497
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,160
A mass-produced typhoon

498
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,400
I'll find my way back

499
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,120
libro.com

500
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,780
10 games, 10 games, I'll write my thoughts and then go to sleep

501
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,340
forward leaving reward

502
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,040
Working classroom

503
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,440
for work

504
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,240
I'm feeling dizzy

505
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,740
and dozing off

506
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,260
in the other room

507
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,480
Mr. and Mrs. Yan, Mr. Yan

508
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:58,920
Mr. and Mrs. Yan

509
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,160
we're all

"Ha Ha"

520
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,000
The club president

521
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,140
started to dance?

522
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,140
I'm so embarrassed

523
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,180
It doesn't suit me!

524
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,180
What, you're a temple?

525
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,340
What, Borubo and Sahonji too?

526
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,100
Wait a minute!

527
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,360
There's something wrong with this!

528
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,020
Alright! I'll join too!
