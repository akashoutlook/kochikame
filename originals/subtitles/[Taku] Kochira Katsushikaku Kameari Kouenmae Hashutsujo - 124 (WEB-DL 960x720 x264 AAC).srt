1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:04,860
You

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,200
Watch

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,340
TV

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,040
You

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,460
You

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,480
Your

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:09,560
Room

8
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,700
And

9
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,440
Get

10
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,040
Away

11
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,500
From

12
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:12,640
Me

13
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,400
You

14
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,600
You

15
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:14,820
Look

16
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:20,920
Your

17
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:21,640
Room

18
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,040
River

19
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,060
You

20
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,260
Look

21
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,460
At

22
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:26,980
The

23
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,700
Sun

24
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:29,960
That

25
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,260
I

26
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:30,420
When

27
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:30,520
I

28
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,300
Away

29
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,080
From

30
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,100
Me

31
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,180
You

32
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,420
You

33
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,160
To

34
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,080
Meet

35
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,140
Me

36
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,620
You

37
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,540
Suddenly

38
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,040
You

39
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,640
You

40
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,000
To

41
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,160
Me

42
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,260
Me

43
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,120
I

44
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,140
See

45
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,180
You

46
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,620
You

47
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,380
When

48
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:51,820
Get

49
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,060
You

50
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,140
Julia

51
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,060
Yeah

52
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,300
Music

53
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:54,760
Air

54
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,080
Music

55
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,880
Yeah

56
00:00:59,880 --> 00:00:59,900
Music

57
00:00:59,900 --> 00:00:59,920
Music

58
00:00:59,920 --> 00:00:59,940
Music

59
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,780
It's so sweet

60
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,720
From the water of the Tungari Boshi

61
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,320
To the Kaishakuten

62
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,280
The sun sets

63
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:24,000
Tomorrow will end like this

64
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,280
The time will end, Kazushika Shibamata

65
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,520
I realized that I lost happiness

66
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,720
Because I'm such an idiot

67
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,500
I'm sorry

68
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,100
I did it! It's decided!

69
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:58,780
Good!

70
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,000
He's going to the final with an overwhelming strength

71
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,980
Well, that's the way he is

72
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,060
Speaking of this place Sagonji

73
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,760
Saori

74
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,000
The image has been completely settled

75
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,320
He is originally a strong fighter

76
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,560
Well, the final opponent is

77
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,020
Mr. Olbo is also doing his best

78
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,020
He started judo in earnest

79
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,980
He is still in time

80
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,340
Isn't that a sign?

81
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
He has improved a lot

82
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,520
It's time

83
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,920
That's it

84
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,220
Red fairy wins

85
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,240
I did it! I won!

86
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,140
Sagonji vs. Olbo

87
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,820
This is going to be a fun battle

88
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,080
Senior

89
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,640
But other martial arts are unknown

90
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,780
Because it is judo

91
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,860
This is Sagonji's victory

92
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,840
The career is too different

93
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,940
I have to try the game

94
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,940
That's right

95
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,180
Because there is also the fate of time

96
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,980
Right

97
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,440
Sagonji is a guy who can throw all his strength even if the opponent is a girl or a child

98
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,200
I won't

99
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,900
Red Sagonji Tatsunosuke

100
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,860
White Olbo Saigou

101
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,680
Come on

102
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,060
You've come all the way here

103
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,540
I'll fight all my strength

104
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,440
Sagonji

105
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,920
Let's start

106
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,000
I will go

107
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
I really do

108
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,980
I will go

109
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,560
BORBOO!

110
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,980
What?!

111
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,820
You've improved, Borbo. But you still have a long way to go.

112
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,780
I'll finish you off with one last blow!

113
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,780
Go, go, Bobby! Go, go!

114
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,200
Go, go, Bobby! Go, go!

115
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,460
What? J-Jody?

116
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,360
Do you know him?

117
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,640
Jody is Borbo's lover!

118
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,960
What?!

119
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,040
I-I see.

120
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,120
I thought you were a true fighter.

121
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,160
You've become stronger by lying so much!

122
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,640
Go, go, Bobby! Go, go!

123
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,300
Go, go, Bobby! Go, go!

124
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,440
Wh-What?

125
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,640
What happened?

126
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,720
One, two, three, four!

127
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,900
Borbo is the last!

128
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,100
Borbo won!

129
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,520
N-No way!

130
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,360
You did it, Bobby!

131
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,960
My legs just slipped!

132
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,220
Over there!

133
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,900
See? It's sticking out!

134
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,480
N-No, this is...

135
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,540
I see. You're sticking out like a cheerleader.

136
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,560
TsukibÃ©, you're a pervert!

137
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,880
No!

138
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,320
I can't believe you just did that!

139
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,640
My legs are stuck in the dopamines.

140
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:09,220
Even officer Watsons said it there.

141
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,580
I can't believe that you're a pervert.

142
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,020
I am the best fighter in the world.

143
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm the man of the world!

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm the man of the world!

145
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:17,960
My legs are in so much more control.

146
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,620
I won't let you win this time.

147
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,120
Hi!

148
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,340
Hi! Is Bobby here?

149
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,060
Hey, Bobby. Did you have a nap?

150
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,400
Jody, what's that outfit?

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,920
I came to Japan, so I thought I'd have you practice judo in earnest.

152
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,520
Where's the master of this dojo?

153
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,660
That's him.

154
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,940
Oh, you're the one who lost to Bobby in the Hanachi Bu.

155
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,540
Sakonji, Jody isn't in the wrong.

156
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,760
I-I know.

157
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,240
Come on.

158
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,280
Here I go.

159
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,360
You seem to be doing a little, but you're still too naive.

160
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,060
Don't make a fuss again.

161
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,480
I won't make a fuss about who the opponent is!

162
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,820
Are you okay, Jody?

163
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,100
This is the first time I've lost to a man this perfectly.

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,120
I-I can't believe this music!

165
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,700
I saw it! I saw it! I saw it!

166
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,880
Papa!

167
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,500
As I thought, Captain Bugryu!

168
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,860
Captain Bugryu?

169
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,760
Didn't Captain Bugryu say he would make a man who defeated Jody his wife?

170
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,840
What?

171
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,540
Don't be so reckless!

172
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,600
Bobby!

173
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,520
Jody! What's wrong? What's wrong with you?

174
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,860
I'm going to make this man my bride.

175
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,200
I'm getting ready for the wedding.

176
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,560
Jody!

177
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,740
Bobby!

178
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,560
Jody...

179
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,100
What the hell?

180
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,280
Jody...

181
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,540
Don't worry about it.

182
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,820
I understand, Boss!

183
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,560
I think they were carried to the New Mexico Military Base.

184
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,840
I'm going to find them.

185
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:43,900
I'm going to find them.

186
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,120
I'm going to find them.

187
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,200
What's this?

188
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,880
It's a wedding hall under construction.

189
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,060
Captain Bugryu seems to be making a wedding hall in the base for the two of them.

190
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,100
Is that father serious?

191
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,780
Ryotsu! Please! Do something!

192
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,260
I know! This kind of ridiculous wedding won't be for anyone!

193
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,080
I'm going to destroy this wedding!

194
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,740
I'm going to destroy this wedding!

195
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,900
I'm going to destroy this wedding!

196
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,580
I'm going to destroy this wedding!

197
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,300
I'm going to destroy this wedding!

198
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,280
I'm going to destroy this wedding!

199
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,240
I'll do it myself.

200
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,860
Father, what did you do?

201
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,340
Father!

202
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,600
I'm going to destroy this village!

203
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,140
We have no choice but to buy materials from outside.

204
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,960
It's the second floor.

205
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,340
The window over there is Jody-san's room.

206
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,040
I see.

207
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,400
Is it really that room?

208
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,540
There's no doubt about that.

209
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,940
Shut up! You won't tell me, will you?

210
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,360
Jody!

211
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,480
Bobby! Is that you, Bobby?

212
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,520
Why are you here?

213
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,140
I came to bring you back.

214
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,640
Me?

215
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,840
No.

216
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,240
I won't forgive you.

217
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,480
Are you going to marry Sakonji?

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,840
It's your fault, Bobby.

219
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,580
If you had told me earlier

220
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,600
that you were going to marry Sakonji...

221
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,820
Jody!

222
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,740
What was that?

223
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,760
It's Daddy.

224
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,460
If he finds us, he'll kill us.

225
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:47,980
Run!

226
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,280
But...

227
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,660
Hurry!

228
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,460
Hey!

229
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,120
Don't be so slow!

230
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,120
Good night, Master.

231
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,220
Good night.

232
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,760
You guys...

233
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,660
Hey, we're here to help you.

234
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,340
Yeah, we should.

235
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,780
Hohoho!

236
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,100
We're here!

237
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,880
We're here!

238
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,680
Hey, which is Sakonji's room?

239
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,680
She's calling me.

240
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,300
I don't want to be here alone.

241
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,180
I need to tell her where she can live in.

242
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,760
What do you mean, "this"?

243
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,560
Don't touch her.

244
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,180
I'll kill you.

245
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,400
Yes, I do.

246
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,820
But you...

247
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,160
You're not mine.

248
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:33,860
No, I didn't touch you.

249
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,440
Babe, everything is fine.

250
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,060
Happy?

251
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,420
Johnny!

252
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:37,820
What?

253
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm teaching judo to the soldiers here.

254
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,180
Everyone here calls me "Master" and respects me.

255
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,340
Even the private ones are nice.

256
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,100
Ryotsu, what am I called in the Katsushika Shrine?

257
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,340
Hanaji Keio no Sakonji.

258
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,680
Right? I'm the judo master, Hanaji Keio no Sakonji!

259
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,080
As long as I live in the Katsushika, I will follow you, Hanaji Keio no Sakonji, all my life!

260
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,080
I wonder if you're right.

261
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,780
I've decided!

262
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,820
I will destroy the dirty image of the Katsushika and start over in America!

263
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,540
But you have to marry Jody for that.

264
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,140
You hated Namami's woman.

265
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,700
I noticed recently that Jody is not like Saori in the Doki-Memo.

266
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,500
What?

267
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,760
She has a hairstyle like this.

268
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,460
She has eyes like this.

269
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,720
She has a nose like this.

270
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,100
She has a mouth like this.

271
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,240
And she has a contour like this.

272
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,320
And finally, she has a skin color like this.

273
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,460
See! Saori is like that!

274
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
Ryotsu, this is a miracle!

275
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,500
I just changed everything!

276
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,520
You forgot something important!

277
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,540
If you live in America, you can't do Doki-Memo!

278
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,960
And Jody is jealous!

279
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,440
Even if she is a game character, she won't forgive cheating!

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,060
I'm ready!

281
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,860
I will forget about Saori today!

282
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,900
From now on, Jody will be my Saori!

283
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,140
Oh, Jody...

284
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,360
What is he talking about?

285
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,060
Is this Saori?

286
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,820
Oh, this is Saori!

287
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:45,840
Is he speaking Takumi's voice?

288
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,580
So, everyone is like this.

289
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,100
UtyÐ½ÑÑÑ, who is he?!

290
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,280
Te-te-te-te-te-te...

291
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,320
Takumi...

292
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,460
I'm not talking about Takumi!

293
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,940
Somebody is talking about Saori!

294
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,260
I think she is speaking Takumi's voice.

295
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,700
I'm sorry...

296
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:55,740
What am I supposed to say?

297
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,660
Say something about Saori.

298
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:56,820
I don't understand what you are talking about.

299
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,320
Yes.

300
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,100
Yeah, we call it the Saori Project.

301
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,880
Alright! That's all for today!

302
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,120
Alright! Thank you very much!

303
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,020
Alright!

304
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:21,480
Th-this is...

305
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,120
......

306
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,920
A 20-piece Saori figure!

307
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,300
I'll give you a price of 15,000 yen.

308
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,740
What do you expect to receive here?

309
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,520
Nooooooooooo, Saoori!

310
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,260
Master, did you hear something?

311
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,820
Wha... what is it?

312
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,560
We just heard Master's scream.

313
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,960
I-It may have been my imagination.

314
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,600
I hope that's all right.

315
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,000
If you have something, feel free to tell us.

316
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,460
Master.

317
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,820
Master is a precious body that prevented me from marrying Jody.

318
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,720
If something happens to Master, we will be scolded by Colonel Bakuryuu.

319
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,820
Yes, I understand.

320
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,620
I see. If he sees me holding on to Saori,

321
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,260
I will be in trouble for marriage.

322
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,400
I'm really fine.

323
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,160
You guys clean the dojo.

324
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:14,640
Yes.

325
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,760
I decided to forget about Saori.

326
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,040
I decided to forget about Saori.

327
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,780
Goodbye, Saori!

328
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,040
That's not good, Ryo.

329
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,620
The plan has just begun.

330
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,040
This is...

331
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,260
This is a soap maker.

332
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,940
I sold it for kids to see what they misunderstood.

333
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,980
I will get it back in a week.

334
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,760
I will get it back in a week.

335
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,560
I will get it back in a week.

336
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,460
Saori!

337
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,120
Master, did something happen?

338
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,560
It's nothing.

339
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,900
It's really nothing.

340
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,060
Master is a precious body that prevented me from marrying.

341
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,740
I understand.

342
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,660
I understand, so let me take a shower.

343
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,860
Yes.

344
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,020
I'm sorry, Saori.

345
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,880
Forgive me.

346
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,140
But I'll break it.

347
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,920
Somehow, Saori is...

348
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,640
Somehow, Saori is...

349
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,280
Is it really just me that did this?

350
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,880
It was only a normal thing.

351
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,500
Yes, it's my fault.

352
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,420
I'm sorry.

353
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,640
If I had a boyfriend and amazing,

354
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:41,660
It's not true.

355
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,700
Well...

356
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,980
Though, it is true...

357
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,960
So, what's wrong?

358
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,840
If you say it's nothing, then it's nothing!

359
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:06,920
I can't believe it...

360
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,060
The display that was used to promote the 3x speed when the first Doki Memo was released!

361
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,060
The display that was used to promote the 3x speed when the first Doki Memo was released!

362
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,520
There are more than 100,000 of these as a phantom item among the fans!

363
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,300
That's... That's...

364
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,640
What? Why are you here?

365
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,500
Oh, you're trying to interfere with my wedding!

366
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,700
Don't show me such an innocent smile!

367
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,680
I can't leave you here!

368
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,320
Saori...!

369
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,120
Saori...!

370
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,160
Saori...!

371
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,040
Saori...!

372
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,320
Saori...!

373
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,340
Saori...!

374
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,260
No! No...!

375
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,380
Saori...!

376
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,600
I have to have such a painful feeling...!

377
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,100
*Discorded*

378
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,620
I'll just watch TV...

379
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,520
*Discorded*

380
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,140
*Discorded*

381
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,820
*Discorded*

382
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,200
*Discorded*

383
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,260
*Discorded*

384
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,380
Forget about Saori, Tatsunosuke Sakonji!

385
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,060
I'm taking a new step!

386
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,360
Forget about Saori!

387
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,440
*Discorded*

388
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,520
*Discorded*

389
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,280
*Discorded*

390
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,620
*Discorded*

391
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,960
*Discorded*

392
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,680
*Discorded*

393
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,500
Hello?

394
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,100
You're so mean, Satchan!

395
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,060
You suddenly turned off the TV!

396
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,600
Saori!

397
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,020
It's okay. I'll make you feel better tomorrow!

398
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,740
No, that was...

399
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,580
This is Ryouzu's trap!

400
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,420
Don't you understand that?

401
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,100
I bought a new swimsuit for tomorrow's date.

402
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,500
I can see your belly button.

403
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,480
I can see your belly button?

404
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
*Discorded*

405
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,360
*Discorded*

406
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,120
*Discorded*

407
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,760
I can see your belly button!

408
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,660
*Discorded*

409
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,120
*Discorded*

410
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,020
*Discorded*

411
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,400
That's not how it should be, Tatsunosuke!

412
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,920
Tatsunosuke!

413
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,860
I'm out.

414
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,020
Damn it!

415
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,740
You even hired a real voice actor!

416
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,400
I don't have any other choice.

417
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,040
*Discorded*

418
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,920
*Discorded*

419
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,700
*Discorded*

420
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,580
You still have a choice.

421
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,220
You still have a choice.

422
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,360
*Discorded*

423
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,180
*Discorded*

424
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,220
*Discorded*

425
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,340
*Discorded*

426
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,700
*Discorded*

427
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,480
*Discorded*

428
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:35,960
*Discorded*

429
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,540
Be my guest tomorrow.

430
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,120
Hmm?

431
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,480
Is there something bothering you?

432
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,200
N-no, nothing.

433
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,900
From the start, nothing's happened.

434
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,820
I'm not sure about the future anymore.

435
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,480
The wedding dress is complete!

436
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,040
Tatsunosuke, Dad!

437
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,020
I'm doing the work now, Daddy.

438
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,720
To have gotten married to such a beautiful girl

439
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm so happy to be able to do this!

440
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,940
This is good enough.

441
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,120
Saori...

442
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,980
Bobby...

443
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,040
There was such a game in the amusement park?

444
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,800
I haven't played games for a while.

445
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,820
It's a new one.

446
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:27,900
I see.

447
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:38,160
I did it!

448
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,300
What was that just now?

449
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,160
Why did you continue even though you won?

450
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm curious.

451
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,240
I did it!

452
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,460
Alright, this time...

453
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,400
Oh, it's out.

454
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,440
Look this way.

455
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,520
Look, look this way.

456
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,480
That's right, that's right, that's right.

457
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,040
It's almost done!

458
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,060
I won't lose to a monster!

459
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,040
I did it!

460
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,940
Hurry up and take the girl from before...

461
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,040
If you win this time,

462
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,800
I'll...

463
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,660
I'll be with you...

464
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,640
I-I'm sure it's Saori!

465
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,240
What if I win? What's going to happen?

466
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,960
Wait, wait for me, Saori!

467
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,480
What's going to happen?

468
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,760
You got caught.

469
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,540
I've been a member of a program of a friend for a week.

470
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,480
It's a fighting game-style love simulation.

471
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,680
It's called "Docu-Memo Fight."

472
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,180
It's a horror game where you fall into the Docu-Memo while you don't know what's going on.

473
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,680
I'm going to win, Saori!

474
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,000
If you show this scene to Captain Bakuryuu and Jody,

475
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,000
you won't be able to get married.

476
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,900
Senpai, that's...

477
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,820
It's Bakuryuu.

478
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,160
I've saved my effort to call you.

479
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,720
Then let's go home together!

480
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,240
Saori!

481
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,340
Saori!

482
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,560
So, I need to talk to you.

483
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,660
Wait! Wait, Saori!

484
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,900
What's this?

485
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,480
Papa! Tatsunosuke!

486
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,300
I can't forget about Bobby.

487
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,200
I can't marry him like this.

488
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,000
I need to talk to him again.

489
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,320
What?

490
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,980
I want to see the sea.

491
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,320
The sea?

492
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,380
Hey, Saori!

493
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,520
Wow, Saori!

494
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,220
If you go to the sea, you can see Saori's swimsuit.

495
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,760
Wow, swimsuit!

496
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,580
What should we do?

497
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,020
Go!

498
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,680
Someone's coming. Hurry!

499
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,060
Saori will disappear!

500
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,640
What's this?

501
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,880
Papa, what are you doing?

502
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,840
How about the wedding preparations?

503
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,920
Do whatever you want with that.

504
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,440
What?

505
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,220
Tatsunosuke!

506
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,400
Which is more important, me or her?

507
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,700
Saori, of course!

508
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,960
I see!

509
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,520
That's what I meant!

510
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,240
Everyone, go to hell!

511
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,620
Saori!

512
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,320
Where are you, Saori?

513
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,160
Do something, Bulba!

514
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
I can't stop you anymore!

515
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,360
Y-You're saying, Saori?

516
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,600
Yes.

517
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,220
There you are.

518
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,240
I-I-I-I-I-I-I...

519
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,280
You will pay for playing with your maidenly thoughts!

520
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,980
Ahh-!

521
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:33,720
So, after all, Jody and Saccongi's wedding is cancelled.

522
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,440
Yes, I knew Jody would be better with Bulba.

523
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,840
As already, Bobbyå¹´

524
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,920
is waiting to defeat me!

525
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,060
I'll wait for you to come back.

526
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,720
What about you, Sakonji-san?

527
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,700
I'm into Doki-Memo again.

528
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,400
My girl is already in love.

529
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,940
Doki-Doki...

530
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,820
*crying*

531
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,960
Dachi-chan, cheer up!

532
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,500
Eeeeeeeeh! Saori!

533
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,440
Doki-Chan, cheer up!

534
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,960
Even if I wake up at midnight,

535
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,740
If it's you, I'll be awake.

536
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,360
Even if I have boring talks,

537
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,280
I'll make the entire body hot.

538
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,200
Hey, friend,

539
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,320
I want to see you.

540
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,000
I want to be loved

541
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,640
Just a little

542
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,040
The more everyone says

543
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,280
I feel like we're melting

544
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,580
I want to shoot you

545
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,840
For some reason, love is just cowardly

546
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,180
Don't hide all the strong love

547
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,180
We visited the school that was about to be demolished

548
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,000
We met a girl who was like a dead classmate

549
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,980
The piano sound in the music room

550
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,680
It made our memories vivid

551
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,920
Next time, after a long break

552
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,760
Thank you!

553
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,520
Next time, after a long break
