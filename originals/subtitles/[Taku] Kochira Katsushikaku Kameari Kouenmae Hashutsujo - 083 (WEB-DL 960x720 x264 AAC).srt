1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,600
"Ski-Ai!

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,320
The sunset came forward

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,680
If I set off a love stone

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,540
it would fly to my shoes

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,380
I wonder if I should go to the gym that I used to work out.

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,040
I was laughed at as it was.

7
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,480
Even if I try to lose my energy somewhere,

8
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,960
I can only win, and even if I have a bad temper,

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,920
I can't change a single thing.

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,680
The city is strangely kind.

11
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,420
From the main street of Tongari-boshi,

12
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,100
I'm heading to Kaishakuten.

13
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,080
The sun is setting.

14
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,600
Tomorrow will end like this.

15
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:14,940
It's over.

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,200
If I win, I'll be happy again.

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,980
I lost and I realized.

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,380
I'm such an idiot.

19
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,260
Speed Battle

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,900
Ryotsu, is Ryotsu here?

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,800
If it's Senpai, he'll go on patrol.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,800
Patrol?

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,200
If he goes on patrol,

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,700
I'm going to be suspicious.

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,960
That's right.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,300
Is there something you want to tell Senpai?

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,400
No, he said that he has been ahead of his salary for this month.

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
I thought he would use it for something bad.

29
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,600
I see.

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,020
I see.

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,680
I see.

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,620
I see.

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,840
I see.

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,500
I see.

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,800
I see.

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,900
I see.

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,260
I see.

38
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,760
I noticed.

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,120
Thiseps, I think you're right.

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,080
This parliament may be important, too.

41
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,620
It's going to be interesting.

42
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,620
That's what you say, Senpai.

43
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,120
There are so many stalls.

44
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,680
Oh!

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,680
What's that strange crowd?

46
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,360
Now, now, welcome!

47
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,680
The New Wave of the Yatai Ginda!

48
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,260
A new type of three-story store with ramen, oden, and beer halls!

49
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,400
Oh, this looks interesting.

50
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,720
Let's have a drink at the beer hall.

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,360
Welcome!

52
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,560
Ryo!

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,440
Huh?

54
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,620
Reiko Nakagawa!

55
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,620
Senpai!

56
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,420
What are you doing here?

57
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,500
What are you doing here?

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
You can tell by looking at me, can't you?

59
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,860
The Yatai Ginda is in a big boom right now.

60
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,440
That's why I decided to start running a stall as a side business.

61
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,740
I thought you wouldn't be able to see me.

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,400
I heard you stole the money, but you're using it for this again, right?

63
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:18,880
Huh?

64
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,280
I'm free to use my own money however I like.

65
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,900
If both Nakagawa and Reiko are not customers, then I'm going home!

66
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,980
Hey, Sakonji!

67
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,780
What is it, Ryo?

68
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,640
Hey, Sakonji!

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,740
You two are trying to stop me at the beer hall!

70
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,180
Huh?

71
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,400
Even Sakonji!

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,460
Ryo got caught up in it.

73
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,500
Hey, why don't we have some oden?

74
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,820
Yeah.

75
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,300
I'm hungry.

76
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Hey, you guys.

77
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,720
I want ramen!

78
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,540
Welcome!

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,320
I want yakitori!

80
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
You two get to the beer hall!

81
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,360
No one can stop Ryo now.

82
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,260
Seriously, Senpai is in trouble too.

83
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:56,920
Hey!

84
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,620
Wait for the beer.

85
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,380
Ryo!

86
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,320
Hey, Nisan!

87
00:03:59,780 --> 00:03:59,980
You haven't brought the yakitori!

88
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,280
Sorry, I'll bring it right away.

89
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,760
Hey, Sakonji!

90
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,560
You haven't brought the yakitori!

91
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,660
Hey, Sakonji!

92
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:10,800
Hey, Ryo!

93
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,660
You're too busy to carry it.

94
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,480
I'm still hungry.

95
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm waiting for the showtime at 11 p.m.

96
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,760
Showtime?

97
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,900
There are so many stalls lined up.

98
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,160
If we don't do something that impressive,

99
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,380
we won't survive on this market.

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,520
That's fine, but who will do it?

101
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,160
You're the only one.

102
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,280
Me?

103
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,060
Yeah.

104
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,260
I'm not joking.

105
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,800
You don't want to?

106
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,820
Of course not.

107
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,160
That's a shame.

108
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,960
I got a new figure for the Doki-Memo.

109
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,300
What?

110
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,520
Really, Ryo?

111
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,000
Victory!

112
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,760
This time, the figure is one-in-one,

113
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,620
with 200 joints and all poses are as you like.

114
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,380
As you like?

115
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,620
All right!

116
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,440
Showtime!

117
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,900
What's this?

118
00:04:59,520 --> 00:04:59,620
It's hot!

119
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,240
Hey, bro.

120
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,300
The yakitori is burning.

121
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,400
Hey, hey.

122
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,900
Is the oden ready?

123
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,780
Don't shoot.

124
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,320
I'll shoot.

125
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,200
Don't waste it.

126
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:07,840
Yeah.

127
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,200
A bottle of beer, please.

128
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,060
I'm home.

129
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:10,940
Hello?

130
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,260
The yakitori isn't here.

131
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,160
I'll be right there.

132
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,580
Hey, everyone.

133
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,280
It's showtime.

134
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,280
I'm not saying you should go home after watching the show.

135
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,700
Enjoy it.

136
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,820
Enjoy it.

137
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,960
That hurts.

138
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,020
It's burning!

139
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,300
Amazing!

140
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,740
Thank you!

141
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,240
Oh, that's great!

142
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,920
Amazing!

143
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,580
He's got a lot of customers.

144
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,700
We have to be that flashy.

145
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:21,260
Look, look, look!

146
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,620
It's a big profit as planned.

147
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,440
But I can't get tired in just one day.

148
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,320
I don't have the strength.

149
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,120
I see.

150
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,920
Then let's have Honda buy it.

151
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,660
Instead, we'll have the Doki-Memo figure...

152
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,420
I'll do it! I'll do it! I'll do it!

153
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,680
Are you motivated?

154
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,140
Then, from tomorrow, we'll have not only the night,

155
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,800
but also the daytime.

156
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,340
The daytime?

157
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,280
Yes.

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,940
If it's this popular,

159
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,480
then there will be people who will copy this store tomorrow.

160
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,680
It's such a competitive world.

161
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,860
But, from the daytime,

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,680
Oden and beer hall won't be a business.

163
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,280
That's right.

164
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,420
The daytime store

165
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,140
has to meet the needs of the customers who use it in the daytime.

166
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,220
It's just around the noon.

167
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,200
All right, I think this is good.

168
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,200
Hey, Sakonji!

169
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,040
This is good!

170
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,260
Hey, Ryotsu.

171
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,380
What are you going to do by stopping here?

172
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,940
Well, well, you'll see.

173
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,960
This is how the night market is in the daytime.

174
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,520
Eh?

175
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,400
What is this night market?

176
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,520
The first floor is a backroom.

177
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,520
Even in the busy hours during the daytime,

178
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,040
you can keep it clean.

179
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,500
On the other side is a pachinko house.

180
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,360
You can relieve the stress in a short time.

181
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,980
And on the side is the

182
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:54,740
And on the side is a

183
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,620
And, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more!

184
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,240
On the third floor, you can eat cakes for the OLs!

185
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,640
It's designed for all busy office workers, OLs!

186
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,160
It's also called the "Ryo-chan's Yatai", which is a place where you can reach the sickest of places!

187
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,040
A-Amazing! I might be able to go there!

188
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,160
All the office workers and OLs passing by!

189
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,080
Come on, come on, come and take a look!

190
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,900
You can take a quick break and refresh yourself!

191
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,660
You can go to the shop, go to the pachinko, go to the butter golf, and go bowling!

192
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,520
You can also eat cakes for the OLs!

193
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,780
Sounds interesting! Let's go!

194
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,800
He said he can eat cakes for free!

195
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,460
You don't have to eat them!

196
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,860
I did it! As expected of the boss!

197
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,340
Next, the Adagokuren!

198
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:55,780
Yes!

199
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,140
I-I don't have any money, but I can't do this.

200
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,640
Hey! I'm not going out!

201
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,400
Hey! I'm not going out!

202
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,740
Hey, Ryotsu! Please change a little!

203
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,940
Come on!

204
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:19,060
Hey, Ryotsu! Please change a little!

205
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,180
Hey, Ryotsu! Please change a little!

206
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,660
I'll just get in the car for now.

207
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm wet! I'm wet!

208
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,300
But this won't be enough for your body!

209
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,420
That's right! We still haven't got enough stalls!

210
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,880
Are you going to increase it?

211
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,280
Huh? You're going to patrol the stalls?

212
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,600
Yes.

213
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,460
The number of stalls has increased recently, so there may be trouble with the customer's reception.

214
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,160
The number of stalls has increased recently, so there may be trouble with the customer's reception.

215
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,580
Then, I'll leave it to you.

216
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,240
Ah, Chief!

217
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,320
What should we do? If we know that the trouble is the senior...

218
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,760
But, you know, it's just as usual.

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,140
I knew it. As I expected, someone who would immediately follow us has appeared.

220
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,520
But we're already a step ahead.

221
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,480
But we're already a step ahead.

222
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,020
Ugh...

223
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,780
Ugh...

224
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,480
Ugh...

225
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,260
Ugh...

226
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,640
Ugh...

227
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,000
Ugh...

228
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,760
How is it?

229
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,440
This is the world's only 7-story stall.

230
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,080
Ramen, oden, yakitori, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, kaitenzushi, yakimo...

231
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,840
A thousand salaried men will be able to enjoy the best menu.

232
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,440
See!

233
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,680
Huh?

234
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,660
That is a stall!

235
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,960
Then it's not a stall. It's the same as a building!

236
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,160
It's illegal construction!

237
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,700
Huh, Chief!

238
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,380
Oh, Ryozu!

239
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,840
What are you doing here?

240
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,940
No, I'm not a lion!

241
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,840
Who's a lion?

242
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,600
No, I'm not a lion! I'm a lion!

243
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,740
Hey, lion! Stop!

244
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,060
Stop?

245
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,860
Stop! Stop!

246
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:06,800
Stop!

247
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,940
Hey, you idiot!

248
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,200
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

249
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,080
You're not going to do that kind of thing again.

250
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,120
Yes, I won't do it again.

251
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,160
Really?

252
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,320
Yes.

253
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,280
I'm not giving up on this kind of thing.

254
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,260
I've already come up with an idea for the next stall.

255
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,580
Ah, ha, ha, ha!

256
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,800
Ramen, oden, yakitori, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, kaitenzushi, and yakiimo.

257
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,800
This is also a special version of Ryo-chan's "Yatai Ressha" weight transformation!

258
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,560
And with the addition of a computer,

259
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,380
you can pay the electricity bill from the concert ticket.

260
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,060
And you can also get a real station ticket as a family souvenir.

261
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,800
From one to another...

262
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,080
You're going to keep it up like this?

263
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,880
Of course, you can't go to the concert without the ticket.

264
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,080
You have to choose the method.

265
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,160
I'll do it.

266
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,240
Here, ramen.

267
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,500
Hey, can I have an order of oden?

268
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,680
Of course!

269
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,920
Hey, Sakonji!

270
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,020
I'm asking for an order of oden.

271
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,240
What?

272
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,700
Hey, can I have a beer?

273
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,620
Yes.

274
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,240
Hey, can I have an extra yakitori?

275
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,040
Yes.

276
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,840
Yakitori? Not yet?

277
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,700
Yes, I'll bring it right away.

278
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,460
Thank you, sir.

279
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,240
Thank you, sir.

280
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,720
Thank you, sir.

281
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,380
It's been a while since I've had a drink.

282
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,900
I'm hungry.

283
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,280
I'll go get some food.

284
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,840
I'll go get some food.

285
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,460
Thank you, sir.

286
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,880
Thank you, sir.

287
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,820
Thank you, sir.

288
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,640
Thank you, sir.

289
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:11,740
That's right.

290
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,980
I'm hungry.

291
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,800
Ah!

292
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,220
It's the Apache of the Bakuryu Captain!

293
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,600
What's this place?

294
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,380
Hey, hey, give me the money!

295
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,200
Damn it!

296
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,780
Damn it!

297
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,720
Hey, the Apache of the Bakuryu Captain!

298
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,400
You're interfering with people's business!

299
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,460
Hey, you're interfering with people's business!

300
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,600
Hey, you're interfering with people's business!

301
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,940
You're the one who's the "Bakuryu Captain"!

302
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,160
So it was your shop.

303
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,200
I came to drink with you.

304
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,240
Why are you riding a helicopter in a place like this?

305
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,500
The customers must have run away.

306
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,180
Don't worry.

307
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
I'll pay for it.

308
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,420
Everyone, get ready!

309
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,200
Roger!

310
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,880
Hey!

311
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,760
Let's begin drinking!

312
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,580
Roger!

313
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,120
I want to drink Yakitori's tongue and liver.

314
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,260
Y-Yes.

315
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,720
If these guys are here, I can't start a business.

316
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,880
I'll make them drink quickly and give it back.

317
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,600
Come on, let's drink, Captain!

318
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,940
Hey, Ryosu, don't get too excited.

319
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,680
He이랑ик

320
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,900
We are waiting for Yakitori!

321
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,680
Yakigataran!!

322
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,280
This is a helicopter of the great Great Defense Division, No. 2.

323
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,300
Yes!

324
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,180
My name is Dragoon...

325
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,340
Go to Dragon Arrow.

326
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,020
Roger!

327
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,680
Action code 68.

328
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,060
Codename, Dragon Arrow.

329
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,960
Hey, Captain!

330
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,140
Dragon Arrow!

331
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,300
I need one yakitori lever.

332
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,840
Target, one yakitori lever.

333
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,060
Target locked.

334
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,780
Begin attack.

335
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:56,940
Fire!

336
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,020
Fire!

337
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,840
He's still alive.

338
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,540
He's just one yakitori.

339
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,880
How arrogant.

340
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,720
All right.

341
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,040
Now, I'll take your lunch.

342
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,560
Give me some potatoes.

343
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,560
The potatoes are still hard.

344
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,360
What?

345
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,720
Do you think you can afford to do that?

346
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,520
I'm Kaen Houshagi.

347
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,760
Kaen Houshagi?

348
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,560
Roger!

349
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,540
Fire!

350
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,280
All done.

351
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,580
The operation was a success.

352
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,080
Are you going to leave me alone like this, Ryo?

353
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,140
Well, just get me drunk as soon as possible and get on the helicopter.

354
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,560
All right.

355
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,100
Now, now, Captain.

356
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,140
Let's go further.

357
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,620
Okay.

358
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,600
Well, the

359
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
Ten Ki sure feet do.

360
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,700
Why are there eight octopuses?

361
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,000
Whoa.

362
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,800
I have enough just for one, and why do you need it all?

363
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,500
All right, all right, all right.

364
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:12,740
Gimme some.

365
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,260
Here, here, here.

366
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,960
Yeah, here.

367
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,300
Huh?

368
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,440
It ain't too bad, Baki!

369
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,180
Here, here.

370
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,780
One more.

371
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,700
There.

372
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,260
I'm good.

373
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,700
I'll call you later.

374
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,240
Ah, it feels good.

375
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:29,900
Yes!

376
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,380
Oh, that's right. I'll show you something good.

377
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,240
That's fine. You should go home already. You look pretty drunk.

378
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,160
Don't say that.

379
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,820
This is the new type of speed-reactive bomb our army developed.

380
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,440
The name is "If you stop, you lose, Pooh-Pooh."

381
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,560
Speed-reactive bomb?

382
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,700
If you set this to a car or something, the speed will be below 30 kilometers per second.

383
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,260
As soon as the speed is below 30 kilometers, the device will switch on.

384
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,420
It can also be used to connect multiple vehicles.

385
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,840
We have it equipped for everyone in our unit, just in case.

386
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,060
Hey!

387
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:06,660
What?

388
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,920
We are training to be able to set it within a minute.

389
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,180
Let's go!

390
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,760
Yes!

391
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,280
Why don't you train in a place like this?

392
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,520
We don't have to train.

393
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,640
If you can do it properly in any situation, the army won't stop.

394
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,900
Set complete! Set complete!

395
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,040
54 seconds.

396
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,980
All right.

397
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,700
What if you set it up and explode?

398
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,360
Don't worry.

399
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,500
If you press the switch on this remote control, the bomb's dimensional device will stop.

400
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,480
If you do this...

401
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,420
Don't panic.

402
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,980
No matter what the situation,

403
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,260
the bomb will stop.

404
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,600
My motto is to deal with it calmly.

405
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,420
Ah!

406
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,500
Hey!

407
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,320
If it really explodes...

408
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,820
Whoa.

409
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,360
It's about time for the joint training.

410
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,300
All of you, go to the helicopter.

411
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,260
Yes, sir!

412
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,200
Hey!

413
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,820
What are you going to do about the bomb?

414
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,600
Anyway, run!

415
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,200
If you run over 30 kilometers, it won't explode.

416
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,180
No way!

417
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,640
You're kidding!

418
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,100
Whoa!

419
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:23,980
Whoa!

420
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,320
Whoa!

421
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:24,680
Whoa!

422
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,200
You'll be fine as long as you keep running.

423
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,260
See you later.

424
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,620
No way!

425
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,760
My Sendai-san is also in this store!

426
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,240
Let's go!

427
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,800
But...

428
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,220
Are you sure?

429
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,500
There are also figures from the documentary in this store!

430
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,960
Y-Yes!

431
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,680
Whoa!

432
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,620
Whoa!

433
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:44,940
Wow!

434
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,300
Wow!

435
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,320
Wow!

436
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,760
Wow!

437
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,100
Wow!

438
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,240
U-Um, wow!

439
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,220
Well...

440
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,760
Wow!

441
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,600
Wow!

442
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,500
Hey, don't slow down!

443
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,200
What are you going to do?

444
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
You have to find the bomb's structure!

445
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,620
Ryo-tsu!

446
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Is this it?

447
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,740
How's this, Ryo-tsu? Can you do it?

448
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,180
No! The red and blue lines are sticking out!

449
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,480
If you miss the structure of this type of bomb, it'll explode!

450
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,640
Then what are you going to do?

451
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,920
Ryo-tsu, go back! It's uphill!

452
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,560
What?!

453
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,540
You're going to die, Sakonji!

454
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,120
I can't let you fall below 30 kilometers!

455
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,640
Hey, Sakonji!

456
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,520
The explosion is getting more and more intense!

457
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,600
Now you must run!

458
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,880
This time it's downhill!

459
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:54,920
That's right!

460
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,260
I can't stop! My legs are starting to break!

461
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,540
What are you two doing?

462
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,100
Oh, Honda! We've made it to the right place!

463
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,140
What are you doing?!

464
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,020
Once this was over 30 kilometers per hour...

465
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,180
This yabana will explode!

466
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,440
What did you say?

467
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,980
I'll take a break for now.

468
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,560
Hey Honda, don't drop it below 30kg!

469
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,320
I didn't say that!

470
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,160
What a joke.

471
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
He's pulling it so hard.

472
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,320
That's not a human trick.

473
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,400
Okay, in the meantime...

474
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,120
What are you going to do, Ryotsu?

475
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,940
I'm going to find the remote control that the colonel dropped on the hot spring.

476
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
This is...

477
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,000
What's going on?

478
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,840
The track has been cut off because of the construction of the road.

479
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,860
What?

480
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,900
The road was cut off because of the construction!

481
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,340
Are you okay, Ryotsu?

482
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,500
What's going on, Ryotsu?

483
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,260
I'm here!

484
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm going to turn off the gas.

485
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,480
What?

486
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,560
Why do I have to do this?

487
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,340
Hurry up!

488
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,400
Please hurry up, Ryotsu.

489
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,140
It is...

490
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,640
Hey!

491
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,460
No!

492
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,940
Y presente!

493
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:09,660
Now it's too late.

494
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:09,700
I shouldn't have done that either.

495
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,140
It'll be okay.

496
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,880
I'm saved.

497
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,380
What?

498
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,340
Oh, is it already this late?

499
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,260
I have to contact Teiji.

500
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,220
This is the remote control of the Dimensional Bomb.

501
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,080
Then, what about the one before?

502
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,420
This is...

503
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,880
just a phone call, isn't it?

504
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,420
My vegetables!

505
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,900
Kaori!

506
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,540
What? It's me too!

507
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,020
I'm hungry!

508
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,580
That drunk old man!

509
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,700
If we meet again, I won't leave him alone!

510
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,920
Transform! Transform! Transform again!

511
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,400
You guys are just cosplayers!

512
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,820
Stop it!

513
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,460
I won't do that kind of thing!

514
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,780
Why are all the special police officers

515
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,120
all so perverted?

516
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,360
