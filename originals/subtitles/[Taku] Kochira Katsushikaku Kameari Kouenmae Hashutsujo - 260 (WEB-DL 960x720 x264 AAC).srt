1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,300
"When watching TV, please make your room bright and try to be away from it."

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,240
Come to me, you poor fellow!

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,180
Come to me, you poor fellow!

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,960
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

6
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,980
I wonder what will happen to them.

7
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,820
Come to me, you poor fellow!

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,120
Come to me, you poor fellow!

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,980
Look at the red clouds and the red clouds.

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,500
I wonder what will happen to them.

12
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,620
You know it, don't you?

13
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,220
You know it, don't you?

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,300
I know, I know!

15
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,760
If you know, then just shut up and follow me!

16
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,360
Make money with the healing system!

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,660
Her girlfriend is a healing system, isn't she?

18
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,420
She's a healing system, isn't she?

19
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,720
She's a healing system, isn't she?

20
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,840
Welcome!

21
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,300
Which flower should I choose?

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,740
I'll take the big one!

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,820
You like flowers, don't you?

24
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
I love them!

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,540
Oh, right! I found a Cosmos flower this morning.

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,260
Isn't it very cute?

27
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,040
It's really very cute!

28
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,360
It's really cute!

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,320
Every day, every day...

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,300
You just come here and buy flowers that you don't even care about.

31
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,600
You're going to be healed, aren't you?

32
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,440
You're going to be healed, aren't you?

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,860
You're going to be healed, aren't you?

34
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,200
Did you guys get that much hurt in the first place?

35
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,180
I get hurt every day!

36
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,140
Why do you get hurt so much?

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,040
It's because of the pressure from work and relationships.

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,700
I don't understand.

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,060
We're not as strong as Ryotsu.

40
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,040
You look strong at first glance, but you're actually as delicate and weak as a glass piece of art.

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,120
We're easy to get hurt.

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,060
Glass piece of art?

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,640
What's so delicate about that muscular body?

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,000
The delicate part is here.

45
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,720
It's the heart, senpai.

46
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,560
Ryo-chan, why don't you learn from Mr. Honda and buy a bouquet of flowers?

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,160
They don't care about flowers.

48
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,360
I don't know if it's for healing or something, but I just want to see Hana-chan's face at work.

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,540
Senpai.

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,800
Welcome home, Kei-chan.

51
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,420
Speaking of Hana-chan, I heard that she has a boyfriend who's a college student.

52
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,940
You guys were here?

53
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,760
I just happened to hear the manager of the flower shop talking.

54
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,260
I don't know.

55
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,680
Hana, sorry.

56
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,580
I'm tired. I didn't want to hear it.

57
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,760
What should we do, senpai?

58
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,980
Don't worry.

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,300
I'll be Hana-chan and heal you guys.

60
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,180
How?

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,120
I'm a man who's been called the healer of the turtle.

62
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,120
I've never heard of that.

63
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,440
How are you doing?

64
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,860
Stop it.

65
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,060
You're going to have a dream.

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,940
I'll heal you.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,920
Don't hurt us anymore, Kurie.

68
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,400
I'm trying to comfort you guys.

69
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,800
There's no such thing as a feeling of comfort as a senpai.

70
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:20,940
What?

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,260
Most of our stress is not an exaggeration even if Ryo-chan is the cause.

72
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,460
That's an exaggeration.

73
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,960
You're trampling on people's feelings.

74
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,720
Ryo-chan.

75
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,760
Shut up.

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,900
Shut up?

77
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,360
Reiko-san.

78
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,300
What?

79
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,540
What?

80
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,080
Ryo-chan's shoulder is also hurt?

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm fine.

82
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,020
I'm back.

83
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,260
I'm late.

84
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,140
I have a souvenir.

85
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,020
What's wrong with that persimmon?

86
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,380
The third-year grandmother of Yoshida-san brought it to me because there were so many of them.

87
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,960
Oh, Sakonji-kun and the others were also here.

88
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,560
Hmm.

89
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,860
It's still hard.

90
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,780
This one is a Shibugaki, a servant.

91
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,960
I thought so.

92
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,580
If you thought so, say it.

93
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,380
Well, Ryo-san, you're going to eat it when you're going to say it.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,460
If I make this to be a Hoshigaki, I'll be able to eat it, right?

95
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:23,960
I'll wash it.

96
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,040
What an old-fashioned guy.

97
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,300
That's funny.

98
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,060
Yes.

99
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,480
It's so relaxing to have you around.

100
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,680
It's like you're being healed.

101
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,780
Yeah, it's healing.

102
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,060
Well, then, we should get going.

103
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,660
Sorry for the trouble.

104
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,200
Cheer up!

105
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,740
What?

106
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,960
The crow that just cried is already laughing.

107
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,300
I'm glad you came back, Terai.

108
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,740
You're right.

109
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:51,860
You're right.

110
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Now we're done.

111
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,200
Whoa! You scared me!

112
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,500
What's wrong, Ryo-san? Do you want some tea?

113
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,740
No.

114
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,280
You're acting strange, Ryo-san.

115
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,720
Are you a healing person?

116
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,040
What is this place?

117
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,260
It's a healing research facility.

118
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,900
A healing research facility? What is that?

119
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,400
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

120
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:34,380
The head of the All Japan Healing Research Association, Dr. Taizo Iyashi.

121
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,180
40 years of research.

122
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,860
I'm an expert in healing research.

123
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,540
To survive this harsh modern society,

124
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,580
there must be a healing facility.

125
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,780
I see. I see.

126
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,700
I'll go and find it.

127
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,800
These are all pictures of those in the healing research facility.

128
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,680
Healing research facility?

129
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,780
So, you mean the healing research facility of the Terai?

130
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,480
From what I've seen,

131
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,760
it's 93 to 98% of the healing research facilities.

132
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,520
Is that amazing?

133
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,680
Or is it not?

134
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,200
Generally, the healing research facilities of the dolphin are 150.

135
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,280
And the healing research facilities of the healing talent, Inoguchi Haruko, are 98%.

136
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,180
They are said to be the highest in the world.

137
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,760
So, you mean they're pretty good?

138
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,900
I don't get it.

139
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,680
Then, let's get right into the experiment.

140
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,060
The healing research facility of the dolphin

141
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,680
The healing research facility of the dolphin

142
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:35,900
Please look.

143
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,940
The brain waves of the experimenters are sent to this monitor.

144
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,600
The brain waves of the experimenters are sent to this monitor.

145
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,800
The brain waves of the experimenters are sent to this monitor.

146
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,780
What about this red wave?

147
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,420
This wave is the energy that is generated when the brain is in a nervous state.

148
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,440
This wave is the energy that is generated when the brain is in a nervous state.

149
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,520
This wave is the energy that is generated when the brain is in a nervous state.

150
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,820
The green wave just came out!

151
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,300
This wave is the alpha wave generated when the brain is in a relaxed state.

152
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,600
So, do you mean that student is being healed by just looking at the picture of the Terai?

153
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,300
Yes, absolutely.

154
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,560
You!

155
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:12,740
You.

156
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,180
You said you wanted to talk but...

157
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,000
Wow, another wave has risen!

158
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,540
Wonderful! You!

159
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,520
This is a far more surprising result than I expected!

160
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,480
Really?

161
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,060
If you doubt it, why don't you experience it yourself?

162
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,120
I'm always with the others in the office,

163
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,280
and now...

164
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,260
Stop!

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,120
Look! The alfalfa has already come out!

166
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,780
It's true! I feel like I'm being healed somehow!

167
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,680
Ryo-san, let's go home!

168
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,500
Look, look, look! There's so much!

169
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,440
I feel like I'm being healed!

170
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,540
Ryo-san!

171
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,040
I'm being healed!

172
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,260
I'm being healed!

173
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,180
The alfalfa has been confirmed to have 30 times more healing abilities than the alfalfa!

174
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,200
What?

175
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,100
That's why I'm always with the alfalfa.

176
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,720
Reiko and Nakagawa and I don't know any stress.

177
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,380
I've been living in the east, and it seems like I've finally dug out a gold vein.

178
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,800
The alfalfa's healing abilities

179
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,340
have been researched from various angles,

180
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,940
so let's start researching.

181
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,480
No, that's enough.

182
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,260
Wait a minute, the alfalfa!

183
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,860
He's calling me!

184
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,420
Now that you know that the alfalfa has healing abilities,

185
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,440
you should help him earn money as soon as possible.

186
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
The alfalfa doesn't want money,

187
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,360
but he wants to help people.

188
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,040
That's true, but...

189
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,460
From now on, you and I will help people

190
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,160
who need it the most!

191
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,780
The alfalfa!

192
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,000
What's with this outfit?

193
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,160
It's a simple approach, but first I'll make a photo book of the alfalfa.

194
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
My photo book?

195
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,160
No, that's embarrassing!

196
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,980
Don't be shy, alfalfa!

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,820
If you're going to heal people,

198
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,660
you've got to be embarrassed!

199
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,720
Well, let's go!

200
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,860
Nice.

201
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,080
That's nice, alfalfa!

202
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,340
That's really nice!

203
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,500
This is the healing alfalfa,

204
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,580
who has combined alfalfa and alfalfa.

205
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,960
It's a healing character, the alfalfa.

206
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,700
Alfalfa?

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,480
Is there really any healing effect

208
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:43,800
by making something like this?

209
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,380
It looks like him!

210
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,300
He's smiling!

211
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,620
If you give us your opinion as a monitor,

212
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,580
we'll give you a present.

213
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,880
So cute!

214
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,120
He might be healed!

215
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,360
If you think that the real people have been healed,

216
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,020
the healing will be successful!

217
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,160
Oh, the tea pillar is standing.

218
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,980
There are seven of them standing.

219
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,540
It seems like today will be a good day!

220
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,400
You're going to be healed!

221
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,060
Okay!

222
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,440
Then, please start from the head!

223
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,420
Yesterday, I had a dream that my house loan had been extended to 80 years.

224
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,920
I thought I might drown in my sleep.

225
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,340
If you're lost,

226
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,180
come to the Hashi-jo in front of Kameari Park.

227
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,140
Again!

228
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,900
It's the GD of Terra Ichi!

229
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,700
I'll always be there for you!

230
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,620
Now it's time!

231
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,620
If you bought the healing-type

232
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:36,960
GD,

233
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:44,680
we'll give you these cute GD-only novelty goods.

234
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,840
If you want to be healed,

235
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,040
hurry up!

236
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,120
Please!

237
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,300
Please!

238
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,540
Over there,

239
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,580
is the GD of the healing type, Terra Ichi!

240
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,020
It's Terra Ichi!

241
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,920
Huh?

242
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,140
There's a senior too!

243
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,100
Hello!

244
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,540
The healing effect of the GD of Terra Ichi is 10 times the effect of a lemon,

245
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,980
and 30 times the effect of a dolphin.

246
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,340
It's scientifically proven.

247
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,540
And you are?

248
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,700
I'm sorry to inform you,

249
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,360
but I am the manager of Terra Ichi,

250
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,280
and the healing advisor, Ryo-tsu.

251
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,460
Healing advisor?

252
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,300
If you want to heal,

253
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,800
please consult me.

254
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,180
Please.

255
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,240
I'll be in your care.

256
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,180
Ryo-chan,

257
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,880
you said that.

258
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,160
Are you sure you're okay?

259
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,520
Please do your best!

260
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,120
Thank you!

261
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,180
I'm cheering you on!

262
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,280
Thank you!

263
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,860
The healing expert, Terra Ichi,

264
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,140
will heal you,

265
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,720
both today and tomorrow,

266
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,820
with his spiritual power.

267
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,180
All kinds of Terra Ichi goods

268
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,480
are on sale!

269
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:53,980
Are you okay, Kano?

270
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,860
He-he-he-he...

271
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,780
He-he-he-he...

272
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,140
Please take a look!

273
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,480
P-does he mean...

274
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,620
I can don't believe you!

275
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,120
Look at his face!

276
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,140
Just look at him!

277
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,220
Perhaps something's wrong with him...

278
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,840
Who...

279
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,440
Who?

280
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,840
Is in pain.

281
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,000
The healing expert?

282
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,480
Sorry to ask,

283
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,100
please take a look!

284
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,360
Thank you!

285
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,000
Is it alright?

286
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,040
I'll be in your care,

287
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,280
and the healing advisor, Ryo-tsu,

288
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:29,740
will heal you,

289
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,780
Y-Yes...

290
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,480
Ryo-san, if you have the power to heal people,

291
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,000
I want to heal as many people as possible,

292
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,280
but I don't want to use it as a tool to make money!

293
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,000
Um...

294
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,540
Listen, Terai.

295
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,220
To heal as many people as possible,

296
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,020
you have to sell a lot of your CDs, photo books, and stuffed animals.

297
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,100
It takes time and money.

298
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,680
If you want to save that precious time for yourself,

299
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,340
you have to get the reward of the funeral.

300
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,660
But I...

301
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,140
I told you that I would pay you for it!

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,920
Are you going to heal me?

303
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,340
No way!

304
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,020
Terai-kun, let me heal you right now!

305
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,560
Please let me know what you want to talk about.

306
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,220
I'll help you if I can.

307
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,300
I've tried a lot of things so far.

308
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,880
I bought all of Terai-san's healing goods.

309
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,260
I was healed for a while, but then again...

310
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,760
It's not coming yet!

311
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,980
What?

312
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,740
What do you mean?

313
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,640
Terai-san.

314
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,440
The person sitting behind you...

315
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,120
You haven't even brought water yet, have you?

316
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,800
He came into this store with us!

317
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,460
What?

318
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,520
What?

319
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,120
What is it?

320
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,820
The beta wave is rising again!

321
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,520
What is it?

322
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,920
That's it, Ryo-san.

323
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,640
It's a special brain wave measurement device.

324
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,460
So why are you carrying that on your phone?

325
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,380
If I have this, I can see for myself if I'm healed or not.

326
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,160
It's only a matter of seconds.

327
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,720
Okay, just tell me when.

328
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,600
Today's patients are unibtius.

329
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:05,800
The According to the research, it can't be healed to one person.

330
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,500
It doesn't mean it'll explode if you shake the meter off.

331
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,140
W-wait a minute!

332
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,180
Why did you ask me to do that?

333
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,260
Goomurice.

334
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,000
A large order of rice, please!

335
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
That's all from ourhale, いすまん.

336
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,300
Please get us some rice at the third seat.

337
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:18,640
Thank you!

338
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,000
What a big sperm!

339
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,660
Thank you, Mr. Mr. geni.

340
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,060
Here! Like this?

341
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,780
Kindly.

342
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,200
Is this enough?

343
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,880
Thank you very much.

344
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,240
It's like a dimensional bomb.

345
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,460
Talking to a monk is very healing.

346
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,880
Move a little!

347
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,180
That guy stopped the taxi!

348
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,860
It's going up again!

349
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,620
Wait a minute!

350
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:51,760
Wait a minute!

351
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,980
Taxi!

352
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,840
Please!

353
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,140
I'm glad.

354
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,760
I stopped the taxi.

355
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,140
Thank you very much.

356
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,200
If you keep doing that, you'll get stressed out.

357
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,360
Hey, what's next?

358
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,860
My eyebrows are connected.

359
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,220
Hurry up and stop the taxi!

360
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,920
Taxi! Taxi!

361
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,420
Where are you taking me?

362
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,080
I'm going to take you home.

363
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,760
If you do this, you'll be in trouble.

364
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,580
Listen, don't look at anything until you get home.

365
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,700
Don't listen to anything.

366
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,820
Just be normal!

367
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,860
Here?

368
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,300
What a house!

369
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm going to take you home.

370
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,120
Please go up.

371
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,640
I'll put some tea in.

372
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,880
Not a single drop fell.

373
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,120
Yeah.

374
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,340
It's quiet.

375
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,020
Where is your family?

376
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,400
My father and I live together.

377
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,280
Please.

378
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,220
There's nothing here that threatens a peaceful life.

379
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,380
No.

380
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,000
When I was little, I was in the house.

381
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,640
I'm just flustered and I can't calm down.

382
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,140
He doesn't have the healing ability of a monk.

383
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,600
Even if the chopsticks fall, he's in a state of stress.

384
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,120
Is it Ryo's room?

385
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,180
It's probably a miracle room.

386
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,520
I just imagined it.

387
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,320
I'm stressed!

388
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,760
I'll take it out.

389
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,060
Yes.

390
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,040
Yes.

391
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,680
Yes.

392
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,380
I feel sorry for him.

393
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,140
I wonder if we can save him.

394
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:06,980
Ryo.

395
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,440
You said you'd give me as much money as you can, right?

396
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:10,940
Yes.

397
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,620
I'll give it to you.

398
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:11,720
Come on!

399
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,340
Come on.

400
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,640
Okay.

401
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,300
I'll make you a healing store.

402
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,120
And I'll offer you a ride.

403
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,180
Okay.

404
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,860
Please.

405
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,500
Ryo.

406
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,440
Yes.

407
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,240
Yes.

408
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,740
Yes.

409
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,620
I'll give you a ride.

410
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:27,920
Okay.

411
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,000
I'll give you a ride.

412
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,340
I'm taking it.

413
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:38,600
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I---

414
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,080
This waterfall's made of Minus-ions!

415
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,000
Come and heal yourself!

416
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,780
I-I-I~ hook it up!

417
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,480
Hey, start to pour!

418
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,720
"I'm going to get you!"

419
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,820
"You're doing too much, Miss!"

420
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,760
"You can even listen to Ogawa's tesseract!"

421
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,540
"You'll be healed!"

422
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,560
"Help me!"

423
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,580
"Healing!"

424
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,220
"What's next?"

425
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,000
"I'm going to heal you!"

426
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,260
"You're healed!"

427
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,360
"You still can't?"

428
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,360
"Here's the final weapon!"

429
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,200
"Alright!"

430
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,560
"Go!"

431
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,160
"W-What the hell?"

432
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,180
"If your healing ability is 30 times that of a dolphin, you'll have to fight with a dolphin and a whale!"

433
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,800
"You'll have to fight with a dolphin and a whale!

434
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
"Go!"

435
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,020
"Hello!"

436
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,320
"That's healing!"

437
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,500
"Help me!"

438
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,300
"No! No!"

439
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,160
*Bang*

440
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,560
*Screaming*

441
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch...

442
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,040
*Cries*

443
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,320
*Cries*

444
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,380
*Cries*

445
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,260
Ryo-san! Teruo-kun!

446
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,640
Damn it...

447
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,340
Where's Teruo-kun?

448
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,440
Eh?

449
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,340
*Crying*

450
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:12,900
*Panting*

451
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,540
*Crying*

452
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,980
What the hell was I doing?

453
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,480
*Crying*

454
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,460
*Crying*

455
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,760
*Crying*

456
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,140
It's been years since I felt like this.

457
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,620
It feels good.

458
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,900
*Crying*

459
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,140
*Crying*

460
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,080
*Crying*

461
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,560
Teruo!

462
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,260
Teruo!

463
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:36,700
*Crying*

464
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,320
*Crying*

465
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,120
Dr. Iyashiki! Dad!

466
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,320
*Crying*

467
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,260
Teruo!

468
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,340
Dad!

469
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,200
*Crying*

470
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,440
*Crying*

471
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,140
Teruo, are you okay?

472
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,820
Dad, it's my fault.

473
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,540
It's fine. If you're okay, then...

474
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,760
*Crying*

475
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,600
I didn't know you were the professor's son.

476
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,140
I was too obsessed with research.

477
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,820
My family collapsed.

478
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,100
My son fell into a deflector spiral.

479
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,700
What's that?

480
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,040
*Screaming*

481
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,800
*Screaming*

482
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,620
The more I heal, the more I feel stress.

483
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,040
Without healing, I can't live even for a second.

484
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,700
I'll build a bicycle to heal even more.

485
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,020
*Crying*

486
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,440
*Splat!*

487
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,640
I started to do more healing to save my son.

488
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,760
Your son is fine.

489
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,600
*Splat!*

490
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,980
I'm sorry to have worried you.

491
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,720
I've healed him.

492
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,800
Now, let's get to the cash.

493
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,520
Unfortunately, I don't have any money left in my house.

494
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,960
You don't have any?

495
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,920
The assets I inherited from my parents disappeared,

496
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,920
including my research expenses, my wife's medical bills, and my son's tuition.

497
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,020
The land is also a debt deposit, and only this house is left.

498
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,260
Don't call it a debt deposit!

499
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,380
And another thing.

500
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,740
I found a flaw in the brain wave measurement device used in the healing ability experiment of Mr. Terai,

501
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,020
so all the experiment data will be an error.

502
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,020
What?

503
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,580
Everyone has been healing like that until recently.

504
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,520
I told you that I was going to be healed!

505
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,660
What are you going to do, Senpai?

506
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,520
I have no choice but to apologize to everyone.

507
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,500
I thought you didn't have any special abilities.

508
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,220
I hate healing!

509
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,400
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

510
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Or you further call it peppering.

511
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,540
Where are you going?

512
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,560
Please wait a moment, I just need to use the microwave.

513
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,640
Oh!

514
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,540
Ah...

515
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,060
What's wrong?

516
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,540
I was amped up.

517
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,520
Oh, no, thank you.

518
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:35,540
Ah...

519
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,640
now?

520
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,600
I walked through the city's black alleys

521
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:53,100
Everyone was a child once, but now they've forgotten

522
00:24:53,100 --> 00:25:00,600
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt in the eyes

523
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,020
Look up at that corner

524
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,600
You'll see everyone

525
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,380
There's a turtle over there

526
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,180
There's definitely a turtle

527
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,960
Everyone come to our town

528
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Thank you!

529
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,620
What's with this weird old man?

530
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,840
I don't know if it's Gosho-Gawara or something, but he's been picking up kids

531
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
Everyone's in trouble, right?

532
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,540
And why does he read a book every day?

533
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,880
Next time, "The Troublesome Old Man Gosho-Gawara"

534
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,600
See you!

535
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,760
There's a turtle over there

536
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,560
There's definitely a turtle

537
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,680
Everyone come to our town

538
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,880
Thank you!
