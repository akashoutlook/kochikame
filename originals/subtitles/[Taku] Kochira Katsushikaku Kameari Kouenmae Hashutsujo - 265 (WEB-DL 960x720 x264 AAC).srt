1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,440
Room"

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,420
When you watch TV, make the room bright and look away!

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,220
The

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,000
poor

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,900
guy

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,940
come to

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,860
me!

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,780
I'm

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,380
not here

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,400
but I'm

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:27,940
worried

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,240
about

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,260
you!

14
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,020
Look!

15
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,320
The

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,560
blue

17
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,000
sky

18
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,220
and

19
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:34,420
the

20
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,000
white

21
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,940
clouds

22
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,440
will

23
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:38,540
be

24
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:38,680
a

25
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,220
while!

26
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,580
I'm

27
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,780
unemployed

28
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,400
but

29
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,540
come to

30
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,300
me!

31
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,540
I'm

32
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,020
not here

33
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,000
but I'm

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,520
worried

35
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:03,620
about

36
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,400
you!

37
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,400
I'm

38
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,120
not here

39
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,480
worried

40
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,520
about

41
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,640
you!

42
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,220
I'm

43
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,680
not here

44
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,060
but

45
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,780
I'm

46
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,260
worried

47
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:17,460
about

48
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:17,600
you!

49
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:20,920
You

50
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,100
know

51
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,640
it, right?

52
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,580
You

53
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:22,980
know it,

54
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,320
don't

55
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,420
If

56
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:24,460
you

57
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:24,700
know,

58
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:24,960
then

59
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,220
come to

60
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,720
me!

61
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,740
Hmm...

62
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,000
Hmm...

63
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,380
There are fewer and fewer bathhouses in Tokyo.

64
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,140
That's right, if you say so.

65
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,920
I feel a little lonely.

66
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,480
Ryo-chan loves bathhouses.

67
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,340
I like them too.

68
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,000
That open-air bathhouse.

69
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,560
It's a commonplace and I like it.

70
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,000
If you say that to Nakagawa, I'll get into trouble.

71
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,080
Well, a bathhouse is a car park for adults and a playground for children.

72
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,420
In the past, there were many bathhouses in the same town.

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,940
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

74
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,460
That's right, this is a picture from that time.

75
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,180
Eh? Senpai, that time?

76
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,980
Yeah, there were bathhouses all over our childhood.

77
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,160
There aren't many expensive buildings yet.

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,060
That's why there were many high-altitude chimney in the first floor.

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,160
Hurry up! Hurry up!

80
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,000
We're going to be overtaken by the first class.

81
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,880
You're going to hand over the third Nakashima's bathhouse, aren't you?

82
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,380
I can't throw away the first one.

83
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,740
Yay! I got on the first class!

84
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,800
Huh?

85
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,640
What?

86
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,020
What?

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,600
The first class is the first class?

88
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,400
It can't be helped.

89
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,900
They haven't gone to school or work.

90
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,720
It's because they're in the dormitory.

91
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,420
Even so, they're going to the second class in the order of Matsu-no-yu, Take-no-yu, Ume-no-yu and Shochiku-ba.

92
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,620
It's really strange.

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,480
The first class is the owner of the first class.

94
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,480
He was called "the president" by the owner of the co-op.

95
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,460
What kind of president was he?

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,740
He was the one in charge of the crew.

97
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,540
Well, this is...

98
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,780
This is great.

99
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,520
Drink more "seiken-."

100
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,460
All right, I'm ready.

101
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,220
Well, the first is the high-altitude chimney.

102
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,580
Don't lose, Chinkichi!

103
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,160
Furukawa's "Seisui Eiho!"

104
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,180
Are you ready?

105
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,540
That's how it is!

106
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,980
T broth

107
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,440
Ohishimasen kachi!

108
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,380
Yay!

109
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,560
Ouch, ouch, ouch!!

110
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,760
That was a sąro!

111
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,840
Me too.

112
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,420
Kairou is so stiff, it's hurting my body.

113
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,880
You two, you have been late.

114
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,020
If you put situación in this way, will you no problem?

115
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
I see!

116
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,740
Me too!

117
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,740
Alright!

118
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,320
I don't care if you win or lose!

119
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,680
Okay! I won't lose!

120
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,600
The second round! Masao vs. Kankichi!

121
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,520
Ready!

122
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,300
Mach 15 speed!

123
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,640
Fire!

124
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,320
Awesome!

125
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,400
Awesome!

126
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,640
There was a problem with Chin-Chin's upskill.

127
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,980
The brakes didn't work because he couldn't see ahead.

128
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,960
You guys are in danger too, so stop.

129
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,100
No one will do it.

130
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,340
Ouch!

131
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,700
You guys again!

132
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,320
We'll ban you from getting out of the car if you do this again!

133
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,060
Hey!

134
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,180
I used to go to the battle every day.

135
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,580
I used to go in for 5 hours a day.

136
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,820
5 hours?

137
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,640
Yeah, I felt uncomfortable and looked like I was dirty.

138
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,080
It was just then.

139
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,640
I went to the Shinovazu's pond with Zenko.

140
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,260
Hm?

141
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,400
Are you sure?

142
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,500
Yeah,that's for sure!

143
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,020
Do you wanna fight me?

144
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,300
Of course!

145
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,240
Akira,Arya and Kazuhara will be fighting you.

146
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,060
Really?

147
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,840
What are you doing?

148
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,940
Are you joking?

149
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,040
Imagine if you were me.

150
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,600
All right!

151
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,300
Ah,I didn't even know what you were talking about!

152
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,500
Huh?

153
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,160
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

154
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,080
Huh?

155
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,700
Yaaah!

156
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,120
Ahhh!

157
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,360
Ahhh!

158
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,840
Ahh...

159
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,360
Y-yabai!

160
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm so glad.

161
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,100
Ah!

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,780
Ah, um...

163
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,980
I'm sorry...

164
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,240
It's fine.

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,120
Huh?

166
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,680
Wow, it's so beautiful!

167
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,860
Ah, it's true!

168
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,540
I've never seen a painting this beautiful!

169
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,140
The painting is beautiful, but so is your sister...

170
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,960
Idiot!

171
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm talking about impressions.

172
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,260
I like paintings like Monet, Manet, Goffo, and Cezanne.

173
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,100
I-Imitation? Go-Go-Cezanne?

174
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,040
A comedian?

175
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,280
Is she in Rock?

176
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,360
I don't know.

177
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,940
I know the rest, but...

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,900
Ah, um...

179
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,020
My sister...

180
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,620
Her name is Miki.

181
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,420
Miki Orihara.

182
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,380
I'm Kankichi.

183
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,660
I'm Chinkichi!

184
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm Tompei!

185
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,320
Nice to meet you.

186
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,140
Y-Yes!

187
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,100
Um...

188
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,280
Can we sketch together?

189
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,700
Tell me about the painting!

190
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,500
Sure.

191
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,220
I don't care if you can tell me.

192
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,360
Let's draw together!

193
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,480
Yeah!

194
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,120
Let's draw together!

195
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,180
Yes!

196
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,420
Yes!

197
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,080
Let's draw together!

198
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,500
I can't draw well!

199
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,520
Me neither!

200
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,040
How can you draw well like my sister?

201
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm trying to draw well.

202
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,900
Really?

203
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,620
Yes.

204
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,120
For example...

205
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Don't try to reflect the tree over there...

206
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,740
What do you think of that tree?

207
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,860
What do you think of that tree?

208
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,180
What do you feel about it?

209
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,340
What do you think of that tree?

210
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,880
It's Kankichi's painting!

211
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,220
Cool!

212
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:32,880
It's a bronze!

213
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:33,980
Yay!

214
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,100
Oh!

215
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,880
It's mine!

216
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,620
Yay!

217
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,260
It's mine!

218
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,040
Yay!

219
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:38,960
Yay!

220
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,660
Chinkichi!

221
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,460
You guys don't draw what you see,

222
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,160
but what you think of it.

223
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,740
I'll draw a picture of you.

224
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,140
From now on,

225
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,180
call me Kankichi Gahaku.

226
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:49,720
Hahaha!

227
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,180
Kya!

228
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,560
Kya!

229
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,220
Kya!

230
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,700
Kya!

231
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,600
Kya!

232
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,420
Kya!

233
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,220
I'm glad I did what my sister said.

234
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,020
Yeah!

235
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,100
But, you know,

236
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,200
I haven't seen you lately,

237
00:08:59,260 --> 00:08:59,860
but what's wrong?

238
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,840
Yeah...

239
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,900
Today's the best day!

240
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,700
Eh...

241
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,540
Ah...

242
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,200
Ah...

243
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,900
Ah...

244
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:07,980
Huh?

245
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,500
Ah...

246
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,240
It's 5:00 today.

247
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,260
5:00?

248
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:11,840
Why?

249
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,620
I'm repainting the drawing on the bathroom.

250
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,300
I'm repainting the drawing on the bathroom.

251
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,240
The drawing on Mt. Fuji?

252
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,700
The drawing on Mt. Fuji?

253
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,360
The pen is wet and the color will fade,

254
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,500
so I repaint it every year.

255
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:21,840
So I repaint it every year.

256
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,560
Huh?

257
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,900
Show me!

258
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,880
I'll give you some advice.

259
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,360
Kankichi Gahaku?

260
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,540
I'll give you some advice.

261
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:29,840
I'll give you some advice.

262
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,380
Ah...

263
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,900
You're late!

264
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,180
Bring it here quickly!

265
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:38,960
Huh?

266
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,920
Don't be so nervous!

267
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,320
The pen will dry out!

268
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,320
Huh?

269
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,620
What's wrong with you?

270
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,140
What's wrong?

271
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,560
Ah...

272
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,300
Well...

273
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,180
Don't show it to me!

274
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,080
It's in the way!

275
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,820
Get in!

276
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,220
...

277
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,980
Tch...

278
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,140
Tch...

279
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,120
It's fine.

280
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:51,820
It's fine.

281
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,080
I'm sorry, Dad.

282
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:53,600
I'm sorry, Dad.

283
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:53,800
Huh?

284
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sorry, Dad.

285
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,820
Kankichi-kun!

286
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,160
Kankichi-kun!

287
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,380
Kankichi-kun!

288
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:56,540
Kankichi-kun!

289
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,000
Sis...

290
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:57,920
Kankichi-kun!

291
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,400
Why are you...

292
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,920
Why are you...

293
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,200
Why are you...

294
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,860
Miki, the brush!

295
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,200
Miki, the brush!

296
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,380
Ah...

297
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,900
Yes.

298
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,480
Yes.

299
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:01,780
Yes.

300
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,420
Yes.

301
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:03,700
Miki?

302
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,680
Yes.

303
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:04,800
Dad?

304
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,580
I don't know!

305
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,780
I don't know!

306
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,120
"Hand and foot are examples of the tools of craftsmen."

307
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,620
For a craftsman, the tools are the same as his hands and feet.

308
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,360
Hurry up and find it!

309
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,120
"Hand and foot are examples of the tools of craftsmen."

310
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,680
Sis, I'll help you look for it, too.

311
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,580
Thank you!

312
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,780
Where's that eye ball-pad?

313
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,720
It's my father's!

314
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,880
It's a real craftsman's treasure!

315
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,360
"Food"

316
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:38,960
"Milk"

317
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,120
"Milk"

318
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:41,680
"Milk"

319
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,000
"Milk"

320
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,920
Oh, I found it!

321
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,260
This one, right?

322
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,980
Oh, that's it! I'm so glad I found it!

323
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,420
But it's weird to think you can't draw without this kind of thing.

324
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,940
That's true.

325
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,900
Don't you draw at the bathhouse?

326
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,580
What?

327
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,180
My father thinks my drawing is just for fun.

328
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,980
Rather than oil paintings that make rich people happy,

329
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,540
I think it's more important to make the guests at the bathhouse and the movie theater happy.

330
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,860
I'm proud of my current job.

331
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,340
That's why my drawing is...

332
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,380
That's not true!

333
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
Anyone can see your drawing!

334
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,060
Not yet.

335
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,680
That's why I want to study oil painting seriously.

336
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,340
I want to study in France.

337
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:39,980
France?

338
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,900
My father is absolutely against it,

339
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,540
but he won't let me live there if I do oil painting.

340
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,480
You don't have to listen to that stubborn old man!

341
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,640
Your sister is a very good painter, so go to France!

342
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,820
Thank you!

343
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,500
I'll be more brave if Kankichi says so.

344
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,680
I'll be more brave if Kankichi says so.

345
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,480
With that, what happened?

346
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,500
Well, here's the story.

347
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:20,720
Huh?

348
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,660
Ah, it's about winter this year.

349
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,280
That year, she finally decided to go to France and told her father.

350
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,460
I'm taking the plane together again in the evening,

351
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,660
and I'm very grateful for everything.

352
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,200
Just like my father said,

353
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,720
I may not be able to live in the oil field for the rest of my life.

354
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,960
But I want to try my best.

355
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,820
Have a job.

356
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,220
My father told me that and I lived my life.

357
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,620
I thought so too.

358
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,580
What's the point of drawing a picture that doesn't make money?

359
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,500
Don't think you can eat oil fields.

360
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,100
I'm ready.

361
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,060
Do whatever you want.

362
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,840
Sorry!

363
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,240
What?

364
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,880
My sister is going to France tomorrow evening?

365
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,100
Really?

366
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,480
What about my sister?

367
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,500
She's going to help that old man in the fish pond.

368
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,440
Fish pond?

369
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,420
My sister!

370
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,820
Kankichi!

371
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,160
Jinkichi!

372
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,880
Tonpei!

373
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,380
You again!

374
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,640
I'm going to get in your way, so go home!

375
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,220
We have to say goodbye to my sister.

376
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,320
Ouch!

377
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,340
Kankichi!

378
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,120
Kankichi!

379
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,960
Ouch!

380
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,860
Ouch!

381
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,620
Ouch!

382
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,160
Ouch!

383
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,980
Ouch!

384
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,040
Ouch!

385
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,360
Ouch!

386
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,660
Ouch!

387
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,380
Ouch!

388
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:26,420
Ouch!

389
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:26,440
Ouch!

390
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:26,660
Ouch!

391
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:27,640
Ouch!

392
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,700
We'll continue.

393
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,440
Damn it.

394
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,020
Father!

395
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,260
Damn it. I only have one day off today.

396
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,280
I have to run all day long. I can't do business.

397
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,060
I'll do it.

398
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,940
What?

399
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,420
Leave it to me.

400
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,500
You can do it?

401
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,740
I can do it.

402
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,640
You're really good at painting.

403
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,340
Besides, I've been helping you for a long time, so I can do it.

404
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,600
Yeah, we'll help you.

405
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,620
Let me do it, Father.

406
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,140
Father.

407
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,580
Do it yourself.

408
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,560
Father!

409
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,500
Thank you, Father.

410
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,240
Huh?

411
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,320
Huh?

412
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,620
It's so big when you look at it up close.

413
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,960
It's overwhelming.

414
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,980
How many times bigger than a 100-carat canvas?

415
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,700
You have plenty of time to get lost.

416
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,080
You don't have time to get lost.

417
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,920
I'm gonna draw my own picture.

418
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,280
All right!

419
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,800
Please grind up more paint on the blue and green.

420
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,580
Okay!

421
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,820
It doesn't get stretched no matter how much I paint it.

422
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,220
It is completely different from the canvas.

423
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,200
The brush is dry too quickly, and it's completely different from the oil.

424
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,160
Hey, here it is.

425
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:23,780
Get off.

426
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,200
Hey, here it is.

427
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,280
Get off my face.

428
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,960
I forgot about them.

429
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,480
Wake up, Kankichi.

430
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,140
Tonpei and Jinkichi, too.

431
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,840
It's too late. You have to go home.

432
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,840
Thank you for helping me.

433
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,780
No!

434
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,260
You're welcome.

435
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,920
I'll help you until the end.

436
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,500
But...

437
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,740
Please help me. I want to help you.

438
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,320
Okay.

439
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,540
But, please get permission from your family.

440
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,300
Okay.

441
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,860
I'll bring you something to eat.

442
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,340
I'll bring you something to eat.

443
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,040
I'll bring you something to eat.

444
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,340
Okay!

445
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,480
Done!

446
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:27,960
What?

447
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,620
I did it!

448
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,280
It's a women's bath.

449
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,660
It's a men's bath next.

450
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,180
What?

451
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:32,940
I see.

452
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,200
There's still a men's bath.

453
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,540
What's a good man's bath picture?

454
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,400
What picture do you want to draw?

455
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,340
Mt. Fuji.

456
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,520
Me, too.

457
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,720
Me, too. Mt. Fuji.

458
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,040
Mt. Fuji.

459
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,280
Okay.

460
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,460
Mm!

461
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,080
Well done.

462
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,340
Do it.

463
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,680
I understand.

464
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,740
Good.

465
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,540
Shoo!

466
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,140
Good boy.

467
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,900
Yes.

468
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,860
I'm going now.

469
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,500
Shoo!

470
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,700
Shoo!

471
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:24,820
Good boy.

472
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,240
Shoo!

473
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,580
Eh? Red? I don't have any.

474
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,760
Eh? I'm in trouble. I need red.

475
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,100
I'll get it.

476
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,300
Yeah, leave it to us.

477
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
Thank you. Please.

478
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,880
Mister, red pen!

479
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,200
Red?

480
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,580
I'm trying, but I'm running out of red.

481
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,640
Where is the red pen?

482
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,080
Mister, where is the red pen?

483
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,280
Hey, bring me the two reds on the shelf.

484
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,980
And the empty can too.

485
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,180
I made the red.

486
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,800
I'm the only one who can make the same thing.

487
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,440
Not yet.

488
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,160
Now! Mix it quickly!

489
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,600
Okay.

490
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,720
The red pen...

491
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,140
Kankichi, hurry up.

492
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,560
What time is it now?

493
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,680
About 2:30.

494
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,200
We'll make it in time.

495
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,620
There's no one who comes at 3:00 anyway.

496
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,380
Old Man Ichibanbu!

497
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,840
I was in Matsunoye the other day.

498
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,040
So I'm in Umedoi today.

499
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,380
That old man gets really angry if he can't go to the bath on time.

500
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,500
You guys go to your sister.

501
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,160
I'll do something about Old Man Ichibanbu.

502
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,980
The

503
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,820
We're in Umedoi today, right?

504
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,280
Yes.

505
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,500
Get there just on time.

506
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,780
Yes, sir.

507
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,680
...We've run out of time.

508
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,320
...We've run out of time.

509
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,460
Okay! Hit it and crack it!

510
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,520
...

511
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,880
...

512
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,780
...

513
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,420
...

514
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,840
...

515
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,480
Uwaaaaaah!

516
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,140
Uwaaaaaah!

517
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,120
I can't feel my arm.

518
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,640
My legs are like a stick.

519
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,400
Hang in there, big sis!

520
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,500
Just a little more...

521
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,440
Just a little more...

522
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,200
Ah...

523
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,380
It's done!

524
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,960
Complete!

525
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,000
I did it!

526
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,640
3 o'clock.

527
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,560
Oh, perfect.

528
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Now, let's have a drink!

529
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,240
Oh, it's the red flag.

530
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,220
This is wonderful.

531
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,100
Huh?

532
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,360
Dad...

533
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,540
It's so bright.

534
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,960
Old man, look at the woman's face.

535
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,120
From Japan, the city of Mt. Fuji, to France.

536
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,440
This is how you feel, big sis.

537
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,540
Both are wonderful.

538
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,900
It's a good omen.

539
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:53,620
It's a good omen.

540
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,720
Dad, I...

541
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,100
Ah, it's time for the plane.

542
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,080
If you don't hurry, you'll be late.

543
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,620
Let me go before I get there.

544
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,900
Ah, let go!

545
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,820
Sis, hurry!

546
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,740
Be careful with your health.

547
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,960
You're going to be late.

548
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,720
Go.

549
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,260
Dad!

550
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,840
Well then, I'm going.

551
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,800
Sis!

552
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,840
Bye-bye!

553
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,520
Bye-bye, sis!

554
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Bye-bye!

555
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,940
Thanks, everyone!

556
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,840
Ha...

557
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,660
Ha...

558
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,880
One year has passed since then.

559
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,440
I did it!

560
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,200
I found you, Ichiban!

561
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,580
You're Ichiban's old man!

562
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,940
But above that...

563
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,240
What?

564
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,360
The picture has changed!

565
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,320
I was a bit shocked.

566
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,660
There was only a little bit of red paint left under the painted picture.

567
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,920
I felt like my precious memories had disappeared.

568
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,660
I thought it was only natural.

569
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,880
I realized how important it was when it disappeared.

570
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,560
The painted picture of the centaur is wet and discolored, so it can be repainted once a year.

571
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,480
That is the fate of the painted picture.

572
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,160
Then this picture is valuable.

573
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,820
Well, yes.

574
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,500
At that time, I regretted why I didn't leave it in my memory even more.

575
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,540
I tasted it and that was the end of the video.

576
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,640
Every time I wore it, it felt like I Hanae this time because it was so cute.

577
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,880
I walked looking back at the light

578
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,920
I was drawn to the gacha

579
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:34,440
I felt a strange feeling at that time

580
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,120
So I tried to walk on the black side of the Akedogai Tile

581
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,880
I was drawn to the black side of the Akedogai Tile

582
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,060
Everyone was a child at one time

583
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,780
But they all forget

584
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,960
A politician with a great face

585
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,720
A blue aunt in the eyes

586
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,160
Look up at that corner

587
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,720
I want to meet everyone

588
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,640
Let's go!

589
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,020
There is a turtle

590
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,560
There must be a turtle

591
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,460
Everyone, come to our town

592
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,540
Thank you!

593
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,220
I did it! I picked up a small number on the street!

594
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,780
This must be a gift from God!

595
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,980
I thought so!

596
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,260
It's really a surprise camera!

597
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,840
Even the president has come with me!

598
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,000
Then, if I'm the president, won't I be deceived?

599
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,960
Next time, "Ryotsu Dokkiri Maruhi Report"

600
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,100
Please watch it!

601
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,860
There is a turtle there

602
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,900
There must be a turtle

603
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,840
Everyone, come to our town

604
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,900
Thank you!
