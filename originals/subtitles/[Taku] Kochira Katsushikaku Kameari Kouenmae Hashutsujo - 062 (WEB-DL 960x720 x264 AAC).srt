watching the sunset floating on the river If I

00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,320
kick the love stone, I can fly to the shoes

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,240
I wonder if I'll go to the gym where I was saving money

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,080
I was laughed at as I was a

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,460
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can only win

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape that doesn't change even one yawn is strangely gentle

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,400
From the waterfront of the Tungari-boshi

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,140
The sunset falls to the Kaishakuten

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,180
Tomorrow is already over

19
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,520
I lost my happiness again because of the Katsushika Shiba

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,980
I realized that I was stupid

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,340
So

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,320
Run,

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,220
Father!

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,700
I'm full!

25
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,040
Yes, I'm home.

26
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,720
Here you are.

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,360
Honda Hayato

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,300
I don't need it.

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,480
I have you!

30
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,500
Yes, go!

31
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,060
Honda!

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,340
Go!

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,880
Go!

34
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,840
Yes, go!

35
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,400
Yes.

36
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,180
It was all right.

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,040
You can forget about Yoko

38
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,880
Yoko

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,180
Why?

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,260
Don't be so nervous.

41
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,820
If you're a man, you should forget about the woman who was dumped.

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,760
Yes!

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,740
Honda Hayato

44
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,680
Forget about it!

45
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,740
OK!

46
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,540
Boss.

47
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:25,720
.

48
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,760
Well...

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,600
It's 13,000 yen, but thanks to Mr. Honda who took out Mr. Ryo's past years of experience,

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,680
we'll accept 10,000 yen each.

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,800
I see. Then I beg your pardon!

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,960
W-wait,

53
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,800
are there more times where you let me down than my seniors do?

54
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,960
Well, yeah.

55
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,540
I can't take it anymore...

56
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,620
I don't have the confidence to live as a human being.

57
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,460
Look at him, he's talking nonsense.

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,720
I'm sorry, Ryo.

59
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,360
Don't be sad.

60
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,420
My number of times I've been in trouble is the number of times I've been in the police.

61
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,020
If you count the number of times I've been in trouble since I was a kid, it's more than that.

62
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,000
You're still a kid.

63
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
-Really? -Yeah.

64
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,180
That's great.

65
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm getting more and more brave.

66
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:12,960
Yeah?

67
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,280
Okay, let's go one more time.

68
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,180
Yes!

69
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,800
Let's go to Tokoton today!

70
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,660
Tokoton!

71
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,860
Hey, you came on board, didn't you?

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,960
Look!

73
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,720
Isn't that Mr. Honda?

74
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,560
He's amazing!

75
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,040
He's saying that he's working so hard.

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,640
Well...

77
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,480
I guess it's better to comfort him.

78
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,240
Shut up!

79
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,780
I've been drinking three cups of beer since that day.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,540
Besides, I was accompanied by the chief yesterday and he said a lot of bad things about me.

81
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,480
Why don't you learn from Mr. Honda?

82
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,380
He's a good friend of mine,

83
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,260
so he's working so hard for me.

84
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,700
How naive.

85
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,180
Huh?

86
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,880
When Honda is on fire, it's the time to fall in love.

87
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,480
He's quick to be depressed, but he'll recover faster.

88
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,260
Then...

89
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,500
Yeah, he's definitely in love.

90
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,620
"I'm in love with you."

91
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:14,680
"I'm in love with you."

92
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,980
"I'm in love with you."

93
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm in love with him.

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,840
He hurts me!

95
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,740
Yeah, you're in love!

96
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,820
I'm going to make you come to my home!

97
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,020
My feelings for you!

98
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,620
Your feelings for me?

99
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,760
I love you!

100
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,440
Stop!

101
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,120
I can't!

102
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,580
My heart hurts!

103
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,040
Oh, my knees!

104
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,480
I'll make you come today!

105
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,260
With me!

106
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,420
With me!

107
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,960
With me!

108
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,580
The next day

109
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,120
What the hell is this?

110
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,280
Run away!

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,640
I thought I could run away, but I've done too much!

112
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,480
Honza-senpai!

113
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,720
Hey, Kokoro!

114
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,580
We've received a message from the rescue team!

115
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,860
Oh, I see.

116
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,300
I'll leave the rest to you!

117
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,060
Yes!

118
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,620
Damn that bastard!

119
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,780
He did it so hard!

120
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
I'll write it in the newspaper!

121
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,420
Did something happen?

122
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,020
No, nothing. I'm sorry!

123
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,980
You'd better be investigated!

124
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,800
It's more scary than a bird's nest!

125
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,040
So, what did you say?

126
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,940
What's the matter, Senpai?

127
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,360
You?

128
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,200
Are we in love again?

129
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,820
Daiya, darling!

130
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,660
Good boy.

131
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,080
You are scared to confess like that.

132
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,520
I'm afraid that your job will be more difficult for you.

133
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,080
Truth be told, I'm scared to confess, too.

134
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,000
So, who's your sister this time?

135
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,920
Actually, there's a shop in Azabu to maintain white voracely.

136
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,000
A lady working there has a man

137
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,320
I'm so tired.

138
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,900
Alright, let's go.

139
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,560
What?

140
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,280
You should get your scars on before it's too late.

141
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,620
I-It's obvious that I'm going to get hurt.

142
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,160
Don't be so stubborn. Just hit it and smash it.

143
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,140
I don't want to smash it!

144
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,660
Honda, be brave.

145
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,780
That's right.

146
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,400
Ego, I'm counting on you.

147
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,800
It's a big shop.

148
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,720
It's a motorcycle import company.

149
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,420
Motoguchi Motors is famous.

150
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,340
It's the second largest import company in Japan.

151
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,940
I see.

152
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,900
I guess I'm going to have to...

153
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,800
Honda!

154
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,320
Wait!

155
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,620
No, no, no! I'm going home!

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,220
Let me go!

157
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,320
Don't come near me!

158
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,540
Let's decide!

159
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,380
Right, Honda?

160
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,060
Wow, they're all famous in the world.

161
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,760
Recently, they started selling a motorcycle with the name Motoguchi.

162
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,200
It's the fifth largest motorcycle in Japan.

163
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,860
They're aiming to become a motorcycle manufacturer.

164
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,260
I'm looking forward to the future.

165
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,160
Is she the woman who was at the Shiroba inspection?

166
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,440
Yeah.

167
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,880
Then, I think she's the president's daughter.

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,560
What?

169
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,420
President's daughter?

170
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,240
Yes.

171
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,760
You're in love with something great again.

172
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,320
The president's daughter and the bike repairman's daughter are the same.

173
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,040
No, I'm going home.

174
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,120
I'm going home!

175
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,320
Senpai!

176
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:37,860
Yes?

177
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,520
Are you with that lady now?

178
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,420
Yes, I am.

179
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,340
This way, please.

180
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,700
No!

181
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,860
I'm going home!

182
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,860
I'm going home!

183
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,140
I'm definitely going home!

184
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,500
That lady is running now.

185
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,420
She's a good runner.

186
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,300
Right, Honda?

187
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,040
Yes.

188
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:22,820
Yeah, I'm really going home.

189
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,260
I'm Motoguchi Rika.

190
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,960
Can I help you?

191
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,380
This girl is so pretty!

192
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:30,840
Well, yeah.

193
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,140
I'm Ryotsu Kakuchi.

194
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,620
I'm Nagagawa.

195
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,180
Nice to meet you.

196
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,820
But this guy...

197
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,640
Oh, the Shirobai team that came the other day.

198
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,540
You remember me? I'm impressed!

199
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,900
I'm Honda Hayato of the 4th Mobile Team!

200
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,940
You're the famous Honda-san?

201
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,020
What? You know me?

202
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,480
There's no rider in Tokyo who doesn't know the late Honda.

203
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,480
You have a completely different image.

204
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,420
I thought you were a more scary person.

205
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,740
When I get off the bike, I become like this.

206
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,660
I'm like Jekyll and Hyde.

207
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,460
You seem to have a lot of veins.

208
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,760
No, that's not true.

209
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,320
By the way, Rika-san, he likes you.

210
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,340
Will you go out with him?

211
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,540
Senior!

212
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,440
Yeah.

213
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,540
Sure. Let's go out.

214
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,980
What?!

215
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,760
That's great, Honda!

216
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,260
As a friend, I'm very welcome.

217
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
As a friend?

218
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,400
Yes.

219
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:31,900
Yes.

220
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,840
Friendship is a habit.

221
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,800
You can also say that it's a good thing.

222
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,540
But it's not completely a denial.

223
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,340
It's all up to your skills.

224
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,040
Naka, let's go.

225
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,600
Yes.

226
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,500
Wait a moment, Senior.

227
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,640
What should I do with my skills?

228
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,080
Think about it yourself.

229
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,480
Even if you say that...

230
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:55,860
There's nothing like that.

231
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,980
I have to go in this case.

232
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,480
But...

233
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,300
But there's no strike.

234
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,660
Mr. Honda!

235
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,200
Are you alright, Mr. Honda?

236
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,900
No, I'm fine about this.

237
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,640
Senior...

238
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,560
No need to worry.

239
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,020
He's a good man at fixing women's instincts.

240
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,020
Well done, Honda!

241
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,060
-Honda! -That's amazing!

242
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,140
Congratulations, Mr. Honda!

243
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,080
Oh, thank you very much!

244
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,140
-Honda, this is a reverse-sacrifice. -Versus-sacrifice?

245
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
It's a reverse-sacrifice.

246
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,860
-She's single, right? -Yes.

247
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,700
That means if you proposed to her and got married,

248
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,300
you're the president of Motoguchi Motors.

249
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,980
N-No way!

250
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,560
I just invited her to a date.

251
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,640
You're the president of Motoguchi Motors.

252
00:10:59,640 --> 00:10:59,700
You're the president of Motoguchi Motors.

253
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,320
50% of the people will get married.

254
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,680
50%?

255
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,500
-Really? -Yes.

256
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,040
If that's the case, I'll have to thank you.

257
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,340
What?

258
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,540
If you become president, you'll get a Dohgatti or a Harley bike.

259
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,260
But I can't ride a bike.

260
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,300
I'll pay you.

261
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,980
No way.

262
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,840
You can at least get one every month.

263
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,240
Don't be ridiculous.

264
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,760
You should mind your language.

265
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,560
If I didn't join, things wouldn't have gone this well.

266
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,140
Well, of course you wouldn't.

267
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,540
Alright, one for your next month.

268
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,360
You can see I'll be heading on with a full time position

269
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,540
as vice president as a colleague of mine.

270
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,440
Okay.

271
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,160
You can say I'm going to be the "big president" of the future.

272
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,280
Subtitle by Subdivers

273
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,660
You idiot!

274
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,800
You can't date a girl who rides a manual!

275
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,900
Oh, I've been looking into it...

276
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,880
You can't be a city girl like that!

277
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,000
You have to show your personality more!

278
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,760
My... My personality?

279
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,380
Umm...

280
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,640
You look great on a motorbike!

281
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,560
You look great on a motorbike!

282
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,200
He's a pro rider too. That's not acceptable!

283
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,400
If you can show your personality to others...

284
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,220
Nice!

285
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,160
I'm worried.

286
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,080
Actually, I am! Don't worry!

287
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,020
What?

288
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,380
Really?

289
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,620
There is a weapon that Rika Motoguchi doesn't have in Honda...

290
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,100
That is...

291
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,180
That is...

292
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,960
The birth of a city girl!

293
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,920
A city girl?

294
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,020
Yes!

295
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,640
As the killer of a city girl, I summoned a city girl!

296
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,520
Then, what I can't do?

297
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,880
To a nearby town in a town I know, I can't run away!

298
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,660
Seems like Americans do.

299
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
I first saw a town in a town where the Edo culture begins.

300
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,280
She encountered a culture shock, I got shocked.

301
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,540
That's why Honda-san is so wonderful.

302
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,320
I see.

303
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,540
That's why Honda-san is so wonderful.

304
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,920
So, I'll do your hand-to-hand and...

305
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,300
I won't!

306
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,560
I will be a big shot in Asakusa!

307
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,660
No matter how much I own a town or a city, I'll attend!

308
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,960
Then, I can't do anything you ask of me.

309
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,220
I can't help it. I'll set up the whole date course.

310
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,200
Senpai...

311
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,540
If you do as I say, everything will be fine.

312
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,080
Yes, thank you.

313
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,620
I'll make you the president no matter what.

314
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,920
I'm going to be on a big ship.

315
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,960
I count on you, senpai.

316
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,680
Namidabashi?

317
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,640
That's not a bad place.

318
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,740
Idiot!

319
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,020
Namidabashi is the place where Jyo and Tanke met for the first time.

320
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,180
But I don't think there's actually such a bridge.

321
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,540
I'll explain it to you.

322
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,800
"I'm crossing Namidabashi, Jyo!"

323
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,320
And I'll make Tanke and Tanpei laugh by imitating their voices.

324
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,560
As expected of you, senpai. You're so detailed.

325
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,700
"Jyo!"

326
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,480
"I'm crossing Namidabashi, Jyo!"

327
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,000
Mama, what's that?

328
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,700
Don't look at me.

329
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,300
Will this really be okay?

330
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,320
Hi, this is Honda.

331
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,800
Oh, Rika?

332
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,460
Mr. Honda?

333
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,200
Excuse me, but can you change the address to the intersection of Matsuyama and Sukiyabashi?

334
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,140
Ah, that...

335
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,760
Is that okay?

336
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,720
No, I'll be there soon.

337
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,580
I can't imitate Sukiyabashi and Tanke and Tanpei!

338
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,100
Um, um...

339
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,560
Next is...

340
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,600
Next is to Motoguchi by tandem.

341
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,540
You two will make Rika feel excited.

342
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,960
"Feel excited"?

343
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,960
Motoguchi's original bike.

344
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,800
Rika will be happy to ride it.

345
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,940
That's great.

346
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,960
The exhaust note that will sway your heart is...

347
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,720
I can only say my original words.

348
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,460
Oh, Honda-san!

349
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,120
I'm so nervous!

350
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,280
How is it?

351
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,060
Senpai, I'm a man!

352
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,360
I'm so nervous!

353
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,080
Then I'll write you a note!

354
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,200
Yes.

355
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,220
Ah, I can only say my original words

356
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,640
I'm sorry, Honda-san.

357
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm late.

358
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,180
Riku-san,

359
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,220
no, I wasn't waiting at all.

360
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,860
That's good.

361
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,380
Hey,

362
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,700
how about I drive?

363
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,220
Oh, what a cool car!

364
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,500
I'm so excited.

365
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,640
Where should we go?

366
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:00,960
That's right.

367
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,720
Next,

368
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,420
let's eat.

369
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,500
Oh,

370
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,480
Monjayaki?

371
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,600
You're so naive!

372
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,560
Monjayaki is too representative and has no freshness.

373
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,600
If you want to give her a culture shock,

374
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,840
you can have a gift of a Japanese-style sushi.

375
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,180
You can have a Japanese-style sushi.

376
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,920
A Japanese-style sushi?

377
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,680
What's that?

378
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,660
Don't you know what a Japanese-style sushi is?

379
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,960
It's a whale's cutlet.

380
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,440
It was served at a school lunch.

381
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,180
Hmm...

382
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,860
It wasn't served.

383
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,120
Is that so?

384
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,000
It's because we're from different generations.

385
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,560
It's been 12 years since it was banned from eating.

386
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,020
Isn't that impossible?

387
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,080
I'm sorry.

388
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:39,920
Don't be ridiculous.

389
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,760
If you were younger than you,

390
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,720
you wouldn't even know that you can eat whale meat.

391
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,620
You'll be shocked for sure.

392
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,400
I see.

393
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,820
A meal is a whale's cutlet.

394
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,900
A meal is a whale's cutlet?

395
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,140
Hey, Rika,

396
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,820
we're having a meal.

397
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,780
Huh?

398
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,420
Oh,

399
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:56,740
what?

400
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,620
What?

401
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,340
What?

402
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,060
What?

403
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,420
What?

404
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,740
What?

405
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,540
Is it your first time having a Thai meal?

406
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,840
Oh,

407
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,340
yes.

408
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,780
It's my first time being born.

409
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,500
It's spicy but delicious.

410
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,940
I'm so happy.

411
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,540
I'm so happy.

412
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:11,600
That's good.

413
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,460
I'm so happy.

414
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:14,900
I'm so happy.

415
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm so happy.

416
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,600
A whale's cutlet wasn't good either.

417
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:16,780
I can't get sick.

418
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,220
Berth?

419
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:18,700
This is my last meal.

420
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,020
See you later.

421
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,500
And after that,

422
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,880
it's an excursion to Riki Island.

423
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,140
Riki Island.

424
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,620
on a small boat.

425
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,560
You can never go on theüty boat tour too.

426
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,540
We didn't quite get it.

427
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:28,940
This is an ice rink.

428
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,880
Don't do that.

429
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,800
growth losers.

430
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,380
Do and don't put on aDrone on an ice rink.

431
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,400
I don't really understand.

432
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,460
Just wave to the beach.

433
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:44,800
Haha....

434
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,920
Hahaha....

435
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,440
Hahaha.....

436
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,040
Hahahaha...

437
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,840
Hahahaha....

438
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,320
Hahahaha....

439
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,480
Hahahaha...

440
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,180
It was fun.

441
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,780
Yes.

442
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
This is not going to continue like this.

443
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,920
We need to decide only for the last time.

444
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,360
On your way back from your date,

445
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,920
I'll send her to your house.

446
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,300
I will show the man's worth.

447
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:10,580
I'll show you the true power of the Ichi-Gisa!

448
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,820
Understood?

449
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,780
Um, Ms. Rika...

450
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,280
Well then, Ms. Rika.

451
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,400
I had a lot of fun today.

452
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,080
I'm glad you're happy.

453
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,260
Well then, good night.

454
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,560
Good night.

455
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,460
Oh my!

456
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,540
Good night.

457
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,920
Well, I was surprised to hear that.

458
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,280
I was surprised to hear that.

459
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,480
What are you going to do after being shocked by the culture shock?

460
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,940
Well, I was really nervous

461
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,540
when I was taken to Ms. Rika's house.

462
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,840
You're completely at the other side of the spectrum.

463
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,260
I'm sorry.

464
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,820
Well, did you confess your love?

465
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,520
Well, did you confess your love?

466
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,140
What?

467
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:57,700
You idiot!

468
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,900
Then why did you go on a date?

469
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,020
But,

470
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,000
Ms. Rika introduced me to your parents.

471
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,320
What?

472
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,160
Parents?

473
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,980
You were introduced to your parents on your first date?

474
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes.

475
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,340
So, how was it?

476
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,760
Well, Mr. Honda, here's a cup.

477
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,640
Thank you.

478
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,240
When I said I was a white-collar employee,

479
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,460
my father liked me.

480
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,460
You did well!

481
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,200
It seems that 80% of your father liked you.

482
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,660
Really?

483
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,240
That's right.

484
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,480
I think you should give it to your daughter's boyfriend.

485
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,700
Mr. Honda, you did well.

486
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,840
Mr. Honda, you did well.

487
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,320
You can't forget the president's sword.

488
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,620
I'll leave it to you.

489
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
If you want to be a good husband and daughter-in-law,

490
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,100
you should first be a good son-in-law and a good son-in-law.

491
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,520
You should attack your father as much as possible.

492
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,640
Yes, I will.

493
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,120
Actually,

494
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,300
I was invited to my father's company for the next vacation.

495
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,280
I see.

496
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,720
90% is not bad!

497
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,240
Good luck, Mr. Honda!

498
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,620
Yes!

499
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:04,720
Good luck, Mr. Honda!

500
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,280
Good luck, Mr. Honda!

501
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,500
I found a good girlfriend.

502
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,260
But she hasn't been around lately.

503
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,200
Don't be so annoying, Nakagawa.

504
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:16,800
I'm off work.

505
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,220
No, I was wondering about Mr. Honda too.

506
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,640
He hasn't gone out for a week since then.

507
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,220
No, I was wondering about Mr. Honda too.

508
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,060
No, I was wondering about Mr. Honda too.

509
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,180
Miss, please be careful.

510
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,480
I'll leave it to you.

511
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,080
Yes, I'll be going.

512
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,460
Yes, I'll be going.

513
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,020
Yes, I'll be going.

514
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,900
Mr. Ryotsu, Mr. Nakagawa!

515
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,260
Where are you going?

516
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,760
I'm going to Europe.

517
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,820
Europe?

518
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,900
I'm going to Europe.

519
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,220
I'm going to Europe.

520
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,620
What?

521
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,680
Then, what about your marriage with Mr. Honda?

522
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,880
Marriage? I don't like it.

523
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,220
But that's fine with me.

524
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,920
If you have a girlfriend, you can marry.

525
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,680
But that's fine with me.

526
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,380
But do you know his name?

527
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,580
Mr. Honda is not my father.

528
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:06,940
He's my father.

529
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,300
Excuse me, I have to talk to him.

530
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,580
Bye.

531
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,080
Excuse me, I have to talk to him.

532
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,820
Let's go on a date when yoru will be back.

533
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,880
Let's go on a date when yoru will be back.

534
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,080
Lots of excuses.

535
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,620
I'll be waiting for you.

536
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,220
Boss, we've reduced Rika's course record by 2 seconds.

537
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,240
What?

538
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,380
This is amazing data, Boss.

539
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,080
Tonira, you're back.

540
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,600
You're still doing well.

541
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,940
I see. You're very reliable.

542
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,240
Then, I'll take care of the test run of this bike.

543
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,360
Before that, please let me see Rika.

544
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,720
Rika?

545
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,980
This is bad. If Honda finds out, the development will be delayed again.

546
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,180
Rika is taking a shower right now.

547
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,220
Shall we go to see it together?

548
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,980
No, no...

549
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,300
By the way, Rika said that the Honda on the bike is the coolest.

550
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,740
Rika?

551
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,840
Honda!

552
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,960
I'll go to the test run!

553
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,260
What is it?

554
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,680
It's just a test driver.

555
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,520
By the way, Honda said that he liked your skills.

556
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,200
Hey!

557
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,000
Hey!

558
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,980
Rika's boss!

559
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,740
Isn't Honda pitiful?

560
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,920
That's right.

561
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,600
What are you doing?

562
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,420
I'm a friend of Honda.

563
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,400
Why is Rika keeping it a secret that you started in Europe?

564
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,300
But,

565
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,940
Rika is a test driver for me.

566
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
I think that he can be my son.

567
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,580
What?

568
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,380
Then, marry Rika?

569
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,220
It has nothing to do with you.

570
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,660
What?

571
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,860
Please choose one.

572
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,580
But then, Rika and Honda can be brothers, right?

573
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,600
That's right, but...

574
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,740
there is a problem, I suppose.

575
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,020
Or, is it?

576
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,480
No! No! No!

577
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,680
No problem at all!

578
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,040
Boss, the course record again!

579
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,000
What?

580
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,820
Wait!

581
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,260
Boss!

582
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,180
It's alright.

583
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,080
At least we got a good landing.

584
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,620
No way!

585
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,560
You're really good at this, Honda.

586
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,860
Get the next machine.

587
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,020
Yes!

588
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,680
Boss, wait a minute.

589
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,500
I know.

590
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,680
Your wife always said she wanted to see you on a motorcycle.

591
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,440
I'll go, dad.

592
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,040
Well, Honda.

593
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,200
You're my son now.

594
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,180
You can do it.

595
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,860
Boss, I can't tell you the truth.

596
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,780
Poor guy.

597
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,900
I'll go out with you again sometime.

598
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,360
You're really good, Mini Pato girls!

599
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,620
You're all over the place!

600
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,540
Watch me now.

601
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,060
I'll teach you a lesson.

602
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,580
I'll blow up different newspapers like Koshin that're not about to be published.

603
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,960
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

604
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,120
Be sure to pay attention next episode!

605
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,140
The纹社新聞大戦争!
