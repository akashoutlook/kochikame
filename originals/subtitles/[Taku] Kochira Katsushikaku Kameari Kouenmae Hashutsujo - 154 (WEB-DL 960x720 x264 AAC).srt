1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,640
When you watch TV

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,920
Make the room brighter

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,420
And try to get away

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:24,720
Like someone calling

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,060
The rain after the rain

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,260
I walked looking back

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,080
I was drawn to the gacha

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,580
I felt

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,540
A strange feeling

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,060
So

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,360
I tried to walk

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,400
The black tile of the arcade

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:53,440
I tried to walk

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,360
Go to the left

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,880
I saw the darkness

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,780
The black tile of the arcade

17
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,900
I saw the black tile of the arcade

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,140
I saw the black tile of the arcade

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,220
I saw the black tile of the arcade

20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,480
And I took a deep breath

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,320
What should I do

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,060
♪ Ah, it must be a turtle ♪

23
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,040
♪ Everyone, come to our town ♪

24
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,600
Thank you!

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,960
Ah! The Hellish Life of the Beast

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,800
Yagi, I won a lot of games today!

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,320
I'll clean up the room!

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,620
That's it! I have one more step to go!

29
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,540
Uryaaaaa!

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,020
What?

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,280
Uryaaaaa!

32
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,620
What's this? Ryo is gone!

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, Ryo, you're here!

34
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,020
I'm not here. What's going on, old lady?

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,160
You have to rebuild it!

36
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,480
Huh? Rebuild it?

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,680
Another male Ryo in the Katsushika office was caught in the department's management,

38
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,360
so he was going to meet up with my Ryo.

39
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,300
Huh? So you're going to rebuild it?

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,920
Yes, to increase the number of people.

41
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,960
But there's no need to do it so suddenly.

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
No way, Ryo!

43
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,460
You've been writing it down on the bulletin board for three months!

44
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,700
Huh? Is there a bulletin board in my Ryo's room?

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,260
There is!

46
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,240
But where should I live?

47
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,460
It looks like everyone is renting an apartment or moving to a friend's house.

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to my daughter's place too.

49
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
See you in two months, Ryo!

50
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,580
Hey, how are you?

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,180
I'm fine.

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,360
I have to find a place to sleep.

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,240
Huh? You're staying at my house?

54
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,300
Yes, I'm looking forward to working with you.

55
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,980
I'm sorry, but the Arabian ambassador will be staying at my house for a while from tomorrow.

56
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,800
What? Are you saying I'm the only one left in Japan?

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,240
That's not what I mean.

58
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,580
Then what?

59
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,580
Huh? Ryo, you're home, aren't you?

60
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,680
Oh, Terai! You're back at the right place! Actually, I...

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,060
Wait.

62
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,140
Wait.

63
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,340
You have about three and a half hours of work to do, right?

64
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Yeah, but what's that?

65
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,700
Nothing.

66
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,780
Reiko!

67
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,360
No!

68
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,260
I haven't told you anything yet!

69
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,080
No, no, no!

70
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,740
What are you thinking about going to a single woman's room?

71
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,820
If you can live with Ryo for two months, it's even better to live with a cockroach.

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,760
Stop talking about that!

73
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,880
Who would want to live with you?

74
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:45,900
Pekka!

75
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,320
Pekka!

76
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,940
What happened, Ryo?

77
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,820
Ryo's apartment has been taken over.

78
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,020
That's terrible.

79
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,260
That's why I'm telling you, there's no trouble in your house. Don't worry.

80
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,500
Thank you.

81
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,320
Bunchou!

82
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,720
Oh, I'm so busy, I'm so busy.

83
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,180
Reiko, this is all right, so please give me your documents.

84
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,460
Yes!

85
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,680
Bunchou! Bunchou! Bunchou!

86
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,180
Bunchou! Bunchou!

87
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,120
Here you go.

88
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,860
Thank you.

89
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,080
Oh, this is it.

90
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,080
Bunchou!

91
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,620
Bunchou, listen to me!

92
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,780
You idiot!

93
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,280
Don't get too close to your bad face!

94
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,640
Then listen to me.

95
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
No, no, no.

96
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,680
It's really wonderful to live in your house for two months.

97
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,680
I see.

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,420
Then you have a book in your closet.

99
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,860
If you bring a blanket in there, you'll live a great life.

100
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,800
I can't believe you would say that even though your wife is suffering.

101
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,900
You always say such jokes.

102
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,820
I'm not kidding.

103
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,260
If you have more vitality than cockroaches, you'll be fine.

104
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:51,940
I'm not fine!

105
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,100
How about the back yard?

106
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,280
I don't have to worry about getting late and getting close.

107
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,720
Well, the back yard is where the riot gangs gather at night.

108
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,440
I wonder if I'll go into the riot gangs and rampage.

109
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,800
You're a useless man, but how can you buy a bike?

110
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,860
Are you a riot gang or a parking lot?

111
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,960
Anyway, I don't know.

112
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,240
Oh, I see.

113
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:14,860
I got it.

114
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,020
I'll really get it when it's like this.

115
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,740
And when I'm arrested, I'll say like this.

116
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,720
I'm not that bad.

117
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,200
It's the fault of Ohara who set up the park.

118
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,120
If you had stopped me at that time, I wouldn't have moved.

119
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,980
I'll let everyone yell at me that I'm the chief of Ohara.

120
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,460
Ryo-chan is quite a person.

121
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,580
Yes.

122
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,900
If that happens, the chief's neck won't fly.

123
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,700
I got it, Ryo-chan.

124
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,820
Come stay at my house.

125
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,480
Thank you very much.

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,900
After all, I can understand if you ask for mental justice.

127
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,060
Where is mental justice?

128
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,680
Instead, treat your family the same.

129
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,180
You're different from a lowly man.

130
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,820
Yes, of course.

131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,860
Thank you.

132
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,520
I walk from JR to the station and then to the bus stop.

133
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,160
I often go there every day.

134
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,120
Don't say that.

135
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,120
Follow me.

136
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,820
You're going to work as a clerk on the same route for two months.

137
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,240
Yes, yes.

138
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,180
I'm back.

139
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,180
Welcome, Ryo-chan.

140
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,860
It's been a while, madam.

141
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,920
Come on in.

142
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,080
I'm not here as a customer.

143
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,760
I'm going to stay at your house for two months.

144
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:24,840
Is that so?

145
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,640
Thank you very much.

146
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,700
You're welcome.

147
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,840
Please relax.

148
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,340
What are you talking about?

149
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,620
It's a nuisance to relax when I'm free.

150
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,020
Father.

151
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,100
Be patient, Ryo-chan.

152
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,140
It's been two months.

153
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,760
I'll have lunch before the bath today.

154
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,100
I see.

155
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,020
What's your favorite food, Ryo-chan?

156
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,720
Anything.

157
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,680
Hey.

158
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,260
Yes.

159
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,100
You can come to me every day.

160
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,700
Think of it as air.

161
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,720
You're talking about what you like.

162
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,220
Remember that.

163
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,100
It's time for the news.

164
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,140
The bill is being paid.

165
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,800
The bath after a delicious dinner was also pleasant.

166
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,540
Ryo-chan.

167
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,320
Would you like some tea?

168
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,500
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,040
Thank you.

170
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,800
You don't have to put it in.

171
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,800
Ryo-chan.

172
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,700
Put some tea in it yourself.

173
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,140
Yes, yes.

174
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,740
Thank you.

175
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,300
Thank you.

176
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:11,900
I'm sorry.

177
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,280
No problem.

178
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,780
I don't understand what you're talking about.

179
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,480
I don't get it at all.

180
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,680
Director, is this show interesting?

181
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,780
It's not such a question.

182
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,240
As a policeman, it's better to know this much.

183
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,680
My suggestion is the story of their house in Akashiyama, Fuji.

184
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,520
Do you always watch that kind of show?

185
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,480
No, it's not.

186
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,820
I want to watch NHK, but I can't find it for some reason.

187
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,320
It's a good opportunity.

188
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,900
It's late. You should watch NHK here.

189
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,600
Oh, I suddenly have a cold.

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,300
Yoichi-san, are you OK?

191
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,900
I'm fine.

192
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,360
You must be tired from today.

193
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,620
You should rest.

194
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,880
Really? That's too bad.

195
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,900
I wanted to watch NHK.

196
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,780
Go to sleep.

197
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,500
I'll leave you to it. Good night.

198
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,700
The TV news is totally against the director.

199
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,140
I have to get up early.

200
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,620
I have to drink.

201
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,760
I can't sleep.

202
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,860
Pocket Pin, you're my only friend.

203
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,760
It's hard to have a superior.

204
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,900
Yoichi.

205
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,580
Yes?

206
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,760
I'll wake you up early tomorrow.

207
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,580
Yes.

208
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,860
Go to bed.

209
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,840
Yes.

210
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,940
I'm being watched all day.

211
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,280
I'm more of a coward.

212
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,740
Yoichi, wake up.

213
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,400
It's already morning?

214
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,000
How long are you going to sleep?

215
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,220
When you wake up, fold the futon and come to the garden.

216
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,940
It's still dark. What time is it?

217
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,680
It's still four o'clock.

218
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,800
Old people wake up earlier than you.

219
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,100
Did you say something?

220
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,380
I'm going to bed.

221
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,800
61.

222
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,540
62.

223
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,160
63.

224
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,000
64.

225
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,780
65.

226
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,520
Don't go any further.

227
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,140
68.

228
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,740
69.

229
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,600
70.

230
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,280
Why?

231
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,940
What are you doing?

232
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,360
My lower body is not in.

233
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,700
I see.

234
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,180
Let's take a break.

235
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,900
He's not a coward.

236
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,280
It's ridiculous to sleep right after you wake up.

237
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,140
I haven't even seen the sun yet.

238
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,580
I'm on a six o'clock bus, so I can't wake up in time.

239
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,420
If it's six o'clock, you can wake up at five o'clock.

240
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,020
What?

241
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,020
I'm a cop.

242
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,620
I have to train my body.

243
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,040
I do this 100 times a day.

244
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,420
You should do it 200 times a day.

245
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,040
I understand.

246
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,900
I'll do it 300 times.

247
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,220
You said it right.

248
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,180
73.

249
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,260
71.

250
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:48,880
75.

251
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,820
76.

252
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,580
127.

253
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,440
128.

254
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,300
129.

255
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,800
130.

256
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,620
172.

257
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,440
173.

258
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,360
174.

259
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,980
203.

260
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,660
204.

261
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,300
205.

262
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:10,660
206, 207, 209, 210, 211, 250, 251, 222, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300!

263
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,200
Boss, it's over.

264
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,240
Alright, that's enough.

265
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,340
Now, it's time for dinner.

266
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,660
The food after exercise is delicious.

267
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,620
Ouch!

268
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,040
Is there anything else?

269
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,240
Look at that.

270
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,220
I'm starting to feel a lot of bad luck.

271
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,680
I'm going to do some gardening.

272
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,500
Is that so?

273
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, good luck then.

274
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,960
I'm going to go sweat first.

275
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,860
In this case, there should be people who can help you.

276
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,760
For example, a man who's eating just rice.

277
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:40,940
Alright.

278
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,280
I'll do it if I have to.

279
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, sorry.

280
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,880
I didn't know you'd do it on your own.

281
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,500
No, no, no.

282
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,280
I think I made it too much.

283
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,220
Damn it.

284
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,380
Ryo-chan, are you alright?

285
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,220
I just went to the manager's house and it's only been a week.

286
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,500
I feel like I'm under a lot of pressure.

287
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,280
You know how hard it is to work long distance, right, Ryo-san?

288
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,500
Shut up.

289
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,040
It's not just work.

290
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,160
I get beaten up every morning at 4 o'clock.

291
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,340
I'm being used as a scapegoat.

292
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,640
Even on Sundays.

293
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,400
Dad, let's call a taxi.

294
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,000
What?

295
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,080
I can't do anything about it.

296
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,220
Right, Ryo-tsu?

297
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,920
Ehehe.

298
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,860
I'm sorry.

299
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,560
I thought you'd done it.

300
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,460
Besides, you're even my best friend.

301
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,700
Let's go to bed.

302
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,920
That's no good.

303
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,580
I told you tonight's the last game.

304
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,340
Ryo-tsu.

305
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:34,880
That's my big hand.

306
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,060
But I'm going to do whatever I want.

307
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,820
Just leave me alone.

308
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,080
Besides, I can't play baseball or play the pachinko.

309
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,340
Just let me stand.

310
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,020
You're going to get stressed out.

311
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,820
I wonder if you'll last another two months.

312
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,580
I don't think so.

313
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,860
Just watch.

314
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,540
I'm going to get out of this life.

315
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,620
And now, the weather for tomorrow.

316
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,300
Ryo-chan, have you gone to bed?

317
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,360
I think so.

318
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,660
He said he'd be up early.

319
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,060
I see.

320
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,000
Then I'll go to bed, too.

321
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,040
I won't have to train him again tomorrow.

322
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,520
Good night.

323
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,580
Well, he's gotten even busier since he came.

324
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:16,840
He's gotten much better.

325
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,080
Your father seems to have been enjoying his day since he came.

326
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,520
-Madam! -Yes?

327
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,660
I have a TV show I want to watch. Is that okay?

328
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,200
Sure, go ahead.

329
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,640
I can finally watch a show I like.

330
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,300
How about it, Ryo-chan?

331
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Do you want to watch a lot?

332
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,480
Is that okay?

333
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,140
Here you go.

334
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,600
I'm sorry.

335
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,640
Oh, it's delicious.

336
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,320
Ugh.

337
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,700
Your father will be fine.

338
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,580
He's been sleeping well lately, so he's been sleeping well.

339
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,600
Is that so?

340
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,500
But he suddenly came out of the window.

341
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,960
You're afraid of your father, aren't you?

342
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,100
I'm not afraid of him.

343
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,120
He's like a frog that's been lured by a snake.

344
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,380
Oh, really?

345
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,820
Here, have another drink.

346
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,840
Thank you.

347
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,200
I didn't think I'd be able to drink with you.

348
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,560
Your father is a good man.

349
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,460
It's not fair to drink so much.

350
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,680
In fact, Ryo-chan is happy that you came.

351
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,020
What? The chief?

352
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,300
I have a daughter.

353
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,280
I heard he wanted a boy.

354
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,180
I'm sure Ryo-chan came to my house, so he'll be like a son.

355
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,840
Hey, I don't think that scary chief...

356
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,080
Ugh.

357
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,940
I'm sorry.

358
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,120
It's a sleeping thing.

359
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,360
You always get angry at Ryo-chan.

360
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,900
Even when he's asleep, he only thinks about work.

361
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, I'm surprised.

362
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,860
I don't want to scare anyone even when I'm asleep.

363
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,000
If he's a father, I don't feel like I'm alive.

364
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,520
Really?

365
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,120
How about a drink?

366
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,620
What?

367
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,760
Sometimes it's good.

368
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,700
I know.

369
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,700
I wonder if I should have a drink.

370
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,700
You should have.

371
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,340
Here you go.

372
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,480
Thank you.

373
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,520
Huh?

374
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,100
It's a good drink.

375
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,900
Let's have another drink.

376
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,360
Let's make the chief's bad words known to the fish tonight.

377
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,460
Sure.

378
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:15,600
Let's drink.

379
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,800
Well?

380
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,540
Huh?

381
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,320
You didn't even kiss me before the wedding?

382
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,080
Not only did I kiss you, but you didn't even hold my hand, father.

383
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,240
You've always been stubborn, chief.

384
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,680
That's the only reason.

385
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,960
But you can stay with that stone head for almost 30 years.

386
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,100
You must be out of breath.

387
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm used to it now.

388
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,560
But it's better to be a little softer.

389
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,500
It's better to be a little softer.

390
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,360
That stone head will never heal.

391
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,380
But it's true.

392
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,540
It may never heal.

393
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,540
It's morning, Ryozu.

394
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,060
When are you going to sleep?

395
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:00,960
Wake up.

396
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,820
I smell like alcohol.

397
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,220
Hey, Ryozu.

398
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,680
Wake up.

399
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,320
I can't drink anymore.

400
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,580
Wake up!

401
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,280
Wake up!

402
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm cold!

403
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
You woke up?

404
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,820
What are you doing, chief?

405
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,240
You're killing me!

406
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:19,880
Shut up!

407
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,420
What's the point of drinking secretly in the middle of the

408
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,180
But yesterday, my wife said she wanted to drink no matter what, so I

409
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,660
went out with her.

410
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,540
What?

411
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,280
Your wife?

412
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,300
That's right.

413
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,300
She was crying while drinking.

414
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,220
Why the hell did your wife refuse to drink?

415
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,580
She's too stubborn.

416
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,120
She didn't even hold her hand when she got engaged.

417
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,940
That's right.

418
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,380
It's true that she was young, but it was common in the past.

419
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,220
That's not all.

420
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,120
She's just an order.

421
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,520
She said it would be better to be a little softer.

422
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,840
She was crying while she was saying that.

423
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,440
Is that true?

424
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,080
Dad.

425
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,380
Dad.

426
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,700
Dad, I'm going shopping today, so I'll head out first.

427
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,040
I've already prepared dinner, so I'll be in your care.

428
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,400
City Hall...

429
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,740
You're going to get your divorce letter, aren't you?

430
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,780
What?!

431
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,300
It's been a while since you've been getting divorced, right?

432
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,940
As long as it's mine...

433
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,100
The wife who got divorced receives her retirement money as a car loan,

434
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,860
and she throws her husband out of the house.

435
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,480
She says that's what a "permanent divorce" is.

436
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,700
Permanent divorce?

437
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,600
Permanent divorce?!

438
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,300
Ryotsu, what should I do to prevent you from getting divorced?

439
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,920
First of all, you have to soften that stone head.

440
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,180
I will! I will!

441
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,400
What should I do to soften it? Tell me!

442
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,800
First of all, this.

443
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,480
What's wrong with the city?

444
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,460
Stop pretending not to do it every morning and picking up the bonsai.

445
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,540
What?! That's not good!

446
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,200
Ouch!

447
00:16:59,860 --> 00:16:59,880
Ryotsu!

448
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,520
If you want me to teach you how to soften your head, you have to be a manager!

449
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,740
I don't care whether you get divorced or not.

450
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,520
R-Ryotsu! I got it.

451
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,160
I'll do anything, so help me.

452
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,080
I got it.

453
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,740
Then there's no "this" every morning, right?

454
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,560
Of course.

455
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,280
This!

456
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,660
This is a complete reversal of the situation.

457
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,440
Okay, let's go with this.

458
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,760
Pants are okay with this.

459
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:28,820
Okay.

460
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,740
Okay, bring me a sneaker and a hat.

461
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,140
Yes.

462
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,640
Why do I have to dress like that?

463
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,040
To be a soft-headed human, you need to change your appearance first.

464
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,940
But...

465
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,820
Your wife wants you to dress younger.

466
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,300
But this is...

467
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,560
A proper divorce.

468
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,740
I-I wonder if I should come!

469
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,220
Oh...

470
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,060
Oh...

471
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,680
Oh...

472
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:56,720
Oh...

473
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,180
Ryotsu, everyone is watching.

474
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,800
That's because the manager is dressed like this, so they're watching you.

475
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,420
I don't think so.

476
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,620
Ryotsu, as expected...

477
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,600
Proper divorce!

478
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,200
Proper divorce!

479
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,540
Proper divorce...

480
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,340
I won.

481
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,660
Well then, chief. Let's gamble a little bit.

482
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,460
Do you understand?

483
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,160
If anyone turns that corner, it's either a man or a woman, so let's bet on the wine.

484
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,660
Let me go first.

485
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,900
First, the woman.

486
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,620
I am a man.

487
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,060
Okay, I'll have one at first.

488
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,280
Okay, then the next is the woman.

489
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,720
Then I am a man.

490
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,300
Yeah.

491
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,620
Yay, a man.

492
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,900
I got the second one.

493
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,340
Okay, next is the woman.

494
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,620
You're on board, chief. You're quite a gambler, aren't you?

495
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,160
Shut up! Anyway, I'm a woman!

496
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,100
Yes, yes.

497
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,160
I did it! I'm a woman! I'm a woman!

498
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,140
Ryozu, I win!

499
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,820
It seems that I win again this time.

500
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,580
What's wrong with you, father?

501
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,600
I said I didn't want to.

502
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,200
But somehow you look young and good.

503
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,320
See?

504
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,040
Really? I haven't thrown away my old clothes yet.

505
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,720
You're so mean.

506
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,640
I'll be proud of you if you make me a pig.

507
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,280
Mom, tea.

508
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,400
Here you are.

509
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,920
Here you are.

510
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,920
Father, are you not going to eat dinner tonight?

511
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,060
No reason.

512
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,260
Ryozu, news.

513
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,600
Change it to NHK.

514
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,320
It's FUJITELEVI on Sunday.

515
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,020
I'll let Chirimaru-chan do it.

516
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,900
I'll be watching the GTO anime,

517
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,560
"The Dog's Adventure",

518
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,720
"The RR Daiji-ten",

519
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,620
"Super Night",

520
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,340
and "Music Fair"

521
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,500
and watch the "Chuou Keiba Digest".

522
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,800
That's the right way to spend Sunday night, right?

523
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,420
You!

524
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,520
First, you have to watch the anime and make your head soft, right, mother?

525
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,280
That's right.

526
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,500
What are you talking about?

527
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,080
Anyway, it's NHK news at 7 o'clock.

528
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,880
It's so boring not to watch NHK news.

529
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,520
Chief, you're so young.

530
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,020
Yes, that's right.

531
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,160
Sometimes, I like watching anime.

532
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,760
Right?

533
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:21,640
What?

534
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,380
I can't stand it.

535
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,780
I'm going to bed tonight.

536
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,240
What's wrong with you?

537
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,940
What?

538
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,460
Sometimes, I don't eat dinner,

539
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,560
and I don't take a bath,

540
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,520
and I have to go to bed early.

541
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,520
What do you think, wife?

542
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,520
Chief, you have to sing "Dragon's Feet"

543
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:41,820
in karaoke now.

544
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,200
Your wife will hate it.

545
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,320
And you have to do skateboarding

546
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,260
and show your young side.

547
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,420
And if you can do it on the Internet,

548
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,780
you might be seen again.

549
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,020
Oh, that's right.

550
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,600
My wife sometimes goes to amusement parks

551
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,920
and says she wants to do bungee jumping with me.

552
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,820
Chief, what's wrong with you?

553
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,980
You're so grumpy.

554
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,160
Yes, and in return,

555
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,200
Ryo is feeling a little nervous.

556
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,460
Yes.

557
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,280
What?

558
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,940
What?

559
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,240
What?

560
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,920
What's wrong?

561
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,140
Oh, no.

562
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,180
Mr. Daijiro Ohara

563
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,400
called me saying he wanted a car.

564
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,080
So I brought a pamphlet and a letter of recommendation.

565
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,000
Hey, Mr. Goburo.

566
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,680
What?

567
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,960
Ryo, what's wrong?

568
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,420
I thought it was convenient,

569
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,160
so I called you.

570
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,940
Don't do anything to yourself.

571
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,280
My wife said

572
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,720
she would divorce me if she didn't buy me a car.

573
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,220
Don't lie to me.

574
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,420
My wife will buy a car,

575
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,040
so I won't get in the car.

576
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,500
Oh, really?

577
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,080
What are you talking about?

578
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,760
You're so...

579
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,860
Forget it.

580
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,820
I don't want anyone like you in my house.

581
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,920
Get out of here as soon as possible.

582
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,760
Oh, really?

583
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,140
I don't have any more money in the headmaster's house.

584
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,060
What?

585
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,300
Well, the car...

586
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,000
Why are you following me?

587
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,120
Go home.

588
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,880
I'll go home after I take my luggage.

589
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,360
Oh, that junk is your luggage?

590
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,100
It's a junk.

591
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,840
I don't have such a good house or luggage anyway.

592
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,360
Don't turn on the light at the entrance.

593
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,740
What's wrong with it?

594
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,280
Where have you been at this hour?

595
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,000
Isn't it just that the divorce was early?

596
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,260
What?

597
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,340
That's not the case with my wife.

598
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,480
When she gets late,

599
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,380
she always prepares dinner...

600
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,320
I didn't.

601
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,820
If you really go out...

602
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,320
No way...

603
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,900
I understand how you feel.

604
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,300
Let's have a good time tonight.

605
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,740
Ryo-tsu!

606
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,360
Ouch!

607
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,900
What are you doing?

608
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,920
Ryo-tsu, you're a good guy.

609
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,800
Headmaster.

610
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,740
Come on, cheer up.

611
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,200
I'm home.

612
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,800
Mom?

613
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,060
I'm sorry I'm late.

614
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,420
I went out by bicycle today.

615
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,040
I bumped into you on the way.

616
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,900
Mom!

617
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,560
Dad!

618
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,920
I'm glad you came back.

619
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,260
Dad, what's wrong?

620
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,800
I think you got divorced and left.

621
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,860
I don't want to, Dad.

622
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,660
I'll be with you until I die.

623
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,960
Mom?

624
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,260
But you said you don't like people with a hard head.

625
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,020
You cried and went to Ryo-tsu, didn't you?

626
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,700
I did.

627
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,720
I said I'd like to be a little softer,

628
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,240
but I don't cry.

629
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,860
What?

630
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,600
I'm happy just to be with you now.

631
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,980
Mom, thank you.

632
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,040
I don't want to.

633
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,880
I'm sorry that I have to go to Ryo-tsu.

634
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,460
Huh?

635
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,660
Oh.

636
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,680
Ryo-tsu!

637
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,080
What?

638
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,340
You're lying!

639
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,300
I won't forgive you!

640
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,760
You said you were a good guy!

641
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,540
I'll get you back to your old self!

642
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,420
Stay here forever!

643
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,100
No!

644
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,680
I don't want to!

645
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,240
Wake me up!

646
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,760
Watch me!

647
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,540
Kick me!

648
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,900
My little finger hurts!

649
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,480
For now,

650
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,800
When I brush my eyebrows, I'll go to the station

651
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,260
DASH! DASH! DASH!

652
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:19,480
On the main train, I'm sleeping on my father's back

653
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,200
This week as well, the Go-Kurou Go-Muri is a Go-Moto

654
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,580
I'm holding the bucket in one hand

655
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,180
but it's so hot and cloudy

656
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,980
I'm irritated by the continued work

657
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,240
So I get irritated by it, and that really may trouble me

658
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Everyday is no problem

659
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,000
When I pass through the hot shower

660
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,700
Everyday is no problem

661
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,900
Recovered from sickness and well-being

662
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,380
Everyday is no problem

663
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,760
I really love myself!

664
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,820
I like you, every day is no problem

665
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,220
My heart is flying on Monday

666
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,320
Fun N' Nonsense

667
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:22,060
The chief of the mecha-house bought a mobile phone

668
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,620
but I thought he didn't use it at all

669
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,680
Chief, what are you going to do if you get turned over for not using the tools?

670
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,080
What? The phone is gone?

671
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,720
It's not my fault!

672
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,800
Next time, "Phone Panic"

673
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,920
See you then!
