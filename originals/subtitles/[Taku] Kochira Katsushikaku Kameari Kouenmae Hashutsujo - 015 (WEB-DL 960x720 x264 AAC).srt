Huh?

00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,860
Humph.

26
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,540
Hey, Nakagawa, you're getting hungry, aren't you?

27
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,220
Why don't we have fried lebanese and gyoza for lunch today?

28
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,380
Chinese food? Sounds good.

29
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,740
Honda, you're in danger!

30
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,920
Don't get so angry, Ryo-chan's husband.

31
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,680
Whatever.

32
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,820
Anyway, let's go buy lunch.

33
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,920
I'll go with you.

34
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,580
I'm going on a business trip today.

35
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,460
Can I say I'll treat you?

36
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,640
Honda, why don't you say that first?

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,860
I'll have a special dish of fried lebanese and gyoza.

38
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,340
I'll have some tonjiru for the first time in a while.

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,660
He's a very energetic old man.

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,360
Nakagawa, you're...

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,500
What? Me too?

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,060
Yeah, just in case.

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,000
Hey, Nakagawa, this is your treat.

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Then, I'll have a fried chicken lunch.

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,940
Okay.

46
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,420
Well then, Nakagawa-san, I'm off!

47
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,500
It's rare to see someone with such a different personality.

48
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,760
Yeah.

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,480
Thank you very much.

50
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,780
H-hello.

51
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,820
Oh, welcome.

52
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,860
You're having lunch today, too?

53
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,440
Yeah.

54
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,220
This place has the best lunches.

55
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm so happy.

56
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,120
What are you having today?

57
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,340
I'll have a special dish of fried lebanese and gyoza.

58
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,480
I'll have nori and two more tonjiru please.

59
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,500
Okay!

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,840
I'll have a special dish of fried lebanese and gyoza,

61
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,760
and two more fried lebanese and nori, please.

62
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,580
What?

63
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,140
Oh, am I wrong?

64
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,520
Ah...

65
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,880
It's okay.

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,020
I'll have some tonjiru.

67
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,340
Oh, six kinds of tonjiru!

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,600
Yes, ma'am.

69
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,120
Boss, we'll have two types of tonjiru: Toku-hire, Kara-age, Nori-ben, and Tonjiru.

70
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,880
Here we go!

71
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,940
Two types of tonjiru, please.

72
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,320
Sorry to bother you.

73
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,340
Well, we're always on your side.

74
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,280
That's what we should be thinking about.

75
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,100
It's a big difference from someone else's.

76
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,400
That's what the boss says. Someone else's.

77
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,000
It's about you! You!

78
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,920
Isn't this place a little dry?

79
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,560
You're right.

80
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,320
No, it's not.

81
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,060
I'm using the best light.

82
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,240
Your ass is a little salty, too.

83
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,820
This is just right.

84
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,360
This lunch box is the best.

85
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,940
I'm in love with it no matter what.

86
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,100
I can read it.

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
You're making a mistake by taking a lot of lunch boxes.

88
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,320
You're a lunch box salesman, aren't you?

89
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,220
No, I'm not.

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,240
I know.

91
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,260
You must like the girl from the lunch box store.

92
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,100
No, that's not...

93
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,520
I see. That shopkeeper is cute.

94
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,980
How do you know?

95
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,300
Look at her face.

96
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,900
I can tell who she is by looking at her face.

97
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
She's so sweet.

98
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
So? What's the name of the shopkeeper?

99
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,920
Megumi Hoshino.

100
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,600
Well, I'll tell you the answer.

101
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,260
Give up on her.

102
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,300
Why?

103
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,920
Ryo, are you still friends?

104
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,180
Please help her.

105
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,420
Reiko, how many times do you think she's been out of love?

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,800
It's not once or twice.

107
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,100
It's a hundred times.

108
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,280
To be exact, it's a hundred and one times.

109
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,040
Really?

110
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,200
Then you should try to stop her from seeing you.

111
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,760
But...

112
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,980
Reiko, stop it.

113
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,840
You can't do anything about love without a reason.

114
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,720
You don't know that, do you?

115
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,000
Uncle!

116
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,100
What?

117
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,160
You're rude to me, who is called the nice middle of a woman killer.

118
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,640
What do you mean, the nice middle of a woman killer?

119
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,640
Stop joking around!

120
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,140
Right this is how it works.

121
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm going to make it real, 1.

122
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,380
2.

123
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,420
3.

124
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,600
4.

125
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,800
See?

126
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,040
Why are you here?

127
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,480
I thought you were a guy, 1.

128
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:23,860
I'm going to do it, too.

129
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,060
All right.

130
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,020
1.

131
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:28,780
3.

132
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,760
4.

133
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:32,940
5.

134
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,260
6.

135
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,260
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,600
What do you think, senpai?

137
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,540
No, no. There's a man I like.

138
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,220
No way.

139
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,380
What kind of man do you think he is?

140
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,300
You said you wanted to be a white-collar employee who passes by at 9:00 every morning.

141
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,360
That's not true.

142
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,060
You should give up, Megumi.

143
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,740
I'm also a white-collar employee.

144
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,600
I also pass by the store at 9:00 every morning.

145
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,060
What did you just say?

146
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,560
I also pass by the store at 9:00 every morning.

147
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,040
Come on, Honda!

148
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,320
Hey, Megumi.

149
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,220
Yes?

150
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,060
This is the white-collar man I told you about.

151
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,940
He always comes to buy things.

152
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,360
Hello.

153
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,240
What do you think?

154
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,080
No, they don't look like him at all.

155
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,420
Oh, I see.

156
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,480
He looks a little slim, but he has a tight face.

157
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,320
He always wears a lot of arms and wears a muffler.

158
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,660
He's really manly and cool.

159
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,180
It's me, after all.

160
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,060
Don't listen to him! Senpai!

161
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,460
He's a man.

162
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,900
He does look different.

163
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,020
You can't believe it.

164
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,460
If you take a look at this bike,

165
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,160
your face and your personality will be completely different.

166
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,700
You can't believe it.

167
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,340
This Honda is number one with his white-collar employees.

168
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,080
That's my number one strength.

169
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,420
You're right.

170
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,100
If you're a white-collar employee,

171
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,800
you know who passes by every morning.

172
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,940
You probably don't.

173
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,600
Yes, I do.

174
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,500
Leave it to me.

175
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,280
What?

176
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,220
Then, if you know the person,

177
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,580
Please let me know if you know anything.

178
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,620
Yes.

179
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,160
You made an extra promise.

180
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,160
I see. It's getting complicated.

182
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,700
Megumi likes Honda when she rides a motorcycle.

183
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,000
So, she can't ride the current Honda?

184
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,360
Honda, there's only one way.

185
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,800
What should we do?

186
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,800
You'll be riding a motorcycle in front of Megumi forever.

187
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,600
What?

188
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,540
That's impossible.

189
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,400
I know it's impossible.

190
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,160
But if you go on a date with a motorcycle,

191
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,280
you'll definitely get a "yes" for sure.

192
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
That might be true, but...

193
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,500
That's a little too much.

194
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,420
A man and a woman are important at first.

195
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,840
If you decide right away,

196
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
everything will be fine.

197
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,160
Is that so?

198
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,980
A nice middle man who killed a woman says so,

199
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,600
so there's no doubt.

200
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,420
I'm going to do it.

201
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,100
Mr. Honda!

202
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,720
I like her.

203
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,360
If I can go on a date with someone as wonderful as her,

204
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,420
I don't mind what happens after that.

205
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,100
Okay, it's settled.

206
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,360
Now we just need to attack.

207
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,280
Yes, sir.

208
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,980
Good morning.

209
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,780
Good morning.

210
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,460
Mr. Honda, you're here.

211
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,620
Oh, yes.

212
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,740
Oh, sorry.

213
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,200
Nice to meet you.

214
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,660
I'm Megumi Hoshino.

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,060
What's your name?

216
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm Honda.

217
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,280
Are you Mr. Honda, too?

218
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,460
Oh, no.

219
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,960
I'm Suzuki, the son of Honda.

220
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,860
Mr. Suzuki?

221
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,060
It's a custom for a woman to ride a motorcycle,

222
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,500
but...

223
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,260
How about you entrust your life to me

224
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,340
and feel the wind with me?

225
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,180
I'm glad to hear that.

226
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,360
I'm glad to hear that.

227
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,100
I'm glad to hear that.

228
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,160
I'm glad to hear that.

229
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,060
Well, I'll be here at 9:00 on Sunday morning.

230
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,680
I'll be here at 9:00 on Sunday morning.

231
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,300
Okay.

232
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,760
See you later.

233
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,680
I'll pay you back with this.

234
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,760
How's it going, sir?

235
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,860
I did it.

236
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,660
I'm going on a date on Sunday.

237
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,420
I see.

238
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,180
You did it.

239
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,480
Listen, don't get off your bike

240
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,160
during a date.

241
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,880
Okay.

242
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:45,560
Mr. Suzuki.

243
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,260
Mr. Suzuki.

244
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,120
What is it?

245
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,820
I'm so cold.

246
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,260
My heart can't beat this.

247
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,320
I'm just kidding.

248
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:04,020
You're going anywhere.

249
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,200
You're going anywhere.

250
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,680
How's the taste?

251
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,020
It's good, sir.

252
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,140
I'm sure you'll have it.

253
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,320
Let's drive it.

254
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,620
You know what?

255
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,800
I hate it when it gets cold.

256
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,300
You're just a piece of crap!

257
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,260
Mr. Honda!

258
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,180
It's not Mr. Honda! It's that stupid Suzuki!

259
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,880
I'm so sorry.

260
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,080
I didn't think it was Mr. Honda.

261
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,180
It's Suzuki, you idiot!

262
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,960
Please forgive us, Mr. Suzuki!

263
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,080
Please forgive us, Mr. Suzuki!

264
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,280
I hope you understand.

265
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,980
We'll forgive you for today,

266
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,780
but if you do that again, we won't let you off!

267
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,380
Yes, sir!

268
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,700
Are you okay?

269
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,560
Yes.

270
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,580
I'm not scared if Mr. Suzuki is with me.

271
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,460
Okay, hold on tight.

272
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,320
Yes, sir!

273
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,860
That's strange.

274
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,200
It's Mr. Honda, but...

275
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,540
I don't feel any left.

276
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,760
We should have found him a while ago.

277
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,160
Where is Suzuki?

278
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,800
Suzuki-san, you're really strong.

279
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,760
I'm so touched.

280
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
Are you going to watch a movie?

281
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,040
Yes!

282
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,360
The seats are already open.

283
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,280
Good night!

284
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,780
I always look at it this way. Don't worry about it.

285
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,200
You've changed.

286
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,640
...

287
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Wow, you really like bikes, don't you?

288
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, they're the best you've ever had.

289
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,280
.......

290
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,380
The bike and I are one.

291
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,060
You're the best partner.

292
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,980
What's wrong?

293
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,300
Actually, he's going to America with me.

294
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,600
He has a girlfriend?

295
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,760
He's going to America?

296
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,240
Yes.

297
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,240
Megumi, you're going to America with me?

298
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,520
No, it's nothing.

299
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,740
Two years is too short. We can meet again.

300
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,340
That's all you want to say?

301
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,700
You can go anywhere in America.

302
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,720
Goodbye.

303
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,460
Megumi!

304
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,500
But it's fine.

305
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,780
It's over.

306
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,540
I'm going to beg that man.

307
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,460
A man has to be as manly as you.

308
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,200
I see.

309
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,780
Let's go home.

310
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,980
Yes.

311
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,360
Um...

312
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,100
Welcome.

313
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,880
What are you doing?

314
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,740
Well, what are you doing?

315
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,260
I did it!

316
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,000
I can play!

317
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,400
How was the date?

318
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,740
As you said, I was riding the bike for a long time, so it was perfect.

319
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,500
I see.

320
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,140
You're good.

321
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,820
"She really is very good"

322
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,200
Megumi-san!

323
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,320
Yamamoto-san!

324
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,660
Senpai, please don't interrupt my birthday party, okay?

325
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,500
Who did you think you could date by, right?

326
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,360
"Wrong"

327
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,440
Who is that guy?

328
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:30,840
"Wrong"

329
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,800
Actually, today, he is going to America.

330
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,300
"Wrong"

331
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,980
Hey, Honda, explain who is he?

332
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,680
Wait, you bastard!

333
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:47,660
"Wrong"

334
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,840
Before we go, I want to tell you my feelings.

335
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,540
"Wrong"

336
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,720
Megumi, I like you. I want to marry you.

337
00:17:59,400 --> 00:17:59,680
"Wrong"

338
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,200
This is a ticket for your flight.

339
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,680
I want you to come with me.

340
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,280
"Wrong"

341
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,940
You said it suddenly.

342
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,580
I know. I can't do it.

343
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,640
I always do this.

344
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,460
"Wrong"

345
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,840
Take care.

346
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,140
Dad.

347
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:39,900
Dad?

348
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,300
"Wrong"

349
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,400
Dad.

350
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:40,600
"Wrong"

351
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:40,980
Dad?

352
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,100
Dad?

353
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:42,900
Dad?

354
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,220
What happened to you?

355
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,860
Actually, I saw your image in the newspapers.

356
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,300
"Wrong"

357
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:50,720
"Wrong"

358
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,760
Damn it! I'll arrest you if you do it again!

359
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,360
Hey Honda! Why are you like that?

360
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,680
You like Yamamoto, don't you?

361
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,980
A man's personality is not only his appearance.

362
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,820
I think it's also manly to keep thinking about the woman you like.

363
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,000
Mr. Suzuki.

364
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,060
Mr. Suzuki!

365
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,740
Damn it! I can't believe I'm stuck here.

366
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,160
What time is the departure time of the plane?

367
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,000
7 o'clock.

368
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,660
Damn it! I can't make it in time.

369
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,500
Hold on tight!

370
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,760
What?

371
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,500
Here.

372
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,640
Darn it!

373
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,100
Thank you everyone.

374
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,960
Hey, don't make a terrible face.

375
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,820
I'm going to Los Angeles, bro.

376
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,860
It means you're on the right track.

377
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,280
Let's go.

378
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,400
We'll be back.

379
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,480
Yeah.

380
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,200
Take care.

381
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,460
Call me if you need me.

382
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,020
Good luck!

383
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,440
M-Megumi-san!

384
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,500
Go on.

385
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,620
I-I decided to...

386
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,120
I decided to go with you.

387
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,740
Take me with you, too.

388
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,340
Ah...

389
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,120
Megumi-san...

390
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,000
How long are you going to be like this?

391
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,240
If you don't hurry, you'll be late.

392
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,540
Suzuki-san, what can I say?

393
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,140
Don't worry about me.

394
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,300
Let's go.

395
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:48,800
Let's go.

396
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,140
Yes.

397
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,940
Thank you very much.

398
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,500
Mr. Honda, it was you.

399
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,460
Thanks.

400
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,820
Thank you.

401
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,820
Thank you very much, Mr. Honda!

402
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:36,920
Thanks, Mr. Honda!

403
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,220
Thank you, Mr. Honda!

404
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,200
Good-bye, Ms. Megumi.

405
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,680
Ms. Megumi.

406
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,680
Good-bye, Ms. Megumi.

407
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,060
I was a good boy, but I fell in love for the second time.

408
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,080
I know. Stop crying.

409
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,520
I was in the police station for six months.

410
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,520
I can't help it.

411
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,380
But you're too good at acting as Cupid.

412
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,680
You're like Ryo when he was young.

413
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,500
He was drunk as soon as he fell in love with you.

414
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,380
How about you, Ryo?

415
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,820
Don't talk nonsense.

416
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,760
Well, it's okay.

417
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,440
You fell in love with me 102 times.

418
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,740
You've fallen in love with me over 300 times.

419
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,600
Really?

420
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,520
I feel better.

421
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,160
Let's drink.

422
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,880
We'll get a lot of praise from the chief in two days.

423
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,360
I'm sure.

424
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,240
What?

425
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,400
Damn it.

426
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,660
Let's get drunk.

427
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,120
I'll drink up all the sake in the store.

428
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,320
Yes, sir.

429
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,840
Thank you for your help.

430
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,140
Do you only serve tea?

431
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,720
I'm glad you came all the way to the mountain.

432
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,640
Please, give us something.

433
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,940
Next time, to the familyoria of Ohara.

434
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,560
Please.

435
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:31,200
Slept well

436
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,940
Time passes

437
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,700
Don't look around

438
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:47,800
Don't cry, laugh and live on

439
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:57,380
Even if it rains today

440
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,600
Tomorrow will be sunny

441
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,680
Bye bye, let's wash our hands

442
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,980
Goodbye for the things we don't like

443
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,080
Oh yeah, let's live the way we like

444
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,380
There are good things

445
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:29,940
The sun is calling outside the door

446
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:43,620
Thank you for watching!
