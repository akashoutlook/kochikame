1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,840
Sunset

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,360
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,120
Try to look from the corner of your room and stay away

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:21,680
Makin' Up

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,580
Crawling by the river

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,960
I gaze at the sunset

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,840
When I kicked the stone, it flew to my shoes

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,060
I wonder if it's going to be a good day to go

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:48,420
I laughed as it was

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,840
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,680
I can't help but feel a little bit of pain

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,880
The cityscape that doesn't change a single

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,460
wail is strangely gentle

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,740
From the waterfront of Tongari Boshi

15
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:16,400
To Kaishakuten, the sunset falls

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,920
Tomorrow

17
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,240
Tomorrow

18
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,220
Tomorrow

19
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,180
Why does it end like this?

20
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,900
Whether it's a win or a lose

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,320
I was just happy

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,840
I realized

23
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,640
Because I'm an idiot

24
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,540
-Good morning! -Good morning!

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,620
What are you doing, chief?

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,060
Good morning.

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,900
I got a video letter from my daughter to my grandson, Daisuke.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,060
I bought a video camera to reply to it.

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,500
But I've been addicted to it since then.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,080
Huh? The chief is shooting a video?

31
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,940
It's the age of AV where anyone can enjoy a video camera.

32
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,540
The age of AV where anyone can enjoy a video camera.

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,400
Oh, yeah. You see kids in the park often, don't you?

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,960
I don't have any pictures of my childhood, even.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,260
Ryotsu, do you want to see it?

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,920
Daisuke's video that I took. It's cute.

37
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,640
No, it's fine.

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,200
Huh?

39
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,360
Those things only fun for the family.

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,500
It's just boring for others.

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,420
When I go home often, there are parents who show their child's video to the end.

42
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,620
No one but pain.

43
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,920
No one but pain.

44
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,020
I can't imagine the video the director took.

45
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,040
An amateur's useless long-distance shooting,

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,660
hand shake, pin bokeh, and zoom failure.

47
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,480
If you take it while walking, it may fall,

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,120
but it only shows your feet.

49
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,920
Just thinking about it makes the screen look good.

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,220
Idiot!

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,980
You're an amateur, so you can't take it so well from the beginning.

52
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,200
It's a great work if it's full of love for children even with a boring video.

53
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,120
I'll show you.

54
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,920
I won't let you see it.

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,100
I'm sorry for the long-distance shooting.

56
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,380
Well, I'll go to patrol.

57
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,420
That's terrible, Ryo-chan.

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,500
It's true.

59
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,300
How is it? Do you want to see the video I took?

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,820
Of course.

61
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,860
I really want to see it.

62
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,080
Oh, I have to go to patrol with you.

63
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,500
Kei-chan!

64
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,400
That's right.

65
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,400
A patrol is a rule for two people.

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,580
Here, Reiko.

67
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,300
Yes.

68
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,960
"A patrol is a rule for two people."

69
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,540
"A patrol is a rule for two people."

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,840
Here, here, here.

71
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,400
Cut.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
No, no.

73
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,860
You look so hard.

74
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,100
Listen, Shata.

75
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,100
This is a video library you'll never forget.

76
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,060
A more natural smile.

77
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,680
One more time.

78
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,300
Yes.

79
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,100
Scene 1, cut 3, take 5.

80
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,520
Ready. Start.

81
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,020
Here I go.

82
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,220
Cut cut cut!

83
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,460
You should express your happiness more childishly in your body.

84
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,740
Is it okay?

85
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,760
"Today is a fun sports day! Ran ran ran ran!"

86
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,420
Like this.

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,480
"Today is a fun sports day! Ran ran ran ran!"

88
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,280
Don't put it into words!

89
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,920
Express it in your body!

90
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,160
Then, let's do it again.

91
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,900
Okay.

92
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,660
Next is a scene where she is full of will and goes to school.

93
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,280
She runs lightly to the

94
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:53,880
"Hey! Don't stand there without permission!"

95
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,140
"But the dog..."

96
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,220
"But I don't!"

97
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,260
"I told you that the ad lib without the script is forbidden!"

98
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,000
"What a dog!"

99
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,720
"You can jump over it without any worries!"

100
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,640
"You can bite it!"

101
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,100
"I won't let you!"

102
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,920
"Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!"

103
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,320
"Let go! Let go!"

104
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,280
"Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!"

105
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,520
"Stop it! Stop it!"

106
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Okay, put your head on the second floor.

107
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,240
"Dad, I'm going to be late for the sports day."

108
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,700
Then, don't say anything and act properly!

109
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,800
"Okay."

110
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,480
Ready, start!

111
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,760
Good, good.

112
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,820
You have a natural look.

113
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,320
Let's go to the sports day!

114
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,400
"Oh, I missed the lane!"

115
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,100
"Oh, the slope!"

116
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,160
"Dad!"

117
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,520
"H-help me!"

118
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,420
"Huh? What?"

119
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,040
"Help me!"

120
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,480
"Nagaga, let's go!"

121
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:44,940
"Yes!"

122
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,120
"Go!"

123
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,920
"Are you okay?"

124
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,440
"I'm not okay!"

125
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,640
"C-camera! There's no camera!"

126
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,460
"Huh?"

127
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,840
"Huh?"

128
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,480
"Huh?"

129
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,060
"Huh?"

130
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,900
"I'm glad! It's nothing! It was dangerous!"

131
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,600
"The camera is more important than yourself!"

132
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,500
"Mr. Omawari, don't be so rough!"

133
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,960
"If I don't do anything, I won't be able to stop!"

134
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,820
"It's a high-class camera!"

135
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,660
"It's so insensitive!"

136
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,980
"What?"

137
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:25,780
"Senpai!"

138
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,440
"Dad, I'm really going to be late for the sports day."

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,140
"Oh, that's right!"

140
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,220
"I shouldn't have done that!"

141
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,680
"Let's film the rest of the scene later."

142
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,780
"I see. Sports day, huh?"

143
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,220
"That's a lot of heavy equipment."

144
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,060
"The children's sports day is the biggest event for parents with video cameras."

145
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,100
"What's wrong? Why are you carrying such heavy luggage?"

146
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,060
"I'm delivering something I forgot. From my husband."

147
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,220
"There are various things in the video camera, such as batteries."

148
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,120
"What are you doing?"

149
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,720
"I'm carrying something heavy."

150
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,200
"Is it a man with big glasses with a backpack on his back?"

151
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,400
"That's right. There's a sports day today."

152
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,720
"He's a tough guy. I'll deliver it to him."

153
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,960
"It's hard for women to carry heavy things."

154
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,200
"Where is the school? We'll take you there."

155
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,900
"I'm sorry, Mr. Omawari."

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,280
"Kameyari's turtle and Kora's latte camera?"

157
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,680
"I see. That's a perfect name!"

158
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,500
"That's all I need to know."

159
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,060
"What?"

160
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,600
"The owner's name is..."

161
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,620
"It's written as 'Pinto' in 'ichi'."

162
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,620
"Pinto'?"

163
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,660
"It is said that you read 'Pinto' as 'ichi'."

164
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,660
"What about your son's name?"

165
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,920
"Yes, it's 'Shutter' in 'Shanyitaro'."

166
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,480
"Hahaha! 'Pinto' and 'Shutter'? That's too much."

167
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,380
"I don't think your wife's name is Zoom or Shibori, is it?"

168
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,120
"No, it's a print child with a bronze head."

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,400
"What?!"

170
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,120
"Oh, I'm kidding. His name is Asako."

171
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,520
"That's too much."

172
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,160
"Asako... Asa..."

173
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,800
"Look! Isn't that the feeling of the film?"

174
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:04,780
"Huh?"

175
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,940
"It's like a family that was born to get into the camera world."

176
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,440
"What are you talking about?"

177
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,620
"What is this?"

178
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,280
"It's a huge number of people!"

179
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,000
"It's like a photo shoot for an idol."

180
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
"It's hard to find out from this."

181
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,320
"However, no matter how many sports events there are,

182
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,640
the number of children participating in the competition is too great.

183
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,580
Some parents even monitor and edit the video while children are not participating in the competition.

184
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,860
"How about some videotape?"

185
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,020
"I have a battery now."

186
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,660
"The business is doing well."

187
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,340
"It's much different from the old sports club where I was eating rice balls."

188
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
"Ah, over there."

189
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,000
"Huh?"

190
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,440
"Huh?"

191
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,500
"What?"

192
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,340
"What?"

193
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:51,700
"What?"

194
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,000
"Hey, you! You forgot something!"

195
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,780
"Ohh, sorry, sorry!"

196
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,980
"Oh, you two are...?"

197
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,800
"My wife looked too heavy. So I helped her carry it."

198
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,920
"I see. Well, thank you."

199
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,840
"However, it's a great camera!"

200
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,940
"Do you understand?"

201
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,800
"A-Ah, I saw it, so..."

202
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,720
"It has a super-wide-angle lens for the commercial camera,

203
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,500
and it's a special camera for the sports event that was modified for."

204
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,600
I'll get rid of all the cheap videos there!

205
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,140
You're really serious.

206
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,380
You're not losing to the camera.

207
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,420
This is the ultimate video game!

208
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,840
The third-year obstacle race is starting now.

209
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,040
The shutter's on!

210
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,320
Mr. Omawari!

211
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,900
Hurry up and connect the cable to the D2 video deck for the business!

212
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:45,820
Yeah!

213
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,540
Let's go!

214
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,720
Let's go!

215
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,780
8mm is fine, right?

216
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,360
You cheap camera man, move!

217
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,400
6x zoom doesn't work at this distance!

218
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,700
Open the front!

219
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,860
It's in the way!

220
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,820
It's like a war.

221
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,700
Ready!

222
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,860
You look good, shutter.

223
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,980
Look up a little more.

224
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,520
Shutter Chance!

225
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,620
That's a good idea.

226
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,840
Now that's a powerful image!

227
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,220
Stop running around like that!

228
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,180
What am I doing here?

229
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,840
Now that's really no good!

230
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,780
Here we go!

231
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,180
Good shot!

232
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,960
What?

233
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,000
Now we're going to cross the mud!

234
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,800
W-what a great... masterpiece!

235
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,020
That's good!

236
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,300
Thank you so much for everything!

237
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,700
You guys really did a great job!

238
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,640
You've got a lot of scratches everywhere.

239
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,840
Thanks to you, I got a nice picture.

240
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,200
If you like, you can come over to my house.

241
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,460
Maybe I can get something cold...

242
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,640
Oh, no! I forgot the last scene!

243
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,060
I'm taking a picture of going home from the gym in the sunset.

244
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,280
You're not done yet?

245
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,080
What a healthy guy.

246
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,400
Hey, Mr. Omawari.

247
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,280
I'm not going to that place.

248
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,740
What? You're not going to that place?

249
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,640
That's my house.

250
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,540
This is the video.

251
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,960
Isn't that a TV station?

252
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,460
I couldn't find the tape.

253
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,140
I bought it from the used one.

254
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,600
Here you go.

255
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,400
There are so many tapes.

256
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,420
Ever since the shutter was born,

257
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,880
I've been taking pictures of it.

258
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,380
I've put together 5,500 videos every day,

259
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,960
from 5 hours to 8 years old.

260
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,680
That's not a number!

261
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,560
There are still 2,000 unedited videos.

262
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,380
Videos are the asset of the shutter.

263
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,760
When I grow up,

264
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,080
I'll be grateful for the love of my parents

265
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,860
who have made me grow up so much.

266
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,900
But how do you watch them?

267
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,760
It takes more than 15 years to watch a video every day.

268
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,600
That's why you can be moved by the depth of love of your parents.

269
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,700
There is no parent who can do this for you.

270
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,220
Here, have a cold drink.

271
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,260
This is a 6-month shutter.

272
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,040
Did you see that?

273
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,160
This expression, this angle.

274
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:04,960
It's the best.

275
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,020
Next is the kindergarten entrance ceremony.

276
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,280
Look at this falling cherry blossom.

277
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,200
It's fantastic.

278
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,880
It's idealistic and makes you feel like a poem.

279
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,300
It's a masterpiece.

280
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,140
This tasteful contrast.

281
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,960
A sharp zoom.

282
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,320
A flowing bread.

283
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,060
It's a masterpiece.

284
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,940
It's a masterpiece.

285
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,920
It's a masterpiece.

286
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,480
It's a masterpiece.

287
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,680
It's a masterpiece.

288
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,280
Is that so?

289
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,020
That was hard.

290
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,400
It's amazing to be so hard.

291
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,420
But I can't keep up with you.

292
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,900
You two should have watched Chief Ohara's video quietly.

293
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Mr. Omawari.

294
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:43,920
Mr. Omawari.

295
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,920
Mr. Omawari.

296
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,760
Something bad happened.

297
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,100
Shota went home.

298
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,620
What?

299
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,600
Shota?

300
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,940
Actually, he went to the gym he missed yesterday afternoon to get a workout.

301
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,360
But he suddenly jumped out of the gym.

302
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,740
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,460
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,800
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm sorry.

306
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,120
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,880
I'm sorry.

308
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,460
I'm sorry.

309
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:08,760
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,360
I'm sorry.

311
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,920
I'm sorry.

312
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,660
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,480
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,900
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,340
Hey, Shota.

316
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:20,940
What?

317
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,980
Shota?

318
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,540
That's a gift from my father.

319
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,740
Hey, Shota.

320
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:25,940
What?

321
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,220
You said you had never seen a baby before.

322
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,480
That's a beautiful gift.

323
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,740
It's a great video.

324
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,120
The reflection of the water is giving off a beautiful silhouette effect.

325
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,360
You're an otaku, so go now.

326
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,000
Shut up.

327
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,480
It's getting dark soon.

328
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,200
Let's go home.

329
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,260
No.

330
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,080
Why?

331
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,440
Dad prefers videos over me.

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,120
Is that true?

333
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,920
Because you always shoot videos.

334
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,840
If you don't shoot videos, you won't talk to me.

335
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,060
Shut up.

336
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,080
How long are you going to shoot?

337
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,960
Hey, this is the best place.

338
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,480
I don't want to go home.

339
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,780
I hate you, dad.

340
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,280
Look at that expression.

341
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,560
I failed to take it.

342
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,880
Let's do it again.

343
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,780
Let's go home.

344
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,220
You don't understand this girl's feelings.

345
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,100
I don't understand.

346
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,860
It's a great performance of the white god.

347
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,720
Then it's fine.

348
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,060
I'll take care of this girl.

349
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,400
She's great when she leaves.

350
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,180
All right.

351
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,600
OK.

352
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,980
This is a masterpiece.

353
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,920
What?

354
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,340
Here you are.

355
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,440
Thank you.

356
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,580
So you took care of Shatta?

357
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,160
If there's no child to take care of him, he'll think about it again.

358
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,860
Your father is always like that.

359
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,960
He shoots videos even if I fall or drown.

360
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,020
Videos are more important than me.

361
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,760
That's not true.

362
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,120
There are no parents whose children are not important.

363
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,920
Shatta is cute when he shoots videos.

364
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,160
But that's too much.

365
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,500
What's wrong, senpai?

366
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,480
I was in the park across the street and something was shining.

367
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,140
I was thinking of something.

368
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,000
That's too much.

369
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,640
Sh-Shatta!

370
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,300
I never imagined that you're so obsessed with this.

371
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,880
You're staying at my place tonight.

372
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,620
Yeah.

373
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,080
Don't worry.

374
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,840
Your grandma will make the food.

375
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,600
The bath is huge, too.

376
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,260
Yeah.

377
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,720
Grandma, it's Shatta who'll take care of you.

378
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,880
Nice to meet you.

379
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,760
Nice to meet you, too.

380
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,180
That's a good boy.

381
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,400
I don't think he's Ryo's secret son.

382
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,300
Don't say such stupid things.

383
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,680
That's right.

384
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,940
There's no one who can be his mother.

385
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,980
Huh?

386
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,480
What's that? It's suspicious.

387
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,880
How is it? It's a big bath, right?

388
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,640
Yeah. It's the first time I've been in a big bath.

389
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,160
Even if I go to the hot spring, I have a placard with a function.

390
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,800
I see.

391
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,760
Dad, if you have a video, you don't have to worry about me.

392
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,520
That's not true.

393
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,500
By now, I'm sure...

394
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,860
Who is it?

395
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,480
You!

396
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,920
Dad.

397
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Hey, Shatta!

398
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,240
He's definitely a serious patient.

399
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,420
Maybe he needs a rough treatment.

400
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,160
We're here.

401
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,420
Let's go somewhere.

402
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,600
See you.

403
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,100
Bye.

404
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,020
Sh...Shatta...

405
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,480
You're so lively.

406
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,680
A car?

407
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,260
This is... a kidnapping.

408
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,580
Huh? Shatta was kidnapped?

409
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,280
So what did the murderer say?

410
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,940
He said that...

411
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,060
I shot him...

412
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,100
He said he would give me all the 5,500 video tapes...

413
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,900
But why video tapes?

414
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,260
I'm sure there was something on the video you put up.

415
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,540
I see. He was shooting a crime scene or something.

416
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,100
No way!

417
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,920
The tape has memories of me and Shatta...

418
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,760
Honey...

419
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,960
Anyway, I don't have time to waste!

420
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,400
Okay. Let's go.

421
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,520
Okay.

422
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,220
Honey!

423
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:27,340
Did you bring the promised item?

424
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,900
It's in here.

425
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,100
Show me.

426
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,300
Okay.

427
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,700
Where's Shatta?

428
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,400
Don't worry.

429
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,780
Hey!

430
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:40,740
Yeah?

431
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,640
Shatta!

432
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,200
Tell me.

433
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,620
How many days, how many hours, how many minutes did I take you?

434
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,780
That video tape...

435
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,200
If you say it's all, it's all!

436
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:57,920
All?

437
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,680
But all of Shatta's things are in this.

438
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,720
It's his property.

439
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,920
You're still saying that?

440
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,340
Which is more important, the child's life or yours?

441
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,140
Huh?

442
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,680
That's...

443
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,560
What's wrong?

444
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,460
Make it clear!

445
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,560
Yeah.

446
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,140
Senior, isn't Mr. Volvo and Mr. Sakonji overdoing it?

447
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,260
That's right, Ryo.

448
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,280
It's a bit cruel.

449
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,880
No, he won't know unless he does this much.

450
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,180
Tell me.

451
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,400
Which is the video tape and the child?

452
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,200
Uh, that's...

453
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,760
Dad!

454
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,320
What?

455
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,960
What?

456
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,540
Father!

457
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,160
Dad!

458
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,000
Dad!

459
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,180
Dad!

460
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,200
Dad!

461
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,360
Dad!

462
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,160
Dad!

463
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,640
Dad!

464
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,080
Son of a...?

465
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,780
Dad!

466
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:54,620
Dad!

467
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,780
Shitta!

468
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:56,960
What?

469
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,060
Dad!

470
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,080
Shut up!

471
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,620
Dad!

472
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,640
Dad!

473
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:01,760
Ah!

474
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,600
What's up, Rosen?

475
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,660
Sir, Concenari ...

476
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,260
Dad!

477
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,420
Ouch!

478
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,320
I'm coming!

479
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,920
Shatta!

480
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,060
Ryo!

481
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,720
Step on the brakes!

482
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,620
That's why the model gun is stuck in the middle!

483
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,680
Damn, you're such a pain.

484
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,180
Shatta, I'll take over. Hold on to the handle.

485
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,100
Okay.

486
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,620
There!

487
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:33,800
There!

488
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,140
Ryo!

489
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,740
It's the ocean!

490
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,720
What?

491
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:46,660
Dad!

492
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,100
Shatta!

493
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,180
Shatta!

494
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,360
Dad! Dad!

495
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,160
It's okay. It's okay.

496
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,420
Shatta!

497
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,620
Dad's tape is...

498
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,260
Forget it.

499
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,940
You've gotten heavier, Shatta.

500
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,620
Why didn't I hold you like this before?

501
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,980
Honey.

502
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,020
Asako?

503
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,100
Honey, about the next time...

504
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,640
I know you were all just acting.

505
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,040
Sorry.

506
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,160
No, I'm the one who should apologize.

507
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,780
Huh?

508
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,020
Until now, I've been turned around by taking videos.

509
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,000
I couldn't think about your feelings.

510
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,620
I'm awake.

511
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,280
Honey... Honey!

512
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,040
It was dangerous at the end, but now it's easy.

513
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,320
What?

514
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,300
We had a hard time, too.

515
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,900
So we had a hard time.

516
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,220
Seriously...

517
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,080
Even though this villain doesn't suit us...

518
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,920
The two of us are more real than real.

519
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,940
That's right.

520
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,980
Why don't you forget one person?

521
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,840
I didn't realize the shutter was getting this heavy.

522
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,240
Even if I'm a stupid parent who has never seen a child on the video finder.

523
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,280
I was moved by that.

524
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,760
The video...

525
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,120
I don't know what a child's weight is like.

526
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,860
By the way, are you three going out today?

527
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,880
Yes, to the amusement park.

528
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,940
Without the camera, in the palm of your hand.

529
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,180
I'll leave the memories in our hearts.

530
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,620
It's going to be a good memory.

531
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,800
After all, it's better to watch old stories on video than to hear them from your parents.

532
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,900
Natsuki Takahashi

533
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:16,920
Hatsune Miku

534
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,700
Even if the sun sets at midnight

535
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:26,080
If it's you, then wake up

536
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:37,020
Even if it's a boring story, I want to be close to you

537
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,980
I want to be your friend

538
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:46,440
I want to be loved

539
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,620
I want to be loved, just a little

540
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:56,400
The more we say it, the more we feel like we're melting

541
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,420
I really want to break it open

542
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,860
For some reason, love is only cowardly

543
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,280
Don't hide everything that you're not strong enough

544
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:16,420
I want to be loved, just a little

545
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,400
I want to be loved, just a little
