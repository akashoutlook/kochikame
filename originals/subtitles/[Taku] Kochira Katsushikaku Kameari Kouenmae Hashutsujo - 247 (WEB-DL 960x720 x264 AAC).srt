00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Legend ofougou

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,460
When you watch TV, turn on the light in your room, and try running away!

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,920
Come to me, you without money!

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,920
Even if I'm not with you I'm worried

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,900
Look at the blue sky, the white clouds

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,900
It'll be alright somehow

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,660
It'll be alright somehow

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,360
If you're jobless, come to my place

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but don't worry

10
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,940
Look, it's burning

11
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,400
The red clouds

12
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,580
It'll be alright somehow

13
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,600
You got it, right?

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,580
You got it, you got it?

15
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,720
If you got it, then shut up and follow me!

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,980
Honda Shock!

17
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,560
Yves' Marriage

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,960
I did it! I'm so happy!

19
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,420
I'll treat you to anything you want, Honda!

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,520
You should pay back your debt sometimes!

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't be so hard on me!

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,560
Oh, stop!

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
I'll buy you something, Nakagawa!

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,740
Hmm, a candy store...

25
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,160
How nostalgic!

26
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,100
I'll buy you some sweets and candy!

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,120
Oh, there's strawberry candy, too!

28
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,960
Wow, I remember my childhood!

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,760
I used to take Yves to the candy store in my neighborhood!

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,280
Oh, dear...

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,240
Hehehe...

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,360
Hehehe...

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,460
Hehehe...

34
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,240
Hehehe...

35
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:39,780
Hehehe...

36
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,420
Hmph, hmph...

37
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,760
He was really shy as a kid, you know

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,460
Yeah, that's why when I wasn't around, I didn't go out shopping

39
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,220
It still is, though

40
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,840
Hmph, hmph...

41
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,640
Oh, it's baby color castella!

42
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,800
This is Yves' favorite Kansas candy!

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,320
Oh, come on, let's go buy it

44
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,180
Huh, go buy it? No way...

45
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,380
"I don't know."

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,640
"I think Eve lives in a university dormitory in Takao.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,160
But I don't know how long it will take her to come back."

48
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
"It's okay. She'll be back home in a few days."

49
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,600
"No, that's not the problem."

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,100
"She probably can't make friends and is lonely."

51
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,300
"That's..."

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,180
"Ahh!"

53
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,980
"Brother..."

54
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,980
"You brought this to me on purpose?"

55
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,440
"Yeah, it's Eve's favorite, right?"

56
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,240
"Thank you."

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,180
"Then I'll go get something to drink."

58
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,820
"It's okay, it's okay."

59
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,600
"Because you bought juice with the vending machine before."

60
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,520
"I was surprised and started crying."

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,160
"You bought it for me."

62
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,720
"I'll buy it for you."

63
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,800
"Hey, hey."

64
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,580
"Are there any girls who can't buy juice with the vending machine these days?"

65
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,520
"Here you go."

66
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,940
"Thank you."

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,460
"There's something weird here."

68
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,380
"I wonder if it's..."

69
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,140
"My brother bought this for me."

70
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,060
"Geez, girls are always so unlikable."

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,880
"I think he's worried about me."

72
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,540
"But..."

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,180
"Hmm?"

74
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,460
"Eve!"

75
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,520
"What?"

76
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,880
"Wanna play tennis with me?"

77
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,640
"Sorry, but my brother's coming right now."

78
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,200
"Okay, see you later."

79
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,300
"See you later."

80
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,500
"You've changed."

81
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,720
"You couldn't even talk to me before."

82
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,340
"And you didn't even make a loud voice like you do now."

83
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,420
"That's right."

84
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,520
"So you started living in the dormitory after leaving the house?"

85
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,780
"Maybe."

86
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,980
"But..."

87
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,480
"I bought it for you."

88
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,780
"Right."

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,060
"Eve, you've always liked orange juice, haven't you?"

90
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:11,980
"Thank you."

91
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,000
"Have this. This is tea for you."

92
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,040
"Eve looks much older now."

93
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,300
"He must be kidding."

94
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,580
"He's still a little kid."

95
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,460
"Is that so?"

96
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,820
"I'm telling you."

97
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,760
"No, I'm not."

98
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,680
*phone ringing*

99
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,900
Ryo-chan, it's a phone call from a young lady.

100
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,960
From me?

101
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,060
I'll call you back.

102
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
Hello, this is Ryo-tsu.

103
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,480
Oh, it's Eve-chan.

104
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,060
I'm sorry I suddenly called you the other day.

105
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,760
By the way, what's wrong?

106
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,060
You suddenly called me.

107
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,960
Huh? Do you have something to tell me?

108
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,620
*phone ringing*

109
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,120
I'm sorry!

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,500
*phone ringing*

111
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,680
I'm late for class.

112
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,020
Oh, it's fine. You're free.

113
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,560
It's really far when you're on the train.

114
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,740
My brother's motorcycle

115
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,000
can catch me up in no time.

116
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,840
What the hell is your brother's secret story about Honda?

117
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,200
There's someone I want to meet.

118
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,000
Huh?

119
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,540
*phone ringing*

120
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,040
*phone ringing*

121
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,780
*phone ringing*

122
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,640
Kawasaki-san!

123
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,520
*phone ringing*

124
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,940
*phone ringing*

125
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,780
Eve-chan.

126
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,240
I'm Ryo-tsu, your brother's friend.

127
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,540
Nice to meet you. I'm Kawasaki.

128
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,340
Nice to meet you.

129
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
Is this the person you want to introduce?

130
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,620
Yes, he's Kawasaki, the head of the second-rate club.

131
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,360
And he's my precious person.

132
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,660
Your precious person...

133
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,360
Huh?

134
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,240
You two are dating?

135
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,740
Yes.

136
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,020
Since half a year ago,

137
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,600
I've been surprised when I heard about Honda.

138
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,240
Really?

139
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,900
So you introduced me first.

140
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,460
Yes.

141
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,260
We're going to get married.

142
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,920
What?

143
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,520
*phone ringing*

144
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,420
*phone ringing*

145
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,060
*phone ringing*

146
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,760
*phone ringing*

147
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,200
I was very familiar with people.

148
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,500
So I couldn't make friends with Ryo even when I moved to Ryo.

149
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,040
*phone ringing*

150
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,680
I couldn't get along with others.

151
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,920
So even after the lecture,

152
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,200
I couldn't go back to Ryo.

153
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,920
But I still think this person is her precious person.

154
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,740
*phone ringing*

155
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,820
I think she is.

156
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,400
*phone ringing*

157
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,560
No, she's my precious person.

158
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,240
*phone ringing*

159
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,220
We are friends.

160
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,660
We'll always be friends.

161
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,440
*phone ringing*

162
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,640
*phone ringing*

163
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,860
So that's why you're not interested in me anymore.

164
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,400
But you're both students, right?

165
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,140
No matter how much you do, you get married early.

166
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,500
We're serious.

167
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,860
I asked your parents for an interview.

168
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,240
What?

169
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,440
I've already made a reservation for the wedding.

170
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,600
Are you already talking about that?

171
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,600
Why didn't you let Honda know sooner?

172
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,260
I tried to talk to them many times, but...

173
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:25,960
Eva!

174
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,600
I bought your favorite Imagawa-yaki for you.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,160
Let's eat it together.

176
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,540
Eva, you like this ice cream, don't you?

177
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,640
Eva!

178
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,440
Eva!

179
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,380
Eva!

180
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,460
Looking at your brother's face, it's not very good.

181
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,220
For my brother, she is still a little child.

182
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,560
What a pain.

183
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,540
Father.

184
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,360
Huh?

185
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,840
Hello.

186
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,240
Oh, you're here.

187
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,180
Kawasaki.

188
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,280
What?

189
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,260
Ryo-san is with you?

190
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,920
Is it the engine?

191
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,420
Yeah.

192
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,680
I heard you ride it stupidly.

193
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,660
What?

194
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,400
You're pretty close.

195
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,060
Kawasaki-san, I bought a motorcycle at home.

196
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,160
What?

197
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,100
Does that mean you passed the hard motorcycle test?

198
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,040
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

199
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,420
What?

200
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,540
What?

201
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,120
What?

202
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,640
What?

203
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,060
What?

204
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:30,680
Ryo-san, what's going on?

205
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,540
What happened?

206
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:31,920
It's not like you are the one who started it.

207
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,220
you also like your wife, didn't you?

208
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,200
Yes, about it...

209
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,040
Don't worry.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I know it's true.

211
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,860
You also know Michael.

212
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,600
He is the person who invented this game, and he also invented the biome.

213
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,580
Wow, he is smart.

214
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,220
we will open it.

215
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,640
Okay.

216
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,480
Uplift.

217
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,900
What?

218
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,560
Hey, hey, Kawasaki-san!

219
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
How's it going, Monkey?

220
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,600
You're happy to have a new brother, right?

221
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,000
Shut up! It doesn't matter!

222
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,060
Actually, I...

223
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,520
I wanted a tough brother like this!

224
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,520
So I'm really happy, really happy!

225
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,700
You're so popular...

226
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,220
Mom really likes you too...

227
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,840
Then the problem is only Honda, huh?

228
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,440
Yes...

229
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,820
Alright! I'll try to talk to him!

230
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,740
I'll see! Leave it to me!

231
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,120
Honda-kun!

232
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,880
Don't scare me, Yosenpai...

233
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,120
I'm going on a patrol from now on...

234
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
I know! Well, listen to me...

235
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,040
It's already June...

236
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,240
If you say June in English, it's June...

237
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,340
If you say June, it's June bride...

238
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,000
The wedding bells are ringing everywhere...

239
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,840
The wedding will be held...

240
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,660
Honda, your little sister Eve is also going to get married someday, huh?

241
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,720
What?

242
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,980
Ah! Hey!

243
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,160
Hey, Honda! Don't lose your temper!

244
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,000
Eve is getting married?

245
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,420
Eve is getting married?

246
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,660
Hey, wake up!

247
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,600
That was a joke!

248
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,820
Eve won't get married!

249
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,160
You're right...

250
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,140
Eve is still a kid!

251
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,020
Wedding...

252
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,580
I...

253
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,700
Ah, it's still a long way to go.

254
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,540
Huh? It looks like a boxer just knocked out.

255
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,600
I'll go first!

256
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,840
It's a reaction beyond imagination.

257
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,660
He needs to make a thorough plan.

258
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,780
Eve...

259
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:58,180
From now on, we'll have a strategy meeting for the marriage announcement strategy against Hayato Honda.

260
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,180
But, Senpai...

261
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,600
What?

262
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,360
It's not good to link the word "marriage" and "Eve," is it?

263
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,060
I don't think I can avoid shock no matter how I tell you.

264
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,960
But if you tell him straight, his heart may stop.

265
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,380
That's why I thought about it.

266
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,040
It's the Honda Kawasaki Friendship Strategy.

267
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,740
Eve will be a friend with Honda before introducing Kawasaki.

268
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:31,280
For example, when Honda's bike is in trouble while patrolling, Kawasaki will pass by.

269
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,160
What's wrong?

270
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,640
It seems to be broken.

271
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,600
Please let me help you.

272
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,260
Thank you.

273
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,000
First, you become a friend.

274
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,520
Then, you become friends with Honda.

275
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,160
And a few days later, Honda passes by where Kawasaki's bike is broken.

276
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,280
Hey, you're the one from before, aren't you?

277
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
This time, it's my turn to help you.

278
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,880
Haha, thank you.

279
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,380
After such a fateful encounter, the two became close.

280
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
Love was born someday.

281
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,280
Happily, they became friends.

282
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,440
What?

283
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,680
What will you do if you marry Honda and Kawasaki?

284
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,460
What are you thinking, senpai?

285
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,940
Huh? That's strange.

286
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,700
Anyway, after a fateful encounter, the two become friends.

287
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,060
Yes, it's Otohime.

288
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,980
Otohime will join them and go on a touring together.

289
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,840
Honda says, "I'm glad to have a wonderful girlfriend."

290
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,440
"It'll be good if you have a girl behind you for the next time we go on a touring."

291
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,200
"Is there anyone good?"

292
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,460
No, but there won't be any female acquaintance with Honda.

293
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,980
So Otohime says, "What about bringing Eve?"

294
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,940
Honda may not like it, but somehow Otohime will persuade her.

295
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,420
Finally, Eve will come out.

296
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,580
Yes.

297
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,960
This is how Eve will join the tour.

298
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,060
At first, Honda will worry about her.

299
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,540
But, after many, many times,

300
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:18,060
Kawasaki and Eve feel it's natural for them to be together.

301
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,960
And they see the love and tell each other that they are dating.

302
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,160
You're not talking about marriage yet, right?

303
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,400
Eve is still a child for him.

304
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,620
Eve must tell him that he has grown up.

305
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,400
How long will it take to get married?

306
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,300
About 10 years.

307
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
10 years? Is it that long?

308
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,260
It takes too long no matter how long it takes.

309
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,040
It can't be helped. Honda's nerves are that weak.

310
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,780
Is something wrong with my nerves?

311
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,100
Honda!

312
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,960
What were you talking about?

313
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,880
Nothing.

314
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,160
You were saying my name just now, right?

315
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,380
It's my fault.

316
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,880
You're suspicious.

317
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,220
It's really nothing.

318
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,080
Don't be so grumpy and tell me.

319
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,400
I told you it's nothing.

320
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,040
I don't know how to tell you about Eve's marriage.

321
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,080
I don't know how to tell you about her marriage.

322
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:32,880
Honda, hang in there!

323
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,940
Excuse me.

324
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,840
Hello.

325
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,020
Oh, no. It's Eve and the others.

326
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,700
I wonder if they're here.

327
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,680
Eve, Kawasaki, what's up today?

328
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,060
Actually, I'm talking about getting married to Eve.

329
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,620
I have to ask Mr. Ryotsu to...

330
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,400
Honda is here. I'll talk to you later.

331
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,540
But...

332
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,200
If you know that you're Eve's fiancee, it'll be a big deal.

333
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,080
Eve's fiancee.

334
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:04,940
Brother.

335
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,740
Eve's fiancee.

336
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,780
Honda, hang in there.

337
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,380
No, Honda. Eve wants to eat konnyaku.

338
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,580
Please, brother.

339
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,740
Please accept my marriage with Eve.

340
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,220
Don't make me even more excited.

341
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,540
Brother.

342
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,300
Eve...

343
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:24,660
Eve...

344
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,600
Eve...

345
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:25,800
is...

346
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,420
is...

347
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,240
is...

348
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,460
is...

349
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:27,800
is...

350
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:27,980
is...

351
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,160
is...

352
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,520
is...

353
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:29,800
is...

354
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,040
is...

355
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,320
is...

356
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,400
is...

357
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:30,540
is...

358
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:30,940
is...

359
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:30,960
is...

360
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,600
is...

361
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,740
is...

362
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,200
is...

363
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,960
is...

364
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,500
is...

365
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,940
is...

366
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,940
is...

367
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,320
is...

368
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,620

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,520

374
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,780
Demonic voice "Yibiru"

375
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,420
Demonic phone call

376
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,280
Our business never stops

377
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,920
It's me

378
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,900
That voice?

379
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,240
I understand, I will call for you now

380
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,160
Demonic phone call

381
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,740
I haven't seen him since morning .

382
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Here he is.

383
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,880
Welcome back !

384
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,780
I thought he might get here some day.

385
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,620
We'll have to get you ready!

386
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,280
The special suit for Mr. Honda ...

387
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,940
is also prepared properly.

388
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,160
Bantou Togo Alliance is back!

389
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,600
Let's go!

390
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,500
We've been chased!

391
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,020
We're in the middle of a program, but I'll tell you the news that just came in.

392
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,980
Right now, a bunch of rioters have suddenly appeared in the entire area of the city,

393
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,880
and they seem to be doing rioting.

394
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,060
The police chief is considering a very careful measure.

395
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,740
Hey, no way!

396
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:35,260
The sudden appearance of this rioting group is a result of the revival of a person

397
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,320
called a legend among the rioting gang members who are running a battle

398
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,340
when they gather to talk about their relatives.

399
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,100
Big brother!

400
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,120
It's become something ridiculous!

401
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,320
Hey, you!

402
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,240
That's a real one!

403
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,060
What the hell did you do?

404
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,580
I didn't do anything!

405
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,860
This is the kind of thing you do!

406
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,860
There's no way you're involved in this kind of thing!

407
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,060
You're making such a big deal out of it!

408
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,060
Wait a minute!

409
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,240
It's not Mr. Ryozu's fault!

410
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,360
It's me!

411
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,780
You're...

412
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,800
I see, so that's it.

413
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,440
That's why you said it wasn't me!

414
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,360
I'm the one who brought my daughter to life.

415
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,880
I understand how you feel.

416
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,020
However, you shouldn't act like this!

417
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,100
You have to stop this as soon as possible!

418
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,440
It's my responsibility to do this!

419
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,580
I'll stop it no matter what!

420
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,440
Mr. Kawasaki!

421
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,940
Wait up!

422
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,900
You can't involve a person who has nothing to do with this!

423
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,060
He's my brother!

424
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,340
He has nothing to do with this!

425
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,340
But...

426
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,680
Mr. Kawasaki...

427
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,620
Nakagawa!

428
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,120
Get the helicopter!

429
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
We'll follow him!

430
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,120
Yes, sir!

431
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Mr. Honda!

432
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,420
Y-You're...

433
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,940
Kawasaki, the fiancé of Ms. Eve!

434
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,440
I-I don't know!

435
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,160
I don't know any fiancé!

436
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Mr. Honda!

437
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,840
You're late, you guys!

438
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,480
W-Wait!

439
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,400
You're too fast!

440
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,220
I love Eve from the bottom of my heart!

441
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,720
I want her to accept marriage!

442
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,700
Eve is still a child!

443
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,560
She can't marry!

444
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,740
Mr. Honda!

445
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,940
Listen to me!

446
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,000
I won't listen to you!

447
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,620
Can you see me, Mr. Honda?!

448
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,000
W-Well...

449
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,260
That's...

450
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,460
Oh, thank you!

451
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,800
I'm going to make this wedding ring!

452
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,380
I'll be the one protecting her from now on!

453
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,200
No!

454
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,820
I wonder what they're trying to do...

455
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,280
Brother...

456
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,260
Mr. Kawasaki...

457
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,160
Denomai

458
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,280
Only the two of us can do it.

459
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,460
You're the first one to follow me up here.

460
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,640
As expected from my little brother.

461
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,280
Mr. Honda.

462
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,260
I'm going to see Asahi today.

463
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,420
Please take care of Eve.

464
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,060
Yes, big brother.

465
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:16,440
Mr. Kawasaki, big brother.

466
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:16,520
Eve.

467
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,720
This is a happy occasion.

468
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,300
Yes.

469
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,960
Hey, maids.

470
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,520
You look good.

471
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,940
Eve, show me your wedding ring.

472
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,280
Yes.

473
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,060
Wow, it's cute.

474
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,100
By the way, I was wondering.

475
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,440
Do you know Eve's personality?

476
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,940
Yes, when she rides an elephant, her personality changes.

477
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,160
It's like a new person.

478
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,180
I heard about it a long time ago.

479
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,000
I see.

480
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:48,880
I hope you know.

481
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,620
I didn't know such a wedding would be held in Japan.

482
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,160
The motto of the wedding is to respond to all needs of the guests.

483
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,740
Wait, I'm running away.

484
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,780
Now, Professor Otsuka, who is the father-in-law's wife, will give you a toast.

485
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,140
Hmm...

486
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,780
It's hot.

487
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,780
Damn it, this is bad!

488
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,140
Really, what's wrong with this?

489
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,540
Asahi is Eve Kawasaki!

490
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,180
I'm going to have a nice chat with you.

491
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,280
This is close!

492
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,320
It's nice to meet you.

493
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,740
Nice to meet you.

494
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:51,480
- - - - Eve

495
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:51,780
-chan!

496
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,720
Big brother! I

497
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,500
'm going to be happy! You're going to

498
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,160
be happy, Eve! Of course!

499
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,140
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

500
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,800
Yeah, it's better than seeing it again

501
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,880
Na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na

502
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,220
What is this old-fashioned pro-wrestling?

503
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,960
Do you think you can get money with this?

504
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,740
What? You think you can crush it thanks to me?

505
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,040
Alright, I'll make you the best pro-wrestling organization in Japan that I can get money from!

506
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,720
Next time on "Mine only! Katsushika Pro-Wrestling"

507
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,380
Thanks for watching!
