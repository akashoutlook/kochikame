00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Episode Two: The

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:03,940
Father-in-Law

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,280
Oh, now she's a date?

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,760
That's right, Nana-chan and I are dating, huh?

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,700
Why'd you put your work place on hold?!

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,020
I work.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,420
Oh, this is just for your tip though.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,820
Sorry for being late.

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,800
*Gunshot Noises*

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,140
I was just here, too.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,000
I've been waiting for them for an hour.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,900
I bet you need to count the papers.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,540
I just gave it to Ryusei-san.

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,160
Ah, hello everyone.

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,380
Hello.

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,040
It's a big deal.

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,440
The relationship between the Shirobai staff and the manga artist.

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,060
That's right.

19
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,320
Nana-chan is very busy.

20
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,180
Right?

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,980
No, not really.

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,500
But she hasn't broken the deadline once.

23
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,920
I'm impressed.

24
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,160
There are many manga artists who don't keep their deadline.

25
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,260
By the way,

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,880
Senpai, are you still working on manga?

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,580
Of course.

28
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,420
I'm a signer of the weekly Sapphire.

29
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,160
Then Nana-chan is the deadline.

30
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,100
Ryo-chan too.

31
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,400
Ah!

32
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,540
I got a call several times.

33
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,020
I never get a call.

34
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,560
Come on, Honda.

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't want to.

36
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,400
I'm going on a date.

37
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,760
No, no, no.

38
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,740
Go, Honda.

39
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,540
Go, Nana.

40
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,740
Honda.

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,300
When you watch TV,

42
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,480
make your room brighter and look away.

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,020
Come with me,

44
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,020
if you don't have money.

45
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,780
I don't have money either.

46
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,000
But I'm worried.

47
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,080
Look,

48
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,620
it's blue.

49
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,440
White clouds in the sky.

50
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,040
It's white clouds in the sky.

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,580
It'll come to some.

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,940
It'll come to some.

53
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,460
It'll come to some.

54
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:09,580
You know?

55
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,400
You know it.

56
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,960
Then don't say anything.

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,340
Follow me.

58
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:15,500
Follow me.

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,560
Follow me.

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,100
Follow me.

61
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,860
Follow me.

62
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,300
Is it really as good as I thought it would be?

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,380
Well...

64
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,700
Ryuu-senshi! do not let Honda run!

65
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,680
Game Over

66
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,460
Now you'll pay!

67
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:17,160
Why won't you give me my bike?

68
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,060
My bike!

69
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,780
Mike! Mike! Mike!

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,340
Mr. Ryo! What are you doing?

71
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,260
I'm the one who wants to know what you're doing!

72
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,280
You're trying to trick me into stopping my series, aren't you?

73
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,180
What are you talking about?

74
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,380
I didn't tell you that today was the deadline!

75
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,940
You don't need to be the fastest.

76
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,900
The speed of the brush is the best in the industry.

77
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,020
Oh?

78
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,100
Please believe me, Patricia Kanko.

79
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,720
Hmm...

80
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,680
Whatever.

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,640
Hey, you got anything to write?

82
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,780
What? No way!

83
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,680
You're going to write here?

84
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,260
It's okay if you shake a little.

85
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,420
Huh?

86
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,000
You're holding it, aren't you?

87
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,300
No, that's not good!

88
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,920
What? A new manuscript?

89
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,340
Hmm?

90
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,260
Come to think of it, when a serial writer drops a manuscript,

91
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,260
there's a new manga on it, right?

92
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,640
Ugh!

93
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,900
It's a misunderstanding.

94
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,080
I'll take this!

95
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,180
No! Give it back!

96
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,240
I'll take it!

97
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,460
No!

98
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:15,980
Huh?

99
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,020
Up!

100
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,060
What's wrong with that?

101
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,880
You're no good!

102
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,340
Well, that's all there is!

103
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:22,560
No!

104
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,120
That's great news!

105
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,200
Here.

106
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,880
Please have to take it back!

107
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,380
I quit!

108
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,340
Especially since it's my debut work.

109
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,740
I knew it.

110
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,900
Of course.

111
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,320
There, it's complete.

112
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,600
Thank you for your hard work.

113
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,540
It's for the first time to read a manuscript written behind a copy paper.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,560
By the way, where are you going?

115
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:45,680
Where are you headed?

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,020
It's Midori-sensei's apartment.

117
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,780
Midori-sensei!?

118
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,880
You mean that 4-frame cartoonist Midori-sensei!?

119
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,560
Yes.

120
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,180
I'm so lucky to meet the real Midori-sensei!

121
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
Midori!

122
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,420
I've been waiting for you, Ryu-sensei!

123
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,560
Midori, how's the work going?

124
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,600
It's all done!

125
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,620
You look like lovers.

126
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,500
You're so sweet.

127
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,140
Awesome! I'm so hungry!

128
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,300
You did a great job this time, too.

129
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,580
Thank you.

130
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,700
I'm so glad.

131
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,800
How about some wine to celebrate the work?

132
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,740
That looks delicious!

133
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,400
I'm sorry, but there's still room for more.

134
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,220
What!?

135
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,800
Food! Wine!

136
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,500
This is a great success!

137
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,640
Natsuki Mimi-sensei, thank you so much.

138
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,600
Again?

139
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,040
You're so good at winning the lottery.

140
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,860
It's true.

141
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,620
It's a great success in history.

142
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,800
Then, shall we buy a car to celebrate?

143
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Look!

144
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,820
I prepared this car for you.

145
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,780
I'd love to, but it's still too late.

146
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,520
It's too late.

147
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:10,940
What's wrong with you?

148
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,080
Next time, you can go out with me.

149
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,560
Sure! I'm happy to do that!

150
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,360
I hope you can give me a pen as soon as possible!

151
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,080
I'm so happy!

152
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,820
I'm the only one who's not happy with it!

153
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,860
Ryu-sensei, you're all ours!

154
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:27,800
Hey!

155
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,020
Hey, I'm begging you to give me a pen!

156
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:31,780
Yes!

157
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,580
Senpai, can I go on a date with Nana-chan?

158
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:36,760
What?

159
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,080
What did you say?

160
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,800
Is what you just said true?

161
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,060
Y-yes!

162
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,720
If the date is canceled, the next manuscript may be affected.

163
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,860
Mr. Honda, please go on a date right now!

164
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,780
Y-yes!

165
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,500
So, I'll let him go soon, Miko.

166
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
See you again.

167
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,220
Thank you, Ryu-sensei.

168
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,740
Ryu-sensei, you always think about us, the cartoonists, the most!

169
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,100
Stray!

170
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,440
The editor is a great job!

171
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,620
Being surrounded by such a beautiful woman is like being in a harem!

172
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,760
Let me do it once!

173
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,520
No!

174
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,860
The editor's relationship with the author is important!

175
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,040
No matter what!

176
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,420
No matter what!

177
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,080
No matter what!

178
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,540
No matter what!

179
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,180
No matter what!

180
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:24,880
No matter what!

181
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,160
No matter what!

182
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,340
No matter what!

183
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,520
No matter what!

184
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:34,680
Yes, Ryu-sensei!

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,820
It's been a while, Chaka-bon!

186
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,300
What?

187
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,440
The editor's hand is missing?

188
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,440
It's changed!

189
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,980
It's Ryu-sensei from the super editor!

190
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,360
No!

191
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,800
Of course, it's OK!

192
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,640
No!

193
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,280
See you tomorrow!

194
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,580
Here.

195
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,360
Ryu-sensei!

196
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:50,900
I need help!

197
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,140
Is there a problem?

198
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,560
The French publishing house.

199
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,120
Here it is.

200
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,900
It looks like it's going to collapse eventually.

201
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,480
Ryu-sensei told me about it!

202
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,000
I was out of help.

203
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,240
I also wanted to borrow the cat's hand.

204
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,180
What a reason...

205
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,360
The weekly magazine of men is important now!

206
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,600
It's all about jouissance!

207
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,820
It's so far from the harem.

208
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,500
Huh?

209
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,020
Don't you have a relationship with young girls?

210
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,060
I have.

211
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,020
Actually, Nagisa Shiratori, the photographer at SIMO ait resistance at my place,

212
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,100
is Billy-san's man!

213
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,920
What? Nagisa Shiratori is a super popular idol who has been on TV a lot lately.

214
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,040
Yes, if this photo book hits, the French publishing company will be a member of the best publishing company.

215
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,400
Good, I will be in charge of that photo book. When is the shooting?

216
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,220
I finished it in Hawaii last month.

217
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,880
This is the photo book.

218
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,980
Oh, it's a pretty good picture.

219
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,340
If I put it on the Internet auction, it might sell well.

220
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,940
What? There's a UFO outside the window!

221
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,440
What? Where?

222
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,000
No, I was mistaken.

223
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,220
What?

224
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,880
Then, please take care of the work.

225
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,140
Oh, yes.

226
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,880
-Kouhei! -I'm home!

227
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,060
-I'm sorry to bother you! -Please wait.

228
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,420
-Send this fax! -Yes, yes!

229
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,160
-Kouhei, are you still there? -Yes, I'm home!

230
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,660
-Hurry up! -Yes!

231
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,500
-Hey, Baito! -Yes!

232
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,960
-Kouhei! -Yes!

233
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,500
-Kouhei! -Yes!

234
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,020
It's already 11:00 in the morning.

235
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,460
What's that?

236
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,900
I can't!

237
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,140
I'll work hard on the part-time job.

238
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,160
-We're in trouble! -We're in trouble!

239
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,820
-We're in trouble! -We're in trouble!

240
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:08,480
-Baito, you can do it now! -You're good!

241
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,300
Sorry.

242
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,200
No!

243
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,680
-I'm sorry!

244
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:14,980
-You can't do it! -I don't want to be a thug!

245
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,300
-What's that? -Sorry.

246
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,740
-No! -You can't do it!

247
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,240
-I can't do it! -I'm sorry.

248
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,280
-It's a great relief for the staff! -I'm sorry.

249
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,560
I'm sorry.

250
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:26,620
Listen to me.

251
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm really sorry about this.

252
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,380
-No! -No!

253
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,040
Wait a minute!

254
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,080
I'll do something about this manuscript!

255
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,380
It's the manuscript of the most interesting manga artist who's got the main manga of the week, "Nandemo Goraku"!

256
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,520
And the 8 pages of it are burned to the ground!

257
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,240
If the teacher's manga wasn't on it, the readers wouldn't buy it!

258
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,980
No worries, no need to worry.

259
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,880
Really?

260
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,980
Yeah.

261
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,340
There's no page after this, right?

262
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,080
No.

263
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,640
Then let's look at this manuscript first.

264
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,000
W-what are you doing?!

265
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,780
Shut up!

266
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:11,880
Yes!

267
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,580
In this way, divide the 5 pieces of each page and look at the first two.

268
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,380
This is...!

269
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,060
This is...!

270
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,200
The first page—it's already out!

271
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,840
Now, it's the car.

272
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,940
The other side.

273
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,980
Widen it.

274
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,820
Okay.

275
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,920
2 pages are completed.

276
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,020
You can see the stopped scenes from the second page.

277
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,740
Only one page...

278
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,980
This isn't just anybody's art!

279
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,040
It still says more 5 pages!

280
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,900
And there's this little frame left here!

281
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,140
What do we do?

282
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,220
Now we've got five pages.

283
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,780
DRIVE!

284
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,040
COPY!

285
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,620
The manga will expand little by little, and it will gradually come closer from the other side.

286
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,760
This is the second page of the right-hand side.

287
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,560
Move forward to the first page.

288
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,180
One page further with the face up.

289
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,000
And the last is continued with the eyes up.

290
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,700
What a powerful last!

291
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,780
So everyone, the 16-page manga is complete!

292
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,200
Awesome! I did it!

293
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,020
Awesome!

294
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,220
It's amazing!

295
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,100
It's the help of heaven!

296
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,940
Thank you, Mr. Ryotsu.

297
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,600
Now our car will be saved.

298
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,960
Oh, my gosh!

299
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,920
Of course, Omonnai-sensei's manga is also burning!

300
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,600
What?

301
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,160
I can't do anything about it.

302
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,940
Only two pages remain.

303
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,420
Two pages?

304
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,000
Of course, Mr. Omonnai-sensei's work is also a work of entertainment along with Mr. Mangaichi's work.

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,940
No more!

306
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,060
Is this the end of our publishing house?

307
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,280
No, it might be fixed.

308
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,560
What?

309
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,900
But only two pages remain.

310
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,420
It will be fixed.

311
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,720
Fortunately, it's a conversation scene.

312
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,380
Hmm.

313
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,960
Hmm.

314
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,400
Hmm.

315
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,120
Hmm.

316
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,980
Hmm.

317
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,400
I made it!

318
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,320
It's true!

319
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,080
I made it!

320
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,340
That's all.

321
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,040
I see.

322
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,480
Then say it once again.

323
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,180
What?

324
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,760
Say it.

325
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,520
What?

326
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,200
Sorry.

327
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,220
I can't do anything about it.

328
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,140
One more time!

329
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:34,720
Wow!

330
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,460
It became a proper manga!

331
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,160
Next, it is a danke.

332
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,380
A nuk?

333
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,260
That's all.

334
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,700
I see.

335
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,440
Hmm.

336
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,840
Wait, it's a danke!

337
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,460
Oh, I made it!

338
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,160
Thanks.

339
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,380
Well then...

340
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,240
Oh, again!

341
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,140
Damn!

342
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,380
I made it!

343
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,780
Oh, I made it!

344
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,200
Thanks.

345
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,220
Well then...

346
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,220
Oh, again!

347
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:58,900
Damn!

348
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,080
I made it!

349
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:00,820
Wow!

350
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,660
This is amazing!

351
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,880
We can continue with step by step,

352
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,400
if we combine this "one more time" and "discord".

353
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,040
Wow, that's great skill!

354
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,740
Mr. Boss!

355
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,880
Could I also try?

356
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,360
This too!

357
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,040
This too!

358
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,140
But this is...

359
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,560
Leave it to me!

360
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,660
This conversation will be a laughing matter.

361
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,220
I'll make the volume of the volume bigger here.

362
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,960
Turn this picture over.

363
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,480
Expand this.

364
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,360
He's really a reliable person.

365
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,660
So, I went to get my manuscript.

366
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,860
It's over.

367
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,540
We can somehow release it with this.

368
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,440
Please pay for my part-time job.

369
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,800
Of course.

370
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,260
I've read it again.

371
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,840
I'm sorry for using it for nothing.

372
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,040
From now on, call me Super Editor Ryozu.

373
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,240
Yes, Ryozu Super Editor.

374
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,940
Would you like some coffee?

375
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,760
I'd like some Japanese tea.

376
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,340
This is bad!

377
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,920
The film of Nagisa Shiratori's photo book!

378
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
This is almost burnt!

379
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,340
I should have printed it on the first page tomorrow morning!

380
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,680
We can't release the photo book with this.

381
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,100
Why?

382
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,280
What is this?

383
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,900
It's the end!

384
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,300
It's too early to give up!

385
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,240
But there are only 5 photos left to use!

386
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,020
Don't worry.

387
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,100
For example, this cut.

388
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,020
Up.

389
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,400
Reverse.

390
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,780
Do the layout.

391
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,540
It's like another photo!

392
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,740
MSM.

393
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:02,100
Or from a different photo and...

394
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,580
A combination.

395
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,580
Well, they were good!

396
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,040
This must be a couple of photos!

397
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,560
Let me have a look!

398
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,480
Oh, I think I saw it.

399
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,500
It's your favorite photo!

400
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,080
I have no choice!

401
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,520
If you do more than that, you'll get as many photos as you want!

402
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,820
As expected of Super Editor!

403
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,340
This will fill up a photo book in no time!

404
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,200
But there's not a single photo of the important swimsuit!

405
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,120
That's right! It won't sell without the swimsuit!

406
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,860
Swimsuit, huh...

407
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,560
By the way, I remember there was a photo of Nagisa Shiratori in the magazine last week...

408
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,140
That's it!

409
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,300
This is it!

410
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,200
Oh, that's perfect!

411
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,100
I'll take this!

412
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,340
It's a photo of a magazine from somewhere else, so it's not good!

413
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,360
I know!

414
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,700
If you keep it like this, it'll be bad...

415
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,140
Change the pose...

416
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,740
Arrange with the real thing...

417
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,180
Change the photo...

418
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,200
Change the pose...

419
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,420
Change the pose...

420
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,760
And then change the color of the swimsuit!

421
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,360
If you keep it like this, no one will notice!

422
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,240
Is there another one?

423
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,260
This is good, but it's black and white.

424
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,560
Leave it to me!

425
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,840
This is easy with the computer.

426
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,420
Take this!

427
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,660
OK!

428
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,040
Find a photo that everyone can use!

429
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:54,060
There's no enough background in Hawaii, so I'll just make it to the whole world.

430
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,500
Is there no other photo?

431
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,100
This is all of it!

432
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,980
There are 20 pages left!

433
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,540
All of them are difficult...

434
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,480
Umm...

435
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,360
During the Hawaii shoot,

436
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
I have some snaps I took during the shoot.

437
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,560
Oh, that's great. Bring them here right away.

438
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,960
Nagisa-chan, I don't see you much.

439
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,800
It's just the manager and staff.

440
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,800
Is it still no good?

441
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,640
No, let's go with this.

442
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,160
You can draw a girl's-like circle.

443
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,500
It's a setting called the real album.

444
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,960
I see.

445
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,880
There are 16 pages left.

446
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,260
Put the real thing in.

447
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,860
It's written in the idol's photo book, right?

448
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,220
What's wrong with love? What's wrong with love?

449
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,080
It's like a plot.

450
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,160
It's hard to get the real thing.

451
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,100
I'll draw it little by little.

452
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,400
The blue sky is beautiful.

453
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,280
The white clouds are beautiful.

454
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,900
The favorite food is steak.

455
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,200
It's a barbecue restaurant.

456
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,940
Nagisa?

457
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,000
Is it okay?

458
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,720
It's an emergency.

459
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,880
There are two pages left.

460
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,300
Okay, it's a book service.

461
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,980
Nagisa Shiratori's real-life story.

462
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,940
The last page is a foot.

463
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,480
It's like a snowman's foot.

464
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,380
Nagisa Shiratori's image is...

465
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,180
Good morning.

466
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,560
Good morning.

467
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,660
Chocobon, wait a minute.

468
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,200
Yes.

469
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,320
What is it, president?

470
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,480
How's the progress of the photo book?

471
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,760
That's already...

472
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,420
That's good.

473
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,660
Actually, I was wondering if I could double the page and make it a luxurious book.

474
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,480
What?

475
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Well, I will take it.

476
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,680
This is the manager of Nagisa-chan's production.

477
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,080
I was asked what to do with the president.

478
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,500
I'll ask you for your great photo book.

479
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,800
But I'm not going to finish it overnight...

480
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,080
I'll pay you.

481
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,900
I should have taken a lot of pictures, so it's okay, right?

482
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,200
But...

483
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,020
Leave it to me, president.

484
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,840
How about you?

485
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,420
I...

486
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:11,500
I'm Ryo-tsu Kankichi, the super editor who was specially hired to make the Shiratori Nagisa photo book.

487
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,680
I see. That's very helpful.

488
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,840
I'm counting on you.

489
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,420
Leave it to me.

490
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,740
In return, Mr. President, would you like to give us a special bonus for selling the photo book?

491
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,320
Oh, that's great.

492
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,360
That's great. As expected of Mr. President.

493
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,760
It will be a 100-page book.

494
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,060
Oh, I'm looking forward to it.

495
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,660
I'm looking forward to it.

496
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,040
What are you going to do? You're so cheap!

497
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,940
There are no more photos!

498
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,720
Leave it to us. Everyone bring as many photos as you can!

499
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,340
What?

500
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,580
Can we use this?

501
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,880
Believe my skills.

502
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,880
You don't know the faces of elementary school students, so I'll let Mr. Nagisa be in here.

503
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,300
All old photos will be for the family.

504
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,340
That's terrible.

505
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,460
Lend me the company's pamphlets.

506
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,040
What are you going to do?

507
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,380
I'll put Mr. President's words on the first page of the photo book.

508
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,800
It's like a graduation album.

509
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,720
I'll introduce KANTO COLOR to the company and add an advertisement for hiring employees.

510
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,620
And the profile and family introduction of the president.

511
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,900
That'll fill 20 pages.

512
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,440
No way!

513
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,980
And I'll pay for the novel "Jirocho Gaiden" through 30 pages.

514
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,180
I'm gradually leaving idol photo books.

515
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,280
Can I publish this?

516
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,480
No one will buy it.

517
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,420
It's okay.

518
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,540
Idol photo books are sold.

519
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,860
What will be in the book, the fans will buy it.

520
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,700
What will be in the book, the fans will buy it.

521
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,840
All right, the contents are all here.

522
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,520
Everyone, finish this up tonight.

523
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,620
This one is for the aunt.

524
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,540
And the rest is for the president's daughter and his little sister.

525
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,920
Well, the number of copies has expanded.

526
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,120
This is difficult.

527
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,800
Hey, is this the photo book?

528
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,260
But this is...

529
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,040
You're just like a relative.

530
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,820
I guess someone is looking for you.

531
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,260
Ah, I'm hungry.

532
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,060
I'm hungry.

533
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,220
I would like to have a cup noodles .

534
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,320
Here you are.

535
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,440
Here you are.

536
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,960
All right.

537
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,920
It's done.

538
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,100
All right.

539
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
All right.

540
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,420
Hey, Mr. Ryotsu.

541
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,460
You're really helpful.

542
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,620
Huh?

543
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,440
What is this?

544
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,140
Doesn't it smell weird?

545
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,600
Oh, I see.

546
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,180
It's all burned up.

547
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,380
It's over.

548
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,940
What the hell?

549
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,720
This is...

550
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,200
This is Nagisa's Pocifilm!

551
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,500
Ryo!

552
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,300
What the hell is this?

553
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,840
That's...

554
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,440
What?

555
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,720
Why did it get in my pocket?

556
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,060
It's weird.

557
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,360
What?

558
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,540
Ryo!

559
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,580
What?

560
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,880
I'll show you my photo book!

561
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,440
This is the popular photo book by Nagisa Shiratori, a French publisher.

562
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,240
It's a book with 400 pages of photos,

563
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,020
but the fans buy at least three of them for display, assembly, and storage.

564
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,460
I can't believe this is a hit.

It's a book for display, assembly, and storage. I can't believe this is a hit.

566
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,300
I don't know it.

567
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,280
This book is a hint to how Ryo would devise his own product.

What?

570
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,540
Isn't it kind of cool, Ryo?

571
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,380
It's a shadow laborer.

572
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,280
Everyone was happy to get a special bonus.

573
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,520
I should've run away.

574
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,380
You should've run away.

Let's go!

596
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,460
There's a wall over there

597
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,800
There's a wall for sure

598
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,400
Everyone come to our town

Thank you!

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,600
What?

601
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,980
Two billion yen of property is with me?

602
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,340
But if I don't use up half of it in a week, the rest will be taken away?

603
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,820
What? I won't lose to anyone!

604
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,980
Next time, I'll be a millionaire!

605
