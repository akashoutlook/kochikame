1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,520
"When watching TV, make the room bright and look away!"

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,080
"When watching TV, make the room bright and look away!"

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,100
"Come to me, you poor guy!"

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,380
"I'm not here, but I'm worried about you."

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,840
"Look at the blue sky and the white clouds."

6
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,040
"You'll be alright one day."

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,460
"You get it, right?"

8
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,400
"You get it, you get it!"

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,880
"If you get it, then come to me, quietly!"

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,540
"If you get it, then come to me, quietly!"

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,600
"I'm sorry!"

12
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,920
"Hey, hey, what's up with you all of a sudden?"

13
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,660
"Oh, well, I guess my son-in-law did something wrong again."

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,340
"I'm really sorry!"

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,220
"I've been making things up all day long."

16
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,840
"It's not like I called you all here because you did something wrong."

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,500
"Huh?"

18
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,380
"Well, I know you're involved with Ryotsu-kun, but..."

19
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,200
"What do you mean by that?"

20
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,480
"Actually, Interpol is now opening a competition to decide who's the world's number one police officer."

21
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,900
Now, Interpol presents...

22
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,420
The World Policeman Championship!

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,280
"Huh?"

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,980
"It's a competition to decide who's the world's number one police officer,

25
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:04,040
by gathering the most competent police officers from 179 countries that belong to Interpol."

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,880
"So, it's like a police officer's Olympics?"

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,740
"That's right."

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,540
"That's interesting. No, I mean, it's a wonderful idea."

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,140
"From the Interpol headquarters, we've appointed a special detective,

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
the North Police, as a lead player of our country."

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,200
"W-What do you mean by the North Police?"

32
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:23,580
"Well, you see..."

33
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,720
"It's Kaipan Deka."

34
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,220
"Although he's not wearing his uniform,

35
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,600
he's been keeping his 100% authority for the past 10 years,

36
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,040
so of course he's the world's number one police officer."

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,260
"I see."

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,680
"In addition to Kaipan Deka, Interpol has also asked for two police officers from Japan to be recommended."

39
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,160
"So we used our computers to investigate 100% authority police officers,

40
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,540
and we were able to list two of them."

41
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,980
"And those two are?"

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,240
the head of the Katsushika office of police."

43
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,220
"Oh, is that so?"

44
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,240
"D-Deputy, what a strange thing to learn."

45
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
"Ah. And who are those two?"

46
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,400
"One of them is decided by pathetic Nakaakawa Keiichi."

47
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,600
"Ah, perhaps you are not his son-in - d, or your subordinate."

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,540
"Well, maybe not. That's all."

49
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,820
"And the other one is..."

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,380
"Huh? What, Ryoutsu?"

51
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,280
"Huh. He's by mistake, right?"

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,040
"Precisely.

53
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,780
Well, the Ryotsu Police Department was 100% responsible, just like the Kaipan Department and the Nakagawa Police Department.

54
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,780
Well, even if it's an incident, it's a criminal offense such as "eating and running away", "dirty and dirty", and so on.

55
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,640
That's why we're going to have Nakagawa and Ryotsu participate in the competition.

56
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,720
Please wait, Deputy.

57
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,620
Nakagawa, anyway, if you let Ryotsu participate, the Japanese police will be ashamed of you.

58
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,160
Please leave this problem to us.

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,680
We will not do anything bad.

60
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,840
Please.

61
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,680
I never dreamed that Ryotsu would have been elected as the Japanese representative for the world's No. 1 police championship.

62
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,020
I didn't know that the reputation of the person who wrote such a death note was 100% 100%.

63
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,780
The problem is how to make Ryotsu participate.

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,140
Yes.

65
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,580
I wonder if there's anything good for you, Ohara.

66
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,400
Well, that's right.

67
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,040
Well, how about this?

68
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,360
Hmm?

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,780
If you say that you will give 100% of your reputation as a reward, you will be given a week's rest during the competition period.

70
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,500
Oh, I see.

71
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,280
Ryotsu is already using up his paid vacation this year, so he should be happy to jump on it.

72
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,280
Yeah, let's go with that.

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,360
I'll give you a hot spring trip in the meantime.

74
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,900
Oh, that's good.

75
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,920
I'll get more and more.

76
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,600
SOME CURSE

77
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,580
I heard you, you son-of-a- sad wasp fathers.

78
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,740
World's No. 1 police championship, huh?

79
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,640
This one looks interesting.

80
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,160
The president and the director won't let me participate in it.

81
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,280
Watch it.

82
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,600
Nakama-kun, you know what?

83
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,200
The Japanese representative of the World's No. 1 police championship, huh!

84
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,140
That's right.

85
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,880
Yeah, well...

86
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,560
Really? Isn't that amazing, Kei?

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,680
Well, it's just that last year's review rate was good.

88
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,920
Nakagawa-kun, do your best and win!

89
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,140
Eh? But the opponent is a great police officer from all over the world.

90
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,420
If you win, what will you get?

91
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,320
Eh?

92
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,320
If it's such a big tournament, you'll get a lot of prize money or something, won't you?

93
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,480
Yes. The prize money for winning is 100 million yen.

94
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,200
What? 100 million yen?

95
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,000
And you'll get free pasta that will allow you to use the first class of airlines from all over the world.

96
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,240
And you'll get a gold card that allows you to eat all the free meals at three-star restaurants in the world.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,760
Wow!

98
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,280
Isn't that amazing?

99
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,300
Well, it's not related to you, Ryo-chan.

100
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,020
You're the most distant police officer from the representative.

101
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,120
Shut up!

102
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,680
So, do you have any other Japanese representatives?

103
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,460
Special police officer?

104
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,500
Special police officer Kaipan Deka.

105
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,740
He's been a 100%

106
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,180
Good morning.

107
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,020
Good morning.

108
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,020
Chief, I heard about Nakagawa-kun.

109
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,640
That's amazing!

110
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,840
Nakagawa, I hope you'll do well.

111
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,940
Thank you very much.

112
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,220
And Ryo-chan, I have a good story for you.

113
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,400
Oh, for me?

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,240
Well, I didn't notice it at all, but your reputation is also 100%.

115
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,800
Huh? Ryo-chan?

116
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,600
You're just a coward and a coward.

117
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,200
That's unexpected.

118
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,380
The chief is also very surprised.

119
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,540
Well, he's happy.

120
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,780
He will give you a special prize.

121
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,200
Oh, is that the chief of that place?

122
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,280
What? Aren't you happy?

123
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,980
No, no.

124
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,060
So, what are you going to give me?

125
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,300
Well, don't be surprised.

126
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,900
It's a one-week vacation and a free hot spring experience.

127
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,220
Wow, I'm so happy.

128
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,900
How was it? Were you surprised?

129
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,840
Wait a minute, chief.

130
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,820
If your reputation is 100%,

131
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,960
you're also the world's number one police officer.

132
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,900
Don't say such nonsense.

133
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,200
What's the matter, chief?

134
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,760
Oh, nothing.

135
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,640
Well, I wanted to give you a special prize, so I told you to come to the office.

136
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,540
Come on, come on.

137
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,900
Well, I'm going.

138
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,640
Please don't be rude to the chief.

139
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,060
Say your thanks properly.

140
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,660
Yes.

141
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,820
Oh, come on.

142
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,500
"I hope you will be happy."

143
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,980
"I hope you will be happy."

144
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:09,900
"I hope you will be happy."

145
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,700
"I hope you will be happy."

146
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:10,740
"I hope you will be happy."

147
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,640
I want you to prove Kojiro's strength.

148
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,620
I'm so happy.

149
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,180
Thank you.

150
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,740
Thank you.

151
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:22,820
Thank you.

152
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,820
Ohada, Ryozu's definitely on a vacation, right?

153
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,920
Yes.

154
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,900
I went to the station yesterday.

155
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,980
I screened a video of it at the station.

156
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,180
So I don't be worried.

157
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,340
Well, then.

158
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,800
Please wait.

159
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,520
What?

160
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,320
R-Ryo-tsu!

161
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,300
Senpai?!

162
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,640
Inspector!

163
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,660
R-Ryo-tsu!

164
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,880
What are you doing?!

165
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,300
I'd like to ask you something, Inspector.

166
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
W-What is it?

167
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,740
Hey!

168
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,740
You're rude to the Inspector!

169
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,000
Didn't you go on a trip?

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,360
I was very grateful, so I went to the gold shop to get the cash back.

171
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,560
W-What?!

172
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,420
Inspector!

173
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,480
I heard that the last Japanese representative was chosen as the best in last year's census.

174
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,380
Is that true?

175
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,160
That's correct.

176
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,720
Everyone in the press!

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,320
Actually, Ryo-tsu Kankichi was also selected as the best in last year's census.

178
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,980
That's right.

179
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,340
He was selected as the best in last year's census.

180
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,180
That's right.

181
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,400
However, for some reason, I wasn't selected as the representative.

182
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,960
What the hell is going on?!

183
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,560
That's right.

184
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,020
That's right.

185
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,280
That's right.

186
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,620
Wait, Inspector Ryo-tsu.

187
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,360
The standard for selecting Japanese representatives is not only the authority.

188
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,660
You don't need to be good at shooting or fighting.

189
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,900
Stop!

190
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,480
Nakagawa.

191
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,960
Last year's police chief.

192
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,920
In the shooting competition of Kendo, what was my ranking?

193
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,100
Yes, you were the 2nd place with Mr. Saigo, who was the winner.

194
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,500
What about the national police judo championship?

195
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,140
Mr. Sakonji lost the court decision in the end of the competition, so he was the semi-winner.

196
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,080
By the way, in the kendo competition...

197
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,900
I was the winner.

198
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,160
Yes.

199
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,140
Thank you, Nakagawa.

200
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,840
Nevertheless, I wasn't selected.

201
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,740
Why is that, Inspector?

202
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,280
That's...

203
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,440
Because you were reported to be in danger.

204
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,520
I'm not in danger!

205
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,520
But, from Tonda-kun, it's true that...

206
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,000
Chief, what do you mean?

207
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,440
It's...

208
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,600
Shut up!

209
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,220
It's because you can't let a bad police officer who has written over 100 pages in the death certificate for a year enter the competition!

210
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,440
Oh! Then I will ask the executives who chose the representative,

211
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:06,000
"Did the report that you should put the number of the death certificate in the priority standard from INTERPOL end?"

212
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,860
There was no such report.

213
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,300
Even if there was no such report, you were not chosen.

214
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,500
Depending on the situation, I think I should go to INTERPOL.

215
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,880
I understand, Ryo-tsuku.

216
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,040
This is my mistake.

217
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,500
I will make you an additional entry.

218
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,180
Hmm.

219
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,500
Hmm?

220
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:25,860
Hmm?

221
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,300
Hmm?

222
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,080
Hmm?

223
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,340
Thank you very much!

224
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,820
Ah...

225
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,840
This is the worst situation.

226
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,760
He's so cool.

227
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,620
Ryo-tsu, are you going to enter the competition too?

228
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,740
This is getting interesting.

229
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,340
Let's do our best to aim for the championship.

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,780
Sure!

231
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,820
He's a big-mouthed guy.

232
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,140
Hmm...

233
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,120
We will win!

234
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,380
I'll win for sure!

235
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,580
Hmm.

236
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,300
Why do I have to go to France?

237
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,380
Hmm...

238
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,360
Shut up!

239
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,360
The next line will be,

240
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,160
"I was on a date with Nana-chan, right?"

241
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm tired of listening to you every time.

242
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
What!?

243
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,700
You had to force me to come here?

244
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,240
That's terrible!

245
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,140
Hmm...

246
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,420
Huh?

247
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,600
According to the rules of the World No. 1 Police Championship,

248
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,500
it's good for the participants to have two people as their assistants.

249
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,340
I asked for it from Mr. Volvo and Mr. Sakonji,

250
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,720
but who are the other two, Mr. Honda and Mr. Senpai?

251
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,760
I've prepared them properly.

252
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,660
An extraordinary trump card.

253
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,900
An extraordinary trump card?

254
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,860
Hehe, we'll see about that when we get there.

255
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,420
An extraordinary trump card?

256
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:56,480
An extraordinary trump card?

257
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,140
An extraordinary trump card?

258
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,000
An extraordinary trump card?

259
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,020
An extraordinary trump card?

260
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,640
An extraordinary trump card?

261
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,180
We are in the police officer spirit and in the spirit of fighting all the way.

262
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,980
What is that in the coffin, Senpai?

263
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,240
Ah, this?

264
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,300
I didn't have a Boston Bag,

265
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,120
I didn't have a bag, so I just brought it instead.

266
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,500
Even so, you don't have a nurse, do you?

267
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,140
What do you mean you can bring? You're free, don't worry.

268
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,000
Before moving to Monaco, where the first event will be held,

269
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,220
Let's introduce the Teed players of this tournament.

270
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,860
First, Italian representative Ferrari Deca.

271
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,580
Ferrari Deca, Nakagawa. I got your box.

272
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,040
That's why I brought a special putter car tuned up with Porsche in the first event race.

273
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,520
Next, Chinese representative Ramen Deca.

274
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,200
Are you a ramen man?

275
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,720
Australian representative Crocodile Deca.

276
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,700
Kenya representative Savannah who loves nature.

277
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,140
I'm a man!

278
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,740
English representative Scotch Deca.

279
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,820
American representative Manhattan Deca.

280
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,940
Russian representative Cossack Deca.

281
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,240
You surprised me, you guys.

282
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,900
Last, Japanese representative Kaipan Deca.

283
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
Hey, hey, hey.

284
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,740
There's no one here.

285
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,700
Who's that guy?

286
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,920
He's going to the opening ceremony.

287
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,760
He's late for the opening ceremony.

288
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,800
When a hate incident occurs, not just a small problem,

289
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,580
Kaipan Deca solves everything in one go.

290
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,780
One of the Japanese police chiefs, Special Prosecutor Samba-Galas,

291
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,060
Kaipan Deca is now born.

292
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,060
You're a demon!

293
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,560
The first event of the world's number one police championship is

294
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,240
a race to compete in driving technique with a putter car and a white horse

295
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,660
using the course of the F1 Monaco Grand Prix.

296
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,100
In today's race commentary, we have the Japanese police chief, Katsushika Shoyori,

297
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,600
and the chief of police, Oohara Junsa.

298
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,500
Please come in.

299
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,820
The pole position is this event's champion, Italian Ferrari Deca.

300
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,800
And the second grid is the Japanese police chief, Nakagawa Nakagawa,

301
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,560
who is driving the special Porsche putter car.

302
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,200
When chasing the criminal, he is expected to face many unexpected obstacles.

303
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,860
This race is a race that requires the police to make a quick decision

304
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,380
and to avoid the obstacles prepared on the course and to reach the goal as soon as possible.

305
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,920
It is a race that requires the police to make quick decisions and to have the appropriate driving skills.

306
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,800
Savanna Deca loves nature, and she will dare to participate in the race with a putter.

307
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,600
Oh, Ryotsu Ryoichi.

308
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,720
He has just been in the old type of putter car.

309
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,440
The Ryotsu Ryoichi is completely unsatisfied with the preparation.

310
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,700
That old type of car is not very profitable.

311
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,820
Moreover, the car is not a putter car but a taxi.

312
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,340
The top 16 people will enter the next event.

313
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,480
It is a survival race.

314
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,980
The 32 drivers will start at once.

315
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,260
Ferrari Deca and Nakagawa will do a fast dash.

316
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,220
He's going to crush the tower!

317
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,320
Oh no! What's going on?

318
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,380
The winner, Kaipan Dekka, is being pulled out one by one!

319
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,320
Huh? Kaipan, why aren't you speeding up?

320
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,960
First, let's see what everyone has done.

321
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,000
That's...

322
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:35,120
Oh no! It's an accident all of a sudden!

323
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,580
The number one candidate for this event, Ferrari Dekka, is crashing!

324
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,420
The number one candidate for this event, Ferrari Dekka, is crashing!

325
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,440
He's putting oil on the course!

326
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,200
If he wants to escape, he shouldn't be doing that!

327
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,160
Well, I don't think there's anything he can't do.

328
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,480
Phew, that was close.

329
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,300
Hoi! Hoi! Hoi! Hoi! Hoi!

330
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:14,900
Amazing!

331
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,020
Hehehe! Even if this happens, the remodeling is perfect!

332
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,500
It's a snap!

333
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,160
Oh, Senpai!

334
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,400
Nakagawa, first!

335
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,800
Hehehe! Everyone, first!

336
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,160
This is the power of the fish.

337
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,580
As expected of you, Senpai! I didn't know you were doing that kind of remodeling in such a short period of time!

338
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,740
Huh? Huh?

339
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,480
Huh?

340
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,840
Now, the players who have cleared the first obstacle are gradually increasing their speed.

341
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,820
The course is up the hill from here.

342
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,800
Oh, no!

343
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,300
Suddenly, a huge iron ball appears!

344
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,600
ARA Gigantic Thunderclap вод

345
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,500
I've made them run away!

346
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,600
If you're a policeman, you should avoid the iron ball attack of the culprit.

347
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,500
If you're an escaped criminal, you should use this iron ball.

348
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,360
Way to go, Dekka!

349
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,840
And he managed to counter the

350
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,220
And he managed to counter the

351
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,440
And he managed to counter the

352
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,180
Hey, you're not even a dog!

353
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,680
You're just a little kid!

354
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,240
You're just a little kid!

355
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:45,800
You're just a little kid!

356
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,640
Oh, you did it!

357
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,760
You did it!

358
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,760
You did it!

359
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,120
Oh, how's that?

360
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,840
Ryotsu, if you've been doing such a great job,

361
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm going to give you this!

362
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,300
I'm going to give you this!

363
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,580
I'm going to give you this!

364
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,080
I see, so that's how it was done.

365
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,720
I see, so that's how it was done.

366
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,140
I see, so that's how it was done.

367
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,480
Kaipan Deka has cleared the iron ball with his skillful driving!

368
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,720
Nakagawa and Manhattan Deka will also clear the iron ball in the same way.

369
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,400
And the other players will also clear the iron ball in the same way.

370
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,620
I see.

371
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,380
So when the criminal attacks with the iron ball,

372
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,760
they have to use this technique to avoid it, right?

373
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,840
Y-Yeah.

374
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,280
That's right.

375
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,380
That's right.

376
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,660
Now, Savanna Deka has cleared the top-of-the-line tunnel!

377
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,440
Now, Savanna Deka has cleared the top-of-the-line tunnel!

378
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
Now, Savanna Deka has cleared the top-of-the-line tunnel!

379
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,740
He cleared the hairpin!

380
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,220
Alright, now all that's left is the last corner!

381
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,700
Hey, Nakagawa! Don't get too cocky!

382
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,040
You'll still be injured!

383
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,660
Nakagawa, you're so young.

384
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,120
Oh, no! The last obstacle is the road that's going to be hit by the waves!

385
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,160
That's impossible!

386
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,140
How am I supposed to run on this course?

387
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:06,940
Huh?

388
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,460
Huh?

389
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,840
Huh?

390
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,480
Huh?

391
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,160
Huh?

392
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,500
Huh?

393
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,320
Huh?

394
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,980
Huh?

395
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,220
Huh?

396
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:12,640
Huh?

397
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,700
H-How amazing!

398
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,420
Huh?

399
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,500
Huh?

400
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,040
Hey, look! Just as I thought!

401
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,460
Look at this!

402
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,480
Click!

403
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,260
Click!

404
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,820
Click!

405
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,540
Nakagawa, you're the best!

406
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,840
Nakagawa, you're the best!

407
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:24,900
Nakagawa, you're the best!

408
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,280
Nakagawa, you're the best!

409
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,460
Nakagawa, you're the best!

410
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,340
How's that? Did you see that?

411
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,060
How's that? Did you see that?

412
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,240
How's that?

413
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,600
This only seems like a breakthrough.

414
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:30,700
All right!

415
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:32,900
There!

416
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,960
Big Kaipan!

417
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,860
Big Kaipan!

418
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:38,880
Big Kaipan!

419
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,560
H-How amazing! Big Kaipan!

420
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,340
All right! Me too!

421
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,460
The guy who's been playing is really good!

422
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,860
Japan's representative Kaipan Dekka is now at the top!

423
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,140
The 2nd one is Kenya's representative Savannah Dekka!

424
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,360
Next up is Japan's representative Ryotsu Nakakawa!

425
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,140
They're in the goal one after another!

426
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,920
As expected, SEED's goal is almost a goal, but...

427
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,500
Huh?

428
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,780
Japan's representative Manhattan Dekka is standing in front of the course!

429
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,900
H-How forceful!

430
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,140
Manhattan Dekka!

431
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,380
Let's see if it's SEED's will!

432
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,640
He's in the goal with a pretty rough technique!

433
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,660
In the end, only 12 people made it to the goal!

434
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,340
He's telling us how tough this race was!

435
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,920
The match is just beginning!

436
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,860
I'm going to get 100 million yen for sure!

437
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,080
Kaipan Dekka gets 100 points!

438
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,660
Now for the world's number one police championship!

439
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,620
The second match is here, at the Naska Park in South America.

440
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,620
The 12 people who won the first match are going to be fighting.

441
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,400
First up is the champion of the first match, Kaipan Dekka!

442
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,560
With 100 points for the first round!

443
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,000
Next up is Japan's representative Ryotsu Nakakawa!

444
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,120
"Kaipan Dekka"

445
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,680
Ready?

446
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,360
Ryotsu Nakakawa! 95 points!

447
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,900
Ah, I missed a little.

448
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,680
Ryotsu Nakakawa wins!

449
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,920
He finished with 95 points!

450
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,220
Hey! What are you doing?

451
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,500
Oh, Manhattan Dekka!

452
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,340
He's out of Ryotsu Nakakawa's way!

453
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,940
Huh? What's with that gun?

454
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,900
It's the latest type of laser gun that the FBI has jointly developed with NASA!

455
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,060
There's no way you can win!

456
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:37,580
All you have to do is look through the target through the goggles, and the computer will process everything and automatically fire the laser!

457
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,180
What?!

458
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,220
Oh!

459
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,600
That's amazing!

460
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,260
Now, start it up!

461
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,640
Wait a minute!

462
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,000
What?

463
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,880
Isn't this kind of computer-involved gun a crime?

464
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,120
If it's a self-made gun, then it's a rule that doesn't matter. It's not a crime!

465
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,420
Don't you have any pride as a policeman?

466
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,560
Then, you're not the one using the gun, but the gun is the one using you!

467
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,020
Ryotsu is right about that.

468
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,180
Yeah. This competition is about the skill of the gun, not the performance of the gun.

469
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,880
As long as there's no violation of the rules, there's no problem!

470
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,500
I'm going to continue the competition!

471
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,960
Get out of my way!

472
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:23,800
Ow!

473
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,080
Now, start it up!

474
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,140
Damn it. Now that it's like this...

475
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,480
Um, I was making a mistake.

476
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,920
Ah, excuse me for a moment.

477
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,860
Yes, hello?

478
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,880
What's the matter?

479
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,600
I called the Manhattan department.

480
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,500
What?

481
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:48,660
What?

482
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,940
The Manhattan department! The Manhattan department!

483
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,740
Hm?

484
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,400
There's a phone in the room where we're recording.

485
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,220
What's with this time?

486
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,220
Excuse me.

487
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:02,800
Please.

488
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,220
Ah, I'm the Manhattan department of the New York District Court.

489
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,480
What?

490
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,420
Three ramen and three dumplings?

491
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,760
I'm not a Chinese restaurant!

492
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,820
It's a wrong number.

493
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,000
I see.

494
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,360
Hmm.

495
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,540
Did you do something?

496
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,540
I didn't do anything.

497
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,900
Now, start!

498
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,100
What?

499
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,660
The data is falling apart!

500
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:39,940
Let's get out of here!

501
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,880
Oh my goodness!

502
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,480
What kind of accident is this in Manhattan?

503
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,320
He suddenly left!

504
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,160
He's retired!

505
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,580
I knew it. You did something.

506
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,000
No, I didn't do anything.

507
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,420
Even I want to get rid of him as soon as possible.

508
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,980
I'll cover my eyes.

509
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,020
That's why I said you didn't do anything.

510
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,560
You didn't do anything.

511
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,140
Actually, at that time...

512
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,940
Mr. Manhattan! Mr. Manhattan!

513
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,000
What's this at a time like this?

514
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,760
I thought this might happen, so I made it into an electric cube.

515
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,620
This computer virus generation device.

516
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,540
Um, please give me three ramen and three dumplings.

517
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,460
What a big helping hand.

518
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,100
Noooooooo!

519
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,640
Take this!

520
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,800
Nakagawa's assistant, Borubo Saigo's brilliant shooting skills canシルク!

521
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,860
*Push, push*

522
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,240
*Push, push*

523
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,660
*Rее*

524
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,920
*Push, push*

525
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,520
*Push, push*

526
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,020
*Push, push*

527
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,900
Crocodile Deka 98 points

528
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,780

Scotch Deka 99 points

531
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,460
After the second match, the third match has 8 top players

532
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,420
Kaipan Deka, Nakagawa

533
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,680
Savannah Deka, Scotch Deka

534
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,920
Crocodile Deka, Ramen Deka

535
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,420
Cossack Deka, Ryotsu Deka

536
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,580
In any case, the winning candidate, Mahattan Deka, suddenly retired

537
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,540
I wonder what caused it

538
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,680
Chobari

539
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,940
Nakagawa and his assistant Sakonji used the third match to break through the competition

540
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,720
Crocodile Deka has a wonderful backdrop

541
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,160
He broke through the Savannah Deka with a backdrop

542
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,860
Ryotsu is good at Kendo and attacks fiercely

543
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,820
Ramen Deka is on the defensive

544
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,760
3 minutes have passed

545
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,320
Hey, wait a minute

546
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,700
You did it, Arun

547
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,960
What is it?

548
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,260
Here it comes

549
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,780
Arn

550
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,420
What?

551
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:39,800
What?

552
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,920
I'm not going to lose my energy if I eat ramen

553
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,060
Arn

554
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,360
Arn

555
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:44,660
Arn

556
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,000
Arn

557
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,380
Arn

558
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:46,820
Arn

559
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,120
Arn

560
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,660
Arn

561
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:47,680
Arn

562
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,340
Arn

563
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,360
Arn

564
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,460
Arn

565
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,140
Arn

566
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,140
Arn

567
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,280
Arn

568
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,360
Arn

569
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,680
Arn

570
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:03,960
Arn

571
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,220
Arn

572
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,800
Arn

573
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,320
Arn

574
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,360
Arn

575
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:06,600
Arn

576
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:16,200
Kono

577
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,320
Kono

578
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,280
Kono

579
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,400
Kono

580
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,120
Kono

581
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,820
the semi-finals!

582
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,520
If you really put in the effort, you'll become superhuman!

583
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,340
Now, the final match is between Japan's Kaipan Deka and

584
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,940
England's Scotch Deka!

585
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,440
Who will remain in the semi-finals?!

586
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,400
Here I go!

587
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,260
Golden Claw!

588
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,820
It's decided in an instant!

589
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,260
Kaipan Deka wins!

590
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,400
Oh, that again?

591
00:30:59,400 --> 00:30:59,480
That again?

592
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,620
Oh, crazy!

593
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,180
Now, the world's number one police championship!

594
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,540
The semi-finals are held in the South Pole,

595
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,560
in a five-hour-long penguin-spawn race!

596
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,800
The rules are simple!

597
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,460
If the penguin robot that runs away succeeds in a five-hour-long spawning race,

598
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,940
it can advance to the final round!

599
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,100
What? That's easy!

600
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,900
A-Action!

601
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,500
However!

602
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,840
The penguin robot will be close to everyone within a radius of 30 meters,

603
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,060
and when it comes closer, the penguin automatically turns around!

604
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,140
The penguin will fail if it is recognized by the penguin!

605
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,860
I, as its assistant, will accompany the Kangaroo Deka!

606
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,180
Golgol!

607
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,380
I'll go with Honda, too!

608
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,920
S-S-S-S-Cold!

609
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,480
On the second and third matches, Nakagawa has used every of his secret members.

610
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,880
I understand. I'll do this alone.

611
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,280
Kaipan Deka, what will you do with the secret members?

612
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,140
I may call them later, but I'll leave them alone for now.

613
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,220
All right, the 5-hour endurance penguin beauty race starts!

614
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,100
Run away!

615
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,300
Run!

616
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,740
The players will follow the respective Penguin robots.

617
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,820
The cold is more severe than I expected.

618
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,680
My body is freezing.

619
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,660
Action!

620
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,200
The next day.

621
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,520
Nakagawa has failed.

622
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,040
Oh no!

623
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,480
Nakagawa has retired in a hurry!

624
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,120
Nakagawa was the only one who was a good son of the Japanese police.

625
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,820
We won't let you escape!

626
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,820
I'll show you the strength of the Australian

627
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,720
fishing duo!

628
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,780
Go, Kangaroo Deco!

629
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,200
Kangaroo!

630
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,280
I'll finish you off!

631
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,080
Now, I'll show you what I can do!

632
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,100
Let's chase the Penguin!

633
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,780
Kangaroo!

634
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,600
Crocodile Deco!

635
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,940
You're disqualified for losing sight of the Penguin!

636
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,200
Damn it!

637
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,180
That red penguin!

638
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,320
What a speed!

639
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,840
If you let him go any further, he'll lose sight of you!

640
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,880
Honda!

641
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,580
Change your plan!

642
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:03,760
What?

643
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,760
Oh, no!

644
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

645
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,800
You can't do that.

646
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,580
I've prepared a good one for you!

647
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,040
Here you go!

648
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:11,960
Hey, Honda!

649
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,780
Hey, dog!

650
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,120
Don't run around like that!

651
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,540
If you lose sight of the Penguin, you'll be in trouble!

652
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,740
Now, we can enter the final without a doubt!

653
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,980
Oh, no!

654
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,820
Oh, no!

655
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,880
You are dead!

656
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:39,900
Really?

657
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:40,360
Ah-ha-ha!

658
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,120
Yes, it is!

659
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,260
We did it!

660
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,320
We did it!

661
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,480
We did it!

662
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,880
We made it!

663
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,240
We found it!

664
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,760
So manyć more to go!

665
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:55,260
Ah, I'm playing sperms.

666
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,300
The mark doesn't make it!

667
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,680
Huh?

668
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,260
There!

669
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,120
You saved me, Dolphindecca.

670
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,700
Now that I'm here, it's all good.

671
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,920
Now, the 5-hour endurance penguin light race is finally over!

672
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,720
Only 5 seconds left until the end!

673
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,020
3, 2, 1!

674
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,660
Goal!

675
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,540
Yay! We did it!

676
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,260
Ryotsu from Japan has successfully advanced to the final round!

677
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,960
Ah, I'm left behind again.

678
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,800
In addition, according to the information we received just now,

679
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,340
the Japanese seed, Kaipan Deka, borrowed the help of his assistant, Dolphindecca,

680
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,040
and successfully completed the goal!

681
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,120
What?!

682
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,620
That means the final round is...

683
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,200
R-Ryotsu and Kaipan Deka...

684
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,760
Right...

685
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,220
These two are the top-ranked teams

686
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,080
of the super-awful Japanese gang

687
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,320
and were trapped in the city 3 days ago!

688
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,920
The final round of the World's No.1 Police Championship...

689
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,540
The final round is decided by...

690
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,000
...these two super-awful gang members,

691
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,080
who will be arrested within 12 hours from now!

692
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,900
I see, looks interesting.

693
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,180
I don't mind helping, but...

694
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,060
Why would we have to dress like this?

695
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,420
If we talk about the final round of this event,

696
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,000
maybe there are also taxis on the roof of a skyscraper!

697
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,200
Maybe there are taxis on the roof of a skyscraper!

698
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,480
It's like an Ultra Quiz.

699
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,340
By the way, if we can arrest those two, we'll get 100 million yen in prize money, right?

700
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,580
Of course! Please look behind you!

701
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,200
Hm?

702
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,680
Oh, wow! 100 million yen in cash!

703
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,840
I get it.

704
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,860
You're really into prize money.

705
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,220
What are you going to use 100 million yen for?

706
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,340
I'm going to buy the same model as the one I'm wearing for the rest of my life.

707
00:36:59,340 --> 00:36:59,960
Buy it yourself.

708
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,460
Do whatever you want.

709
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,660
Are you two ready?

710
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,040
Hm? Wait a minute.

711
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,400
The only clue to the culprit is that face.

712
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,360
Huh? Is that so?

713
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,260
What? That's all you need.

714
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,040
Hahaha!

715
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,320
If you can't get it, you can get off.

716
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,720
What did you say?

717
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,680
Hmm...

718
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,800
It seems like it's time to give out the last trump card.

719
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,600
Here you go.

720
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,500
The last trump card?

721
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,080
Ryochi,

722
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,600
what are you going to give out?

723
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,840
Now, it's your turn!

724
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,340
Oh!

725
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,720
Mr. Sunflowers!

726
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,900
Hey, Sunflowers! Get up!

727
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,840
Get up!

728
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,340
L-Let me sleep a little longer.

729
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,280
Huh? Get up!

730
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,160
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

731
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,460
Hm?

732
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,220
Huh?

733
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,680
R-Ryochi, I feel like I'm not sleeping enough.

734
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,120
How old are you?

735
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,060
I'm in the year of the Olympic Games, so it's definitely 2004.

736
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,160
I'm just doing the women's marathon right now.

737
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,240
Shinoko, the Japanese woman, came to the main stadium as the top.

738
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,260
Please listen to this statement.

739
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,440
Until the gold medal in two consecutive competitions, the end is after.

740
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,900
I heard this voice somewhere.

741
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,780
Do your best!

742
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,320
Huh? That's a misunderstanding.

743
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
You're just awake and you're just standing there.

744
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,680
But more importantly, you should get to work.

745
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,460
Huh?

746
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,600
Mr. Ryochi, he's another help.

747
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:26,700
Are you a assistant?

748
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,040
That's right!

749
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,780
Huh?

750
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:29,840
Huh?

751
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,580
Huh?

752
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:30,740
Huh?

753
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,620
Where are they now?

754
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,100
Use your supernatural powers to tell me.

755
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,900
I want to drink hot coffee.

756
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,020
What?

757
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,480
You only work once every four years, but you're going to work for a lot of money.

758
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,960
But when my head is empty, nothing comes to mind.

759
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,860
Oh, my God.

760
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,000
Huh?

761
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:49,840
Look!

762
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,080
A beautiful bunny girl is looking forward to your supernatural powers.

763
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:54,560
Huh?

764
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,160
I see that you are very motivated.

765
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,620
What?

766
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,480
That's right, I like to do it.

767
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,000
If you take a little train, you can be advisable, and if you have time, you can choose to run with it.

768
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,940
Huh?

769
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,900
Oh, I have something.

770
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,560
I'm sure that I can help you.

771
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,080
Let's go.

772
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,160
Look.

773
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,480
But this is not the bell that you used.

774
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,940
Super special sign.

775
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,160
If you get caught up in big trouble, it's going to work.

776
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,200
That's why I want to apologize.

777
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,380
No!

778
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,560
Let's go home.

779
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,500
Let me go!

780
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,720
What are they doing?

781
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,000
There's something on the roof over there.

782
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,280
What?

783
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,880
On the roof over there,

784
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,960
there's a World No.1 Gang Championship.

785
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,300
What?

786
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,480
A lot of bad guys are gathering.

787
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,360
And the prize money is double the amount of this.

788
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,820
So, the gang members were doing the same thing.

789
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,320
So, the culprit is in there.

790
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,680
Okay, we should be quick then.

791
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,260
Yeah.

792
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,260
Wait.

793
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,520
The culprit is closer.

794
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,000
What?

795
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,140
Hey, help me.

796
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,400
Hey, chief.

797
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,100
What are you doing here?

798
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,460
And you're naked.

799
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,520
I came here to check.

800
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,200
I thought you were hit in the head by someone and fainted.

801
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,560
Then, who is the chief here?

802
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,640
Don't move!

803
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,040
Chief!

804
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,540
When did you...

805
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,320
Who are you?

806
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,260
You're a criminal!

807
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:49,960
Did you switch with the chief?

808
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,840
I didn't realize it until now.

809
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,860
Hey, Bunny Girl.

810
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,780
Bring me the 1 billion dollar Duralumin case.

811
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,420
Yes, sir.

812
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,480
Hurry up!

813
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,560
Yes, sir.

814
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,600
Wait!

815
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,620
Chief!

816
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
You're another criminal!

817
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,420
This final battle is about taking your prize money.

818
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,280
I'll take this 1 billion dollar!

819
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,680
Damn it!

820
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,020
If we lose the prize money, there's no point in fighting.

821
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,560
I'll take it back.

822
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,140
Let's make it a big deal.

823
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,140
Let's help each other and take the prize money back.

824
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,820
Sounds good.

825
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,340
Hey, I'll use my second assistant.

826
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,560
Yes, sir.

827
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,040
Here you are.

828
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
I'll ask the principal to support me.

829
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:52,880
What?

830
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,400
I'm a little bit worried.

831
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,980
I'm a little bit worried.

832
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,620
I'm a little bit worried.

833
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:08,920
I'm muitos worried.

834
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:09,660
Do you have any ideas?

835
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,020
What?

836
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,860
Well, the old

837
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,380
man's going to

838
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,840
You can't do it. You do it!

839
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,760
If I'm the assistant of the assistant, there's no point in being the assistant.

840
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,880
If you're not going to do it, I'll go home!

841
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,860
I got it! I'll do it! I'll do it!

842
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,760
Not just a beautiful transformation!

843
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,460
Put the energy of the moon on your back!

844
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,780
The stick of justice, the darkness of the sky!

845
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,800
If it's that kind of time, leave it to me!

846
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,640
Master of the Moonlight, Gekkon Deka, has arrived!

847
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,400
Me too, Venus Deka!

848
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,400
If it's like this, I'll burn you!

849
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,140
W-What's with them?

850
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,960
Z-Za...

851
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,400
Leave the machine guns to me!

852
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,580
Take this, you gangsters!

853
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,840
I don't need that kind of machine gun!

854
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,480
H-Hey!

855
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,000
Don't be so funny!

856
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:37,840
I'll just follow...

857
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,160
Z-Za!

858
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:38,220
Z-Za...

859
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,880
I don't need to kill anything!

860
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,480
Listen!

861
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,800
When the sun sets,

862
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:45,380
you'll be with us.

863
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,300
Let's go home, all of us!

864
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,200
What the hell is going on?

865
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:47,420
Don't!

866
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:47,780
It's dangerous!

867
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,740
Hey, hey, hey! Remember what we did earlier!

868
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,460
Alright, Ryotsu! Let's transform!

869
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,560
What? At a time like this?

870
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,440
Make up! Moonlight Power!

871
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,340
Let me explain myself here!

872
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,060
By transforming to Ocho-Ogujin, the Moonlight Deity,

873
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,860
you can throw an incredible Vanguard Serve!

874
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,000
Ball, you say?!

875
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,760
Let's go, Hiromi!

876
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,460
Are you Hiromi?!

877
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:41,520
Oh! We're going down to Shinjuku Fishing Park!

878
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,080
Hosted by Mano Ocho-Og迷

879
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,060
Whoa! It crashed down!

880
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,200
It's the Egg Fishing Istagram!

881
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,380
Senpai!

882
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,040
R-Ryotsu...

883
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,480
Senpai?!

884
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,300
I'm glad you're all right.

885
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,300
I did it!

886
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,900
How was that?

887
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,180
Two people were arrested and

888
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,000
they took back 100 million yen!

889
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,520
Senpai...

890
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,660
The winner is the Japanese representative,

891
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,980
Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

892
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,500
I did it!

893
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,100
Congratulations!

894
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,140
Senpai, congratulations!

895
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,180
Ryo-tsu!

896
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,720
I can't believe he's still alive.

897
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,380
It's a great achievement.

898
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,840
I'm the loser.

899
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,940
Now, let's go to the Special Investigation Department.

900
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,980
All right, I'll do it even if it's for three years.

901
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,140
That's a good idea.

902
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,580
So, I will award this.

903
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,520
On April 6, 2003,

904
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,280
the Interpol Director General.

905
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,080
2003?

906
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,060
Huh?

907
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:18,840
Oh!

908
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,340
Oh, Higurashi!

909
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:21,820
You're not even old enough to go to the Olympics,

910
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,480
but you're still making me wait.

911
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,180
W-W-Wait! Calm down, Higurashi!

912
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,380
I won't do it again!

913
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,860
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

914
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,720
Not yet!

915
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,760
Is this the place?

916
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:49,860
Superb!

917
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,940
It's a place...

918
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:56,960
Where are they?

919
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,440
It's rain...

920
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,660
Well, let's get changed.

921
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,840
What is it?

922
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,600
I heard it's raining here~

923
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:15,260
Ah, it's just cold.

924
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,820
It's a big deal.

925
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,600
Ryotsu, you can't make a profit with 100 million yen.

926
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,840
Am I making a profit?

927
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,900
Of course.

928
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,560
No way.

929
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,280
I'm getting sleepy. Good night.

930
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:33,820
What?

931
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,780
I can't make a profit with 100 million yen.

932
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,260
I like historical fiction.

933
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,280
Why?

934
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:11,220
The butterfly's wings are so small.

935
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,680
Why?

936
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,640
When riding a motorcycle,

937
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,400
I change my personality.

938
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,540
Why?

939
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,960
I've only slept in the sun for four years.

940
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,020
Why?

941
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,180
Nakagawa loves both.

942
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:33,260
Why?

943
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,220
♪ I don't lend money to Reiko-san, but ♪

944
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,880
