1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,620
Precious

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,700
Heat the room when watching TV and look out the window

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,980
Come to me who doesn't have money

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,980
Even though I don't have money, I get worried

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:35,920
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,900
They'll get better eventually

7
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,080
Come to me, you jobless one

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but don't worry

9
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,420
Look, the red clouds are burning

10
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,880
Look, the red clouds are burning

11
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,440
Look, the red clouds are burning

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,720
They'll get better eventually

13
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,600
You know it, right?

14
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,140
You know it, right?

15
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,760
If you know it, then keep quiet and follow me!

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,280
If you know it, then keep quiet and follow me!

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,400
I'll help you stop it!

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,760
Dr. Joseph's

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,740
Dr. Joseph's

20
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,760
Dr. Joseph's

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,820
Dr. Joseph's

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,140
Dr. Joseph's

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,640
Dr. Joseph's

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,320
Dr. Joseph's

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,360
I've eaten only the little I've got

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,700
I've held onto the bloody Depois

27
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,740
I'll help you out

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,960
There's no trash in the bucket.

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,320
I wonder if someone's coming.

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,340
If possible, a monk.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,200
Next, Nakagawa, Reiko,

32
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,100
food,

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,000
money,

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,440
money!

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,760
Miss!

36
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,220
What?

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,440
The chief?

38
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,620
Chief!

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,560
Help in front of the building?

40
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,080
That's right. Deliver some food.

41
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,200
If something happens, help me.

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,160
Wait.

43
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,660
The front of the building is

44
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,360
Kohaku mochi and ohineri.

45
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,740
It's money, not coins.

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,060
Also,

47
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,300
Furumai sake and food.

48
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,580
Yay!

49
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,300
Money and food, bonus!

50
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,940
What?

51
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,800
No,

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,580
the chief of Ryotsu,

53
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,080
will go to celebrate the front of the building.

54
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:43,940
Yes.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,480
Replace the celebration.

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,320
I'll pay later.

57
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,300
What?

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,220
You don't have money?

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,680
Oh, dear.

60
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,940
What kind of life do you have?

61
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,020
I'm going.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,840
Listen.

63
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,760
Two sake for the celebration.

64
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,480
A man's name tag.

65
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,260
Got it?

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,380
Yes.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You only give me two coins.

68
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,660
You're stingy.

69
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,240
I'm hungry again.

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm getting dizzy.

71
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,680
Two coins for sake.

72
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,700
I can't use this.

73
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,280
No.

74
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,420
I'm hungry.

75
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,660
What is this?

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,600
I say,

77
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,440
but I split it.

78
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,060
I'm not afraid of my survival instinct.

79
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,640
I...

80
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,920
Oh, tea.

81
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,680
Added croquette and curry rice.

82
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,180
And potato salad and stir-fried vegetables.

83
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,620
Yes.

84
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,160
I ate.

85
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,540
Ouch!

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,360
Ah! The money I borrowed from the chief!

87
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,840
I can't help it now.

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,180
Well, I'll manage.

89
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,720
It's a free meal and free sake.

90
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,480
Here's your sake.

91
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,280
Excuse me, please leave it there.

92
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,560
Oh, what a beautiful house!

93
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,660
Thanks to you, my house has finally become popular.

94
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,380
Look at this pillar. It's the best firewood.

95
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,000
It's my 10-year-old dream house.

96
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,640
No, that's really good.

97
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,000
I also have a reason to celebrate.

98
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,980
Ryo!

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, yes.

100
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,860
This is from my chief.

101
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,760
My chief is very kind.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,460
He only gives me a little money.

103
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,520
That's all.

104
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,100
I can't buy it.

105
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,380
No, I'm sorry for being so polite.

106
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,280
Well, as you can see, there are many people today.

107
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,760
I'm sorry for being so rude.

108
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,360
Oh, it's okay.

109
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,480
Are you still building?

110
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,160
That's the end.

111
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,020
It's just finished.

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,840
It's a pity.

113
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,940
No, it's not.

114
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,080
I came here because I was looking forward to it.

115
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,700
Let's do it again.

116
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Are you serious?

117
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,960
I'll go home as soon as the building is finished.

118
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,120
I'll go home as soon as the building is finished.

119
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,380
You're right.

120
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,420
I'll go home.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,480
Are you going to do the building again?

122
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,200
Please.

123
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,680
Just a little bit because it's just a shape.

124
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,760
Everyone is already hungry.

125
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,660
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ryo.

126
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,380
I'll start.

127
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,040
I've been waiting.

128
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,620
Oh, Ryo.

129
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,580
Were you here?

130
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,900
I'm here to look at the building.

131
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,100
Do you cook?

132
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,480
Of course.

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
Do you drink?

134
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,960
Of course.

135
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,120
I'm surprised.

136
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,100
Now I'm going to celebrate Yamamoto's new home and start building.

137
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,260
I've been waiting for you.

138
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,460
Hurry up and turn over.

139
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,040
Yes, sir.

140
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,600
Yes, sir.

141
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,840
Yes, sir.

142
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,280
Just a little bit.

143
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I did it.

144
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm fine.

145
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm fine.

146
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,180
Yes, sir.

147
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,680
Yes, sir.

148
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,240
Yes, sir.

149
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,340
Yes, sir.

150
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:04,980
I'll do it over there.

151
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,060
Yes, sir.

152
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,560
Sorry.

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Yes, sir.

154
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,620
I'd rather be fine.

155
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,080
I would rather be healthy.

156
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,560
That's right!

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,060
That's right!

158
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,720
I did it!

159
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,740
I'm a 100 years old man!

160
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,500
Ouch!

161
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,580
Who built a pillar in this place?

162
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,540
Please make the center of Ryo's place.

163
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,540
The house will be destroyed.

164
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,100
That's right.

165
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,200
That's right!

166
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,740
I wonder why it's raining all over my place.

167
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,220
It's raining all over my place.

168
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,220
Hello, everyone.

169
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,540
I'm done with the seats.

170
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,420
All right.

171
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,480
A lot of food.

172
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,620
Huh?

173
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,860
They're all gone.

174
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,080
I see.

175
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:54,920
It's time for celebration.

176
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,920
I'm so happy that I'm exercising.

177
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,240
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,060
Please give me a seat.

179
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,060
Yes!

180
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,720
It's sushi.

181
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,880
Ryo.

182
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,340
You said you'd go home after the celebration.

183
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,060
I don't remember anything.

184
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Well, that's all right.

185
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,700
Today is a happy day.

186
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,480
Don't make a mess.

187
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,640
I don't care.

188
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll have one of each.

189
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,400
You're a good eater.

190
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,220
Come on, Nomine.

191
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,120
Do it more.

192
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,640
All right.

193
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:31,980
Here.

194
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,340
Wait.

195
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,800
Cheers.

196
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,080
Thanks, Tom.

197
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,860
Thank you very much.

198
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,720
Cheers!

199
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,000
Cheers!

200
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,580
Cheers!

201
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,880
Oh, no.

202
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,080
He's the best full drown.

203
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,100
It's fine.

204
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,560
It can't be wrong.

205
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,720
Good for you.

206
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,180
If you say so.

207
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,460
It's just like cooking.

208
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,880
Yes yes, you're right.

209
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm doing this.

210
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,960
Oh no, hide Sakadaru!

211
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,660
Eh? No matter how many people there are, two is enough.

212
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,180
Hey, sorry, I came to get some alcohol.

213
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,880
-Ik! -Here you go.

214
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,720
Ah, it's troublesome to get this one.

215
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,400
Look, he's different from other people.

216
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,660
-That person is... -Wait, this...

217
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,500
-Ah? -Ah...

218
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,060
-It's a Disney drink. -You too, my friend.

219
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,720
You're with your friend?

220
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,520
-Where are you going? -My friend, I'm going back to work tomorrow, so it's about time.

221
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,040
What? You're drinking something that's worth drinking, so don't interrupt me!

222
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,220
I'm sorry.

223
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm totally drunk.

224
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,240
When comrades get drunk, they don't know what to do.

225
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,280
No way!

226
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,540
You're a sick person, Ryo-san.

227
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,360
Yeah.

228
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,480
I'm sorry to make you think about what to do, but it's troublesome.

229
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,580
Yeah.

230
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,220
Let's celebrate the 7th world cup!

231
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,720
Cheers!

232
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,000
Here it comes.

233
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,960
It's very dynamic.

234
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,420
Eh? What?

235
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:21,940
What?

236
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,180
*stab*

237
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,160
AAAAHHHHHHH!!!

238
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,580
*stab*

239
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:27,620
*stab*

240
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:27,660
Tch!

241
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,880
Toshio, you're pretty good at this.

242
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,500
*stab*

243
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,840
You still can do this one!

244
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,140
*stab*

245
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,020
Gah, that's a little too much!

246
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,880
*stab*

247
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,120
*stab*

248
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,860
*stab*

249
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,220
*stab*

250
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,520
*stab*

251
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,500
*stab*

252
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,600
Why are there many pillars here?

253
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,400
It's a nuisance!

254
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,180
There are too many pillars in this house.

255
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,740
Yeah.

256
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,860
Just one on every four corners of the house is plenty.

257
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,660
You're right.

258
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,760
*stab*

259
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:50,940
Okay.

260
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,080
*stab*

261
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,640
Here I come!

262
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,440
What are you doing?!

263
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,240
Hey, what are you doing in this place?!

264
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,220
P-Please stop!

265
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,440
Hey, you can leave the house to the carpenter!

266
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,280
Can I leave it to him?!

267
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,400
This place is in the way, too!

268
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,460
Shall we go?

269
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,380
This way, too!

270
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,120
Yes!

271
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,240
This guy, too!

272
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,200
P-Please stop!

273
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,000
Please stop, sir!

274
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,300
What are you going to do if you destroy the house?!

275
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,920
What?

276
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,700
Stop!

277
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
You guys, get out of here!

278
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,140
Oh, sir...

279
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,920
Okay, okay, don't be so violent.

280
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,200
What?

281
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,800
It's just a chaos!

282
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,740
You stringy bums!

283
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,800
Stop, sir!

284
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,040
Please stop, Zoro!

285
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,120
You coming!

286
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,720
My home, my sweat and tears, my home is the end of the world!

287
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,460
Idiots!

288
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,520
Ouch, don't shout so loud, chief. It's a double.

289
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,260
Of course. I'm going crazy.

290
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,720
You know, Yamamoto-san's home, you take responsibility and rebuild it.

291
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,600
Got it?

292
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,340
Yes, I got it.

293
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,640
Terai, buy me a cup of sake.

294
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,020
It's a great sake. It's the best to refresh.

295
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,460
That's not good!

296
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,380
Listen, Ryotsu. You're a nuisance to people.

297
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:45,440
What?

298
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,360
You've caused trouble. You have to at least pay for it.

299
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,460
I know. So I'm going home.

300
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,740
That's right. But it's not enough.

301
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,340
What?

302
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,260
You have to reflect.

303
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,840
Yes, I reflect.

304
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,960
It's sake. No alcohol. No drinking.

305
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,180
What? No way!

306
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,580
No way or nothing.

307
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,900
I'm going to take responsibility for your director's

308
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,320
"Fuuki-todoki" and I'm going to ban you from drinking.

309
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,120
No way! What's going to stay if I take sake? No way!

310
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,980
If it's no good, it's no good.

311
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,220
I'm going to ban all kinds of sake for a week.

312
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,020
Listen, Nakagawa, Reiko, Terai.

313
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,080
If you find Ryotsu drinking for a week, you can take a fine for it.

314
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,700
A glass of beer, a glass of sake, a glass of chocolate, a glass of anything costs 10,000 yen.

315
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,420
What? 10,000 yen?

316
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,620
Sir, I don't have money.

317
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,340
It's okay. You can cut off the fine and get paid.

318
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,260
No way.

319
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:42,900
No way.

320
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:50,500
A glass of beer, a glass of sake, a glass of sake, a glass of sake, a glass of sake.

321
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,140
Well, chief.

322
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,560
I'm getting a lot of drinking signs today.

323
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,560
Call me.

324
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,420
Call me.

325
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,660
No way.

326
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,840
I don't have money either.

327
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,400
The chief took all the drinks.

328
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,440
Okay.

329
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,600
If I close my eyes and walk, I can't see the sign.

330
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,220
Ouch!

331
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,300
Ouch!

332
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,360
Ouch!

333
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,580
No.

334
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,620
I can't walk around here if I close my eyes.

335
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,180
Huh?

336
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,060
Oh, it's sake!

337
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,120
Hehehe.

338
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,940
Hehehe.

339
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,080
I'll have a cup if you collect what you have left.

340
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,400
Hehehe.

341
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,300
Ryo-tsu!

342
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,400
Hmm?

343
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:52,800
Hmm?

344
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,840
I told you not to drink sake!

345
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,560
Ah!

346
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
C-Consolidation!

347
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,500
It's you.

348
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,600
I'm sure you're thinking of drinking sake even with this complicated means.

349
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,460
I thought I'd try to get drunk with this method.

350
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,500
You did, didn't you?

351
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,200
From now on, I'll send you to Ryo every day.

352
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,080
Yes, yes. It's hard to do.

353
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,280
"Skatt Soukai Kandei Amakuchi"

354
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,060
"The Master Shimobashiro"

355
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,880
"The Man's Sixth Sense"

356
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,900
Damn, why do you always do the alcohol commercial?

357
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,680
Is Ryotsu here?

358
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,400
What's with that happy face, Sakonji?

359
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,440
I got a new fighting game. Come to my room.

360
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,600
It's in, it's in.

361
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,000
It's pretty hot.

362
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,680
It's fine, it's fine. Sit down.

363
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,740
I'm going to change the stove this season.

364
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,100
I'm a little cold.

365
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,520
I'll get you a hot carpet.

366
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,020
I'm a little cold.

367
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,100
I'll get you a kotatsu.

368
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
It's a game, a game. Choose a character.

369
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,480
I did it! I won!

370
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,980
Shut up. If you weren't sweating, I would have won.

371
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,060
But it's hot. It's like a sauna.

372
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,720
Your throat is dry, right?

373
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,180
Here.

374
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:36,060
Here, Ryotsu.

375
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,820
If it's this hot, beer is the best.

376
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,620
No way!

377
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,560
Sakonji, you!

378
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,220
You're trying to trap me and get me into trouble!

379
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,380
I don't know.

380
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:10,620
You're not the only one here.

381
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,560
Here's a beer for you, too.

382
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,620
A beer?

383
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,140
You're welcome.

384
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,940
Cheers!

385
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,860
Cheers!

386
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,320
Game...

387
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,220
Beer...

388
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,580
Damn it! I'm gonna lose!

389
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,580
I lost again!

390
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,880
Senior!

391
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,780
Senior!

392
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,460
I was passing by the can of beer with a pachinko...

393
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,860
You can't do that to me!

394
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,080
You can't do that to me!

395
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,220
You can't do that to me!

396
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,400
Senior...

397
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,940
Both of you...

398
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,640
Both of you...

399
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,920
I won't believe you for a week!

400
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,940
I won't believe you for a week!

401
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,600
Ryo!

402
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,840
Ryo!

403
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,000
Ryo!

404
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,360
Come here!

405
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,400
What? Cherry blossoms?

406
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,720
These are cherry blossoms.

407
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,260
It's the best time to see them.

408
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,840
Well, I thought you were fooled,

409
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,840
so come here.

410
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,940
There are special sushi,

411
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,240
and there are special meat and sukiyaki.

412
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,140
Well, I'm bored, so let's have a look.

413
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,060
Well, I'm bored, so let's have a look.

414
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,500
This is also a serious thing.

415
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,260
Isn't it?

416
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,220
It's delicious.

417
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,560
There are more.

418
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,960
Edokko?

419
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,060
He is from Asakusa.

420
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,560
He is a good eater.

421
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,300
Edokko is from Asakusa.

422
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,700
Edokko is sushi, isn't it?

423
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,000
Sushi is a food with sake, isn't it?

424
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,680
Of course.

425
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,360
Come on, hold the bowl.

426
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,500
This is also a good shape.

427
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:18,860
Isn't it?

428
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,540
This is a Shimo-bashira.

429
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,340
The color is nice.

430
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,780
The scent is good, too.

431
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,460
Ryo-san, Edokko.

432
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,120
Edokko is very good at eating.

433
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,920
Mr. Edokko, you're going to eat too.

434
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:30,980
I'm not going to drink it.

435
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,200
I won't eat that!!

436
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,660
I'm not going to eat that!!

437
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,080
Ryo-san!!

438
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,840
He ran away.

439
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,380
He thought we were going to pay him a fine.

440
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,900
He thought we were going to pay him a fine.

441
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,500
And?

442
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,140
He became a man, didn't he?

443
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,380
But, it's just a week today.

444
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,180
Not yet.

445
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,880
I'm going to ask the chief to punish me.

446
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,420
Punish you?

447
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,580
Yeah, now it's finally over.

448
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,040
You've put up with it.

449
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,620
What do you think, Ryotsu?

450
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,780
If we get this done, we'll be completely banned.

451
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,360
That's not a joke!

452
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,900
Hey, Terai, let's go back and drink.

453
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,500
But...

454
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,100
Too bad, but we have work tonight.

455
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:14,840
What?

456
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,920
It's the security of the Shinsen reception of the Takepon Kingdom's Chinese ambassador.

457
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,980
The security of the Shinsen reception of the Takepon Kingdom's Chinese ambassador.

458
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,540
Is there anyone suspicious?

459
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,200
No, nothing unusual.

460
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,760
There's no suspicious person, but there's something suspicious about the drink.

461
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,000
Hey, Ryotsu!

462
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,680
What?

463
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,580
Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,400
Reiko and I are personally invited to this party.

465
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,640
Really?

466
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,600
Then it's unfair for you guys to be able to eat this luxurious room for free.

467
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,840
So, go home.

468
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,260
What?

469
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,320
Reiko, you can go.

470
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,740
Then, should I wear my dress?

471
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,640
Huh?

472
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,600
Then, we'll go around the place.

473
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,580
We'll keep watch, so don't worry.

474
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:06,860
Huh?

475
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,020
There's only Tadazake and Wansato in front of me.

476
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,440
Huh?

477
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,360
Oops, I almost got excited.

478
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,700
This time.

479
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,060
What's wrong?

480
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,620
Something under the table?

481
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,740
Did you hear a moat?

482
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,840
That thing?

483
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,960
*History activity of Taishi*

484
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,140
Well, there is nothing changed...

485
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,000
What a strange man...

486
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,160
*Return of Takao*

487
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,320
Welcome to the party, ladies and gentlemen.

488
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,500
I, Takao them, have prepared a bouquet from Takepon King.

489
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,940
If you are surprised, please win this bouquet of flowers.

490
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,240
It's an old bouquet. Reiko-san, how was it?

491
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,900
It's okay if the person who received the bouquet says they can get married next time.

492
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,660
Anyway, the person who grabbed this bouquet has to drink with the Shunichi ambassador.

493
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,340
Oh, senpai!

494
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,280
What? What? What?

495
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,660
He's pushing me out.

496
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,200
One, two, three!

497
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,700
Don't push me!

498
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,320
Please come here.

499
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,680
It's senpai.

500
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,120
I have a bad feeling.

501
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,980
Well, hello.

502
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,400
Would you like whiskey or sake?

503
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,220
I would like anything.

504
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,740
What? Sake?

505
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,320
Can you drink sake?

506
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
It's a drink comparison with me.

507
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,480
Yay!

508
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,100
No, I'm a little...

509
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,680
Don't refuse, senpai!

510
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,000
That's right, Ryo-chan.

511
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,100
Why are you doing that again?

512
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,560
In the Takepon Kingdom, it is the most rude to refuse to drink even though I received this bouquet.

513
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,140
No, I can't do that.

514
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,200
I'm just a little too excited about the international issue.

515
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,880
Ryo-chan, I don't care.

516
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,640
Please accept my apology.

517
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,560
Really?

518
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,300
What?

519
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,860
Ryo-chan, you can drink it.

520
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,580
I can drink it.

521
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,460
But I think I've done too much.

522
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,280
What?

523
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,740
What?

524
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:55,900
What?

525
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,340
What?

526
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,120
What?

527
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,620
What?

528
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,780
And, the

529
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,560
The roof's turning?

530
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,020
What? I heard the roof is turning.

531
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,160
That's not what I mean!

532
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,700
The floor's shaking.

533
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,580
Ryo-chan, you've opened up this pillar and it's tilted.

534
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,480
No, you haven't отдел core.

535
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,300
I'm going to mend this.

536
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,920
Interesting, very interesting!

537
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,840
I'll help you.

538
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,020
I'm so tired of this.

539
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,180
Alright, everyone, I'm going to fix you!

540
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,140
Next is this way!

541
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,600
Alright, I'll do it!

542
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,240
Alright, this is the last one. Let's go!

543
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,780
Next is this way!

544
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,520
Next is this way!

545
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,760
Next is this way!

546
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,520
Thank you!

547
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,320
Damn! That Ryusenshi guy!

548
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,320
Even though he's an editor, he still rides a helicopter and is popular with girls.

549
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,460
He eats up all the delicious food and I envy him too much!

550
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,660
In this case, I'll become an editor who's better than an editor!

551
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,220
I'll become a super editor!

552
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,580
Next time, Super Editor!

553
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,740
Thanks for watching!

554
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,960
Thank you!
