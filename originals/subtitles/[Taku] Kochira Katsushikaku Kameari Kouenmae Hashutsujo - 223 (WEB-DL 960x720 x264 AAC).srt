1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,520
Watch with the power of Tamiya on all TVs!

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,780
When watching TV, be sure to turn on the light in the room!

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,700
Those who don't have money, come to mine!

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,940
I don't have it either, but I'm worried

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,960
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,480
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,760
Come to me, you who have no job

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,740
I'm not here, but don't worry

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,400
Look, the red cloud is burning

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,940
Look, the red cloud is burning

11
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,460
Look, the red cloud is burning

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,600
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,480
I know, I know, I know

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,760
If you know, keep quiet and follow me

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,080
I know, I know, I know, I know

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:38,600
If the world ends, you and I will meet again

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,000
The future of the prayers of the gods will be set in your hands

18
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,060
What's wrong?

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,120
What the hell is this?!

20
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,980
Oh, you got that catalog too?

21
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,300
It's too cruel! You're fooling my colleague!

22
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,500
What's wrong, Tegai?

23
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,540
Did something happen to Ryo-chan?

24
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,120
Listen, Reiko-san, Nakagawa-kun.

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,260
Three days ago, Ryo-san was asked to buy the latest version of the 200,000-yen computer,

26
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,420
because it would cost half the price if it was a direct purchase.

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,960
If the latest version is half the price, that's a good thing.

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,620
But when I looked at the catalog of this delivery that was distributed at the station today,

29
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,180
it was actually 70,000 yen.

30
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,280
So Ryo-chan spent 30,000 yen?

31
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,220
Hey, don't say bad things about people.

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,760
Look at this carefully.

33
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,520
I can buy it cheaply because I have more than five customers.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,800
It's not strange that I paid 30,000 yen for that effort.

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,520
I see.

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,120
Wait a minute.

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:54,940
What?

38
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,200
If you pay 30,000 yen for five people,

39
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,380
you can get 150,000 yen from your colleague.

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,940
I see.

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,540
It's a fraud to make 150,000 yen just by collecting people who buy it.

42
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,680
Don't be silly!

43
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,400
Think about it carefully, Tegai.

44
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,900
It's a profit for the company to sell five of the stock computers,

45
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,340
and it's a profit for you to buy a 200,000-yen computer for half the price.

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,120
I'll make 30,000 yen for each one.

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,160
There's no one who's making a profit and losing money.

48
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,560
I see.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,220
Then it's okay to keep the four ways.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,980
If you say so.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
Mr. Tegai, don't be fooled.

52
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,320
It's unnecessary for Ryo-chan to make a profit.

53
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,360
That's right.

54
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,700
If Tegai collects the four people who want to buy the computer,

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,540
he can buy it for 70,000 yen.

56
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,020
I see.

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,860
Hey, don't blow in the unnecessary wisdom.

58
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,040
Anyway, I spent a lot of money on the computer yesterday,

59
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,000
so I'm already late.

60
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,340
No way.

61
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,780
What?

62
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,460
What are you talking about?

63
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,420
Oh, sir.

64
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,400
Good morning.

65
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,420
Good morning.

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,580
Sir, please listen to me.

67
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,600
Ryo-san is...

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,540
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,980
I'm on patrol...

70
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,140
Stop it, Ryo-chan.

71
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Well, sir, that's...

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,500
Actually, I have something to ask you.

73
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,640
Huh?

74
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,360
Hey, Itaike-kun.

75
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,080
Come in.

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,440
Oh, yes.

77
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,080
Um, nice to meet you.

78
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,840
Boss, what's with you?

79
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

80
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,160
Please forgive me.

81
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,880
What's with you?

82
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,900
It's I, Itaike-kun, a patrol officer who became a member of my office.

83
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,260
Nice to meet you.

84
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm Akimoto Reiko.

85
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,840
Nice to meet you.

86
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,120
Oh, nice to meet you, too.

87
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,840
You have a pretty body shape.

88
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,960
I'm Keiichi Nakagawa.

89
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,820
Oh, my God.

90
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,320
Wow, you're cool.

91
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,040
This office is like a model club.

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,060
I'm Terada Ryo.

93
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,180
I'm the best!

94
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,560
But you're not.

95
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,060
Ah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

96
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,520
Ryotsu, as you can see, Itaike-kun is a little weak.

97
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,480
The director asked me to fix him.

98
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,460
No way! I'm that role?

99
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,820
You're good at guessing.

100
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,100
Anyway, train him well.

101
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,600
Itaike-kun.

102
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes?

103
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,820
This Ryotsu chief will guide you.

104
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,200
Thank you, Ryotsu-senpai.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hey, can you walk faster, Itaike?

106
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,640
Yes.

107
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,980
Senpai is faster.

108
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,760
I'm the standard speed of Japanese.

109
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,340
Thank you.

110
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,060
No!

111
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,520
What?

112
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,400
No!

113
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,400
Scary!

114
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,440
No!

115
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,460
You're in my way!

116
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,240
Go away!

117
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,460
Hello.

118
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,540
Please.

119
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,560
Thank you.

120
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,180
Thank you.

121
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,760
You know what?

122
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,760
Police officers should always be proud.

123
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,920
Don't say that you're a police officer loved by the citizens.

124
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,020
Senpai!

125
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,760
What are you doing?

126
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,140
I can't see.

127
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
Please help me.

128
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,840
I did it.

129
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,780
I was saved.

130
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,560
Why don't you refuse?

131
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,460
I was going to refuse, but I felt bad if I didn't get it.

132
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,060
You idiot!

133
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,500
You're working part-time there.

134
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,300
And you're a fool to go with me.

135
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,580
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,500
Don't leave me!

137
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,320
Yes.

138
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,320
Hey, Senpai.

139
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,560
Me?

140
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,300
This is the latest computer-compatible all-automatic sewing machine.

141
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,440
This is supposed to be 150,000 yen, but this time...

142
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,100
It's only 80,000 yen!

143
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,860
Ah, that's cheap.

144
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,880
Right?

145
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,660
See?

146
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,180
It's like this.

147
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,000
You can sew anything with just a cloth.

148
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,040
It looks convenient.

149
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,160
Right?

150
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,900
How about one?

151
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,960
But I don't use a sewing machine.

152
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,980
Oh, no.

153
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,900
You're not good enough, sir.

154
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,940
You're good at gambling.

155
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,700
Let's add another 10,000 yen and make a deal with 70,000 yen.

156
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,300
But...

157
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,600
No, I can't win against you.

158
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,400
I can't win against you, sir.

159
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,600
Then I'll add this sewing machine set as a service.

160
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,040
Here's 70,000 yen.

161
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,720
What?

162
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,860
70,000 yen.

163
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm weak.

164
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,040
I have 70,000 yen...

165
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,420
I have it!

166
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,780
That idiot is gone again.

167
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,300
Senpai!

168
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,300
Senpai...

169
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,880
What's that?

170
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a sewing machine.

171
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,360
Don't you shop while patrolling?

172
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,100
No, I didn't.

173
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,780
I was bought when I noticed it.

174
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:44,920
What?

175
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,300
I've never used a sewing machine.

176
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:48,980
I see.

177
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
Your personality is the problem.

178
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,960
All right, follow me.

179
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
Yes, sir.

180
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,840
Well, well, ladies.

181
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,500
Have a look.

182
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,440
What is it?

183
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,460
I'll give it back.

184
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,200
What?

185
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,700
I bought it by mistake.

186
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,940
I'll cancel it.

187
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,880
No way.

188
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,900
It's a problem.

189
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,060
I sold it once.

190
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,780
I'll tell you again.

191
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,300
I'll cancel it!

192
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,940
Yes, immediately.

193
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,680
Thank you very much.

194
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,940
Thanks to you, I got 70,000 yen back.

195
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,320
You can refuse it yourself.

196
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,100
But I thought it would be bad if I refused.

197
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,140
It's not bad.

198
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,800
Just look at the other person's face and say, "I don't need it."

199
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,340
It's about my daily life.

200
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
Do you understand that?

201
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,180
Yes, I do.

202
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,920
If you don't voice your opinion, you won't be able to live in a good city.

203
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,640
Yes, sir.

204
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,780
Okay.

205
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,520
Let's go.

206
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,580
Yes, sir.

207
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,820
Welcome.

208
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,820
Well, um...

209
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,660
Here's the menu.

210
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,780
Phew, I'm screwed.

211
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,520
I don't want to be cheated on again.

212
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:01,660
I see.

213
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Just like Senpai said, I'll look into the eyes of the other person...

214
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,080
Excuse me!

215
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,380
How about 10 sets of new hamburgers?

216
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay, then I'll...

217
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,440
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

218
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,260
How about freshly fried potatoes?

219
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,800
How about a set of fries?

220
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,680
Please...

221
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,600
Where did Itai-ke go?

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,480
Itai-ke!

223
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,420
You got robbed again?

224
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,280
I can't eat 10 hamburgers!

225
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,840
I'll help you.

226
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,480
Sorry.

227
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,440
It's lunch time.

228
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,040
Where's your drink?

229
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,020
Don't go.

230
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,300
You'll get robbed again.

231
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,400
Then,

232
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,380
why don't you come to my room?

233
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,540
I have some juice.

234
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,240
You live in a mansion like this?

235
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,980
It's 3 minutes away from the station.

236
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,500
Isn't the rent pretty high?

237
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,940
It's 200,000 yen.

238
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,480
200,000 yen?

239
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,640
I couldn't refuse it because it was recommended by a real estate agency.

240
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,480
Hey, hey, hey!

241
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,080
Is there such a person who can save up so much newspaper?

242
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,180
Oh, this is all today's money.

243
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,740
I couldn't refuse it because you gave me some money.

244
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,120
Here you go.

245
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,820
What's this room?

246
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,800
I bought some things from the market and catch sales,

247
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,700
so I ended up like this.

248
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,260
What?

249
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,880
You don't need a fire extinguisher like this.

250
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,100
But the lady who came to sell it was so unfortunate.

251
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,760
Actually, I'm going to the hospital.

252
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,140
My parents are in the hospital due to a car accident.

253
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,860
I have to buy this or I'll be in trouble.

254
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,420
I understand.

255
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,940
Then, one, please.

256
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,160
One, please.

257
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,220
Just one?

258
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,440
What?

259
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,620
If it's just one, I'll be in trouble.

260
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,580
I understand. I'll buy it.

261
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
I'll buy everything.

262
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,500
Thank you very much.

263
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,780
That's a lie.

264
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,340
What's this?

265
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,660
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,400
A video of English conversation?

267
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,020
Are you going to be an English teacher?

268
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,900
Are you going to be an English teacher?

269
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,620
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,960
It's not just English.

271
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,580
I've been bought all the foreign language tapes in the world.

272
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,520
That's right.

273
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,960
French, Norwegian, and Vietnamese.

274
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,400
What do you think is the correct Edo dialect?

275
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,320
I was just bought.

276
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,500
Is this a demolition stone?

277
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,360
Yes.

278
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,180
Why is this in the room?

279
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,360
I was passing by the jewelry store.

280
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,940
It's a big bargain that goes four years in a row.

281
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
It's not like the Olympics.

282
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,900
I'm sorry.

283
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,460
Did you buy a demolition stone and have a grave?

284
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,840
I was also evicted for ten years.

285
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,620
Senior!

286
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,980
Then, what is this simple toilet?

287
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,600
There must be a toilet and a bath in this room.

288
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,220
That's ...

289
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,680
This is the toilet?

290
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,780
There's a bath in the back, but there are a lot of bookstores, art and literature museums, and so on.

291
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,260
The library will open.

292
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,180
Do you want to see the bedroom?

293
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,800
No, I'm fine.

294
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,240
I'm not going to get angry anymore.

295
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,340
There are a lot of things everywhere.

296
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,800
Itai, sit down.

297
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,920
I can't sit down.

298
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,640
You bought most of the things in this room by mail, right?

299
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,960
Yes, I don't think you can see it with the piano, but there is a water bed and a tropical fish set in the back.

300
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,240
You didn't sell it to the seller, but why did you buy so much?

301
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,520
There's a direct mail from the mail every day.

302
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,720
I think it's around here.

303
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,920
There it is.

304
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,240
It comes like this.

305
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,500
In a day?

306
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,360
Yes.

307
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,840
There's a postcard for the transformation in it.

308
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,900
I think it's here.

309
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,040
If you put this out, the goods will arrive.

310
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,680
Of course. It's an application postcard.

311
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,260
But it says, "Put it out within a few days."

312
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,360
I feel bad if I don't put it out.

313
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,360
It's okay not to put it out.

314
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,100
If you do that, the room will be full of things.

315
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,620
I'm sorry.

316
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,920
What if your throat is dry?

317
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, by the way, it was juice, right?

318
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,240
Here you go.

319
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,860
It was probably this refrigerator.

320
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,520
Oh.

321
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,260
I found it.

322
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,340
Here.

323
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:37,980
Oh.

324
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,540
By the way, it hurts.

325
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,200
Yes.

326
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,920
Why are there three refrigerators?

327
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,980
The other day, I was walking around the store and I was robbed.

328
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,840
You have a lot of money.

329
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,120
Most of them are loans.

330
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,960
Even if you say it's a loan, if you buy this much, the monthly payment will be difficult.

331
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,900
That's right.

332
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,200
Please look at this.

333
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,500
Oh, it's a cotton candy.

334
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,100
It's nostalgic.

335
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,880
No, it's a credit card.

336
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,020
What?

337
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,260
You have so much?

338
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,520
It's been so long and I never pay the annual fee.

339
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,100
There are about a thousand in a hurry.

340
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,640
How can I live from now on?

341
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,760
Anyway, which products have you delivered within 8 days?

342
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:33,620
Well, World Art Training Week, Athletic Equipment, CDMD Compo and ...

343
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,400
Put it on the list. Everyone can return.

344
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,520
Huh?

345
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,000
There's a system called "cooling off".

346
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,180
Most people can cancel a contract if they don't understand it.

347
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,440
Can you do that too?

348
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,640
You don't even read the contract.

349
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,180
It's always written in any contract.

350
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,400
On the corner.

351
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,220
I didn't know.

352
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,660
I'll take care of the card company.

353
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,880
Thank you very much.

354
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,200
Thank you very much.

355
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,580
Well.

356
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,760
Thank you very much.

357
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,360
I've cleaned up a little, but there's still a lot.

358
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,240
All I can do is force it with a strong blow.

359
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,960
Ah...

360
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,320
What?

361
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,080
Are you paying back?

362
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,960
All of this?

363
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:25,860
Yeah.

364
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,400
It's all unprocessed.

365
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,660
But...

366
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,140
Call the manager.

367
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,860
Yes.

368
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Um...

369
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,460
Leave it to me.

370
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,860
I'm good at talking.

371
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,360
Great.

372
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm really going to get all the candy.

373
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,660
However, the troublesome thing is the candy that was bought in this town.

374
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,520
Ah, I'm sorry.

375
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,880
You should go to a place where catch-sales are well used.

376
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,860
Yes.

377
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,560
I often do it on Sunday.

378
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,020
It's a catch-sales gold.

379
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,880
I'm sure you're the same group.

380
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,800
There should be a monster over there.

381
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,980
You're also a joke...

382
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,320
Ah!

383
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,340
No one's here!

384
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:07,920
Oh no!

385
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,860
They already caught me!

386
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,420
Where are you?

387
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,320
Hey, Taikei!

388
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,380
When you become a member,

389
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,540
all the travel, hotels, and movies will be special fees.

390
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,000
That's amazing.

391
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,940
Most young people are joining the club.

392
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,280
Really?

393
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,440
Then,

394
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,020
it means you're joining us...

395
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,920
Ah, senpai!

396
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,320
Hey, Taikei!

397
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,840
Don't say you don't need to!

398
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,440
But, there's no admission fee or fee,

399
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,480
so you can join for free.

400
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,260
That's right!

401
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,460
Hey!

402
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,600
You're not going to get paid for staying a member!

403
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,980
What?

404
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,020
Well, it's just a little.

405
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,640
It's about 20,000 yen a month.

406
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,920
It'll cost you 240,000 yen a year!

407
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:48,740
Huh?

408
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,620
I didn't even say that!

409
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,220
Look, there's nothing more expensive than this!

410
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,560
Then, I'll take this...

411
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:57,980
Hey, wait!

412
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,540
You don't have any teaching materials for language, right?

413
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,600
Oh, if that's the case...

414
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,200
Here.

415
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,720
The correct Edoben.

416
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,300
Can I use it?

417
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,660
Wait a minute!

418
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,500
Huh?

419
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,020
Huh?

420
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,500
It's a paper that was bought at your house.

421
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,900
Cancel it!

422
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,580
Huh?

423
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,280
Oh, that's impossible.

424
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,620
Look, it's the 125th edition of the application form...

425
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:19,760
Oh!

426
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,780
I-If I read it well, there's an exception!

427
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,120
Let's cancel it!

428
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:24,980
Cancel it!

429
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,820
One teaching material video is over.

430
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,460
Okay, next.

431
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,420
Hey, Taikei!

432
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:31,540
Wait!

433
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,800
Hey, what are you selling?

434
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,840
It's a fashion ring.

435
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
There's no return list.

436
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:38,920
Ouch!

437
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,400
Let's go!

438
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,840
Um...

439
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,220
The high-end jewelry is very cheap right now.

440
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,500
No!

441
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,700
Wow, he ran away with a single word.

442
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,400
That's why I said I don't need a single word.

443
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,480
Um, do you have a survey?

444
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,720
I'm busy, so I can't.

445
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,460
Give me something else!

446
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,960
Excuse me!

447
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,680
The survey is fine, isn't it?

448
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,420
I was a beautiful woman.

449
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,480
That's why you're no good!

450
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,160
Look at this!

451
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,640
Huh?

452
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,720
Look, a young man like you is already caught.

453
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,020
It's true!

454
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,880
Oh, I'm going to the cafe.

455
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,720
Look closely.

456
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,460
It's from now on.

457
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,260
At first, it's like a date.

458
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,380
Oh, I'm on the phone.

459
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,640
Someone's here!

460
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,580
I changed with a man!

461
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,280
I changed with a man!

462
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,960
Try being persuaded by two men for two hours.

463
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,040
Most of them will fall.

464
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,040
That woman is a food.

465
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,680
Oh, I met the same man.

466
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,580
In my case, I signed it in three minutes.

467
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,560
Don't be stubborn, idiot!

468
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,720
I'm sorry.

469
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
And you won.

470
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,320
A woman called me and called me.

471
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,120
It's like that.

472
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,860
Oh, that too.

473
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,660
Oh, my God.

474
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,420
I'm sorry.

475
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,240
Hmm.

476
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,220
The other things I bought here are

477
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,940
a hundred-year-old set of art books,

478
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,340
a body-building set, and a grand piano.

479
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,320
All right!

480
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,020
What are you going to do?

481
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,480
Oh, my God!

482
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,960
I want an art book!

483
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,620
I want to buy a body-building set!

484
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,520
I want to go on a trip abroad cheaply!

485
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,080
I'm not sure how to spend the money!

486
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,360
Senior!

487
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,400
Huh? Huh?

488
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,100
I have an art book!

489
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,220
If you have a body-building set,

490
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,800
I'd like to go on a trip abroad!

491
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,080
Now's the chance!

492
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,620
Among these, where are you handling the grand piano?

493
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,240
Yes!

494
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,440
That's just me!

495
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,140
I can't return the loan, so I'll return the piano.

496
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:40,960
What?

497
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,120
It says here that it may be used as an used one.

498
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,020
Well, that's possible.

499
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,560
What?

500
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,500
Huh?

501
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,220
What?

502
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,500
What?

503
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,780
What?

504
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:53,860
Huh?

505
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,100
Huh?

506
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,700
Then,

507
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,260
you can have it.

508
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,500
Y-Yes.

509
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,160
Don't run away!

510
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,280
I'm always scared of the grand piano.

511
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,440
What?

512
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,240
So you took it all out?

513
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,920
I sold the things I couldn't find to the used one.

514
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,900
Thanks to that, there's nothing left in Itaike's room.

515
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,980
But, there's a problem with Itaike-san, who can buy anything easily.

516
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,140
Yeah.

517
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:23,900
That's the problem.

518
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,220
I think Itaike-san's personality won't be fixed for the rest of his life.

519
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,920
Don't worry.

520
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,540
My idea made it so that no one would buy anything from me.

521
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,540
Huh? How did you do that?

522
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,600
Senpai, help me!

523
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:39,900
Huh?

524
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,840
R-Ryo-chan is with two people?

525
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,380
I'm Itaike.

526
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,540
Mr. Itaike!

527
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,060
He asked a toy company I know to make a mask that looks like me.

528
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,760
He asked a toy company I know to make a mask that looks like me.

529
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,960
Ah, so Senpai's face means that no one from Catch Sales is coming.

530
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,960
Exactly.

531
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,220
But, Itaike-san, what's going on?

532
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:08,700
I'm sure Catch Sales is not coming anymore, but if I try to go shopping around here...

533
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,700
As long as you don't pay me, I won't sell anything to you!

534
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,420
Don't you dare to come to my store until you bring me a large amount of ramen!

535
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,720
Don't show your face until I pay you!

536
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,740
Go home now!

537
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,900
I'll show you what I can do!

538
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,280
T-that was quite a blow.

539
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,300
Senpai is a very bad debtor.

540
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,240
I can't take this anymore.

541
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,700
Ryo-san!

542
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:34,960
Huh?

543
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,000
This is bad, Ryo-san!

544
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,440
What is it, Terai?

545
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,600
Look at this!

546
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,060
Hm?

547
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,780
Is the evil media company a project bankruptcy?

548
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,020
The company name is the same as the company in the catalog!

549
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,780
What?!

550
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,600
Hm?

551
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,240
Huh?

552
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,960
The number you called is not available right now.

553
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,280
What?! I'm screwed! I spent 350,000 yen on it!

554
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,820
Ryo! If you can't get the computer, give me back my 100,000 yen.

555
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,760
Okay, Terai. But I've already used up all the money I've made.

556
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,580
Oh, right!

557
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,740
Itai-ke.

558
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,200
Yes.

559
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,060
Would you like to buy this card?

560
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,840
This card is all premium cards.

561
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,780
There's a special card that costs 50,000 yen each, and if you're a fan, you'll cry and be happy.

562
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,140
It's worth 1 million yen in total.

563
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,080
I'll lose 500,000 yen today, so please buy it for me!

564
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,000
But I'm not interested in card games.

565
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,700
300,000 yen is fine!

566
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,220
But...

567
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,980
No, Itai-ke. You have to refuse here.

568
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,980
Shut up!

569
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,180
Itai-ke.

570
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,460
I'm begging you. I thought you were helping me.

571
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,860
Itai-ke, I refuse!

572
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,200
Itai-ke.

573
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,200
Look at the other person's face and say, "I don't need it!"

574
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,500
Hey, Itai-ke, say, "I don't need it!"

575
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,040
That's why I said, "I don't need it!"

576
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,040
I... I... I don't need it!

577
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,160
I was rejected for the first time.

578
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,020
You're great, Itai-ke.

579
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,520
If you do it, you can do it, right?

580
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,340
Yes, thank you.

581
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,240
Itai-ke.

582
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,040
Then how about this helicopter?

583
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,240
500,000 yen is fine for 100,000 yen.

584
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,840
I don't need it!

585
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,020
Itai-ke.

586
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,020
I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it!

587
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,380
Yahoo!

588
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,980
I'm going to be completely rejected!

589
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,520
Itai-ke, you've finally overcome your weakness.

590
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,500
Why are you always rejected when I'm around?

591
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,280
What are you talking about?

592
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,520
Ryo-chan taught you, didn't she?

593
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,500
No way!

594
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,660
Ryo-san.

595
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,080
Giku.

596
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,160
Give me back 100,000 yen.

597
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,900
Uuuh!

598
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,280
Itai-ke, wait for me!

599
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,040
Once again!

600
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,160
Say "yes" one more time!

601
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,180
I don't need it!

602
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,020
Itai-ke.

603
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,100
I don't need it!

604
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,460
Itai-ke.

605
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:09,800
I don't need it!

606
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,920
Itai-ke.

607
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,420
I don't need it!

608
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,060
Itai-ke.

609
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,580
I don't need it!

610
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,220
Itai-ke.

611
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,220
Uuuh!

612
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,200
Itai-ke.

613
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,420
Itai-ke.

614
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:53,580
Everyone was a child once, but everyone forgets

615
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,660
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above his eyes

616
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:06,080
Turn and see that corner

617
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,400
Everyone can meet everyone

618
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,480
There is a turtle over there

619
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,340
There must be a turtle

620
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,400
Everyone come to our town

621
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,580
Thank you!

622
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,040
I did it!

623
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,160
Viking is free to eat at only 500 yen!

624
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,620
If you look closely, it's a woman's limited!

625
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,780
Damn it! I was also born a woman!

626
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,380
If this happens, true men and women will be sick!

627
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,480
I will fight for my rights!

628
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,820
Next time, I'm an actress, Ryoko Kameari!

629
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,420
Nice to meet you!

630
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,900
There is a turtle over there

631
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,900
There must be a turtle

632
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,820
Everyone come to our town

633
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,880
Thank you!
