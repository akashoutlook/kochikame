00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,260
"When watching TV"

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,080
When watching TV

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,140
Make the room brighter and look away

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,920
"When watching TV"

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,860
Looking at the sunset floating in the river

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,880
Looking at the sunset floating in the river

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,720
If you kick the love stone, you'll fly to the shoes

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:41,600
I wonder if I'm going to the gym where I was saving money

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,440
I was laughed at as it was

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
I wonder if I'm going to the gym where I was saving money

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,300
I was laughed at as it was

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,400
I was laughed at as it was

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
I was laughed at as it was

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,020
I was laughed at as it was

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:13,340
From the fountain of the Tungari hat to the taishakuten

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,460
The sunset falls

17
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,820
The sunset falls

18
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,840
And it ends like this

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,080
I was happy again

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,820
I was happy again

21
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,580
Because I'm an idiot

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,060
"Ryotsu"

23
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,680
"Ryotsu"

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:46,900
"Ryotsu"

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,140
"Ryotsu"

26
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:47,660
"Ryotsu"

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:47,940
"Ryotsu"

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,540
"Ryotsu"

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:48,880
"Ryotsu"

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,780
"Ryotsu"

31
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,180
"Ryotsu"

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,740
"Ryotsu"

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,380
"Ryotsu"

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:52,800
"Ryotsu"

35
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,440
"Ryotsu"

36
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,120
"Ryotsu"

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,660
"Ryotsu"

38
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,340
"Ryotsu"

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,180
"Ryotsu"

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,760
"Ryotsu"

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,060
"Ryotsu"

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,340
"Ryotsu"

43
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,180
"Ryotsu"

44
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:00,620
"Ryotsu"

45
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,300
"Ryotsu"

46
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:01,840
"Ryotsu"

47
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,080
"Ryotsu"

48
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,860
"Ryotsu"

49
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,300
"Ryotsu"

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:21,260
"Ryotsu"

51
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,440
He has no motor nerve, so it won't work even if he's coached.

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,800
Then only Ryotsu is left, right?

53
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,860
But...

54
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,900
Ryotsu has a better motor nerve than others.

55
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,260
If he's coached and improved, the head coach will be happy.

56
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,160
Oh...

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,600
Anyway, be careful not to lose your ability on the day.

58
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,140
What?

59
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,480
He's been worse than us since he was coached.

60
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,580
Oh...

61
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,040
Don't let him beat you, even if you make a mistake.

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,420
Tell Ryotsu to be careful.

63
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,840
Oh, okay.

64
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,640
I'm already in pain.

65
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,480
What? He took a golf with the boss?

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,580
He took a golf with the boss?

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,060
You're kidding, Ryo.

68
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,660
There's no reason to refuse.

69
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,240
Ryo, who hated golf in the book, said that he was more of a jester than a jester.

70
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,560
He came to pick me up by car.

71
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,140
He was a bonus.

72
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,020
He said he'd feed me.

73
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,980
This is a chance to get some nutrition.

74
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,440
But, senpai, you've never played golf, have you?

75
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,500
Don't underestimate me.

76
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,320
The other day, I had a par 72 course and a hole in one twice.

77
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,540
I was 24 under.

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,520
24 under?

79
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,920
I've never heard of a pro golfer who scored such a high score.

80
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,760
St. Andrews in the All-Star Open and Augusta in the Masters.

81
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,940
I did only a few courses.

82
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,500
18 under was the best score.

83
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:46,820
However, even if I had played, I'd have been an upstart.

84
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,000
When did you go to England or the United States?

85
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,740
Oh! I've got it, senpai!

86
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,360
That's a video game, right?

87
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes.

88
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,620
That's our golf software.

89
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,900
What? You make me feel a bit nervous.

90
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,340
Ryo just has a different style to playing games and real golf.

91
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,420
You wouldn't think that.

92
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,120
I've got the power to be Tiger Woods.

93
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,020
Golf is the smallest sport in my life.

94
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,940
Rather than a tiger, you've got the power to be a gorilla.

95
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,500
What?

96
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:12,860
What?

97
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,300
Who said "Gorilla"?

98
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,360
Huh? I heard a lot of bad gossip.

99
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,180
Oh, what about the club? You don't have one, do you?

100
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,820
Oh, right. I was thinking of lending it to you.

101
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,700
I have a lot of them.

102
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,200
Of course. I'll bring them tomorrow.

103
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,660
No! You can't have them!

104
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,480
Oh, good morning, chief!

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,680
Oh, why can't I go to my club?

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,120
How much is your golf set?

107
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,000
Well, they're all premium, so I think it's about 10 million yen.

108
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,120
10 million yen?

109
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,040
That's why you can't have them!

110
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,000
It's not good to use a club that's more expensive than the chief's.

111
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,740
I'll lend you a set I bought for 30,000 yen 15 years ago.

112
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,920
Use it.

113
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,700
What?

114
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,180
And as I said yesterday, I don't want the chief to tell you, so listen to me.

115
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,080
Don't buy it by mistake.

116
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,680
If you're in trouble, I'll send you to the end of the world.

117
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,860
What?

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,340
I don't want to play golf with you,

119
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,580
but I want to play golf with you.

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,060
I have 99% of the time on my mind.

121
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,060
Ryo, you're in trouble.

122
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
It's good that you don't have me.

123
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,040
Hey, how long are you going to sleep?

124
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,360
I'm here. Take your luggage.

125
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,140
I've never woke up this early since the school festival.

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,000
Why does he wake up so early?

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,120
Good morning.

128
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,020
Good morning.

129
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,420
Head of Kobashi.

130
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,620
Good morning.

131
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,560
I've been waiting for you.

132
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,220
I thought that the meeting will be at 7 o'clock.

133
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,040
I thought it was a little late.

134
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,040
No, I woke up early when I thought it was golf.

135
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,240
I got here at 3:00 in the morning.

136
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,820
It's the same as the time when I was a child.

137
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,900
Hey, do you want to say hello?

138
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,520
Thank you.

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,700
I'm Ryotsu, a subordinate.

140
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,560
Golf is the first time today.

141
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,620
Please take care of me.

142
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,400
Oh, is it your debut match?

143
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,200
Well, don't get stiff.

144
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,720
I'll give you advice, so don't worry.

145
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,240
Yeah.

146
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,400
Please take care of me.

147
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,280
Okay, I want one minute.

148
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,720
Let's get started.

149
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,740
Nice shot!

150
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,840
It didn't fly a little.

151
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,500
No, no, it's wonderful.

152
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,460
It's in the middle of the field.

153
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,700
It's a beautiful shot that flies straight.

154
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,180
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,900
The ball is the head of the club.

156
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,760
The ball is beautiful.

157
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,880
It's artistic.

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,700
I see.

159
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,040
You're not going to fly if you dress up.

160
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,940
Well, I'll fly next.

161
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,260
I hope I can fly well.

162
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,000
I know.

163
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,100
Oh, no.

164
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,040
I'm not good at this.

165
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,860
You look too down.

166
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,800
I need to look at the ball well.

167
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,520
Hmm, I see, I see.

168
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,040
Well, as expected of the director, his advice will be useful.

169
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,260
Well, you can really use a great trainer like that.

170
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,880
Hey, ¿ précédente, what are you doing?

171
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,220
It's your turn.

172
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,620
Yes, yes.

173
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,700
Hey, what are you doing?

174
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,200
You're doing worse than the director.

175
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,200
Try to recalculate yourself.

176
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,020
Yes, yes, I know the end of the story.

177
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,120
I know.

178
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,840
This is the first time I've played golf.

179
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,440
You're not playing golf.

180
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,560
This is how you grip.

181
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,980
Is that so?

182
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
You're putting too much effort into it.

183
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,060
You need to grip it more lightly.

184
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,600
Lightly, lightly, lightly.

185
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,520
That's right.

186
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,100
Good job, Ryouchi.

187
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,740
Look, twist your hips more.

188
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,120
Stretch your left elbow.

189
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,340
Don't put your feet on your back.

190
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,060
Swing here.

191
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,960
Imagine you're making a wall on the left side.

192
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,100
A wall, right?

193
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,420
Then practice the swing again.

194
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,360
A wall on the left side.

195
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,700
What are you doing?

196
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,100
I'm making a wall on the left side.

197
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,960
What do you think?

198
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,300
That's not what I'm saying.

199
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,420
I'm telling you to make a wall on the left side.

200
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,440
Then you should say it more clearly.

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,820
This is bad.

202
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,600
Ryouchi, you're being rude to the head of the club.

203
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,780
No.

204
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,020
The head of the club's advice is great,

205
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,320
but he can't understand it because it's a simple thing.

206
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,440
I see.

207
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,360
I'm telling you.

208
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,780
Finish it quickly, eat something good and go home.

209
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,900
Ready?

210
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,200
That's why I told you.

211
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,240
Swing more.

212
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,380
Pull your hips.

213
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,140
Swing down as if you're drawing a circle.

214
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,740
You're so noisy.

215
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,980
Do it like this.

216
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,980
Like a circle.

217
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,920
How was that?

218
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,080
You're not flying at all.

219
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,080
I'm not doing it like you say.

220
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,360
Good job.

221
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,340
You're doing great, Ryouchi.

222
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,900
I did it as the head of the club told me to,

223
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,560
but I can't fly at all.

224
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,300
You idiot.

225
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,300
You can hear me, right?

226
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,140
You have to do it like that.

227
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,660
I got it.

228
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,460
It's a bit of a hassle to put it on the green from here.

229
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,080
I'll give you some advice.

230
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,280
I'm going to shoot it in here.

231
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,260
Here, from the gap in the tree.

232
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,420
Don't tell me you're trying to get out of the way.

233
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,020
You have to put it on the fairway from the side.

234
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,300
No, but this is...

235
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,740
Damn it.

236
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,260
If I don't get the head of the club's advice,

237
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,760
my score will get worse.

238
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,080
But I have to get out of the way here.

239
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,440
Isn't that Norika Fujiwara?

240
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,580
What?

241
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,120
Damn it.

242
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,580
Damn it!

243
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,140
Head of the club!

244
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,160
Head of the club!

245
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,060
Ryouchi!

246
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,600
I did it as the head of the club told me to,

247
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
but I'm not good at it.

248
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,440
Horrible.

249
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
You're not getting any better this time.

250
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,940
Yes.

251
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,300
The banker is here this time.

252
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,940
Head of the club,

253
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,640
how can we shoot like this?

254
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,900
You're right.

255
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,320
That's right. Watch me do it.

256
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,800
Hey, Chief! I've been waiting for you!

257
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,340
I'd like to see your hand.

258
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,340
You have to set the right foot for this.

259
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,260
That was a bad shot.

260
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:18,620
Chief, this is a bad situation.

261
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,240
Chief, I forgot that I wasn't good at bunkers.

262
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,260
What's going on?

263
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,260
I'll show you what I can do.

264
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,280
Chief, you're bleeding.

265
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,140
You can't do anything.

266
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,320
Take a deep breath.

267
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,900
Shut up!

268
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,320
Do you want to give me advice?

269
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,300
Chief, don't mind him.

270
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,360
Do it at your own pace.

271
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,580
Damn it.

272
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,500
You idiot.

273
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,360
What should I say?

274
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,560
He said he'd lose if he got blood.

275
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,060
How cheeky.

276
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,860
Oh, nice out.

277
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,700
Chief, you're really good.

278
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,380
I see.

279
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,260
In short, you just need to pull the sand as hard as you can.

280
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,060
All right.

281
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,040
I got on.

282
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,080
What?

283
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,100
What?

284
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,940
Isn't it easy?

285
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,180
Hehehe.

286
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,620
Hmph.

287
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,460
You're pretty good.

288
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,520
I'm just trying.

289
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,520
I'm just trying.

290
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,900
You're right.

291
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,080
It's called beginner's luck.

292
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,660
Hey, hey.

293
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,220
Don't dress up like a beginner.

294
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,900
Hurry up and hit it.

295
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,620
All right.

296
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
But this is similar to the eight green that comes out of our golf.

297
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,500
Right.

298
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,820
So, is this the one?

299
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,480
Okay?

300
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:48,980
Right.

301
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,160
The last thing you must do is get out of the blue.

302
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,580
Why don't you shower with water?

303
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,280
Yeah.

304
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,800
Excellent.

305
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,520
Now, I'm going to fight around the middle.

306
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,800
Let's have some fun.

307
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,800
Good service.

308
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,880
Ready to have a game?

309
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Yes, sir.

310
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,560
The game has begun.

311
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,080
Now, please.

312
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,440
The lights are on.

313
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:12,800
The white noise is coming from the bottom.

314
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,100
Coaxing me, huh?

315
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:14,480
We're good.

316
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,960
I can't believe you.

317
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,680
You hit that long putt with one shot.

318
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,120
You're a beginner but you said it's a beginner's luck twice.

319
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
No, it's all thanks to the head coach's advice.

320
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,300
I didn't give you advice on the putt.

321
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,420
Huh?

322
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,500
I feel bad. Get in.

323
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:30,820
Ah!

324
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,780
Head coach, please! That's enough!

325
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,180
You're the one who's always been like that, but you're not as good as you are today!

326
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,660
No way!

327
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,540
This is bad!

328
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,480
Huh?

329
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,640
We lost the golf course!

330
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,200
We lost the golf course?

331
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,340
You're lying!

332
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,280
Come on!

333
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:49,880
Come on!

334
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,120
Hurry up!

335
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,460
If there are no professionals who can beat us, the Murasame 4 Brothers,

336
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,820
I'll take the golf course's sign.

337
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,380
The Murasame 4 Brothers?

338
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,700
Who are they?

339
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,340
The Murasame 4 Brothers' parents, to be exact.

340
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:23,360
Mr. Murah 정치

341
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,920
Mr. Pilpibur

342
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,380
Mr. Poitain

343
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:25,680
Mr. Orochi

344
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:25,720
Mr. P DIO

345
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,280
Mr. Marubou

346
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,180
Mr. Pio

347
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,560
Mr. Fukuda

348
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,080
Mr. Hiromitsu

349
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,440
Mr. Pio

350
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,900
So, you can't beat us, too?

351
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,260
Idiot!

352
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,260
You can't say that right now!

353
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,140
Get out of here!

354
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,820
I'm in a good mood.

355
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,900
Hey, you guys!

356
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,140
You can't cheat!

357
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,480
Who are you?

358
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,560
You're a cop!

359
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,580
A cop?

360
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,820
You must be mistaken.

361
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,040
We don't cheat.

362
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,540
Yes, we just want to compete.

363
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,780
I didn't say I wanted money.

364
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,700
I didn't say I wanted money at all.

365
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,220
Thank you very much.

366
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,140
Are you the manager?

367
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes.

368
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,660
Please accept my condolences.

369
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,920
I'll take your money.

370
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,320
What?

371
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,800
What?

372
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:16,940
What?

373
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,440
What should we do?

374
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,540
We didn't say we wanted money.

375
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,600
If there's no one to compete with,

376
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,900
why don't you just take it?

377
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,600
Wait!

378
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,240
What?

379
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,020
I'll compete with you!

380
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,720
You're going to accept our challenge?

381
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,460
I'm going to win with my dirty hands.

382
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,880
But I can't do as you think.

383
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,740
So I'll give you this money as a deposit.

384
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,480
All right.

385
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,460
But no one has ever tried to win against us.

386
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,480
I don't care.

387
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,520
Don't underestimate me.

388
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,680
It's getting interesting.

389
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,900
By the way,

390
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,240
if I win,

391
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,560
you'll get this money, right?

392
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,140
What?

393
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,860
You don't have to carry the sign.

394
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,960
No, no.

395
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,860
Of course, I won't.

396
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,580
Ryotsu,

397
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,460
is it all right to say that?

398
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,980
You can't even play golf.

399
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,560
It's all right.

400
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,220
I'll give you a big one.

401
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,340
It's the best.

402
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,560
I'm glad you brought your medicine.

403
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,760
Give it to me.

404
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,480
The rules are only one hole.

405
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,520
There are no penalties such as OB.

406
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,280
Anyway,

407
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,180
the one with the least number of hits will win.

408
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:29,800
You're so generous.

409
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,980
You can get away with anything.

410
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,180
I'll be the first.

411
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,820
I'm the second.

412
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,900
How was that?

413
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,440
Did you see that?

414
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,500
It's amazing.

415
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,900
I can fly 300 yards.

416
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,500
So they weren't just a bunch of fools.

417
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,900
The second is Iain Kiyoshiro.

418
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,840
Here I go.

419
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,560
The second one is the problem here.

420
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,420
I can't see the swing.

421
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,760
It's amazing.

422
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,240
This one will stretch, too.

423
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,780
You're so cool.

424
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,640
You can shoot normally.

425
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,260
I'll be the next.

426
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,800
Next is me.

427
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,880
I'm Chin Ranran.

428
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,380
Why are you like a Chinese magician?

429
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,280
Weren't you the four brothers of Murasame?

430
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,700
Why Chin?

431
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,800
My surname is Murasame.

432
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,280
I'm Chin Ranran.

433
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,180
Don't give me a random name.

434
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,200
Amazing.

435
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,340
All three of them have exceeded 300 yards.

436
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,380
This is not a match for Ryotsu.

437
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:49,600
I'm not the kind of person who can shoot.

438
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,540
That's right.

439
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,260
If you have that much power, you'll lose.

440
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,960
I was a little reluctant to go before the head of the headquarters.

441
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,620
This time, I'll do it seriously.

442
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,040
What?

443
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,540
So you've never been serious before?

444
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,440
I mean, he's a fool.

445
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,240
Don't be surprised to see that.

446
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,700
Oh, my God.

447
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,260
What?

448
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,360
What?

449
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,620
Amazing.

450
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,060
But the form is different.

451
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,160
That's right.

452
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,340
No matter how much you fly, the form is different.

453
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,100
That's right.

454
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,820
But 350 yards is...

455
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,140
What?

456
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,320
Be careful.

457
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,300
Sasuke, I understand.

458
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,620
Ryotsu.

459
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,420
Well, my ball...

460
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,600
It came around here, didn't it?

461
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,120
Sasuke did a good job.

462
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,700
There it is.

463
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,800
Ryotsu, it was there.

464
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,300
Why is it in that place?

465
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,660
I should have stopped at the fairway.

466
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,520
He should have stopped at the fairway.

467
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,720
He must have hit a stone and fallen.

468
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,860
He was unlucky.

469
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,460
You want to give up?

470
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,380
Shut up! You can't afford to lose!

471
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,520
I'll make him ring the bell.

472
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,140
No, Ryozu.

473
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,320
We have to get him back to the fairway.

474
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,800
If you do that, you'll lose the game.

475
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,420
Even so,

476
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,840
there's a tree in the green direction.

477
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,080
Oh, there it is.

478
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,540
Look.

479
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:27,580
Look.

480
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,640
Good!

481
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,320
Nice defense!

482
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,220
What are you going to do?

483
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,480
There!

484
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,520
How's that?

485
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,140
It's a two-on.

486
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,240
What's that technique?

487
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,320
Ryozu doesn't know the rules.

488
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,440
What do you think of that shot?

489
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,020
It's great.

490
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:53,900
Huh?

491
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,860
It's a crazy way to do it,

492
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,200
but it's not a good match.

493
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,200
A good match is a good match.

494
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,980
As expected of the chief.

495
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,420
We're telling the officers

496
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:02,960
to watch out for his match.

497
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,960
Right, Ohara-kun?

498
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,360
Yes, sir.

499
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,380
You're pretty good.

500
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,640
But you're still too early to be happy.

501
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,760
Watch this.

502
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,220
A full-blown attack.

503
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,060
A full-blown attack.

504
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,540
A full-blown attack.

505
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,780
My ball was fired from the green.

506
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,860
Stop it.

507
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,400
All I see is my ball.

508
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,040
Then, a great magic skill will crush you.

509
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,740
No way.

510
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,400
I can't believe I could do that!

511
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,500
What?

512
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,740
Can we say we two did a two-on?

513
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,820
Huh?

514
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,900
Hey, where's your ball?

515
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,220
How's that? Do you admit defeat?

516
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,380
Damn it! Give me all the clubs!

517
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,160
What are you going to do?

518
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
I don't care what you do.

519
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,860
If you do that, you'll burn more and more.

520
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,140
I'll definitely buy it!

521
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,180
I did it! This is a song, and this is a super long club!

522
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,440
All right! I did it!

523
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,420
Nice! You did it well, Ryo-tsu!

524
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,320
Damn it! What kind of person is he?

525
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,020
Now it's your turn. I'll do it first, because it's the farthest.

526
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,540
Ryo-tsu, it's not a billiard.

527
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,700
I'll return the change in the change.

528
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,680
Ryo-san's打法:逆転ビリヤード

529
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,760
I'm not good at playing the table tennis, so I'll use the bunker.

530
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,880
I fell into the pond!

531
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,200
Oh no!

532
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,340
I fell into the pond!

533
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,600
You're in my way.

534
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,260
Mido, I'll do the cup.

535
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,360
No!

536
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,840
Don't worry. Sasuke is here.

537
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,480
Stop!

538
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Damn it!

539
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,460
Why is he there?

540
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,420
I see. He was the one who prevented Ryo-tsu from hitting the ball.

541
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,020
I'll go in.

542
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,800
Let's go!

543
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,520
Here we go, Osagi!

544
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,840
I'm in the 4th place!

545
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,220
What are you going to do?

546
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,500
Murasame 4 brothers, will you give up?

547
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,300
Or will you still use your dirty hands to win?

548
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,280
Oh, no!

549
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,900
It's our defeat.

550
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,860
If you want to win, don't ever do this again.

551
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,940
I'll watch you more this time.

552
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,740
Get out of here!

553
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,460
You're so quiet.

554
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,280
The money is mine.

555
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,100
Ryo-tsu!

556
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,920
What?

557
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,200
It was a great game.

558
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,440
Thank you.

559
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,300
I think I've misunderstood you.

560
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,760
I hope we can play again some time.

561
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,580
Unfortunately, I can't make it to the next round.

562
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,440
Actually, I'm going to be fired today.

563
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,540
What are you talking about?

564
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,140
You're a talented subordinate.

565
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,440
Keep up the good work.

566
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,180
It's wonderful to make a fighter like him.

567
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,740
I have to teach him a lesson.

568
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,740
I'm afraid.

569
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,100
Ryo-tsu is my pride.

570
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,880
I don't know what it is, but I think I'm fired.

571
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,360
Thank you.

572
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,600
You really saved me.

573
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,720
As promised, I'll give you this.

574
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,500
Idiot!

575
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,560
Do you have a guy to bring me at such a time?

576
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,700
What?

577
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,400
What is that?

578
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,840
Do you want to do it for money?

579
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,280
No, it's not like that.

580
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,860
Ryo-tsu!

581
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,060
You're fired today.

582
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,280
No way!

583
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,620
No way!

584
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,560
I hate golf so much!

585
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,260
Next time

586
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
Next time

587
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,460
Next time

588
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,780
Next time

589
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,840
Next time

590
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,220
Next time

591
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,300
Next time

592
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,640
Next time

593
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,840
Next time

594
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,860
Next time

595
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,500
Next time

596
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,280
Next time

597
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,080
Next time

598
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,000
Next time

599
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,120
I feel like we're all melting together

600
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:02,180
I really want to push you away

601
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,820
For some reason, love is just cowardice

602
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:37,780
Don't hide everything that makes you strong

603
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:43,100
