00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,880
When watching TV, make the room bright and look away.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,700
If you don't have money, come to me!

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,980
I don't have any, but I'm worried.

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,260
I'm worried.

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,740
Look at the blue sky.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,980
White clouds

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,560
I wonder what will happen.

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,560
I know.

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,840
I know. I know.

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,420
If you understand, come to me quietly!

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,740
Look at the blue sky.

00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,300

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,340
It's all done.

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,420
It's a unique job for a senior.

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,360
But it's not enough to make you get older.

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,080
We have to find another part-time job.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,360
Ryo-san is the type who uses as much as he can and gets to the last minute.

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,420
Leave it alone.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,700
That's right.

30
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,700
Ryo-chan is busy looking for people.

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,640
I think that's part-time job that Ryo-chan's cleverness can make.

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,900
Really? I'm not going to be lazy.

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,240
Introduce me.

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,700
Yes, but there's something I want you to do instead.

35
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,100
Good morning.

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,080
Chief.

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,320
Good morning.

38
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,260
I'm not working.

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,240
You're not working?

40
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,040
No, it's nothing.

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,280
It's about me.

42
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,840
Anyway, you've asked me to do something, haven't you?

43
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,400
What was it?

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,400
What's that look on your face?

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,120
Did you forget?

46
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,860
No, I didn't.

47
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,100
Ryo-san, Chief.

48
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,500
I'm going to give you a hand-made hand-made model for your granddaughter.

49
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Oh, I see.

50
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,880
Of course, I won't forget anything.

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,760
Leave it to me.

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,080
Daisuke loves the ship.

53
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,480
I'm really looking forward to it.

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,140
You must keep your promise.

55
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,140
I know.

56
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,080
Please trust me.

57
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,720
I'm going to make Ryo-san a part-time job.

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,580
From today to the Christmas Eve of the actual show,

59
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,140
I can become a one-man cake chef.

60
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,840
You can do it all by yourself.

61
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,680
How about it?

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,700
Will it be a one-man job in a week?

63
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,660
Ryo-san.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,320
Yes, please.

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,420
First of all, the basics of cake.

66
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,920
Making meringue.

67
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,880
I'll mix it with this.

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,380
Easy peasy.

69
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
No, no.

70
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,460
Faster.

71
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,720
Like this?

72
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,080
It's still too late.

73
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:18,940
Damn it.

74
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,540
Let me hear the snap of your wrist.

75
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,640
What is it?

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,860
Faster, rhythmically.

77
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,660
I'm going to do it.

78
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,480
No, no, no, no.

79
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,080
That's right.

80
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,880
That's right.

81
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,580
That's right.

82
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,640
You're stupid.

83
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,900
What are you going to do with all of them?

84
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,140
Sorry.

85
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,640
Can't be helped.

86
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,940
Use an electric mixer.

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,320
Let me do it from the beginning.

88
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,300
How is it?

89
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,060
Oh, it's good for the first time.

90
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,640
Right?

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,860
I made something like this.

92
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,120
It's a Japanese-style cake.

93
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,280
A Japanese-style cake?

94
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,100
Yes.

95
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,160
I arranged plum and shishamo and shumai.

96
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,260
I put miso on the whole instead of cream.

97
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,880
And when I cut it,

98
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,140
it's a natto sandwich.

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,720
How can this be sold?

100
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,440
Next is this.

101
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,180
Curry cake.

102
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,200
What?

103
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,900
I'll put real curry on it.

104
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,340
Curry?

105
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,400
Yes.

106
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,780
I'll put yakisoba inside.

107
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:17,900
I'll put curry on it.

108
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,520
You can taste both curry and yakisoba.

109
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,040
No.

110
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,940
And.

111
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,540
Sushi cake.

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,020
I'll put sushi on the chocolate eclair.

113
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,720
Not only for Christmas and birthdays,

114
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,000
but also for a year.

115
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,280
The cake will sell.

116
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,940
No, no, no.

117
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,720
How can it sell?

118
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,380
I knew it.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,600
Then.

120
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,900
How about this?

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,060
This is a decent cake.

122
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,160
It looks good.

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But if you put this on the cake one by one,

124
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
the fireworks will go up.

125
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,140
The fireworks can go up to rocket fireworks.

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Maybe I can make it.

127
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,640
Right?

128
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,780
Leave it to me.

129
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,240
Now,

130
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,780
if you put this one by one,

131
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,080
you can enjoy Christmas with your family.

132
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,400
Please enjoy the fireworks cake.

133
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,660
Please give me that.

134
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,260
Me, too.

135
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,680
Yes, please.

136
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,920
Here you are.

137
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:19,900
Thank you.

138
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,060
Thank you.

139
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,840
I didn't expect it to sell so well.

140
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,340
Thanks to Ryo,

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,520
a special bonus will come out.

142
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,900
Ryo, Ryo,

143
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,340
I heard the popularity of fireworks cake,

144
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,280
and I got an amazing order.

145
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,880
Make a 10-meter-high cake

146
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,740
for the garden party.

147
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,760
Really?

148
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,200
I was surprised.

149
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,960
This is what I said.

150
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,160
And next.

151
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,660
Please give me two fireworks cakes.

152
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,780
Two.

153
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,200
Two further.

154
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,440
I will pay for him.

155
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,480
Here you are.

156
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,560
Thank you.

157
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,280
I'll have two fireworks cakes, too.

158
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,580
Oh, Ryou.

159
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,440
Ryo, you are so popular.

160
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,240
Very.

161
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,980
I heard it from Chief.

162
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,020
He said he improved the cake making skill too.

163
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,700
I gave it to you.

164
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,400
Well, well.

165
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,220
Ryo-chan, I told you I wanted you to help me.

166
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,240
I did.

167
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,180
What can I help you with?

168
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,340
Making cakes.

169
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,100
Cakes?

170
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,600
Yes, on the day of the event.

171
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,980
I introduced you to the cake shop, but you didn't do it?

172
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,500
As you wanted.

173
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,360
Ryo-chan mastered making cakes in a short time.

174
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,800
Well, if you have the kindness of my hands, then I can do it.

175
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,740
Right? So help me on the day of the event.

176
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,420
I got it.

177
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,760
Instead, give me a part-time job.

178
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,400
I'm a professional, after all.

179
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,680
I know.

180
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,300
This is Ryo-chan's husband.

181
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,580
It's a cake shop that's working part-time!

182
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,340
Eve and Otohime are on a date, right?

183
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:00,980
Yes.

184
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,200
Nana-chan forced me to open the serial schedule.

185
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,950
So I had to enjoy it.

186
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:07,720
I'm sorry.

187
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,060
I have to give you a special treat, so I have to give you a special treat.

188
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,520
I wonder what's better.

189
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,320
After all, it's better to keep the standard, right?

190
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,700
There's no such thing as a course like that on the magazine.

191
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,740
It's like going to see a couple.

192
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,160
Is that so?

193
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,220
Then, is there another unique course?

194
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,020
Leave it to me.

195
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,160
I'll teach you where to get a good mood with just the two of you.

196
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,820
Really?

197
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,240
Senior, thank you.

198
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,980
It's delicious.

199
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,940
Okay, it's over.

200
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,260
The day is over.

201
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,480
To the amusement park with Eve?

202
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,360
That's right.

203
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,800
I was told that they don't take me anywhere every year.

204
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,900
This year, I'll go.

205
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,520
Ryo, you know what I mean, right?

206
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,680
If you go somewhere, I wonder if the children will be happy.

207
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,280
Tell me.

208
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,760
That's right.

209
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,280
I have a feeling.

210
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,500
If you go with me, the admission fee will be free.

211
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,100
Really?

212
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,480
That's great.

213
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,080
I'm counting on you, Ryo.

214
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,540
Leave it to me.

215
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,840
Chief, please come to the Christmas party at my company.

216
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,880
Please come with your grandchildren.

217
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,760
Oh, that's boring.

218
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,600
No, I'll be glad to participate.

219
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Reiko, too.

220
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

221
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,980
I'm a little bad at Eve.

222
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,040
By the way, you said you were busy at Christmas Eve every year, right?

223
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,920
That's right.

224
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,920
I have something to do.

225
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,360
I'm sorry.

226
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,860
It's a shame.

227
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,480
This year, I'll go to the garden at the company.

228
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,900
I'm going to prepare a special cake with a height of 10 meters.

229
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,680
Oh, that's great.

230
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,580
Is Mr. Terai okay?

231
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,700
It's a shame, but I'm going to the amusement park with the children this year.

232
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,980
It can't be helped if it's a family service.

233
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,760
Reiko's help for the cake shop part-time job.

234
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,260
I have to put the Terai family in the amusement park.

235
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,800
It's a party in the middle of the night.

236
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,440
This is enough for me to have a lot of body.

237
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,340
I'll do it with the help of the family.

238
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,060
Well, I'm sorry.

239
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,780
I hope you don't mind.

240
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,940
It's a pity.

241
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,540
I'm sorry.

242
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,660
I'm sorry.

243
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,080
I'll go to the amusement park.

244
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,500
It's a shame, but I'll have a lot of body.

245
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,040
It's a shame.

246
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,400
It's a shame.

247
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,300
I'm sorry.

248
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:26,720
It's a shame.

249
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,060
I'll go to the amusement park.

250
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,220
I don't want to go.

251
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,640
I have to go.

252
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:28,740
Good bye!

253
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,020
Looks like we'll be able to get in by the evening.

254
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,720
Ryo-san, are you ready to set up the fireworks?

255
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,080
Leave it to me. I'll go set it up before I decorate it.

256
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,340
All that's left is to put this switch in and it's done.

257
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,760
It's done.

258
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,660
If I put in 10 pieces, I'll get one of them.

259
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,620
Now, should I get going?

260
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,760
I have to go to Reiko's after this.

261
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,360
I'm so lazy that I can't sleep at night.

262
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,200
Oh, I see. This is inside the cake.

263
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,140
If only I could sleep for a little bit...

264
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,740
Mmm, it's good!

265
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,580
I'll go to bed now.

266
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,100
I'll go to bed now.

267
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,960
Okay, there's no one here.

268
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,540
Okay!

269
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,320
Good!

270
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,800
Let's go!

271
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,980
Hurry up! We won't make it by the evening!

272
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,480
Alright, we have all the materials.

273
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,140
Now let's all do our best again this year!

274
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,020
Now we've finally got 20 of them.

275
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,340
It's noon.

276
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,360
Ryo-chan did say that in the morning she'd be coming.

277
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:17,940
Huh?

278
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,940
Reiko-san!

279
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,520
What are you doing?

280
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,900
Making Christmas cakes!

281
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,600
That went MICHEAL!

282
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,200
I thought it would smell like something.

283
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,760
But why are you here?

284
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,820
My home is under renovation.

285
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,780
So I'm using this place.

286
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,780
I have to make 200 of them today.

287
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,180
200?

288
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,980
Reiko, alone?

289
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,020
Yeah.

290
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,900
Ryo-chan was supposed to help me.

291
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,000
She's a bit drunk, isn't she?

292
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,840
You can't trust someone like that.

293
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,780
Huh? Reiko, your face is a little red.

294
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,560
Yeah, I think I'm a little hot.

295
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,040
Then we'll help you.

296
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,460
Okay?

297
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,440
Of course.

298
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,040
Thank you.

299
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,260
Reiko, what should we do?

300
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,180
Let's start with the BUSHED NOEL's dough.

301
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,940
Let's make it more and more complete.

302
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,180
This one.

303
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,540
BUSHED NOEL.

304
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,940
I think they decorate it and then roll it up like seaweed.

305
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,740
How do you deco...

306
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,540
Reiko!

307
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,460
Reiko!

308
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,520
Are you okay?

309
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,760
I'm so hot.

310
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,080
I have to go to the ambulance.

311
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay.

312
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,140
I have to deliver the cake.

313
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,600
It's a big deal.

314
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,280
It's a very important cake.

315
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,380
But where can I deliver 200 of them?

316
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,600
Huh?

317
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,680
This is...

318
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,400
Dahlia's old home, 37.

319
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,320
Santa Maria's private hospital, 40.

320
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,640
That's...

321
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,200
Right.

322
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,880
Reiko wanted to deliver the cake where it's written on this note.

323
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,720
Right. Reiko wanted to deliver the cake where it's written on this note.

324
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,100
Right.

325
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,040
Reiko wanted to deliver the cake where it's written on this note.

326
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,900
Right.

327
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,580
Right.

328
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,700
What are we going to do with the cake?

329
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,120
We have to do it ourselves.

330
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,400
The recipe Reiko wrote should be somewhere.

331
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,740
We can make it based on that.

332
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,400
Right.

333
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,060
It's a day of Ibu, but it's overflowing.

334
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,180
Let's send a dispatch to the traffic police.

335
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,420
Reiko, don't worry about the cake.

336
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,320
We'll do something about it.

337
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,740
We'll do something about it.

338
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,020
Christmas presents.

339
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,440
Christmas presents.

340
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,140
I'm looking forward to it.

341
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,580
I'm looking forward to it.

342
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,080
I'm looking forward to it.

343
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,700
Christmas presents.

344
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,580
Christmas presents.

345
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,240
Ibu, Ibu says it's empty even if it's a temple.

346
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,160
It must be empty, but is that all right?

347
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,720
Mr. Honda is numb.

348
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,120
Me, too.

349
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,660
I can't eat it anymore.

350
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,100
I'm coming.

351
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,720
Hi, Bobby!

352
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,700
Jodie!

353
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,820
Jodie!

354
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,020
Long time no see!

355
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,980
Thank you for saving me!

356
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,500
Ryo is missing.

357
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,900
Thank you, everyone.

358
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,220
Thank you, everyone!

359
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,360
As expected of the "all of us"

360
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,120
You guys wait outside!

361
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,840
Now let's start.

362
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,700
Papa, make the "no need" part thinner!

363
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,460
You're good, Scott!

364
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,160
Maria, how is Reiko-san?

365
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,800
She seems to have a bad temper.

366
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,040
It seems that her health has improved a little after being beaten.

367
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,220
I'm in trouble. I don't know about this.

368
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,340
What's wrong?

369
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,340
I can't read the details of Reiko-san's recipe in foreign languages.

370
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,980
It's not English. It's French.

371
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,060
I don't know unless I write this myself.

372
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,360
But Reiko-san is in the hospital.

373
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,280
Yes, that's right.

374
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,800
Then, can you put cocoa in the whipped cream?

375
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,860
Like this?

376
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,960
Okay. Then, mix it.

377
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,080
Okay.

378
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,860
It's too late, Reiko-san.

379
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,220
I said it's just here.

380
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,140
Papa, come on in.

381
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,580
Let's go in.

382
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,480
Let's do that.

383
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,640
It's getting crowded.

384
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,940
Yes.

385
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,360
Can't you catch it?

386
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,300
Yes.

387
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,060
Are you okay, Honda-san?

388
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,340
I'm okay.

389
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,740
It's okay. You should be careful not to catch a cold.

390
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,100
Okay.

391
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,740
It's a date course as the guidebook says.

392
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,840
Senpai.

393
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,900
It's a grand party.

394
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,300
By the way, have you seen Ryotsu?

395
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,420
No. It's strange.

396
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,020
He said he would come as soon as I finished the deal with Reiko-san.

397
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,240
He promised Daisuke a present.

398
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,940
Grandpa, it's delicious.

399
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,300
Oh, is that so?

400
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,300
That's strange.

401
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,600
Senpai shouldn't be caught by food.

402
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,560
I prepared roast beef for Senpai.

403
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,300
I prepared roast beef for Senpai.

404
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,780
I prepared roast beef for Senpai.

405
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,580
I made 200 cakes.

406
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:42,740
I made 2000 cakes.

407
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,440
I repeated everything.

408
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,840
I sprayed a lot of powder.

409
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,020
Look at them.

410
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,360
Are you okay?

411
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,920
Good job!

412
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,340
Thank you, everyone.

413
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,820
I just have to deliver the cake.

414
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,460
But all therophiles are scattered all over the place.

415
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,360
Will we be in time?

416
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,220
No worries.

417
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,200
I'll use

418
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,580
Let's go!

419
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:25,900
I'm going to go!

420
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,080
If you insert this sword into the cake and touch the switch inside,

421
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,280
the rocket-type fireworks will fire!

422
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,660
The person who hits it perfectly will be given the cake!

423
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:37,780
The person who hits it perfectly will be given the cake!

424
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,880
Wow, what a great ship!

425
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,820
It looks much better than any of the others.

426
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,040
Then, let's start with the first entry.

427
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,520
Please check the number card you have.

428
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,200
The first entry is this!

429
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,600
Number 214!

430
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,980
Number 214...

431
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,820
It's wrong.

432
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,900
Me too!

433
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,060
That's too bad.

434
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,180
I got it!

435
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:03,900
Yes!

436
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,940
Congratulations!

437
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,260
Then, take the sword you like and insert it into the cake!

438
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,360
I slept well...

439
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,960
Oh no! It's completely blocked!

440
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,240
Everyone must be worried outside.

441
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,360
I made an appointment with the chief and Reiko.

442
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,220
And I also made an appointment with the temple priest.

443
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,980
That's too bad.

444
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:30,820
Next!

445
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,420
Number 75!

446
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,200
It's the poor man.

447
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,320
Number 175!

448
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,900
Grandpa, I've forgotten it too!

449
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,500
Let's see if I can hit the sword next time!

450
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,200
Yes!

451
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,700
Th-This is...

452
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,440
größе!

453
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,980
Have I been taken to the seaside?!

454
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,580
Stop! Someone is here!

455
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,920
Stop!

456
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,180
Please stop it!

457
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,660
If this happens, I must eat all the cake and get out of town!

458
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,400
What the hell is this?

459
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,420
What the hell is this?

460
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,600
Why do I have to do this?

461
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,260
Why do I have to do this?

462
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,440
My whole body is shaking.

463
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,260
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

464
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,880
I have to get out of here.

465
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,340
I got it wrong again.

466
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,280
Please guess the next one.

467
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,320
The next number is...

468
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,220
It's Christmas, so I made the helicopter look like Santa Claus.

469
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,240
It's Christmas, so I made the helicopter look like Santa Claus.

470
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,280
You painted it red?

471
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,660
Bobby.

472
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,180
Why don't you put on a bell?

473
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,720
I really look like Santa Claus.

474
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,060
I got it wrong again.

475
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,500
You're not good at switching.

476
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,880
You're not good at switching.

477
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:53,900
That's true.

478
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,580
But you're not coming.

479
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,780
I always keep my promises.

480
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,380
That's how it is.

481
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,340
What's that sound?

482
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,300
What's that sound?

483
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,380
What's that sound?

484
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:08,480
That's...

485
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,520
Santa Claus!

486
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,460
Merry Christmas!

487
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,260
Merry Christmas!

488
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,120
Merry Christmas!

489
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,560
Merry Christmas!

490
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,700
It's not Rieko this year.

491
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,620
It's the PG Hitter!

492
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,960
Wow, that's amazing!

493
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,980
Ryo, this time is...

494
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,240
I was told to get on the Ferris wheel, but is there something wrong?

495
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:35,680
I was told to get on the Ferris wheel, but is there something wrong?

496
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,360
Rieko, you finished the delivery.

497
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,640
Thank you, everyone.

498
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,700
Rieko, please rest.

499
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,440
Tonight, we'll be on the way out for you and Rieko.

500
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,580
Tonight, we'll be on the way out for you and Rieko.

501
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,720
It's Christmas, but it's not a good idea.

502
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,720
We'll have a mini party together!

503
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:00,020
The next number is number 175.

504
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,820
The next number is number 175.

505
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,420
The next number is number 175.

506
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,520
Yes! I finally got it!

507
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,680
Grandpa, you're amazing!

508
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,940
You did it.

509
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,960
Yes! Number 175.

510
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:09,880
Congratulations.

511
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,080
Now, will you be able to hit the rocket-shaped fireworks switch?

512
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,860
If you do, all these luxurious gifts will be yours.

513
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,440
Now, please.

514
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,280
I'll do it.

515
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,500
I'll take a half-shape for Daisuke.

516
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,080
I'll take a half-shape for Daisuke.

517
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,340
Nana, I'm sorry.

518
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,880
I dragged you around so much today.

519
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
It wasn't fun at all, was it?

520
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,580
No, it wasn't.

521
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,960
I was happy to spend Christmas Eve with Honda-san.

522
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
I was happy to spend Christmas Eve with Honda-san.

523
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,860
Nana...

524
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,480
With the schedule you set,

525
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,240
With the schedule you set,

526
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,980
I wonder if there's anything else...

527
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,880
I wonder if there's anything else...

528
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,480
Today was tough.

529
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,200
But it was a comfortable day.

530
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,500
Let's have some coffee.

531
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,460
Let's have some coffee.

532
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,120
What?

533
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,140
That's the half-shape I made for the president's granddaughter.

534
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,020
That's the half-shape I made for the president's granddaughter.

535
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,980
Shit! I didn't have to eat anything!

536
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,060
Shit! I didn't have to eat anything!

537
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,960
I did it! I'm out!

538
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,460
What? It's my old place, isn't it?

539
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,440
Shit!

540
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,620
Shit!

541
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:18,680
Shit!

542
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,080
I did it!

543
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:24,580
I did it!

544
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,020
I did it!

545
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:25,820
I did it!

546
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,180
Ahhh!

547
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,000
Ahhhhhhh!

548
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,540
Merry Christmas, Ryozu.

549
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:42,760
Merry Christmas, Ryozu.

550
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,040
Ah!

551
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,880
It's so beautiful!

552
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:55,540
This is what Ryou-san said!

553
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,000
So this is what you were talking about.

554
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,300
You're welcome to come.

555
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,300
Ah, it's snowing!

556
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,700
Papa, this is the first time I've seen a Christmas like this!

557
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,940
So pretty...

558
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,720
I wanted to show you this, so I planned to come here.

559
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,180
Hold my hand!

560
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,320
That's too bold.

561
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,540
It's perfect.

562
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,160
A winter Christmas on a fireworks show.

563
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,720
Nana-chan.

564
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,860
Okay.

565
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,520
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

566
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,380
Honda-san.

567
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,540
Nana-chan.

568
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,880
Thank you, senpai.

569
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,920
Here, it's from Ryo-sama.

570
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,920
Wow! This is the second one in a row!

571
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,880
Why am I the only one who hates Christmas so much!

572
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,820
What?

573
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,680
The night after the rain that seems to be calling someone

574
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,840
I walked while looking back

575
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,880
I walked home

576
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,000
My mother waved her hand

577
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,920
At that time, I felt

578
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,340
A strange feeling

579
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,200
So

580
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,840
I tried to walk

581
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,800
On the Ake-do-gai tile

582
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,480
That was black

583
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,140
Everyone was a child once

584
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,660
But everyone forgot

585
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,160
Politicians with great faces

586
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,460
And blue-haired old ladies

587
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,340
Turn around and look

588
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,080
At that corner

589
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,660
You'll see everyone

590
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,580
Let's go

591
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,400
There's a turtle over there

592
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,200
There must be a turtle

593
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,740
Yes

594
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,360
Everyone, come

595
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,380
To our town

596
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,520
Thank you!
