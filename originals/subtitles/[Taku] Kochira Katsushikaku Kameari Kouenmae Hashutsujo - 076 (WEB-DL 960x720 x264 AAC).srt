2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,280
I look up at the sunset floating in the river

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:24,560
I kick a pebble and fly to my shoes

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:33,140
I wonder if I'll go to the taiku I was saving

5
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,940
I was laughed at as it was

6
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,540
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,960
There is only a single punishment and one bad habit

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape is strangely gentle

9
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,540
The cityscape is strangely gentle

10
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,400
From the waterfront of Tongari-boshi

11
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,940
To the taishakuten

12
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,140
The sunset falls

13
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,500
Tomorrow will end like this

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,740
I lost my happiness again

15
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,740
I realized

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,240
I'm an idiot

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,520
I'm an idiot

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:24,800
I'm an idiot

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,700
I'm an idiot

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,020
I'm an idiot

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,420
The Terrifying Box Man

22
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,780
The Terrifying Box Man

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,380
Lockers

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:43,780
A box of metal that stores clothes and daily necessities anywhere, such as at work and school.

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,460
This is the tale of terror related to its lockers.

26
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,700
Zenin

27
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,320
Ah! Director!

28
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,420
Don't open his locker quietly!

29
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:16,880
This is awful!

30
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,040
I thought I could organize this later

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't take any unnecessary actions, Can you wait?

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,320
Don't you dare!

33
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,960
How many times do I have to tell you?

34
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,980
I told you not to bring toys to the escape room!

35
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,960
It's only a little bit.

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,720
It's for a break.

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,020
You're saying you're playing games with your kids, aren't you?

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,340
What?

39
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,100
Really, Ryo-chan?

40
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,500
It's a rumor, chief.

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,880
I'm a police officer.

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,680
There's no way I would do that.

43
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,660
Ryo-san!

44
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,480
Give me Final Paradise!

45
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,760
Give it to me!

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,140
I'll look for it on my own, Ryo-san.

47
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,540
Where?

48
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,180
Here!

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,000
Ryo-san, give me this!

50
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,520
Okay, I'll pull it and give it to you.

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
See you, Ryo-san.

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,480
Give it to me again!

53
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,120
They're strange kids.

54
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,240
They must be mistaking this place for a game store.

55
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,320
Right, chief?

56
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,980
Bakkabon!

57
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,440
I'm going on patrol!

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,960
Cool your head off outside!

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,980
24 hours in a row!

60
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,620
He's a quick runner.

61
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,780
What are you doing, Ryo-kun?

62
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,120
You said you were going to exchange old lockers, didn't you?

63
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,960
Oh, I did.

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,620
I really want to get rid of all the lockers, but I won't let you do that.

65
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,360
It's so cold out here.

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,480
I can't control it.

67
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,080
Hey, Ryo-san.

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,760
What's going on?

69
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,120
I just came to the right place.

70
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,780
Why do I have to do all this?

71
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,620
Shut up!

72
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,160
Go away!

73
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,620
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,240
I shouldn't have done that.

75
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,520
What's that?

76
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,780
"I'm sorry."

77
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,780
Senpai!

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,480
It looks like no one's here!

79
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,480
I'm going back to my old life.

80
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,540
The documents are out of stock, too!

81
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,140
Senpai, what's going on?

82
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,160
My treasure!

83
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,620
Damn it!

84
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,400
He just threw it out!

85
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,000
He's not going to take it out, is he?

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,160
I really miss him.

87
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,320
The chief's back!

88
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,580
It's a disaster!

89
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,700
If he finds out that I'm skipping patrols, I'll get a big hit!

90
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,220
Alright.

91
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm sure the master is going to let the chief know.

92
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,120
But where are you hiding?

93
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,960
Here.

94
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,660
Why me?

95
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,580
If you stay here alone, you'll be suspicious.

96
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm sure he'll be arrested!

97
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,100
Let's have some tea.

98
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,760
Sorry.

99
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,960
Hey, Terai.

100
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,160
Oh, you're the chief.

101
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,340
I thought you came back.

102
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,240
Ryo-san? No, nobody was here.

103
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,360
Oh.

104
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,580
Hey, Terai. Let me introduce you.

105
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,340
Hm?

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
We've been friends for a long time.

107
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,540
I'm the drug lord now.

108
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,900
I happened to meet you there.

109
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,640
Nice to meet you.

110
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,600
Nice to meet you too.

111
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,940
Nice to meet you too.

112
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,960
Are you the drug lord?

113
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,640
Sounds like a lot of work.

114
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,720
Well,

115
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,460
we're actually doing a huge drug deal nearby.

116
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,300
We're about to catch them.

117
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,260
Hey, hey.

118
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,680
Is it okay to talk about that here?

119
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,520
Stop talking about that.

120
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,480
Go somewhere already.

121
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,380
Senpai.

122
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,340
I told you not to speak.

123
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,900
I want to go pee.

124
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,880
What?

125
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,560
No.

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,280
What did you say?

127
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,880
I heard it from around the locker.

128
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,540
Yeah.

129
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,360
Now that you mention it.

130
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,820
Oh no.

131
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,820
He noticed me.

132
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,860
I'm going to pee.

133
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,080
Excuse me.

134
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,280
Oh.

135
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,640
I've been told that you're going to replace the old locker with a new one.

136
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,500
Oh, that's right.

137
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,460
You're going to replace the locker?

138
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,320
Yes.

139
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,800
I can get out of here.

140
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,380
Oh, no.

141
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,520
Where should I put it?

142
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,800
I think you should move this old locker and put it there.

143
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:44,920
Yes.

144
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,400
Ready?

145
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,220
That's kind of funny.

146
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,540
It's weird.

147
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,360
Reiko was cleaning it up for me earlier.

148
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,480
Anyway,

149
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,800
if there's only garbage like the one your dog collected,

150
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,000
throw it away.

151
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,360
Yes, sir.

152
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,560
OK.

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,940
Senpai, it's hot.

154
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,520
Damn it.

155
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,260
I put it in front of the stove.

156
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,600
Oh.

157
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,140
Ugh.

158
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,660
I don't like it.

159
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,200
Senpai.

160
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,040
You, too.

161
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,240
It's hot and it's burning.

162
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,020
Yes.

163
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,180
Gen-senpai, it's more painful to see two naked men together like this.

164
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,820
That's true.

165
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,780
Oh, pee.

166
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,720
What's wrong? Did you pee?

167
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,200
No, I'm fine. I'm just sweating.

168
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,960
That's okay.

169
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,080
What? It's starting to stain.

170
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,640
What's in there?

171
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,240
Oh, no!

172
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,360
Are you okay, Ohara?

173
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,740
It was just a little hot. I'll go cool it down with water.

174
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,200
Terai, move the stove away.

175
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,440
Yes, sir.

176
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,840
Senpai, are you okay?

177
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,980
It was a dangerous place. If we get caught here, it'll be the end of the first volume.

178
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,180
I'll bring you an old locker.

179
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:22,980
Please.

180
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,680
Ready, go!

181
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Okay, okay, if we get out, we're done.

182
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,160
If we get out, we'll be out of here.

183
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,660
Hey, are you okay?

184
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,440
Oh, sorry, sorry.

185
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,040
Ready, go!

186
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,420
Go!

187
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,760
Be more careful, you bastard!

188
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Okay, bye!

189
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,720
See you later.

190
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,580
Okay, we're about to get out.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,280
Hurry up. You can't stay like this forever.

192
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,780
Damn it! I can't use the door! I can't get out!

193
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,920
What? No way!

194
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,000
And what do you mean, you can't get out?

195
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,220
Wait, This is ridiculous!

196
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,340
Hey, you're congratulations on your graduation!

197
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,460
We're not graduating.

198
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,520
But Senpai...

199
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,340
But...

200
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,400
But...

201
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,940
but...

202
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,280
Don't do that to everyone!

203
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,440
I don't have the time!

204
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Don't be angry!

205
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,160
I tried everything I could to kick you out!

206
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,540
C'mon..

207
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,920
Hmph!

208
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,200
Seriously?

209
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,380
It stopped.

210
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,380
Wh-what's going on?

211
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,840
I feel like something's moving.

212
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,800
It looks like it's on the belt conveyor.

213
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,420
Oh, that thing.

214
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,880
It's the sound of the plushie!

215
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,860
The locker's turning and the door's opening!

216
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,880
It's the sound of the plushie!

217
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,820
The plushie's right there!

218
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,540
The plushie's right there!

219
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:33,620
Help!

220
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,640
It's crushed!

221
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:39,900
It's crushed!

222
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,380
It's crushed!

223
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,800
Hey, Honda, you too!

224
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,840
Hey, Honda, you too!

225
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,440
We managed to escape.

226
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,660
Senpai!

227
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,580
We did it!

228
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,540
We did it!

229
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,480
We did it!

230
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,280
Huh? What is it?

231
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,540
Senpai, it's sinking!

232
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,600
I can see it!

233
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,100
Senpai, senpai, senpai, senpai!

234
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,140
Honda!

235
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,360
Senpai, it's sinking!

236
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,060
Honda!

237
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,360
Honda!

238
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,960
I'm going to the sea.

239
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,800
I'm going to the sea.

240
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,480
I'm going to the sea.

241
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,580
I'm going to the sea.

242
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:13,980
I'm going to the sea.

243
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,460
I'm going to the sea.

244
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,300
I'm going to the sea.

245
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,520
I'm going to the sea.

246
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,500
I'm going to the sea.

247
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,180
I'm going to the sea.

248
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,260
I'm going to the sea.

249
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,420
I'm going to the sea.

250
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,340
I'm going to the sea.

251
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,260
I'm going to the sea.

252
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,100
I peed.

253
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,060
I almost drowned.

254
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,800
What's that?

255
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,420
You're a big man.

256
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:45,840
You're a big man.

257
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,680
Wait.

258
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,240
We're not suspicious.

259
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,340
We're not suspicious.

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,840
Shut up, monster.

261
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,540
If you think you're a child, get up.

262
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,880
If you think you're a child, get up.

263
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,080
Stop it.

264
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,040
Stop it.

265
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,520
Stop it.

266
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,580
It's narrow.

267
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,720
It's narrow.

268
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,840
It's narrow.

269
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,380
Come on.

270
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,300
I'm sick.

271
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,540
I'm sick.

272
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,520
Mr. Moriru.

273
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,080
What are you?

274
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,500
The monster is chasing the child.

275
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,460
It's a suspicious creature.

276
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,080
Catch it and send it to the police.

277
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,080
Yes.

278
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,520
You're a big man.

279
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,840
What's that?

280
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,500
What's going on, senpai?

281
00:13:59,660 --> 00:13:59,900
I don't know.

282
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,260
A group of muscular rugby players is coming this way!

283
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,520
Senpai, why are you running away?

284
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,240
You fool!

285
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,200
How dare you let the public know that two police officers were chasing children in the locker room!

286
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,920
How dare you make excuses!

287
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,380
It fell!

288
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,500
It fell!

289
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,200
Senpai, let's break the locker and get out of here!

290
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,560
You're right.

291
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,940
Senpai, why are you running away?

292
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,740
Oh no!

293
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,620
I hid behind the counter.

294
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,600
This is bad!

295
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,560
If I find you here, I'll be killed by the chief!

296
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,320
What's that?

297
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,700
Pretty Yuri, the popular female wrestler!

298
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,440
Senpai...

299
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,960
Quiet!

300
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,540
She's in a good place!

301
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,460
Senpai, what are you doing?

302
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,100
Be quiet!

303
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,280
Get out of my way, Traktor!

304
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,620
I don't want to see you naked!

305
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,380
Oh no!

306
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,200
I almost...

307
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,960
No!

308
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,200
No!

309
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,980
Nozaki!

310
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,860
What's wrong?

311
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,640
Nozaki?

312
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,580
Hey, what are you doing?

313
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,760
Why are you doing this to me?

314
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,780
You're not getting away from our locker room.

315
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,720
Everyone, get out of here!

316
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,320
Yes!

317
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,960
Nozaki!

318
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,720
Nozaki!

319
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,760
Ouch!

320
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,360
Nozaki!

321
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,840
Nozaki!

322
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,560
Nozaki!

323
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,180
Nozaki!

324
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,980
Nozaki!

325
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,980
Nozaki!

326
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,300
Nozaki!

327
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,060
Nozaki!

328
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,420
girl: Hey!

329
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,040
Nozaki!

330
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,420
Chiyo!

331
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,800
Chiyo!

332
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,820
Nozaki!

333
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,440
Nozaki!

334
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
NOZAKI!

335
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:35,720
NOZAKI!

336
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,160
What the hell?

337
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,860
Chiyo!

338
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,920
Chiyo!

339
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,180
It's that locker.

340
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,620
I hid the items in there.

341
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,060
Get out of the car.

342
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,540
Damn it.

343
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,660
It's hard to get out.

344
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,020
It's shaking.

345
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,860
Is it still rolling?

346
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,100
Ouch!

347
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,260
Ouch!

348
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,720
It's hard.

349
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,620
It's hard.

350
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,040
Why is the sky outside?

351
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,360
I'm going to die.

352
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,420
It's going to be hard.

353
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,000
What the hell...

354
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,420
I got to the garden, but I can't get out.

355
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,100
Don't worry about it.

356
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,560
If you don't want to die...

357
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,240
Well...

358
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,020
Did you bring the cash?

359
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,140
I did.

360
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,840
Here.

361
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,380
This is it.

362
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,160
Is the item in there?

363
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,120
Yes.

364
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,980
I hid it in that locker to distract the police.

365
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,700
Then, let me check the item.

366
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,860
No, you can't.

367
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,020
I'll count all your money.

368
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,120
Count it.

369
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:41,820
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

370
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,900
What's going on?

371
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,920
We're at a drug deal.

372
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,600
Why are we in such a place?

373
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,340
I want to go home.

374
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,420
I'll contact the police somehow.

375
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,440
There it is.

376
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,420
I'll go to the police.

377
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,220
One hundred and forty-one.

378
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,020
One hundred and forty-two.

379
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,360
One hundred and forty-three.

380
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,080
One hundred and forty-four.

381
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,400
One hundred and forty-five.

382
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,740
One hundred and sixty-six.

383
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,000
One hundred and sixty-seven.

384
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,300
One hundred and forty-eight.

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,540
I don't have any 10 yen bills.

386
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,580
Don't worry.

387
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,360
This button is for this kind of situation.

388
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll get out of the car and come back.

389
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,820
It's fine if you pull it like this.

390
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,340
I see.

391
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,700
2,999 pieces, 3,000 pieces.

392
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,440
Okay.

393
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,120
That's right.

394
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,100
Now, please check my item.

395
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,620
No, I don't have any.

396
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,120
Boss, look over there.

397
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,800
When did you...

398
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,460
What's going on?

399
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,620
He's my brother.

400
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,940
I don't think he's making a strange fuss after this.

401
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,620
What's this?

402
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,480
Alright, let's hurry.

403
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,360
1... 1... 0...

404
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,660
Oh no!

405
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,420
Commander!

406
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,400
It's Locker!

407
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,100
What?!

408
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,240
This is 110.

409
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,440
Darn it!

410
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:18,460
Ah!

411
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,580
It's cool!

412
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,160
I'll be fine as long as I stay inside of the torches!

413
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,100
You've played a very interesting trick.

414
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,180
You did the job, didn't you?

415
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,580
Yes, we didn't know about it.

416
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,080
I'll kill you with my own hands.

417
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,280
Ouch! Why did you use the gun?

418
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,800
Too bad. It was close.

419
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,580
You shot my car on purpose, didn't you?

420
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,620
No, no! I'll kill you this time.

421
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,780
Too bad.

422
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,740
My limousine!

423
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,620
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

424
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,240
No, no. I didn't hit the locker.

425
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,860
Well, please watch the next one.

426
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,420
Honda!

427
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,000
Honda!

428
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,540
Hold on!

429
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,960
I can't do this.

430
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,520
Hold on!

431
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,340
It came out...

432
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,080
What!

433
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,300
How's that?

434
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,980
I caught him.

435
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,660
I jangan't hold it for a second.

436
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,900
Shall I give you a cool face before being killed?

437
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,060
Power Locker Burn!

438
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,740
Locker Kick!

439
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,280
Don't mess with me.

440
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,140
Honda, are you fainted?

441
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,500
Don't move!

442
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,400
It's the police!

443
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,660
Amigata!

444
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,560
Thanks to the first caller who called me from this port.

445
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,400
But, who is it?

446
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,060
It's dangerous. I almost got caught by the chief.

447
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,280
Let's get out of this locker.

448
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,840
What?

449
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,900
What are you going to do this time?

450
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,200
Hey, we don't care!

451
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,640
Where are you taking me?

452
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,040
Where did Ryo-chan go?

453
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,840
It's been a week since then.

454
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,840
He must be playing somewhere.

455
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,340
It's not a new thing.

456
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,700
I see.

457
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,560
It's amazing!

458
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,400
When can we go back?

459
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,620
I'm sure we can see the town where many people live.

460
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,920
It's so hot.

461
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,660
I want to go home soon.

462
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,020
Don't cry. It's almost time.

463
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,840
Even if you find an empty locker, you can't get inside.

464
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,100
If you do, you may meet me.

465
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:07,780
I want that! I want that!

466
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,420
You tricked the chief.

467
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,500
You are a pimp.

468
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,200
You tricked the chief!

469
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,160
Oh, no.

470
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,480
If you don't try to hide your face,

471
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,200
you will be caught by the chief.

472
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,680
You're a coward!

473
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,380
You're following his direction!

474
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,280
It's too dark.

475
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,480
I heard a voice from the outside.

476
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,460
I know a girl that can see us well.

477
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,240
I have a hug for you!

478
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,500
Oh my God.

479
00:24:36,500 --> 00:25:06,480
I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited

480
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:35,600
I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited,

481
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,840
Thank you for watching.
