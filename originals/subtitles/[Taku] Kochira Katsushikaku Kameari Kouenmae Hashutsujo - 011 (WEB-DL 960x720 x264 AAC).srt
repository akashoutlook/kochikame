I'm sure summer is coming again this year

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,180
I'm sure summer is coming again this year

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,320
I'm coming to Okinawa.

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,580

00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,320
I'm coming to Okinawa.

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,500

00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,520
I'm coming to Okinawa.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:32,800
I'm coming to Okinawa.

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,680
I'm coming to Okinawa.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,360
I'm coming to Okinawa.

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,640
I'm coming to Okinawa.

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,060
I'm coming to Okinawa.

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,100
I'm coming to Okinawa.

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,040
I'm coming to Okinawa.

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,060
I'm coming to Okinawa.

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:56,040

21
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm coming to Okinawa.

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,760
I'm coming to Okinawa.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,240
I'm coming to Okinawa.

24
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,560
I'm coming to Okinawa.

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:00:59,720
I'm coming to Okinawa.

00:00:59,720 --> 00:00:59,820
I'm coming to Okinawa.

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,300
I'm coming to Okinawa.

28
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,780
I'm coming to Okinawa.

29
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,500
I'm coming to Okinawa.

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm coming to Okinawa.

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,460
I'm coming to Okinawa.

32
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,380
I can't take it!

33
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,320
Otsu!

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,560
Nagagawa-kun's Otaku View

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,200
Everyone, I'm going to order lunch. What would you like?

36
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,260
I'd like char siu noodles and dumplings.

37
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,640
I'd like fried lebanon.

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,660
Then I'd like fried rice.

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,920
What about you, Ryo-chan?

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,800
I'd like ramen rice, since it's before payday.

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,580
What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

42
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,460
Don't tell me you're on a diet.

43
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,520
You're not the only one who's on a diet.

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,520
I'm not on a diet.

46
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,220
I'm just working out and getting hungry.

47
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,540
Then you can't eat anything to get hungry?

48
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,340
No, I'm not.

49
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,380
I have a party in Nagagawa today.

50
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,300
Oh, I see.

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,240
Nagagawa, you're going to make a lot of food for tonight's party, aren't you?

52
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,720
Yes.

53
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,820
The chefs and the waiters are going to make it.

54
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,020
That's not something you can eat often.

55
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,580
So you're saying you're hungry?

56
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,280
I'm just kidding. I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,720
You're stupid. You can't work if you're hungry.

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,840
Why don't you just eat lunch?

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm just saying.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,280
The manager and the waiters don't have the right to order their dinners.

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,320
Anyway, can you eat dumplings and char siu noodles in your stomach?

62
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,120
You're not going to be able to eat them at the party.

63
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,880
Y-You're right.

64
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,660
Ryo-chan, dumplings are fine.

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,060
But just char siu noodles.

66
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,720
R-Right.

67
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,820
I'll just stop eating lebanese food and eat ramen.

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,360
Yes.

69
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,960
Yes.

70
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,500
I-I understand.

71
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,860
I-I understand.

72
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,200
"The King of the Kondala Kingdom"

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,120
Nakagawa, what kind of party is the party?

74
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,640
It is the birthday party of the prince of the Kondala Kingdom.

75
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,900
Kondala Kingdom?

76
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,440
I don't think you know it because it is a small country,

77
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,080
but the king and my father have been friends for a long time,

78
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,920
and when they have a day off, they always stay home.

79
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,760
"The King of the Kondala Kingdom"

80
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,940
This is the first time I've seen such a wide Ferrari.

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,900
I asked the president of the Ferrari company to make it a wide body.

82
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,980
But isn't this a misplaced lane?

83
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,280
It's okay. This is the main road of the Nakagawa family.

84
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,820
What?

85
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,780
There was a Nakagawa exit earlier,

86
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,080
but maybe it's Nakagawa's?

87
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,600
Yes, I made it for my house.

88
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,380
What?

89
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,700
You still want to use it?

90
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,120
I'm dying of hunger.

91
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,940
Well, it's already on the road.

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,700
What?

93
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,260
I can't see anything.

94
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,160
The road continues on the edge.

95
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
It's on the other side of the road.

96
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,920
What?

97
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,500
"The King of the Kondala Kingdom"

98
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,120
"The King of the Kondala Kingdom"

99
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,020
"The King of the Kondala Kingdom"

100
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,960
"The King of the Kondala Kingdom"

101
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,020
In sub-zero, if we don't travel, we won't be given a chance to follow that mountain.

102
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,440
How big is the haunted house?

103
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,300
I don't think it is more than 100 times as big as the Disney Land.

104
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,480
What!?

105
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,000
If it's that big, you shouldn't have to go to all the places, not just the front gate!

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,100
We have to build a gate everywhere!

107
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,520
There are 12 gates in total.

108
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,100
Right now, we are heading for the closest gate, the Mito Gate.

109
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,460
The Mito Gate?

110
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,300
There are also the Gaisen Gate, the Seishun Gate, the Hinokuniya Bunzaimon Gate, and so on.

111
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,620
The Mito Gate

112
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,380
As you wish!

113
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,540
We're here. Let's fly it!

114
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:47,900
Huh?

115
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,880
What's wrong?

116
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,200
It looks like it got lost on the road.

117
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,540
Don't get lost at your own place!

118
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,660
I'll navigate right away.

119
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,460
Please confirm your destination.

120
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,340
If we don't use the navigation in the base camp, we won't make it.

121
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,340
Oh, we finally see our home.

122
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,120
It's about the same size as the chief's house.

123
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,360
The base camp is big, but it's small.

124
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,280
What are you talking about?

125
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,340
It's a great house.

126
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,620
I'm sorry, but that's a doghouse.

127
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,800
And then the chief said,

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,160
"You've been paying a loan to the same house as the doghouse for 20 years?"

129
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,820
Ryo-san...

130
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,240
You're laughing too much.

131
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,060
Wh-what?

132
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,460
Is this your house?

133
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,300
Yes.

134
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,940
Actually, it's my room.

135
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,180
I'm not sure you like it.

136
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,620
My parents live in the house that looks to the other side.

137
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,520
Huh?

138
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,400
And that's the sister's house.

139
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,900
It's a very small house.

140
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,380
Come in!

141
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,220
Oh!

142
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,440
Is this the living room?

143
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,080
Wow, that's....

144
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,540
It's the old game "Invader".

145
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,880
It's black and white.

146
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,980
Wow! A cellophane bar!

147
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,140
Wow!

148
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,340
It's amazing!

149
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
It even has a pool!

150
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,960
No, this is a bath.

151
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,240
The pool is over here.

152
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,800
The bath is moving.

153
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,560
No, the whole room is moving.

154
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,140
The whole room?

155
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,960
It's like a pool in an amusement park.

156
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,540
The pool is amazing.

157
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,540
A golf course...

158
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,020
and an airport...

159
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,440
I did it!

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
50,000 points!

161
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,340
Did you see that?

162
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,300
That was Ryo-sama's best shot!

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,740
Forget about him.

164
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,640
What's up?

165
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,060
Oh!

166
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,140
What?

167
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,020
What happened?

168
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,160
Are you ready?

169
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,360
Yes, I am.

170
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,680
Reiko, you look great.

171
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,580
Thank you very much.

172
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,180
I can't believe I have to dress like this.

173
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,900
We have invited all the famous people from all over the world.

174
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,220
Please be patient.

175
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,940
But Ryo-san is wearing a taxi, so he can't change his clothes.

176
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,600
Thank you very much!

177
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,660
Huh?

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,520
What?

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,380
What?

180
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,060
Are you confident?

181
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,760
Calm down, everyone!

182
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,720
No matter what the police are doing,

183
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,360
you have to be calm and calm!

184
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
I'm not confident.

185
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,140
This is an elevator.

186
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,340
What?

187
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,340
The whole room is an elevator?

188
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,760
I live in a house smaller than an elevator.

189
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,360
Welcome.

190
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm the chief.

191
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,320
Welcome to the top floor.

192
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,520
You're the chief?

193
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,280
I'm the chief.

194
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,600
Welcome.

195
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,520
I'm the chief.

196
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:08,640
Nice to meet you, sir.

197
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,400
What?

198
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:20,440
Hi, Ryo-san.

199
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,300
Welcome.

200
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,260
Welcome.

201
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,940
I'm the chief.

202
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,360
I'm going to introduce you to Prince Hondara.

203
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,740
Hey, Prince Hondara!

204
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,400
Oh, Keiichi!

205
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,360
Happy birthday!

206
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,860
Thank you!

207
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,740
I thought you were more of a cool guy, but you're just a fat kid.

208
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,040
R-Ryo-chan!

209
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,080
What is it?

210
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,380
Well, Prince, I'd like to introduce you to my colleagues.

211
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,480
This is my boss, Chief Ohara.

212
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,620
Nice to meet you.

213
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,040
Nice to meet you!

214
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,380
And this is my senior, Ryotsu.

215
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:16,540
What are you talking about, old man?

216
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,560
Prince, your Japanese is terrible.

217
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,540
You idiot! Why didn't you say that first?

218
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,440
I am the Japanese!

219
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,200
I'm going to be the man who will rule the future of Japan!

220
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,380
I'm Ryotsu Kankichi!

221
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,040
This gorilla is so funny.

222
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,920
I didn't say that to a pig!

223
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:39,720
What do you mean by a pig?

224
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,660
Well, it's a birthday party, so let's go.

225
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,040
You don't have to say that after the party.

226
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,700
I'm going.

227
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,380
Forget it.

228
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,980
He's just an stupid idiot, though...

229
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,020
What?

230
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,580
What kind of idiot is a gorilla?

231
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,660
Hey, Ryouta.

232
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,660
Grab a 15-pound piece of���r and 1 pound of trapped corn by hand.

233
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,380
Sorry, but before my brother clears the candle from the cake,

234
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,240
someone else said it's needed.

235
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,700
I haven't eaten anything since yesterday!

236
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,700
Please!

237
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,340
----!

238
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,420
You're a jerk!

239
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:24,820
It's not enough.

240
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,320
Prince...

241
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
I'll forgive you.

242
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,580
It's not enough.

243
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,100
You're a good guy.

244
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,760
What's up?

245
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,100
Keiichi's senior told me to grab some special sushi for you.

246
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,660
You'll be a good king.

247
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,380
Then grab it quickly.

248
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

249
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,460
Wow, it looks delicious.

250
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,240
Hmm...

251
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,080
Yes, I can eat it.

252
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,000
Wasabi!

253
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,240
I'm so shocked!

254
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,720
I'm so sorry for my bad mouth!

255
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,000
Well then, let's ask the prince to turn off the candle light.

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,460
Prince, please come to the stage.

257
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,800
Yes, sir!

258
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,560
Why are you so late?

259
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,300
A bad kid like that won't survive.

260
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,940
Excuse me...

261
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,360
Excuse me...

262
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,460
Excuse me...

263
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Excuse me...

264
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,020
Excuse me...

265
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,500
Translated by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

266
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:11,680
Thank you very much

267
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,340
Bonnie!

268
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,720
Now.

269
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,720
Tch, I failed.

270
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,400
What did you say to the prince?

271
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,900
Oh, it was a joke.

272
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,200
Remember your eyes, little gorilla!

273
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,780
Hey, Bocchan. I need to talk to you.

274
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,920
What?

275
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,760
Is there something suspicious in this mansion?

276
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,460
This isn't normal for the Haunted Palace.

277
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,580
That's true, but...

278
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,140
What's going on, Nakagawa?

279
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,880
It's terrible, sir.

280
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,180
Elephants are after the prince.

281
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,220
What?

282
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,940
Good boy.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,340
Let me start with the對.

284
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,080
This is it.

285
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,820
And this.

286
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,720
Let's see...

287
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,620
This and this and this and this...

288
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,720
This should be enough.

289
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,200
I like it.

290
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,360
You bastard!

291
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,320
Get up!

292
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,440
Get up!

293
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,760
I'm too hungry to run.

294
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,460
Aim well.

295
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,960
I know.

296
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,040
Let's find the terrorists.

297
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,640
Where's Ryo?

298
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,420
He's useless.

299
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,260
First, we need to secure the safety of the guests.

300
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,320
I'm going to go!

301
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,820
I was faster.

302
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,040
I'm faster!

303
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,160
You're being rude to the prince.

304
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,620
There's no difference between a prince and a thief.

305
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,660
This is my business.

306
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,420
I won!

307
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,640
What's going on?

308
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,020
Everyone!

309
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,480
It's dangerous!

310
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,360
Help us!

311
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,360
Terrorists have invaded this mansion!

312
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,360
My meat...

313
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,340
My meat...

314
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,240
It's my meat!

315
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,880
Damn, we failed again.

316
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,260
We have to do something.

317
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,460
We have to go inside and find the prince.

318
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,720
What's going on?

319
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,760
What's this?

320
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,440
Calm down.

321
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,720
The center of this room is moving to the basement.

322
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,080
It's all right now.

323
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,140
My meal...

324
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,540
Are you kidding me?

325
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,240
I haven't eaten anything yet.

326
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,720
Ryo!

327
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,480
Hey!

328
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,400
Ryo, come down!

329
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,220
Forget about that idiot.

330
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,500
The terrorist's target is the prince.

331
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,540
I have to evacuate the prince.

332
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,820
The prince!

333
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,960
The prince!

334
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,140
This is the worst thing this has ever happened.

335
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,160
Hey!

336
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,380
Let go of my hand!

337
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,060
I'm not letting you eat it!

338
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,020
Stop it, idiot!

339
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,540
One last bite!

340
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,100
What's going to happen now?

341
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,400
Wait for me!

342
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,940
Senpai! Oji!

343
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,420
Get out of the room right away!

344
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,620
What? I can't!

345
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,600
My favorite, Torino Maruyaki!

346
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,320
What?

347
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,860
You can't find it anywhere!

348
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,360
I'll eat it or you'll die!

349
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,240
How dare you!

350
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,320
Idiot!

351
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,440
You can't do that!

352
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,520
You're a terrorist!

353
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,640
Here it comes!

354
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,520
Give me your hand!

355
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,240
Idiot!

356
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,340
I told you it's not the time!

357
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,460
You're really something!

358
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,680
Don't you dare ignore us!

359
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,840
What?

360
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,200
Ridiculous!

361
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,360
Damn you!

362
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:41,520
Torino Maruyaki!

363
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,200
I'll show you!

364
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,900
Take this!

365
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,500
Take this!

366
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,040
Go on!

367
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,300
I'll teach you a lesson!

368
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,740
Here we go!

369
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,800
Where did the Torino go?

370
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,960
Now!

371
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,080
What the...?

372
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,800
It's a tamer.

373
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,500
That's enough.

374
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,100
Alright. We're under arrest!

375
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,180
There!

376
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,160
Maruyaki! Where are you?

377
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:35,760
Prince!

378
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,540
Maruyaki!

379
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,860
Prince, do you remember them?

380
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:46,800
Chief!

381
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,620
What a shame.

382
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,220
Don't move!

383
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,280
Everyone, drop your guns and raise your hands.

384
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,460
That's it.

385
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,240
I'll have you go to that world too.

386
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,900
Prince, it's alright.

387
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,700
If only you could turn on that switch...

388
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,140
No! No! No! No! No!

389
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,880
Where is my Maruyaki?

390
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,320
Where is my Maruyaki? Maruyaki! Maruyaki!

391
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,180
You're looking for the big bird Maruyaki, aren't you?

392
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,940
No way...

393
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,680
What are you talking about?

394
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,480
Are you making a wish?

395
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,800
As you wish, I'll let you die.

396
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,780
Master! Maruyaki!

397
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:38,960
Let's eat!

398
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:54,740
We did it!

399
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,300
-Senpai! -We did it!

400
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,080
What's wrong?

401
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,720
We did it!

402
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,920
-Senpai put the switch in the trap! -We did it!

403
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,940
-We did it! -We did it!

404
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,600
Maruyaki...

405
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,820
Where is Maruyaki?

406
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,440
We did it!

407
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,120
We found it!

408
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,360
You did it, Ryo!

409
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,940
You're the best, Chief!

410
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,940
You saved me, Senpai!

411
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,900
Thank you, Ryo!

412
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,120
Well, that's it.

413
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,200
Well, that's it.

414
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,400
You yourselves!

415
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,480
Well, that's it.

416
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,400
That's it?

417
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,520
I...

418
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,180
I'm sorry...

419
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,980
Don't worry.

420
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,060
What a nuisance.

421
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,620
Don't worry, I won't.

422
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:51,740
This is all just for the security.

423
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,060
It's only a mere short notice.

424
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,880
This is all just for the security.

425
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,400
All right.

426
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,080
This is for the security.

427
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,660
This is the Katsushika's first prize.

428
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,140
You did well, Ryotsu.

429
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,740
I don't want that.

430
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,340
I want to eat the maruyaki, the sushi, the gochisosama!

431
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,080
The fact that the party's food was not eaten was a real shock.

432
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,340
Hey, wait!

433
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,520
Who are you?

434
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,820
I'm really happy that you saved me.

435
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,840
I had a really good time last night.

436
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,940
I want you to eat it.

437
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,380
What? Prince!

438
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,660
You're so considerate.

439
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,360
Wasabi!

440
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,300
You got me again!

441
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,600
You're such a fool!

442
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,960
You little brat!

443
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,620
The End

444
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,200
while you're there, come here

445
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,900
and join in the fun! Of course

446
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,500
you can, but this

447
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,620
is how you should have a fun party! You're

448
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,800
so stubborn, you gotta

449
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,600
get used to it! Huh?

450
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,780
I still

451
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,740
won't get used to it. Next time,

452
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,140
we'll have

453
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,740
a fun party! - What?

454
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,920
- What do you mean by "fun"!?

455
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,060
"I'm going to be a good boy"

456
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,580
Let's smile anytime

457
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,040
Even if something terrible happens

458
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,400
Please smile cutely

459
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:50,280
I want to go out with a face that doesn't matter

460
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,380
Hey, please smile

461
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,040
You're not bad

462
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,280
Hey, please smile

463
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,800
You're in the same mood as before

464
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:11,040
Please smile anytime

465
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,220
Because a woman who is dark is not beautiful

466
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,820
You should smile immediately

467
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,220
If you're not a child
