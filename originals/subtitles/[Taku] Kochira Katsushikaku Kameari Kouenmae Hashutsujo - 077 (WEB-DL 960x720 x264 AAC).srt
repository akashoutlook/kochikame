00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
English Translation:

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,860
When he was looking over the river twice

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:22,980
He burned a love stone and the shoes

4
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:06,940
From the main line of the Tungari hat to the taishakuten, the sun sets

5
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,680
Tomorrow will end already, won't it?

6
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,620
If I win, I'll lose happiness again

7
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,340
I realized, I'm such an idiot

8
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:42,020
What's wrong, chief?

9
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,280
You've been sighing since morning

10
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,620
That's right

11
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,820
I heard he had a fight with Hiromi

12
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,720
Really?

13
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,080
He said he didn't want to see her, and he wouldn't let Daisuke, his grandson, see her

14
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,860
Chief, which way?

15
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,800
I'm going to patrol. Please take care of Luce

16
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,620
Yes, sir

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,680
He seems to be pretty stubborn

18
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,140
Yeah

19
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,280
Wow!

20
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,020
He's got three, four, and one!

21
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,200
He's really good

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,020
Yeah!

23
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm going to beat you all

24
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,500
Yay!

25
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,160
I don't think we can win 351-2 in a video game, but crane games are Nash

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,940
By the way, I want to teach you all the tricks of the crane

27
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,000
What are you doing while you're working?

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,180
Chief, this is...

29
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,060
I never skipped any work

30
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,060
I'm preparing for the region...

31
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,760
A hectare's owner?

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,200
Hey, you must be a rich chief, right?

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,540
You look like a real man.

34
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,200
Don't scare me.

35
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,040
But it's rare to see Mr. Ryo.

36
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,200
He's not even in a competition outside the shopping mall.

37
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,420
Competition? What's that?

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,680
You don't know?

39
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,200
It's a crane that takes a super luxurious product.

40
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,420
Really?

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,880
If I don't hurry, it's about time I got married.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,460
Oh, you're already gone.

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,020
Luxurious product, grab it!

44
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,020
I did it!

45
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,780
The Asumoto-Sakaguchi group is the top in the price of luxury products.

46
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, no.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,880
Two of them in one group.

48
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,780
Hey, you.

49
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,520
Why don't you join me in the crane game?

50
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,320
You don't have to run away.

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,960
Hey, you.

52
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,460
Join me.

53
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,180
A gorilla!

54
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,620
Damn it.

55
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,960
Hey, you with long hair.

56
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,660
No way.

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,780
Damn it.

58
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,960
Don't come there.

59
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,520
You're so bad.

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,820
Join me in the crane game.

61
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,660
Mr. Ryo!

62
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,520
That's strange.

63
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,760
Do you always do this?

64
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,420
Don't show your face to illegals.

65
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,740
I'm just kidding.

66
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,640
This is strange.

67
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,680
I hope it's not the front of the entire branch.

68
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,620
Um, chief.

69
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,580
What's wrong?

70
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,140
You look like you had a fight with Hiromi-san.

71
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,940
How did you know?

72
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,360
What? Are you really fighting?

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,940
It's not that serious.

74
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,020
I just called her and she hung up.

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,980
I even visited her house and she didn't show me Daisuke's face.

76
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,880
That's a good fight.

77
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,240
What's the reason?

78
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,660
I think she spilled tea on the idol's autograph paper when she visited Hiromi's house.

79
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,500
What idol?

80
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,160
I think it's a group called Smappi.

81
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,400
What? Smappi?

82
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,820
You know them?

83
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,360
Of course I do!

84
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,520
Smappi is a popular idol group that 99.999% of the Japanese population knows.

85
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,520
They are the most popular idol group in Japan.

86
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,660
They are the most popular idol group in Japan.

87
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,540
They are the most popular idol group in Japan.

88
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,100
The only idol group that I don't know is the leader.

89
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,220
I see.

90
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,920
That's why Hiromi was so angry.

91
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,800
I see.

92
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,020
It's probably the product of this event.

93
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,680
What?

94
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,900
Smappi's autograph paper.

95
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,260
I see.

96
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm impressed by the Kameari Shopping Association.

97
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,800
It's time.

98
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,160
I'd like to give the last one to the next participant.

99
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,280
I'd like to give the last one to the next participant.

100
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,080
Does anyone want to participate?

101
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,480
Let's participate, chief.

102
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,240
What?

103
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,560
Let's participate in the crane game.

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,060
This is a chance to get back together with Hiromi.

105
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,400
What?

106
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,660
The name of the sign is on the sign.

107
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,480
The heavens are ordering you to take the sign and give it to Hiromi.

108
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,340
But...

109
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,320
It's hard for me to skip work.

110
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,920
But if you miss this chance,

111
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,020
you may not be able to get back together with Hiromi.

112
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,080
It's too much.

113
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,320
It's too much.

114
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,260
It's too much.

115
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,220
Parent-child relationship is a little thing that collapses.

116
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,520
My friend has a father and daughter who haven't spoken to him for 20 years.

117
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,200
What's the cause?

118
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,380
It's because his father's fart was smelly.

119
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,700
It's because his father's fart was smelly.

120
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,020
I have to take this chance to restore the good relationship.

121
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,620
I have to take this chance to restore the good relationship.

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,900
I have to take this chance to restore the good relationship.

123
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,240
I'll do my best!

124
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,640
But...

125
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,280
It's not good if someone sees me.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,760
Is there anyone else who has the courage to challenge?

127
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,940
If you don't do it quickly, other people will come out.

128
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,960
If you don't do it quickly, other people will come out.

129
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,480
Go!

130
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,400
Hey!

131
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,260
Thank you!

132
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,260
Now, the last challenger is here!

133
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,130
What's your name?

134
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,970
My name is Ryo...

135
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,050
If you call me by my real name, there's no reason to take the side.

136
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,330
That's right.

137
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,390
We are the "Fukumen Brothers".

138
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,550
I'm No.1 and you're No.2.

139
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,110
What?

140
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,670
You don't have to come out with your real name.

141
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,150
But...

142
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,010
Then, explain the rules quickly.

143
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,190
Yes!

144
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,610
One person is a crane, and the other person controls it.

145
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,270
Within three minutes of the time limit,

146
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,970
you can get as many items as you like.

147
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,650
But you can only return to the starting point once.

148
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,130
The total amount of the winning item,

149
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,370
the top five groups,

150
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,590
can enter the final that will be held soon after this.

151
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:42,850
What?

152
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,490
There's a final?

153
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,910
Yes.

154
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,870
If you win there,

155
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,230
you can challenge the special stage,

156
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,370
"10,000 yen ticket, grab it, human crane".

157
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:51,970
What?

158
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,170
"10,000 yen ticket, grab it, human crane"?

159
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,070
Alright!

160
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,450
I'm getting more and more motivated!

161
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,810
Get ready for the crane!

162
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,490
I'm not good at this.

163
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,790
Don't worry.

164
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,710
If you do as I say,

165
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,110
everything will be fine.

166
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,770
Then, "Fukumen Brothers" team,

167
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,610
start!

168
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,230
First, let me climb.

169
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,450
Yes.

170
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,450
Stop!

171
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,790
Move forward!

172
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:20,490
Roger!

173
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,710
As expected from the president of the Kameari Shopping Association.

174
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,810
It's like they've taken out the prize as long as anything is fine.

175
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,230
That's the signature of the Kameari Shopping Association.

176
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,890
Stop, stop!

177
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,430
Did you find it?

178
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,310
Good job, Ryo...

179
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,670
No, Ichigo!

180
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,610
Wait a minute.

181
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,010
If I take the signature of the Kameari Shopping Association here,

182
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,290
I'll be in trouble!

183
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,370
Alright, your honor.

184
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,830
Then, I'll go back to work.

185
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,110
The final is "10,000 yen ticket, grab it, human crane"!

186
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,450
I'll pretend I didn't see it.

187
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,430
I'll take the crane!

188
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,550
No, it was a mistake.

189
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,190
Let me move forward.

190
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:07,850
I see.

191
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,830
Oh, that's...

192
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,290
The first lot of the Parastepan Doki Doki Memorial!

193
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,110
Stop, stop!

194
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,210
Please take it down!

195
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,210
I already gave up because I couldn't get it,

196
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,510
but I can't believe I'm here.

197
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,770
Oh, that's the modern model 48 series that was a hit 20 years ago!

198
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,690
And it's No. 10!

199
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,710
It's the Tiger II with the 13th-year-old Rommel doll!

200
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,070
No. 2!

201
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,450
To the left!

202
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,850
Good job!

203
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,630
The premium price is 100,000 yen!

204
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,290
Ichigo!

205
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,290
The price of all the products is calculated at a low price!

206
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:42,690
What?

207
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,670
Then, is this only 500 yen?

208
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,430
No, no.

209
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,150
I can't go to the final without taking a more expensive product!

210
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,950
Forward, forward!

211
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,010
Right, right!

212
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,650
Now, go back to the left!

213
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,330
What is that guy taking from a while ago?

214
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,630
No, no, no!

215
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,730
It's the Fukumen Brothers No. 1!

216
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,490
Our goal is to get the signature of the Smappi!

217
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,790
Look for it!

218
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,710
I'm looking for it!

219
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,590
I'm sure he's trying to get rid of something that might get in the way!

220
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,550
I can only see that he's choosing a more expensive product and taking it.

221
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,030
Oh?

222
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,430
That's it!

223
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,330
What are you doing all of a sudden?

224
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,950
It's the No. 2, not the 2nd one!

225
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,690
That's it!

226
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,290
There's a signature underneath it!

227
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,590
Isn't it the Smappi's signature?

228
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,110
Huh?

229
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,110
No, it's not!

230
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,150
It's the signature of another idol!

231
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,910
Really?

232
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,190
That's strange.

233
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,190
I'm sure the signature is only for the Smappi.

234
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,130
No, it's not!

235
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:38,570
You!

236
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,970
Hey, that was Smappi!

237
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,830
But it's not in good condition, so I can't get it.

238
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,830
You'll get it if you stretch your legs!

239
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,530
Oh no!

240
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,150
I got it!

241
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:49,870
I got it!

242
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,130
You're such a troublemaker!

243
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,790
Now, take it!

244
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,850
Oh no!

245
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,670
I got it again!

246
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:54,770
It's broken!

247
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,190
You're such a troublemaker!

248
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,110
I got it!

249
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,150
I got it again!

250
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,270
I got it again!

251
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,490
Huh?

252
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,350
Now, you'll get it this time!

253
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,790
I'm sorry!

254
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,170
I can't take it anymore!

255
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,470
You should throw it away somewhere!

256
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,130
I can't do such a wasteful thing!

257
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,770
Then, take it with your mouth!

258
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:16,950
Damn it!

259
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,690
What's wrong with him?

260
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,590
What?

261
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,430
What's this?

262
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,170
What are you doing?

263
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,430
Take the signature now!

264
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,890
This is the legendary Toyota 2000GT!

265
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,110
I can't believe it's here!

266
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,730
I don't care about cars!

267
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,410
I'm signing it!

268
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,630
If you take this, you'll definitely get into the finals!

269
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,050
What's the finals?

270
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,050
I want to sign it!

271
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,820
If this happens...

272
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,550
That's not it!

273
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,330
I'm signing it!

274
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,750
Amazing!

275
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,250
I'm supporting the car with my teeth!

276
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,930
This is a great 10th anniversary!

277
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,890
Oh, no!

278
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,150
It's time!

279
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,110
Oh!

280
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,510
I'm supporting the car with my teeth!

281
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,470
Is this the end?

282
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,710
The final score is...

283
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,910
272,000,000 yen and 95,000 yen!

284
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,830
The total cost is...

285
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,370
A total cost of...

286
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:11,870
2,720,000,000 yen and 95,000 yen!

287
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,970
It's not over yet!

288
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,710
I'm going home.

289
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,950
Wait, it's the finals!

290
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,450
I just wanted the signature!

291
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,230
It's the final!

292
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,410
You can't even take a picture of the sign in front of you.

293
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,190
I really couldn't take it.

294
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,830
You're so stubborn.

295
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,230
I don't want to hear any excuses.

296
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:34,110
After all, you used me and Hiromi's fight to get into this game.

297
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,750
Oh no, he's looking at me.

298
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,090
Come on, let's go back to work.

299
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,450
Wait a minute.

300
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,890
We can take a picture of the sign of Smoppy even in the finals.

301
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,370
What?

302
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,530
That's right.

303
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,010
The prize for the finals is something else.

304
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,450
I don't mind if you give me one more.

305
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,350
Oh, yes.

306
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,970
Do you have a signature of Smoppy?

307
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,230
I'll take it for sure this time.

308
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:57,910
I want to get back together with Hiromi.

309
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,910
You're trying to get into the weakness of people.

310
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,690
Well, let's do our best in the finals.

311
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,510
Mr. Uemura, the finals has begun.

312
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,090
I'm sorry we kept you waiting.

313
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,070
The Himeari Shopping Association is going to host the finals of the Himeari Human Crane Tournament.

314
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,870
There are five to ten athletes who have won the qualifying.

315
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,330
It's pretty tough to come out of the finals.

316
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,230
It's going to be fine this time.

317
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,750
Leave it to me.

318
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,310
I'll win the finals for sure.

319
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:47,470
I'll show you.

320
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,870
It's a signature.

321
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,030
Of course.

322
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,270
It's a signature of the Smappi.

323
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,330
No one will forget it for a moment.

324
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,570
How suspicious.

325
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,970
Now, for today's day,

326
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,590
we have a special guest.

327
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,010
He's the local police chief of the local police station,

328
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,990
Mr. Gomes Tonda.

329
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,390
Hello, hello.

330
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,270
The first stage of the final round

331
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,450
is the Piranha Stage

332
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:13,870
in the water.

333
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,410
In this water tank,

334
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,710
there are luxurious products

335
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,330
that have been purified.

336
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,250
However,

337
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,230
there is a Piranha in the water tank.

338
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,030
If you dive for too long,

339
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,610
you will be attacked by Piranha.

340
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,370
So please be careful.

341
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,070
Let's start.

342
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,590
The top battle is

343
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,970
the Atsumi Buying Team.

344
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,930
I thought my heart would stop.

345
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,350
When the chief came...

346
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,430
It's okay.

347
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,190
We have this mask.

348
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,370
You can't get caught.

349
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:45,970
But,

350
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:46,890
if you want,

351
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:47,670
you can't get caught.

352
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,490
Chief,

353
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,070
in the case my acquaintance handled,

354
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,090
my daughter made fun of my father.

355
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,350
The cause was

356
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,970
that my father used my daughter's towel

357
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,550
without any hesitation.

358
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,090
No way.

359
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,330
It's just a towel.

360
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,390
That's dangerous.

361
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,250
If you don't do it when you can get along with each other,

362
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,690
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

363
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,110
On the other hand,

364
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,430
you will have hatred for each other,

365
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,770
and you may have to take a period of life.

366
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,830
Is that okay?

367
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,250
Chief,

368
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,170
please don't worry about the chief.

369
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,730
If you don't think about it,

370
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,010
you'll be caught.

371
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,810
Is that okay?

372
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:25,650
I,

373
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,390
I understand.

374
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,610
Next,

375
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,590
the next challenger

376
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,690
to the Piranha Stage

377
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,610
is the top of the qualifying team,

378
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,070
the Fukumen Brothers Team.

379
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,770
Chief,

380
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,470
don't be nervous.

381
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,130
We'll find out.

382
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,150
Okay,

383
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:40,730
we're ready.

384
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,030
Then,

385
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,490
the game starts.

386
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,530
The game starts.

387
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,090
The game starts.

388
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,430
The game starts.

389
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,290
The game starts.

390
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:47,630
We're going to the Name and state not the time.

391
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,070
Then,

392
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,690
I'm sorry,

393
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:48,850
sorry.

394
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,250
Oh,

395
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:51,490
oh,

396
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:51,970
it's hot.

397
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,690
The surface is reflected,

398
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,250
so it'sЛ

399
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,750
It's quite ugly.

400
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,310
I don't care.

401
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,250
I have no choice.

402
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,250
You can call a break.

403
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:00,910
ah

404
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:00,990
Yeah!

405
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:09,650
Ah! Did you invite Piranha with a flashy landing?

406
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,690
They are noisy.

407
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,310
I won't make Piranha a problem at all.

408
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:23,970
I was off the schedule.

409
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,270
There's nothing good.

410
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,750
If this happens, I'll win the game.

411
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,270
What?

412
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,370
What's that?

413
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,850
That's right!

414
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,690
Why didn't you take it? You should have noticed.

415
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:50,110
No, I mean number one!

416
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,190
Here's the time!

417
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,150
What's the total amount of the prize money?

418
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,170
128,721 yen.

419
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:00,670
The total is...

420
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,830
They won't pay me.

421
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,210
Here's the point.

422
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,290
Ah!

423
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:04,930
I have one!

424
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,330
What?

425
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,850
I'll sell it all here.

426
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,530
Excuse me.

427
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,990
The Main Brothers' team won the top spot.

428
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,630
Of course.

429
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,990
Why didn't you take the sign?

430
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,310
You should have seen me.

431
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,470
You didn't notice?

432
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,530
What delighted me?

433
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,930
No oxygen bombs.

434
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,190
I can't wait to die.

435
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,910
I don't have time to decide.

436
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,470
I'll talk about that later.

437
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,610
Hey, you guys.

438
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,290
You didn't see me?

439
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,610
Idiot!

440
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,330
Move as you're told, No. 2!

441
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,470
What do you want, Ryotsu?

442
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,210
We have to talk about the president's suspicions.

443
00:17:53,210 --> 00:18:00,290
If he knows our true identity, he won't think I'll hit the president.

444
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,750
That's possible, but...

445
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,930
Our goal is to win, so don't lose your temper.

446
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,890
Sorry!

447
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,070
Don't apologize!

448
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,930
We won't do it seriously.

449
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,930
If you don't do it, the president will find out.

450
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,410
If he finds out, you're fired.

451
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,170
You don't get promotion or bonus.

452
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,010
Do you get it?

453
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:21,970
I get it.

454
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,890
You have to do it properly next time.

455
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,310
Oh!

456
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,250
He's so powerful!

457
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,350
I thought I'd stop him from playing the piano.

458
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,070
But he didn't seem to be very talkative.

459
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,990
It's the final stage.

460
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,690
Up to now, the top team is...

461
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,110
The X-Men Brothers team, 397,5527 yen.

462
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,010
Only the cost is included.

463
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,410
And the winning team is...

464
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,890
The 10,000-yen crane.

465
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,630
This is a challenge for the 10,000-yen crane.

466
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,570
Oh!

467
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,550
I get the prize!

468
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,770
I can't trust him anymore.

469
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,930
This is it.

470
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,710
It's a big deal, Ryotsu.

471
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,870
We're about to take off our masks.

472
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,550
What?

473
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,930
Oh, it's true!

474
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,010
It's a big deal if the president finds out.

475
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,030
The promotion doesn't matter, but you won't get bonuses.

476
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,350
I'll be back!

477
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,010
- - You

478
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,830
're late, Ichigo. You

479
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,690
're so slow. Come

480
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,170
on, get to your position. Wait,

481
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,350
wait, wait. I'll

482
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,950
get the Smutpy sign for sure. The final

483
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:45,890
stage of the final match is the Battle Royale Balloon Bomb Stage! The balloons

484
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,910
have bombs on them, and they explode when they touch them.

485
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,970
The white powder is the bomb, right?

486
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,210
It's a common thing on TV.

487
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,310
Now, watch this.

488
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,790
Which team will be able to win the battle and win 10,000 yen?

489
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,850
The final stage...

490
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,790
Start!

491
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,230
What's wrong, Ichigo? Why aren't you moving?

492
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:18,890
What's wrong, Ichigo? Why aren't you moving?

493
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,990
I can't do it. Let's switch.

494
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,870
I can take at least one of the sign sign.

495
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,590
I said I can't win.

496
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,430
Don't say anything. Just move.

497
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,890
I can't do it.

498
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,590
If you're really not going to move...

499
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,430
What?

500
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,850
How dare you!

501
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,750
Let me go!

502
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,650
It's for the bond between father and daughter.

503
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,950
I'm sorry, but can you help me?

504
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,410
It's dirty. Let go of that hand and come back.

505
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,610
If you get a sign...

506
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,710
You're so arrogant.

507
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,950
Then, how about this!

508
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,410
Stop!

509
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,070
Stop!

510
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,010
Igo, switch with me.

511
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,190
I'll get a sign this time.

512
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,850
Can you trust me?

513
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,970
Come on.

514
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:07,390
I'm not feeling well.

515
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,600
Igo!

516
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,990
You're so tough.

517
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:16,390
What's wrong?

518
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,610
You're not doing it right!

519
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,730
Give up!

520
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,450
I won't take your orders!

521
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,450
Where is Sai Nishikishi?

522
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,710
Stop the nonsense!

523
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,170
Don't get in my way!

524
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,230
Where is Sai Nishikishi?

525
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,350
Sai Nishikishi...

526
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,430
Where is the sign of Smuppi?

527
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,650
There it is!

528
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,590
We did it!

529
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,910
Now we can make up with Hiromi!

530
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,610
That's...

531
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,250
It can't be!

532
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,290
Everyone, get in the car!

533
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,210
The End

534
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,430
I'm so nervous about the memorial...

535
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,810
The Toyota 2000 GT...

536
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,870
Too bad, you know,

537
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,550
Mr. Ichigawa of the Fukumen Brothers.

538
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,710
What?

539
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,570
No, Mr. Ryozu Kankichi!

540
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,410
S-S-Sire!

541
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,990
You did it again, didn't you?

542
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,510
Not really...

543
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,290
There are good news and bad news,

544
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,130
but which do you want to hear first?

545
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,090
Well, the bad news first...

546
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,370
You're so brave.

547
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,050
This time,

548
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,150
you'll pay for all the damage, Ryozu-kun!

549
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,990
No way!

550
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,350
It's all because of No. 2...

551
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,330
No, it's all because of Chief Ohara!

552
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,430
He's doing this because he's so annoying!

553
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,870
Ohara-kun?

554
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,430
Sign...

555
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,490
Sign...

556
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,930
Smuppi's sign...

557
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,270
Where is the Smuppi's sign?

558
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:14,930
Where is it?

559
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,910
Where is it?

560
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,250
It's...

561
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,770
Smuppi's sign...

562
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,090
The Smuppi's sign...

563
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,210
See? Chief Ohara, right?

564
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,470
No, it's someone else's sign.

565
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,510
There's no way a serious man like Ohara-kun

566
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,890
would be here.

567
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,570
That's right, there's no mistake!

568
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,350
No way!

569
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,110
Chief, what about the good news?

570
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,730
You don't have to work anymore, Ryozu-kun.

571
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,610
You're fired!

572
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,230
You're fired!

573
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,410
Please, let me finish this properly!

574
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,910
There's a serious problem!

575
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,370
You're fired!

576
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:51,930
You're fired!

577
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,650
You're fired!

578
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:53,630
You're fired!

579
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,370
You're fired!

580
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,530
You're fired!

581
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,970
You're fired!

582
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,430
Nagagawa!

583
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,090
What do you mean by quitting the police?

584
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,210
What?

585
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,210
Did your father decide it?

586
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,790
I'm not joking!

587
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,930
It's the job you chose, right?

588
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,030
Are youсть throw away your heart?

589
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,430
I have no choice but to be with you, either!

590
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,490
Next time on "The Fiery President: The Father of Nakagawa"

591
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,830
I look forward to working with you!

592

593
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,690
"The Father of Nakagawa"

594
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,370
I'm surprised

595
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,950
I'm startled

596
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,170
I'm surprised

597
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:39,830
I'm surprised

598
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,210
Bia Bia!

599
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,910
Solving it!

600
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:41,870
Do-ka Do-ka!
