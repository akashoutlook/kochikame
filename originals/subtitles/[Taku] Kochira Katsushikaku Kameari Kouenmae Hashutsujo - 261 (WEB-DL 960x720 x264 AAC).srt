1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,360
"When you watch TV,"

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,040
"make your room bright and try to look away."

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,960
Come to me, the one without money!

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,900
I'm not here, so don't worry.

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,880
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

6
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,120
It'll be alright eventually.

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,000
You understand, don't you?

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,680
You understand, don't you?

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,360
If you understand, then come to me quietly!

10
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,900
"The

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,060
Honda!

12
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,920
The weather was great!

13
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,620
The two nights, three days of luxury,

14
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,060
the journey of Izuhakone, the pair, the Gosho experience!

15
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,540
This is also a good life of my daily life, isn't it?

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,880
Um...

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,860
I'm not the one who got that right.

18
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,240
Besides, I was going to invite Nata-chan, not you,

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,860
but you said no.

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,080
Say something, Honda!

21
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,740
No, I didn't!

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,900
The train is coming.

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,600
Please wait inside the white line.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,360
Oh, the timing of the train...

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,680
What the hell is this?

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,680
Huh?

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,940
It's a train!

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,160
Yeah, it's a luxurious train...

29
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,160
Wait!

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:00,880
Hm?

31
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,720
Wha-what the hell?

32
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,940
Don't get on this train!

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,960
Hey! What are you doing?

34
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,780
This is a special train!

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,320
Ordinary people can't take it!

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,700
A special train?

37
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,140
Got it!

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,320
Huh?

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,040
What is it?

40
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,460
What is it?

41
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,100
What is it?

42
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,420
What is it?

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,180
A smooth cosmos!

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,020
A train journey to the sun,

45
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,460
Shipopo Shipopo Shiposhiposhipopo

46
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,480
Come on everybody

47
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,660
Shipopo Shipopo Shiposhipopo

48
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,360
What's up with that old man?

49
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,080
What's so rude?

50
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,620
Listen up

51
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,300
The president of the Gosho-Gawara Group

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,880
Gosho-Gawara Kingorohno-suke

53
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,800
Saemon-Taro-sama will be the president

54
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,020
Masaaki

55
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,320
I'm sorry

56
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,260
President

57
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,900
I was mistaken

58
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,900
I was trying to get on the president's train

59
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,320
I was trying to get on the president's train

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,920
I did it

61
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,660
Hello

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,820
I'm the president of Gosho-Gawara

63
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,700
That's great

64
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,040
As expected of the president

65
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,940
Wonderful

66
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,580
I'm impressed

67
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,560
That's right

68
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,420
That's right

69
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,180
That's right

70
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,780
What are they?

71
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,440
What are they?

72
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,120
I think it's Gosho-Gawara Group

73
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,700
It's a top-class company in Japan

74
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,380
that makes space rockets from Trump

75
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,340
It's a top-class company in Japan

76
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,440
It's a top-class company in Japan

77
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,200
The president there is a very good man

78
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,760
The president there is a very good man

79
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,040
I see

80
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,580
President and his subordinates

81
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,820
The rate of employment is high

82
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,340
The rate of employment is high

83
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,320
They all work hard

84
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,820
They all work hard

85
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,560
I forgot something important

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,120
I forgot something important

87
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,520
What is it?

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,100
It's a station lunch box

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,860
The lunch box

90
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,440
It's over there

91
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:58,960
Masaki

92
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,060
Yes, what is it, president?

93
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,100
I've got one

94
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,220
If you're full, it's time for dinner

95
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,380
Ben Ben Ben

96
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,660
I love lunch boxes

97
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,420
It's a station lunch box

98
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,900
Give the president a station lunch box

99
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,040
Yes, sir

100
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,120
President, it was a fantastic lunch box

101
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,840
President, it was a fantastic lunch box

102
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:21,940
President, it was a fantastic lunch box

103
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,760
Which should I choose?

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,020
Which should I choose?

105
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,280
This is mine

106
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,140
This is mine

107
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,120
I'll pay for it

108
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,840
I'll pay for it

109
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,320
Give me everything

110
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,700
What?

111
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,400
I sold it

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,700
I sold it

113
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,880
I sold it

114
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,420
At least it was just a drink

115
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,380
At least it was just a drink

116
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,000
What?

117
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,060
What?

118
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
I'll pay for it

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,300
What?

120
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,500
What?

121
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,340
What?

122
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,840
What?

123
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,300
What the hell

124
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,940
What the hell

125
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,280
What?

126
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,920
I found one

127
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,840
I found one

128
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,020
Bells ringing, bell-marking.

129
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,260
Let's have a great lunch!

130
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,560
Bravo!

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,220
Hey! Don't take everything!

132
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,000
Just one! Come on!

133
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,680
Wow, what a great view!

134
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,040
Senpai, look at this!

135
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,440
It's a great view!

136
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm so hungry that I didn't have lunch.

137
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,840
I'm so hungry that I didn't have lunch.

138
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,720
No way!

139
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:06,840
I'm so hungry that I didn't have lunch.

140
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,440
I still haven't had lunch!

141
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,980
It's still lunch time.

142
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,300
Oh!

143
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,120
There is a tennis court!

144
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,160
There are so many girls.

145
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,540
I wonder if they are girls.

146
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,620
There is a cute girl!

147
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,500
Yes!

148
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,680
Hey, you're doing it!

149
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,300
You're young, aren't you?

150
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,720
Senpai, you're hungry, aren't you?

151
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,460
Even if I don't have lunch, I'll come out when it's time.

152
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,620
Now I'm hungry.

153
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,240
Let's fight one more fight!

154
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,060
Don't you dare!

155
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,100
Come on, Senpai!

156
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,640
Go ahead, take it easy!

157
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,380
I just want to have lunch!

158
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,060
Don't fight!

159
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,360
If you don't want to go in,

160
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,740
You're an idiot!

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,740
I'm saying, don't fight!

162
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:12,880
Take it easy!

163
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,220
Ah, they are the same as before.

164
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,900
They were also here.

165
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,580
Boss, I'm ready.

166
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,000
How is it?

167
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,280
It suits you very well, boss.

168
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,740
What a cool guy.

169
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,500
He doesn't look like a tennis player.

170
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,680
He doesn't look like a tennis player.

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,800
Oh, I have an idea.

172
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,120
What is tennis?

173
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,000
Is it a ball in the hand or a ball in the hand?

174
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,880
Aim for the ace, ace, ace, ace.

175
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,700
That's a great idea, boss.

176
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,020
Hey, Horashi.

177
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,400
Let's go to the bathroom after we get home.

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,920
That's a good idea.

179
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,200
Oh, I have another idea.

180
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,200
What is tennis?

181
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,100
It's a game of girls.

182
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,400
Don't do it anyway.

183
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,640
Then teach me how to play tennis.

184
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,000
That's great.

185
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,480
No, that's not what the boss wants to say.

186
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,120
Is there a female coach here?

187
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,220
No, I'm the only coach here.

188
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,820
Oh, no.

189
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,620
Find a female coach immediately.

190
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,960
Hurry up.

191
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,920
Yes, sir.

192
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,040
A female coach.

193
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,560
A female coach.

194
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,660
A female coach.

195
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,740
A female coach.

196
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,500
A female coach.

197
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,460
What are they doing?

198
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,220
They're making a fuss.

199
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,680
It has nothing to do with us.

200
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,900
Hey, you guys.

201
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,680
What?

202
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,360
Is there a female tennis coach or someone you know?

203
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:50,980
What?

204
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,700
What is it?

205
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,440
If you know, bring me a big ball.

206
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,980
Why are you suddenly saying that?

207
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,780
Please.

208
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,300
I'll pay you any amount of money.

209
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,400
What?

210
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,960
If it's a female coach, any one is fine.

211
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,860
Is there one here?

212
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,140
Leave it to me.

213
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,380
Oh, okay.

214
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,060
Sorry to keep you waiting.

215
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,200
I'm a coach, Ryo Tsukanco.

216
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

217
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,080
What do you think, do I look good?

218
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,520
What's the point of being a female coach?

219
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,700
You're just a female player.

220
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,100
In short, I just need to look like a female coach.

221
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,300
That's enough.

222
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,280
Senpai, it's too much.

223
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,540
Is that so?

224
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,920
Masaki.

225
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,960
Yes, sir.

226
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,920
I made a wig.

227
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,440
It's wonderful.

228
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,340
When a female coach arrives, you must tool myself with "What can I do?"

229
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,260
So let's try it together.

230
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,140
Huh?

231
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,560
Take a look over here, it'll do.

232
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,160
Was it your taste, that woman?

233
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,520
I didn't know I had such a taste.

234
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
Nice to meet you.

235
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,580
What the...

236
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
What's the matter?

237
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,900
I'm back. Please return it.

238
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,960
I'm going to hit the president's racket.

239
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,580
What? Then I won't be able to play tennis.

240
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,760
What if you hurt the president?

241
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,060
I don't want to play tennis.

242
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,700
If you want money, do as I say.

243
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,340
I got it.

244
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,200
Here we go.

245
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,080
Take this.

246
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,560
Take this.

247
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,600
Here we go.

248
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,220
Did I hit it?

249
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,200
Too bad. It's out.

250
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,020
It's a great shot, president.

251
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,760
Professional.

252
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,600
No one can take it.

253
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,620
I can't lose to anyone in tennis.

254
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,100
What? That was out.

255
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,980
President's shot was out.

256
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,800
You don't want money?

257
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,360
I got it.

258
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,000
I got one.

259
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,800
I saw it one day.

260
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,460
On the TV, the ball comes and goes.

261
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,760
It comes and goes.

262
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,680
It comes and goes.

263
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:23,820
It comes and goes.

264
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,000
It comes and goes.

265
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,440
It comes and goes.

266
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,780
It comes and goes.

267
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,400
It comes and goes.

268
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,760
It comes and goes.

269
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,220
It comes and goes.

270
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,320
It comes and goes.

271
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,820
It comes and goes.

272
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,080
It comes and goes.

273
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,520
It comes and goes.

274
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:31,540
It comes and goes.

275
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:31,640
You know what?

276
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,340
So, I don't want to play tennis.

277
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,020
Let's play tennis and start over.

278
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,780
Come on.

279
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,260
You can't beat me.

280
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,920
Good game.

281
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,260
Go to the Natsuma четting.

282
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,120
A man who is at the top of the game.

283
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,500
Are you okay, Senpai?

284
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,900
I've come up with a good idea.

285
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,200
I can rally if I use this.

286
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
I see. So that's how it works.

287
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,280
Let's go!

288
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,320
Captain, now!

289
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,100
Captain!

290
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,400
Captain!

291
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,540
Captain!

292
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,620
This is really tennis.

293
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:39,040
I've finished one round.

294
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,020
Tennis is really fun.

295
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,560
I want to play it again with everyone.

296
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,580
That's it!

297
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,440
Thank you!

298
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,020
I'll never do it again.

299
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,380
I can't stand it.

300
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,220
This stupid tennis.

301
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:10,860
You eat a lot.

302
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,680
I moved my body yesterday.

303
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,040
It must have been hard.

304
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,140
But you got a lot of money, right?

305
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:18,860
Yes.

306
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,720
Let's play as much as we can today.

307
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,260
Let's play as much as we can.

308
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,020
They're so early in the morning.

309
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:27,880
Hey!

310
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,760
How was yesterday?

311
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,340
Are you going somewhere?

312
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,460
The president suddenly said he wanted to play golf.

313
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,100
I'll come with you.

314
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,500
It's about him.

315
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,700
Don't make a crazy request like yesterday.

316
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,940
That's a good idea.

317
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,620
Maybe we can play the game later.

318
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,820
If I'm an important person,

319
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,680
this is my chance.

320
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,060
He's going to make it.

321
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,180
He's going to make it.

322
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,440
I'll when I'm gone.

323
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,180
When I'm done, I'll start playing.

324
00:13:59,520 --> 00:13:59,740
If you come, please.

325
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,260
But that's...

326
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,920
A big chance.

327
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,780
You made another loan?

328
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,520
Of course.

329
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,860
One is up.

330
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,500
One shot.

331
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,960
I'll show you, hototogi.

332
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,660
Hohohohekyo. That's a good one.

333
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,340
Ha!

334
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,600
The president wants to get a whole-in-one.

335
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:33,980
What?

336
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,140
Follow him.

337
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,800
Uh...

338
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,760
Here you go.

339
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:41,860
Here you go.

340
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,900
Koshokawara.

341
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,120
What did you do?!

342
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,500
Zip.

343
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,280
It's Ikeboccha.

344
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Leave it to me.

345
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,240
I can't do it. I'm going to go over.

346
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:27,980
President, thank you. I'm a new member.

347
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,580
I want to ride a horse and run as far as possible.

348
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,400
Run, run, run.

349
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,640
It's a horse. President is very generous.

350
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:38,900
I'm very generous.

351
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,740
What? I just started golf.

352
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,860
Why do we become horses?

353
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,920
Because the real horse doesn't listen to the president.

354
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,460
Aki, Kashi, Yamawa, Akai, Momiji, Gari, gather everyone.

355
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Momiji, Gari.

356
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,040
Isn't that something different?

357
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,620
I hope the president agrees.

358
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,240
Speaking of Izu, Izu's踊り子 is the best.

359
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,260
Izu's踊り子.

360
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,800
Next year, this month, tonight, this moon.

361
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,680
No, this is a temporary horse.

362
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
I can't notice it if I stay quiet.

363
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,080
The sea is wide and big. I envy Hana-chan who is fishing all the time.

364
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,720
I'm going to fish this time.

365
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,660
Speaking of fishing, I want to fish.

366
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,420
I want to fish if I'm from Kyushu.

367
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,680
The president is very generous.

368
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
But how can I fish?

369
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,320
Leave it to me.

370
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,500
Welcome.

371
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:56,880
Dad.

372
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,300
Welcome.

373
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,640
What should I do?

374
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,380
Everything.

375
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,500
What?

376
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,400
With this.

377
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,820
Thank you.

378
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,780
Oh, I'm tired.

379
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,300
I will go.

380
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,880
The rest is up to you.

381
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,460
I'll stay beside you.

382
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,580
Really?

383
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,840
I did it!

384
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,100
The president is right.

385
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,700
The president is right.

386
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,480
Congratulations!

387
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,220
Ba-tai!

388
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,460
Ba-tai!

389
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,420
Ba-tai!

390
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,200
I'm a genius fishing master!

391
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,420
You're great!

392
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,660
Next is octopus. Chuchu Chuchu Octopus!

393
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,600
Next is octopus! It's octopus!

394
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,700
What? Octopus?

395
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,520
I bought one from the store, so I have something.

396
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,220
What? What? What?

397
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,520
Well...

398
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,020
Here it is, boss!

399
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,540
Bonzai! Bonzai!

400
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,740
Bonzai! Bonzai!

401
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,760
Bonzai! Bonzai!

402
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,260
Let's catch some suzuki.

403
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,920
Next is suzuki! Suzuki!

404
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,460
Suzuki? Oh, no. I don't have suzuki.

405
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,500
I don't have suzuki.

406
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:24,920
Ouch.

407
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,780
Pardon me.

408
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,320
What's wrong?

409
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,380
Are you familiar with fish?

410
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,740
No, I'm not.

411
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,080
I see.

412
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,400
I guess that's enough.

413
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,100
Well done, boss!

414
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,280
Bonzai! Bonzai!

415
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,220
The wind is getting colder.

416
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,800
Should we go home?

417
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,620
Well, let's get the car ready.

418
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,260
I want to catch a big fish and go home at the end.

419
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,880
What? What?

420
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,620
I want to catch a shachi.

421
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,620
Shachi, shachi, shachi, shachi, shachi.

422
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,720
Shachi?

423
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,200
It's a shachi.

424
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,420
You didn't prepare a shachi, did you?

425
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,860
Of course.

426
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,880
You think we can catch a shachi, you morons?

427
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,000
That's why I told you that I don't know much about fish.

428
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,880
If we don't catch any, what will happen?

429
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,360
We're all going to be in the restaurant.

430
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,660
We'll be lost in the last days of our jobs.

431
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,680
Then, how about my car?

432
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,860
We can't pay for it!

433
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,120
What?

434
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,240
I have three daughters in China, boss.

435
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,160
Who the hell is this?

436
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,300
Hello?

437
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,340
It's me, boss.

438
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,560
What do you want, Honda?

439
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,780
I'm in a aquarium called Oizu Marine Park.

440
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,600
I'm doing a great show.

441
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,580
What do you think?

442
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,520
I don't care.

443
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,580
It's a shachi.

444
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,240
I'm doing a great shachi show.

445
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,720
Shachi?

446
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,280
Where is it? Tell me.

447
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,860
What?

448
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,960
What did you say?

449
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,680
You want me to lend you a shachi?

450
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,840
Don't be ridiculous.

451
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,120
I'm not going to tell you.

452
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,900
This is the rental fee.

453
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,740
Please take it.

454
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,060
But how can I take it?

455
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,840
You're here for that.

456
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,440
This is it.

457
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,020
What?

458
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,620
It's a jet.

459
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,840
Get in, Honda.

460
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:36,860
Okay.

461
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:43,360
Ryoji's husband, get in.

462
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,360
I did it.

463
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,380
Give me the water.

464
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,040
Okay.

465
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,520
I'm hungry.

466
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,260
I can't drink water yet.

467
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,360
I don't have a shachi yet.

468
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,660
What should I do now?

469
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,540
I don't know.

470
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,700
I don't know what to do without Masaki.

471
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,380
Boss!

472
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,560
Masaki.

473
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,560
Boss.

474
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,820
Look at that.

475
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,280
Honda, go straight ahead.

476
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,320
Don't be ridiculous.

477
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,360
It's a shachi.

478
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,480
The car is here!

479
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,380
Oh!

480
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,540
What?

481
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,020
What's going on?

482
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,420
I don't know!

483
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,540
I don't know!

484
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,220
Maybe it's because it's Sho's car

485
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,920
Maybe it's because it's Sho's car

486
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,840
It's fun!

487
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,500
The car is big!

488
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,240
The car is big!

489
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:53,340
Is it my car?

490
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,560
The car is coming this way!

491
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,240
Your majesty!

492
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,480
It's dangerous! Let's escape!

493
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,520
Wait, the car is going to get us soon

494
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,620
We're going to be so happy

495
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,980
Your majesty!

496
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,420
Is that the car, your majesty?

497
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,740
Boss!

498
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
Boss!

499
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,420
Boss!

500
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
Boss!

501
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,280
Boss!

502
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,020
It's over.

503
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,540
Everything is over now.

504
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,500
Boss...

505
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,940
Are you okay?

506
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,100
Do you want to fight?

507
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,160
Masaki.

508
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,660
Yes?

509
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,920
The pick has come up.

510
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,520
Good bye, good bye, good bye.

511
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,720
Good bye, everyone.

512
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,720
I knew it.

513
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,100
I'm fired.

514
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,500
Wait a minute, Goshogawara.

515
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,400
They've been with you until now.

516
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,880
You're going to fire them with just one failure?

517
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,240
Is that what the president of a big company does?

518
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,260
Hey, it's the money I got from tennis yesterday.

519
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,920
I don't need this kind of thing, so take their heads off.

520
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,060
I have no intention of taking their heads off.

521
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,700
I'm just going to go back to the hotel because it's cold.

522
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,360
Boss!

523
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,680
I'll have to pay you back.

524
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,780
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy.

525
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

526
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,140
Good job.

527
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,900
Mr. Kare, let's have a party tonight.

528
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,380
Good bye, good bye, good bye.

529
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,520
Thank you very much.

530
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,700
Why did this happen?

531
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,720
Then pay me back, you idiot!

532
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,460
Boss, why did you do this?

533
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,140
Why did you do this to me?

534
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,700
Help me!

535
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,660
Call me!

536
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,760
Hello?

537
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,980
Are you in the hotel?

538
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,740
I'm going home now.

539
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,500
I'm going home and I'm getting out of here.

540
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,160
Come home, you idiot.

541
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,640
You're always Italian.

542
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,120
I felt a strange feeling

543
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:42,280
That's why I tried to walk on the black tile of the arcade

544
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:53,380
Everyone was a child at least once, but everyone forgets

545
00:24:53,380 --> 00:25:00,520
The politician with a great face and the blue aunt above her eyes

546
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,900
Turn around and see that corner

547
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,260
Everyone can see everyone

548
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:19,100
There is a turtle over there, there must be a turtle

549
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,580
Come on, everyone

550
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:22,980
Let's go

551
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,300
To our town

552
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,320
Thank you!

553
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,280
The prize money of the competition of WIN is 10 million yen

554
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,980
You're a new violinist, but you can't go to Narita without your wallet?

555
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,520
Leave it to me!

556
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,160
I don't want to be a fool who can't win such a big prize!

557
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,100
Next time, "Troubled turtle and Narita"

558
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,740
There is a turtle over there

559
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,420
There must be a turtle

560
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,980
There must be a turtle

561
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,960
Come on, everyone

562
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,700
Let's go to our town

563
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,700
Let's go to our town

564
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,940
Let's go to our town

565
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,000
Let's go to our town
