It was all a failure.

28
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,360
We were only left with a heavy sense of defeat.

29
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,200
Sendai was only one step away.

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,140
I still remember the humiliation two years ago.

31
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,780
Thinking about this man, I can't sleep at night.

32
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,880
But it's the end of this year.

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm sure I'll be the leader this year.

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,840
This year, I'll make sure Ryo and Kankichi get their money back.

35
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,220
I know it's a big deal, but I don't want you to get involved.

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,480
I know.

37
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,120
So, everyone,

38
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,640
let's start the 21st Ryo-Kankichi Bonus Battle.

39
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

40
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,980
It'll be over soon.

41
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,160
Kikuchi,

42
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,480
you shouldn't have brought a baby to an important meeting.

43
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,340
It can't be helped.

44
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,220
His wife is a man who can't even pay off his debt.

45
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,140
So he left home.

46
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,640
I'm being pulled out of my pay, which is the amount that Ryo doesn't pay.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But in fact,

48
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,360
if Ryo is your opponent,

49
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,140
I don't think any hand will be able to reach you.

50
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,260
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,660
Your father,

52
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,920
the former manager of Sato Deki,

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,280
was the president of the 8th shopping street,

54
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,100
and he risked his life to get Ryo's money.

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,160
He was determined to do anything.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,940
He started the sports festival as Mr. Sukeroku.

57
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,680
But thanks to that, he became a kikkuri.

58
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,500
He was a bad guy.

59
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,120
That's right.

60
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,540
That's right.

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,300
This time,

62
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,560
I prepared a new weapon to take Ryo's bonus.

63
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,380
A new weapon?

64
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,440
I've been living in a plastic shop for 30 years.

65
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,920
I've used all the technology I have,

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,280
and developed it over 90% of the shopping street and for three months.

67
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,740
Wow.

68
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,340
This is the Ryo's Navigation System.

69
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,120
In short, Ryo Navi.

70
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,140
The preparation is complete.

71
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,980
All that's left is to catch Ryo on the day and take the bonus.

72
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,560
Oh.

73
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,780
The name of the operation is "Sky Eye Operation".

74
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,460
"Sky Eye Operation"

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,300
"Sky Eye Operation"

76
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,260
"Sky Eye Operation"

77
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,700
Mr. Ryo.

78
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,880
Mr. Shinhika Ryo Tsukankichi.

79
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,800
Yes.

80
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,040
Here's the bonus.

81
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,960
Yahoo!

82
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,340
As I thought,

83
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,560
for 180 days and two days,

84
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,720
every day,

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,040
I went to the 8th shopping street

86
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,120
and continued to go to school.

87
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,980
The day you arrived at the school.

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,020
It's all for you.

89
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,580
It was all for this cute bonus.

90
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,280
Mr. Ryo.

91
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,160
What is this year's bonus used for?

92
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,320
In fact,

93
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,040
I have a one-tenth of a rarified model of the limited-edition NASA-specialized Radicon Space Shuttle.

94
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,380
You always do that.

95
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,880
Well, let's go to the bank right away.

96
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,820
If you don't pay the deposit today, it's canceled.

97
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,800
Paragraph 28

98
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,840
I don't think I can use it for a while, just 30 people.

99
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,220
I'm always the most alert of you all.

100
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,680
No matter how strong the situation gets!

101
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,840
Time's up.

102
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,760
We should make a move with a couple of more of them.

103
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,960
Where are you going?

104
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,340
Don't push me!

105
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,040
No problem.

106
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,520
My them is good at disguise like sunglasses.

107
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,280
Oh, damn.

108
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,320
Hey, young lady.

109
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,780
I'm dropping this.

110
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,040
Thank you.

111
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,700
Don't mention it.

112
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,800
Huh?

113
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,420
What is that?

114
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,200
I think it's like a tried-and-runśnie много.

115
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,140
I thought I'd be able to see her.

116
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,340
But she's more beautiful than a bride.

117
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,760
Oh, that's scary.

118
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,260
Well, then...

119
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,760
Be careful.

120
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,280
That was close.

121
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,060
But they're not blind.

122
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,520
Hey, Ryo!

123
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,500
Huh?

124
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,980
I forgot my handkerchief.

125
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

126
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,340
What?

127
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,560
Oh, no!

128
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,780
It's Ryo!

129
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,180
Give my wife back my salary!

130
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,740
You're not going to get away with that.

131
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,620
Take this, Nippon!

132
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,740
Take this, Kumogakure!

133
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,440
You bastard!

134
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,380
You're not going to get away with this!

135
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,620
Well, then.

136
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,360
I'll give you a bonus.

137
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,240
That's the ramen shop's camera.

138
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,400
What's wrong?

139
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,140
It's right there.

140
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,740
I was just about to ask you the same thing.

142
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,420
Damn it!

143
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,860
Mr. Ozaki, could you answer the call?

144
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,160
This is Kazuchika Shomae.

145
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,440
The waiting is a failure.

146
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,800
Ryo ran away.

147
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,520
The embassy has launched an action.

148
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,160
Roger.

149
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,100
Mr. Ozaki, are you okay?

150
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,900
It's quite possible that Ryo is running away now.

151
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,740
We're now on the front line of the Sky High operation.

152
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,780
Ryo has a navigation computer embedded in his belt.

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,280
"I'm here to find you!"

184
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,460
"I'm here to find you!"

185
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:42,620
Here We Are!

186
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,860
Street Riders Start!

187
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,020
" fug...!

188
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,160
"I got to show you the power

189
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,760
"of a motorcycle I got in front of me!

190
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,120
I'll show you now!

191
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,520
He even brought a bike!

192
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,260
Then...

193
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,380
Buddy!

194
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,380
You're 10 years too early!

195
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,000
You're so naive, Ryo!

196
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,100
I used to be a pro racer!

197
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,160
I heard you talk about that so many times!

198
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,640
Hello?

199
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,220
Hello?

200
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,700
I'm out of Street Riders.

201
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,280
He's going to the next town.

202
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,980
Ryo is heading to the next town.

203
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,920
Shoot him in the middle of the bridge.

204
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,220
Damn it!

205
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,860
They're not in a good mood this year.

206
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,340
It's safer to leave the town and go to the next bank.

207
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,540
We're not going to leave here, Ryo!

208
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,200
N-no way!

209
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,700
How did you know we were going to leave here?

210
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,640
Ryo, there's no escape.

211
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,440
What's going on?

212
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,200
Bonus!

213
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,740
Bonus!

214
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,000
Bonus!

215
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,920
Bonus!

216
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,660
Bonus!

217
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,780
Bonus!

218
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,900
Bonus!

219
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,120
Bonus!

220
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,240
Bonus!

221
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,020
Bonus!

222
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,200
Bonus!

223
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,420
Bonus!

224
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:24,840
Bonus!

225
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,060
Bonus!

226
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,280
Bonus!

227
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,620
Bonus!

228
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,420
Bonus!

229
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,240
That's enough!

230
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,120
No!

231
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,940
I-I can't believe you jumped into the M zeon's river...

232
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,960
Damn it...

233
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,760
Run!

234
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,540
I'll get you!

235
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,280
Wait!

236
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,160
Let go of me!

237
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,160
I'm a human being!

238
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,220
I will die if I jumped into this fine river!

239
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,640
Let go of me!

240
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,960
Right.

241
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,340
What are you doing?

242
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,200
What?

243
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,380
Did you drop this misubo-like gate ball?

244
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,920
Or is it Nagashima Shigeo's sign ball?

245
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,620
It's Nagashima's sign ball.

246
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,460
It's a gate ball, of course!

247
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,460
I'm going to borrow the fire.

248
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,360
Damn it.

249
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,660
How did he know where I was going?

250
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,400
How did he know where I was going?

251
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,280
What's this code?

252
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,180
There's a battery in the glovebox?

253
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,520
You were watching me through the navigation system?

254
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,420
That's a good idea.

255
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,640
But I'm not the one who's going to get caught like that.

256
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:47,680
I have an important mission, which is to go to the bank all day long and deposit money so that I don't have to cancel my reservation for the radio control.

257
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:48,740
What?

258
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,400
What?

259
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:50,740
You're a fool!

260
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,120
You're a fool!

261
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,400
You're a fool!

262
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,600
Oh, you're right.

263
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,440
The hot pot I made isn't as easy as it is to break when you jump into a river.

264
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,860
Is this really where Ryo-san is?

265
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,820
I can't trust you at all.

266
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,820
Hey, Ohara-san.

267
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,760
How is it?

268
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,800
Did you catch Ryo-tsu?

269
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
It's just a matter of time.

270
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,680
This is also thanks to Ohara-san's help.

271
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,140
It's very cheap to exchange the four belts.

272
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,080
I won't bother you anymore because of him.

273
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,380
No, no, please be on a large boat.

274
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,220
I'm counting on you.

275
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,560
Mr. Osaki!

276
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,080
What is it, Grandma?

277
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,420
He suddenly stopped moving, but I think he's broken.

278
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,800
That can't be true.

279
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,500
It's closed.

280
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,720
It seems he's running away and taking a break.

281
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,000
Ohara-san, I'll see you at the end of the trip.

282
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,260
Is it finally?

283
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,720
Please get on.

284
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,500
Yes, sir!

285
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,420
Yes, sir!

286
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:12,480
Yes, sir!

287
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:12,520
Yes, sir!

288
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,360
Yes, sir!

289
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,480
Please stop!

290
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,440
The contingency has increased.

291
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,200
Ryo-san is currently hidden in a Kameari Hybrid Hotel.

292
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,920
Let's clash at once!

293
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,920
The Skyeye Operation is now entering the final stage.

294
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,400
Everybody, head for the hotel!

295
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,840
Yes, sir!

296
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,760
Yeah!

297
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,720
Yes, sir!

298
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,020
Thanks to you.

299
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,440
Good luck!

300
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,540
Is Ryo-san really here?

301
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,680
Please believe the latest technology.

302
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,440
Good luck!

303
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:55,160
This option CD ROM is connected to the radio waves from the satellite and finds Ryosan's location in the hotel.

304
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,120
This room...

305
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,360
Everyone, Ryosan is on the 817th room veranda!

306
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,400
A-Han is on the 816th room veranda!

307
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,200
B-Han is on the 818th room veranda!

308
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,380
C-Han and D-Han, enter from the 817th room!

309
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,580
Enter from the hotel!

310
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,260
The Kameari Shopping Street is in this area.

311
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,880
Everyone, be ready!

312
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,620
Be sure to win!

313
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,220
Yuki, we finally have two people.

314
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,280
I'm going.

315
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,740
B-Han, the location is complete.

316
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,880
B-Han, please.

317
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,160
B-Han, on the 818th room veranda.

318
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,680
The Kameari Shopping Street is complete.

319
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,880
C-Han, D-Han.

320
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,580
C-Han and D-Han, also complete.

321
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,360
Roger that.

322
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,560
Countdown, start!

323
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,440
5

324
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,720
4

325
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,160
3

326
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,260
2

327
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,460
1

328
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,220
Go!

329
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,640
Report! Did you succeed in capturing the target?

330
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,040
It's a crow!

331
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,040
A crow?

332
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,180
No, no, no, no!

333
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,220
Come on, it's 'a crow!

334
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,340
It's a crow!

335
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,780
It was C-Han.

336
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,600
It wasn't 'a crow, but 'a crow.

337
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,320
No, it was a red crow.

338
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,720
You're right.

339
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,500
If it wasn't for him,

340
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,020
we wouldn't have been able

341
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,520
to catch him this quickly.

342
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,300
We'd had to do this.

343
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,560
We were all selling a lot of energy.

344
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:35,820
He's up to the rock we had stuffing in this one.

345
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,500
Damn, I'm so scared.

346
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,580
I'll wash the money.

347
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,260
Oh, money is falling.

348
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,220
Money?

349
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,500
Money, money, money, money.

350
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,760
I found it.

351
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,580
Children's Bank?

352
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,620
Damn it. I'm a coward.

353
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,300
I was caught easily without using the machine.

354
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,180
You're right. This may be the best way for Ryo.

355
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,140
As expected of an old man.

356
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,700
What have I done?

357
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,380
Come on, get in line.

358
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,980
Is that okay, Mr. Ohara?

359
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,140
Please, take it.

360
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryo. I'll take it.

361
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,520
What's wrong? It's strange.

362
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,540
It's better not to pay.

363
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,280
I'm sorry.

364
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,080
Please, take it.

365
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,620
I see.

366
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,620
You're going to be in trouble if you don't say anything.

367
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,860
I'm sorry, Sachiko.

368
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,860
I can't wait to pick you up.

369
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,220
Who is she?

370
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,060
My sister, Sachiko.

371
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,340
She works in a cold place in the Northland where her limbs are numb and her bones are itching.

372
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,040
What?

373
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,900
She's still a child.

374
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:00,940
Why?

375
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,780
If you talk to me, it will be long.

376
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,300
I won't forget.

377
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:06,820
I won't remember anything.

378
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,140
Sachiko was born on a cold, snowy night.

379
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,880
Her parents were happy.

380
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,440
They wished her to have a happy child and gave her a name.

381
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,600
But...

382
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,740
Ryo

383
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:31,020
What happened to Sachiko?

384
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,180
A sudden accident of her parents.

385
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,140
Her insurance should have been paid.

386
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,220
and the insurance money was taken by a bad broker.

387
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,100
Furthermore, the house collapsed,

388
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,060
Besides, the dead parents failed their studies

389
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,060
and found out that there was a debt of 200 million yen.

390
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,780
Sachiko's relative who helped pay the debt took her away.

391
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,940
However,

392
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,600
the relative was actually the president of the Akutoku Construction Company,

393
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,540
and even the young Sachiko was forced to work.

394
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,060
He didn't let me eat.

395
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,560
I tried to get rid of Sachiko,

396
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,140
but every time I got a debt of 200 million yen,

397
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,520
and I made up my mind.

398
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,180
If I had just earned it,

399
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,800
I wouldn't have made it before Sachiko got older.

400
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,280
I would have to pay all my salary and bonuses for the debt.

401
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,520
I don't care how much people in the world hate me for that.

402
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,560
I want to be stronger in the future.

403
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,640
But young Sachiko was wrong.

404
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,200
Even though you are didn't mean it.

405
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,560
He suffered a lot of bad things for so many people.

406
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,760
My brother is a species that can not survive.

407
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,420
Oh yes he is.

408
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,100
I can't believe you are a species that can't survive.

409
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,460
Please forgive me.

410
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,240
It's okay.

411
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,720
Everyone,

412
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,740
maybe I did the wrong thing.

413
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,440
But he will have the enemy's attention.

414
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,060
I was trying to live as a human being.

415
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,180
Please forgive me in the name of Daijiro Ohara.

416
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,440
I was trying to get a bonus without thinking about the situation of Ryo.

417
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,860
Ryo, it's your bonus.

418
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,900
Give it to your sister soon.

419
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,140
But this is...

420
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,940
I don't care about the debt.

421
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,260
I don't care about the debt.

422
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm a million times happier than Ryo.

423
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,080
Good luck.

424
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,360
Don't lose.

425
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,460
I will never forget your kindness.

426
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,300
I'm sure my sister will be happy.

427
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,340
Hello, everyone.

428
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,920
What's wrong with you?

429
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,260
What is this?

430
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,400
That's Ryo's sister, Sachiko.

431
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,860
That's strange.

432
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:57,720
Um.

433
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,960
This is a magazine cutout.

434
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,980
And I don't think he has a sister.

435
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,220
Ryo, if you get caught up in that story, you can't take my bonus.

436
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,920
Thank you very much.

437
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,440
Well, I'll just go to the bank.

438
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,520
What's this?

439
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,040
Who did this?

440
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,600
You did this to me?

441
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:33,420
Based on past data, you are 95% sure to stay in this cafe.

442
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,020
It's as you thought.

443
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,300
There was a reason why I waited.

444
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,140
P-Promo's father?

445
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,000
What's this?

446
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,280
This is a debt-free weapon against Ryo and Kikuchi.

447
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,740
Debt hex.

448
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,480
Is this Debt hex?

449
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,860
I secretly developed it for the next year's bonus runoff, but...

450
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,500
It's 80% complete!

451
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,380
I'm sure I can defeat you even in these calculations.

452
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,660
I'm not going flexible!

453
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,680
The link between Shocking X...

454
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,000
It's Ryo's work!

455
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,620
How did it work?

456
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,120
No!

457
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,860
Ahhhhhhh!

458
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,480
This is bad!

459
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
Electric Shock!

460
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,660
Uwaaaaaaahhh!

461
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,340
Uwaaaaaaahhh!

462
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,200
Uwaaaaaaahhh!

463
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,140
Is this too much!?

464
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,640
Don't worry.

465
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,180
I will consider your strength and set it to a voltage that will not die.

466
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,080
I will consider your strength and set it to a voltage that will not die.

467
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,140
Well, I think it will be able to make you faint.

468
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,900
Nyaaahhh!

469
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,900
Electric Shock!

470
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,120
Uwaaaaaaahhh!

471
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,380
Electric Shock!

472
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,120
Uwaaaaaaahhh!

473
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,680
Electric Shock!

474
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,980
This is my bonus.

475
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,460
I don't want to do this.

476
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,300
I don't want to do this.

477
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,440
You are the one who didn't pay the debt.

478
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,980
How about I give you the bonus?

479
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,440
Huh?

480
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,880
What's wrong?

481
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,680
Huh?

482
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,920
Uwaaaaaaahhh!

483
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,200
It's only one step away!

484
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,480
Uwaaaaaaahhh!

485
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,740
Uwaaaaaaahhh!

486
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,620
Uwaaaaaaahhh!

487
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,820
Uwaaaaaaahhh!

488
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,240
What on Earth!

489
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,540
As you all see

490
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,360
there is no way you can take it!

491
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,160
There is no way you can take it!

492
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,180
Even if the chief allows it

493
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,100
God won't allow it!

494
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,020
Oh, God is also...

495
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,020
Oh, God is also...

496
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,340
Wait!

497
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,400
What's happening!?

498
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,340
We're almost there!

499
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,000
We got it!

500
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:07,660
Hey, what's Ryotsu up to?

501
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,360
What are you doing?

502
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,380
If you have any money left in your bank account,

503
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,460
you can pay it back at the bank.

504
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,220
What a hard work.

505
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,340
Hirotsu, if you want to pay back the debt,

506
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,660
you can help me.

507
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:27,960
Stop talking!

508
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,660
It's a job with concentration.

509
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,340
My bonus!

510
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,560
I'll pay you back next year,

511
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,980
Ryotsu Kankichi.

512
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,000
Haha! I did it!

513
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,520
I found the secret

514
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,940
and got the highest exchange rate

515
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:11,920
with the bank account.

516
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,300
Men are not about their faces or bodies,

517
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,200
but their hearts and minds.

518
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,060
Do you get it?

519
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,140
Next time on Ryotsu Mecha-Mote宣言!

520
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:20,780
Take care!
