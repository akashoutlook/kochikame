In 괸島おーるくん

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,920
There was a day when I learned from a study.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,520
Ah, I see.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,980
Senpai, what have you been talking about?

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,560
I'm surprised by your voice. I have a special spirit of the master of craft.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,100
Really?

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,900
There is really something.

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,280
It's easy to get caught.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,940
I'm taking a big car!

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,900
Wait!

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,000
Senpai, please wait for that hand!

13
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,740
I won't wait for you, but I'll change the menu.

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,620
I'll change the menu.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,520
Can I change it?

16
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,540
If you want to wait, I'll do it.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,720
Then I'll change from Katsu-don to Una-don.

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,440
Okay.

19
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,340
I'll return the gold and block the way to write.

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,260
Then I'll do the brush.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,420
You are kind.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
I'm defeated by Hankichi.

23
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,060
What is it? Lemon?

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,240
Don't scare me.

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,720
What is it? Lemon? Don't scare me.

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,360
Why am I defeated?

27
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,060
It's Nifu.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,520
It's true!

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,820
I can't believe that I'm Nifu.

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,220
It's forbidden to hit two Nifu at the same time.

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,960
I did it! It's an eel gun!

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,320
It's Una-don, not an eel gun.

33
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,440
I treated Honda for lunch, and this is all I have left.

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,760
It's the only one left.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,040
Hey, you.

36
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,860
Why did you bring lemon?

37
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,500
I brought it because you told me that you wanted to ask me to do it.

38
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,660
You wanted to ask me to do it?

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
My father is in a bad state of mind,

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,740
so I haven't had enough time to go to the restaurant.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,800
Oh?

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,240
Do you want me to work part-time?

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,800
Yes.

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,740
Oh, I see.

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,000
I can't help it.

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
It's the lemon's job.

47
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,440
I want to do it.

48
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:22,960
Let me go!

49
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,440
When you watch TV, make your room bright and look away!

50
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,520
Come to me, you poor thing!

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not here, but I'm worried

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,980
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

53
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sure they'll be okay

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:19,560
I have no job

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Come to me, you poor thing!

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,520
I'm not here, but I'm worried

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,040
Look at the red clouds and the white clouds

58
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,280
I'm sure they'll be okay

59
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,620
You know what to do, don't you?

60
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,300
You know what to do, don't you?

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,740
If you do, come to me!

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
You know what to do, don't you?

63
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,860
You know what to do, don't you?

64
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,980
If you do, come to me, don't you?

65
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,440
You know what to do, don't you?

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,060
Lemon's Salt Shop

67
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,640
Lemon's Salt Shop

68
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,140
I'm home!

69
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,440
Welcome back, young lady!

70
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,280
It's been a while, Mr. Ejiro!

71
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,740
I'll make you trouble again!

72
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,760
I'll make you trouble again!

73
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,680
*Sigh*

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,880
Sorry, Ichiro.

75
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,720
I was having trouble on the day before work, so I'm going to go by boat.

76
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,740
You'll get paid for your part-time job, so you can work until tomorrow.

77
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah.

78
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,240
And you can eat sushi.

79
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,960
What?

80
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,860
You haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

81
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,680
Ahaha, it hurts.

82
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,040
It's okay.

83
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,860
Alright, the contract is a success!

84
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,120
It's a success!

85
00:04:47,820 --> 00:05:03,660
It's a big deal that you only trained for a month last year.

86
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,480
Your hands are not good for your face.

87
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,020
It's not good for my face.

88
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Alright, that's enough for now.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,140
I don't know why you'd go to this restaurant again.

90
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,920
It's not too bad.

91
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,000
I can't even thank you enough.

92
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,080
Eat!

93
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,940
Wait over here!

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,400
W-W-What do you want me to do?

95
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,080
Can't you go to work?

96
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,140
Get off of me.

97
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,880
Ah!

98
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,440
Oh, my...

99
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,100
Oh, my...

100
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,920
Compensation served to make me eat sushi.

101
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,440
Ugh...

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Ow...

103
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,980
Ow...

104
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,600
Hey, what are you doing?

105
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,080
Everyone, Kanchi is a man of Ryotsuke.

106
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,380
Don't be a nuisance.

107
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,140
If you eat a lot, you'll run away.

108
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,540
Grandma, Kanchi is useless.

109
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,100
I don't think so.

110
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,720
You're too much.

111
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,020
If you're a Ryotsuke man, you can eat my sushi and get a salary.

112
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,920
I'm a bear before the winter vacation.

113
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,420
Let's go together.

114
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,820
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,200
You're a bear before the winter vacation.

116
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm so upset.

117
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,660
Grandma, you're talking too much.

118
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,680
Lemon asked Kanchi to come.

119
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,780
I can't help it if Lemon brought me here.

120
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,420
Then I can eat sushi, right?

121
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,880
Let's eat.

122
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,540
Sushi is human after work.

123
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,780
Let's clean the front of the store.

124
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,820
Why don't you answer me properly?

125
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,360
Yes, yes.

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,140
Say yes.

127
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,280
Yes.

128
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,100
I want to be a human soon.

129
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,600
Listen, you guys.

130
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,700
I'll say it again and again.

131
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,660
You can't trust a Ryotsuke man.

132
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,080
Okay?

133
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,160
I hate you.

134
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,240
You've been

135
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,360
doing this.

136
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,220
But that's a brother's problem.

137
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,820
I don't think it has anything to do with the grandchild's Kankichi.

138
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,920
I've talked about it before, but I tried to steal the treasure in the basement of my village.

139
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,620
That's because you couldn't talk to Matoi and made him angry.

140
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,840
I don't think Kankichi is a bad guy, as you say.

141
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,760
Yeah, half of what you say is right.

142
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,600
But there's a good part about that.

143
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,220
No, if I don't do it, my grandchildren will be spoiled by that good-for-nothing guy.

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,360
If I don't do something about it...

145
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,260
Two servings of Chirashi, please.

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,440
Yes, yes, wait a minute.

147
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,400
Yes, hello, I'm Chief Kanda.

148
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,840
Oh, you're here.

149
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,320
I understand.

150
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,840
I'll ask you right away.

151
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,300
This is the second serving of Okami Heights, Mr. Yoshikawa.

152
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,380
Five servings of Jouzushi, please.

153
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,340
Two servings of Uchi, please.

154
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,340
Yes, sir.

155
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,540
Five servings of Zashiki, please.

156
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,340
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,120
I'm off to work!

158
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,960
Grandma, why do you have to disguise yourself like this?

159
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,880
I'll tell you the reason later.

160
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,780
Now, let's follow Kankichi.

161
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,020
Well, Okami Heights, Okami Heights, Okami Heights...

162
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,240
Oh, that's it.

163
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,160
I'm hungry.

164
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,840
There's no one here.

165
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,840
Huh?

166
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Hmm...

167
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,000
Hmm, one serving and four Tekka-maki, huh.

168
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,320
I can't tell even if I eat one by one.

169
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,660
The man in front of you!

170
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,480
I don't care about the trust of the restaurant, I'm trying to fulfill my hunger.

171
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,520
That man is such a man, Emon.

172
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,320
Hmm, the rust is working well.

173
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,540
Huh?

174
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,320
Hahahaha!

175
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,720
What's going on?

176
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,000
Huh?

177
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,300
I don't know what's going on, but I'll tell you.

178
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,140
Okay.

179
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,880
What's wrong, Ishiro?

180
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,740
Didn't you deliver a delivery?

181
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,880
Hmm, Jouzushi is five servings, and Uchi, Wasabi-nuki, is two servings.

182
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,080
All of them have wasabi in them.

183
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,320
Oh, no!

184
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,520
I mistook it for the one in the upper room.

185
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,300
Oh, no!

186
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,440
You'd better be more careful, or the trust of the restaurant will be lost if I don't check.

187
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,220
I, I'm sorry.

188
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,860
I'm going to take it back right away.

189
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,880
As expected of Kankichi.

190
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,080
N-No, you mustn't be fooled.

191
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,920
I just noticed it when you were eating the snack.

192
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
As usual, please take the oki out to the entrance.

193
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,800
Here we go.

194
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,580
Huh?

195
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,920
Huh? Why aren't you going back to the store?

196
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
It's about that guy.

197
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
I'm going to be late. I'll be back.

198
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,500
Look at that ugly face.

199
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,320
That's the real form of a man from the Ryotsuke family.

200
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,620
He's just a kid. What are you looking at?

201
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,240
You don't need to know that.

202
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,400
Welcome.

203
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
You bastard! Give me the whole Ryotsuke family!

204
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,940
Hurry up!

205
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,080
Hurry up!

206
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,580
Rope and gum tape!

207
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,440
Yes, sir!

208
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,300
Rope and gum tape!

209
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,340
What are you doing?

210
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,480
You bastard!

211
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,320
Did you forget? I'm the police!

212
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,640
I'll teach you a lesson!

213
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,380
I won't do it anymore!

214
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,980
Thank you very much.

215
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,620
I can't thank you enough.

216
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,320
It's okay.

217
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,680
This is also work.

218
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,040
Gum tape, 285 yen.

219
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,680
Rope, 288 yen.

220
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,520
Magazine, 580 yen.

221
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,020
Each item, including the consumption tax, is 1210 yen.

222
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,300
Each item, including the consumption tax, is 1210 yen.

223
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,800
Oh, are you taking money?

224
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,320
Yes, it's my job.

225
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,320
Oh.

226
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,100
Put it on the head of the department of the Katsushika branch.

227
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,580
Okay, then sign here.

228
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,940
Okay, then sign here.

229
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,160
I'll do it, Kankichi.

230
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,660
Oh, no.

231
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,900
Why are you so rude today?

232
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,140
Kankichi, bring 10 more pressure cans while you're at it.

233
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,920
Okay.

234
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,260
Here you go.

235
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,920
Wait 10 more pressure cans.

236
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,780
You're really rude.

237
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,480
You're really rude.

238
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,200
Miss, I'll have another one.

239
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,120
I...

240
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,420
Miss, this is still 20 years old, so you can't drink it.

241
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,240
That's too bad.

243
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,740
Miss, how about I drink it?

244
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,980
Okay, that's good.

245
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,380
Here you go.

246
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,340
Here you go.

247
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,760
Here you go.

248
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,440
Here you go.

249
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,660
I'm gonna drink it to death.

250
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,360
You're really quick to drink, Miss Lenny.

251
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,420
You'd better drink the cup.

252
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Oh, sorry.

253
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,220
Wow!

254
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,600
It's so good!

255
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,840
Here you go.

256
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,560
Here's one more.

257
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,120
I feel good.

258
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,340
Kankichi, you're overdoing it.

259
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,120
What?

260
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,580
You're the next best customer in front of this man.

261
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,440
Right, boss?

262
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,640
I like it.

263
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,360
I said, drink up!

264
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,140
Please call me Ichiro.

265
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,400
Marina Azuka!

266
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,220
Ichiro-kun!

267
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:00,900
Next!

268
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,560
That idiot.

269
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,760
Is there no such thing as a penalty?

270
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,360
This is Ryo's man.

271
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,580
If it's just for the sake of it, you'll be a scum and drink it up.

272
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,280
Ichiro Ichiro!

273
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,280
I'll go in with a butter pot!

274
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll go in with a butter pot!

275
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,440
If you hit the ball with that, you'll break!

276
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,640
Break?

277
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,460
I see.

278
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,700
If you're playing baseball,

279
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,220
you shouldn't act like this.

280
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,680
Out!

281
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,280
You see, humans are born with a purpose.

282
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,080
You understand, right?

283
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,380
This mean, mean, mean man

284
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,980
is the true form of a scum.

285
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:48,860
You're right.

286
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,460
Thank you very much.

287
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,320
I'll come again.

288
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,260
Wow, I had so much fun tonight.

289
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,860
Ichiro-kun, you're the best.

290
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,260
I'll use this room for the next party.

291
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,280
Thank you.

292
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,300
Be careful on your way home.

293
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,480
I can't believe I can feel the customer's heart in one night.

294
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,720
As expected of Kankichi.

295
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,320
Huh? Why is this happening?

296
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,880
This is going to be very strange.

297
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,580
That's why the van will be closed some day.

298
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,200
I have a plan.

299
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,340
And Te oma.

300
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,000
And Ririka.

301
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,440
Two of them?

302
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,680
I'll change it and call them.

303
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,560
How much longer are you going to sleep?!

304
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,600
Wake up, Kankichi.

305
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,420
Oh no, I'll just get a little sleep.

306
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,560
Ouch! I... It hurts.

307
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,200
That's a normal thing to do.

308
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,000
I'll borrow it. Get up now!

309
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,660
I know, so don't shout.

310
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,460
I'm so mad.

311
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,600
I'm the best at drinking at times like this.

312
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,160
Don't talk nonsense!

313
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,440
You want to crush the restaurant?

314
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm so mad!

315
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,760
You're a rough woman.

316
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,220
Who's a rough woman?

317
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,520
Get up!

318
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,020
Gevalt, you really got me.

319
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,040
You're lying, Dad!

320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,020
What happened to Lemon?

321
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,040
Kankichi, do you know Lemon?

322
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,080
He's my father's assistant.

323
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,840
Dad's back in shape,

324
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,200
so he's out of the house.

325
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,620
He said he'd come back,

326
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,120
but he's been working overtime this morning.

327
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,000
I see.

328
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,180
Okay, I'll go out on my own.

329
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,700
Kankichi will come on his own?

330
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,580
You don't want me to come on my own?

331
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,840
No.

332
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,600
Then go home and prepare for kindergarten.

333
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,140
Okay.

334
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,500
Okay, come on.

335
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,960
Lemon, 10 points.

336
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,180
10 points.

337
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,160
Kankichi, you're going out on your father's house?

338
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,700
Yes.

339
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,060
That's great.

340
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,080
Lemon's happy.

341
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,500
Yes.

342
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,660
There's no way.

343
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,100
Listen, Kankichi.

344
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,840
Don't be so rude to Lemon.

345
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,720
What do you mean?

346
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,500
Hey, Lemon.

347
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,560
What is this?

348
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:27,940
Yes.

349
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,780
It's a lion.

350
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
Yes, it's a lion.

351
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,480
You did a good job.

352
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,620
Yes.

353
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,400
Next picture.

354
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,340
What is this?

355
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,980
Yes, Mako.

356
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,420
Yes, it's an elephant.

357
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,440
Yes, you did a good job.

358
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:47,840
Yay.

359
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,740
Next is this.

360
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,640
It's a hippopotamus.

361
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,560
Hippo, hippo, hippo?

362
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,380
Yes, correct.

363
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,120
"Kaba" is an English word for hippopotamus, isn't it, Joji?

364
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:00,940
Yay.

365
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,200
It's a cat.

366
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,520
It's a cat.

367
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,920
"Buta, buta, buta."

368
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,360
"Buta, buta, buta."

369
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:07,640
Yes, correct.

370
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,560
You all did a good job.

371
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,340
Next is...

372
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,920
Well...

373
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,180
It's Ichiro, the father of Lemon, the daughter of Lemon.

374
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,420
Yes, Ichiro.

375
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,320
What is it?

376
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,440
The first one to raise his hand is Lemon.

377
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,540
Why don't you let Lemon answer?

378
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,320
Kankichi...

379
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,480
I'm sorry.

380
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,740
I'm sorry.

381
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,800
So, next is this.

382
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,700
Who can answer?

383
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,220
What's wrong, Lemon?

384
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,940
Raise your hand.

385
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,900
I can't help it.

386
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,460
Does anyone know?

387
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,680
Hiroshi?

388
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,480
Yes, it's Kurao.

389
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
This is good.

390
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,800
That kid's father likes to fight.

391
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,580
I want to see his father's face.

392
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,660
It's me, but what is it?

393
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,180
What?

394
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,820
What?

395
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,440
He he.

396
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,080
Quiet.

397
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,720
Hiroshi, the name of the horse is not your name, but the "horse".

398
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,460
This is the last one.

399
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,480
Anyone who knows?

400
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,460
Ehh...

401
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,800
Well then...

402
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,120
Lemon, do you know?

403
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,260
That's the boy called Alexander collector dog, a unique dog association.

404
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,440
Is that?

405
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,600
That's right.

406
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,180
That's correct.

407
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Ehhh...

408
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,520
How is Lemon?

409
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,840
That's not a butterfly!

410
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,600
It's a fried chicken with Katsu-sand!

411
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,440
I can't say that!

412
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:30,940
That's the answer!

413
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,360
I see.

414
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,280
That old man is funny!

415
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,800
He's a weird old man!

416
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,540
Oh, it's a real-time video!

417
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,720
Oh, Ryo-san!

418
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,740
Is your kid in this kindergarten?

419
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,940
Yes.

420
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Why is Ryo-san here?

421
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,780
He's my father's agent.

422
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:51,880
Agent?

423
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,340
That's so flashy!

424
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,860
That old man is Akira-kun's father, right?

425
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,800
Akira's dad?

426
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,560
Great!

427
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,980
Kankichi!

428
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,120
Don't mess with people's clothes and outfits!

429
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,500
I'm sorry!

430
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,360
Okay, I got it.

431
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,940
Jukkoku-do is doing a show in Asakusa.

432
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,120
That's called "Seifuku" .

433
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,760
Oh, I see.

434
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,800
What's he doing?

435
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,880
Well, it's a folk song.

436
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,020
Akira, your father is doing a great job!

437
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,320
You should be proud of him!

438
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,120
You should be proud of him!

439
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,260
Your father is so cool!

440
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,360
He's so cool!

441
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,700
Ryo-san, I'm sorry.

442
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,440
I came here after the stage was over.

443
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,880
I didn't expect to see you in this outfit.

444
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,240
See? He's a good father.

445
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,320
Yeah!

446
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm sorry for interrupting your class.

447
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,720
No, it's okay.

448
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,680
It was a good lesson.

449
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,500
Hey, everyone!

450
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,060
Yes!

451
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,160
I see.

452
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,580
Akira-kun's father is doing a stage show.

453
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,660
It's a good time to show him the Fukua Jutsu.

454
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,220
It's a good time to show him the Fukua Jutsu.

455
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,940
But I didn't bring a doll.

456
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,720
Okay.

457
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,420
Then I'll do the doll.

458
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:13,940
What?

459
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,100
Yeah.

460
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,460
Yeah!

461
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,060
Ryo-san, let's start.

462
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:21,900
Okay.

463
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,380
Ryo-san, you can't do Fukua Jutsu if you talk to yourself.

464
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,620
Ryo-san, you can't do Fukua Jutsu if you talk to yourself.

465
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,220
Oh, I see.

466
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,900
I'll do it again.

467
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,440
Okay, Ryo-san. Let's start.

468
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,880
Okay, Ryo-san. Let's start.

469
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,280
I'll do it again.

470
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,880
By the way, do you know what my job is?

471
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,640
By the way, do you know what my job is?

472
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,220
Yes, I know.

473
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
You're a Fukua Jutsu master, right?

474
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,500
Liar!

475
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,680
No, I'm not.

476
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,020
Then do you know what my job is?

477
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,820
Yes, I know. You're a

478
00:21:52,820 --> 00:22:04,320
What kind of job is a playboy?

479
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,580
Then I'll just tell you.

480
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,760
Thank you.

481
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,560
First, I go to the station in the morning.

482
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,900
Then I go to sleep until noon.

483
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,420
And when the president comes,

484
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,540
When the president comes?

485
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,480
I'll run away!

486
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,440
Run away?

487
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,440
I'll play with a swing in the park.

488
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,180
Swing?

489
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,620
Sometimes I'll hit the ball!

490
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,320
Swing?

491
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,020
I'll go back in the evening, eat dinner and sleep.

492
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,420
When do you work?

493
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,460
When I'm playing.

494
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,700
Wait a minute.

495
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,120
It's about me.

496
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,240
Did you find out?

497
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,480
Stop it.

498
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,720
The End

499
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,080
I'm home!

500
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,340
Welcome back, Lemon.

501
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,900
How was it, Father?

502
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,480
You didn't have to be ashamed of Kankichi, did you?

503
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,840
Not at all.

504
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,980
Kankichi was cooler than that.

505
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,720
Not really.

506
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,920
What? Kankichi is cooler?

507
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,660
Well then, Kankichi, see you later.

508
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,660
Yeah.

509
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,580
Go tell your father.

510
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,460
I'll go tell your father.

511
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,780
By the way, Matoi.

512
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,660
If you don't want Kankichi,

513
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,580
you can have Lemon as your wife.

514
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:22,700
What?

515
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,840
What do you mean "what"?

516
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,420
Kankichi!

517
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,100
You're still going on about having a lemon in kindergarten?

518
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,020
What the hell are you talking about?

519
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,360
It's a lemon joke, of course!

520
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,040
What?

521
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,980
Oh, so you're his wife.

522
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,060
Yeah.

523
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,980
Lemon is a joke!

524
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,280
Lemon!

525
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,980
Tell me it's a joke!

526
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,920
Kankichi!

527
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,160
I hate this!

528
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,400
All this crap!

529
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:19,100
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

530
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:27,320
People who make stupid looks don't want to be the type to fight back.

531
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,700
When I was walking on the street in the corner of the street, the moon went away.

What?

550
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,580
Are you testing a magic carpet?

551
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,460
