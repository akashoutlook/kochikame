00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,000
When you watch TV,

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,060
make sure to look out the window and look away!

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,880
Looking at the sunset floating on the river,

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,480
watching the sunset floating on the river,

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,960
if you kick a pebble, you'll fly to the foot of the river.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,520
I wonder if the head of the gym who was doing jogging

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,340
laughed with a smile saying, "It's just a cramp."

9
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,860
I wonder if the head of the gym who was doing jogging

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,120
laughed with a smile saying, "It's just a cramp."

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,300
The cityscape that never changes

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,440
is strangely gentle.

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,740
From the waterfront of the Tungari-boshi,

14
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,320
to the Taishakuten,

15
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,420
the sunset falls.

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,860
From the waterfront of the Tungari-boshi,

17
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,460
to the Taishakuten,

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,220
I see why the snow is falling.

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,320
A time like this is the end.

20
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,460
I realized I've lost my happiness

21
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,840
I realized I've lost my happiness

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:50,860
after wasting too long in Karamaru.

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,200
*panting*

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,280
*panting*

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,140
*panting*

26
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,960
Good morning, Ryo-chan.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,440
Hey, Reiko.

28
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,400
Good morning.

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,980
Here's your tea.

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,700
Do you have any tea or something?

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,880
You ate all of it the other day, Ryo-chan.

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,500
Buy me a new one.

33
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,660
Even if you buy it now, it'll just be your meal.

34
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,200
*panting*

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,480
*panting*

36
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,960
*panting*

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,620
*panting*

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,200
*panting*

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,940
I'm getting even more hungry.

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,340
I have three more days until my payday.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
I have three more days until my payday.

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,460
If I keep this up, I'll die of hunger.

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,000
*panting*

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Reiko, I'm begging you!

45
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,740
Just give me 1000 yen!

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,400
No.

47
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,780
Chief Ohara told me not to lend you a penny.

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,340
Chief Ohara told me not to lend you a penny.

49
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,200
That damn Chief Ohara!

50
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,840
*thunder*

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,500
There he is.

52
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,020
Welcome, Mr. Honda.

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,180
*thunder*

54
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,720
*thunder*

55
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,900
What's wrong with that face?

56
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,000
It's nothing.

57
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,340
*thunder*

58
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,240
Actually, we're in trouble.

59
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,540
What is it?

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,800
*thunder*

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,420
A fight between father and son?

62
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,340
You want me to do that?

63
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,460
My father and my brother have been fighting all this time.

64
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,220
My father and my brother have been fighting all this time.

65
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,360
My father and my brother have been fighting all this time.

66
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,340
My sister asked me to do it.

67
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,060
My sister asked me to do it.

68
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,900
I'm begging you, Chief Ohara.

69
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,520
I'm begging you, Chief Ohara.

70
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:23,860
Please do something.

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,900
I can't do anything about other people's affairs before the payday.

72
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,060
I can't do anything about other people's affairs before the payday.

73
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,140
That's not true.

74
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,020
I can only rely on you.

75
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,000
I can only rely on you.

76
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,640
I haven't eaten properly in almost a week.

77
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,520
I don't have the strength to do a party.

78
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,220
I don't have the strength to do a party.

79
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,340
My sister is good at cooking.

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,820
I'll make you prepare a lot of your favorite dishes.

81
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,920
I'll make you prepare a lot of your favorite dishes.

82
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,220
Really?

83
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,000
So, what's the reason for the fight?

84
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,140
So, what's the reason for the fight?

85
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,220
Apparently, they are arguing over whether to follow my father's restaurant or not.

86
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,320
Apparently, they are arguing over whether to follow my father's restaurant or not.

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,580
Your family was a motorcycle shop, wasn't it?

88
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,660
Yes.

89
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
So I was riding the motorcycle because I wanted to.

90
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,020
So I was riding the motorcycle because I wanted to.

91
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,260
It's a motorcycle with a lot of money.

92
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,300
Get out of here!

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,680
Don't die!

94
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,340
I'm here.

95
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,020
Are you off today?

96
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,420
Yes.

97
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,940
I'm not a father who usually takes the time off.

98
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,060
I'm not a father who usually takes the time off.

99
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,060
Did you come to take the time off because your senior said he would come?

100
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,880
Did you come to take the time off because your senior said he would come?

101
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,440
Thank you, senior.

102
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:42,840
I'm home!

103
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,380
Welcome back, brother.

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,280
Oh, it's you, Eve!

105
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,360
Hey, what's going on?

106
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,700
Don't call me "Senpai" all of a sudden.

107
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,360
My sister is really shy.

108
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
You're too much.

109
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,100
Okay, okay, come out.

110
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
It's Ryotsu who talked on the phone.

111
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,040
She's scary, but she's not a bad person.

112
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,000
Come on, come on, it's okay.

113
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,480
It's like a dog or a cat.

114
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,280
Then I'll introduce you.

115
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,200
My father and my younger brother Kadoki.

116
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,240
But everyone calls me Monkey.

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,380
This is Ryotsu, my senior.

118
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,340
Hayato is always there to help.

119
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,520
I'm Hayato's father, Kaizo.

120
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,720
I'm Kadoki.

121
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,140
Nice to meet you.

122
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,500
Why are you closing the shop today?

123
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,180
I was cleaning the shop.

124
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,200
Right, Monkey?

125
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:42,660
Yeah.

126
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,240
Huh? I thought you two were fighting.

127
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,500
No way.

128
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,900
It's a mistake.

129
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,400
What? You two are close.

130
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,500
You can eat without having a hard time.

131
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,840
Friendship is beautiful.

132
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,020
You can't fight.

133
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,160
Ah, I did it!

134
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,600
I did it!

135
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,820
She's not scary.

136
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,860
Let's eat.

137
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,120
Wow.

138
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,420
I ate a lot.

139
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm sorry. It's been a week since I last ate something decent.

140
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,760
Oh, is that so?

141
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,280
Hey, Eve! Bring some plum juice! Let's make some tea!

142
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,980
Oh, tea? That's a good idea!

143
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,040
Let's eat!

144
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, so you're interested in bikes?

145
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,780
Yeah! I like anything that has the name of a mecha.

146
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,100
I like bikes especially because I'm always riding them with Honda.

147
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,940
Then, shall we take a look at our bikes?

148
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,960
What the hell is this?

149
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,640
It's a Riku-O bike, isn't it?

150
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,220
Why is it like this?

151
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,920
Honda, is this a used car specialty store?

152
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,480
No, it's just a new car.

153
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,900
Then, what is this Riku-O?

154
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,040
It's a bike from a company that went bankrupt decades ago!

155
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,760
Don't say that.

156
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,380
I mean, there are new Meguro bikes, but...

157
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:34,640
What?

158
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,820
That's an old company, isn't it?

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,500
The latest ones are Mach 3 and Double One.

160
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,460
They're all bikes from over 20 years ago!

161
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,800
Hahaha. It's hard to sell them.

162
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,520
How much do you sell them for?

163
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,680
It's all on sale.

164
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,800
On sale? On sale when they were on sale?

165
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,540
Of course. They're new.

166
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,460
Oh...

167
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,500
If a bike enthusiast saw them, he'd throw up.

168
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,760
They're sold for four or five times or even more than the average price.

169
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,120
Um, dad, can I sell this bike to you?

170
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,840
What? By a senior?

171
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,260
No, I'm completely obsessed with the charm of bikes.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,880
I want to go touring with you next time.

173
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,920
Honda...

174
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,440
Oh, no, no.

175
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,700
Why are you showing off the bike

176
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,760
by selling it to somebody else?

177
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,300
I just want to ride a motorcycle

178
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,720
Don't say stupid things, Honda-kun

179
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,480
It's a request from Hayato-senpai

180
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,740
It's fine, which one would you like?

181
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,680
I'll buy many at once, it's unnatural

182
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,200
If I choose one, it's the Rikuou

183
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,920
It's a famous car from half a century ago

184
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,840
It's now traded at a discount of 200 million yen or more

185
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,340
If it's in good condition, it'll be 3 million yen

186
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,740
It's brand new

187
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,960
Can I have this Rikuou?

188
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,920
Rikuou?

189
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,600
I'll take Meguro Jr.

190
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,280
Sure

191
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,120
I have some orders, please wait

192
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,560
What a nice father

193
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,020
It's strange that it's not sold at all

194
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,920
Senpai, are you really going to buy it?

195
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,680
Of course, I just have to continue

196
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,400
It's hard to continue

197
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,320
Eh?

198
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,720
What's that?

199
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,280
A motorcycle that's 50 years old

200
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,000
Minami Senju's motorcycle

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,940
It's mine

202
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,440
Is it your father?

203
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,020
Yes

204
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,060
If you wear a Tsunagi, your personality changes

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,020
As expected of Honda's father

206
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,800
Ryo-san, you said you wanted a Rikuou

207
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,780
Yes, just in case

208
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,800
Just in case?

209
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,400
Are you trying to do something for my Rikuou with such a half-hearted feeling?

210
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,840
No, I'm serious

211
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,300
I've been digging into this motorcycle for 10 years

212
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,320
I've been thinking about getting it no matter what

213
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
I've been thinking about it for a long time

214
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,740
Oh, I see

215
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,680
You want it so much

216
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,780
Okay

217
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,140
Then I'll take the test of Rikuou class

218
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,360
Test

219
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,520
What is this?

220
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,500
Why is there a test course in the back of the house?

221
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,560
Are you testing all the customers?

222
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,660
Not all of them

223
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,750
The Bosozoku and Miihana bike fans have no right to take the test

224
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,980
I'll chase them back on the spot

225
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,200
Then I can't sell what I can sell

226
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,720
Rikuou course will take a 10-stage test

227
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,920
First, the first test

228
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,180
It's a love test

229
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,500
I went touring and found an old motorcycle on the bottom of the valley

230
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,000
What will you do?

231
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,260
What do you mean what to do?

232
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,140
I don't know

233
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:20,740
You idiot

234
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,420
If you really like motorcycles, pull it up for now

235
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,940
If you can repair it, repair it and use it

236
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,300
If you can't, you should ask the boss for help

237
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,120
That's right

238
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,240
Of course I intend to

239
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,600
Good

240
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,020
Then carry this motorcycle and climb that cliff

241
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,100
I'll ask you to grab it

242
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,960
What?

243
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,120
Why is it so heavy?

244
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,840
I wonder

245
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,380
What would you do if you were a 97-speed motorcycle of Rikuou?

246
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,700
The total weight is 500kg

247
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,160
500kg is not a weight that humans can lift

248
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,780
That's why you cover the motorcycle with love

249
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,080
That's why it's a love test

250
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,320
Yes, I understand

251
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,380
It's for Rikuou

252
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,200
I did it

253
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,160
I'm glad

254
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
OK, I finished the first test

255
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
Next is the second test

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,460
He's taking a lot of credit

257
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,580
I went touring

258
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,240
I found an old motorcycle in the river

259
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,100
What will you do if you do it?

260
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,340
I think it will not be used

261
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,740
I'm not giving it up

262
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,700
Of course you will

263
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,560
This is also to get Rikuou

264
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,500
What?

265
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,260
I got deeper suddenly

266
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,520
It's not certain what kind of danger there is in the river of nature.

267
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,600
Damn it!

268
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
Someone may even talk about piranhas.

269
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,740
You're not stupid.

270
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,380
Okay, the third test.

271
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,860
When I went to the touring, I found an old bike on a tall tree.

272
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,740
What are you going to do?

273
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,320
Of course I'm going to get it.

274
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,260
This is for the sake of the king.

275
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,140
The fifth test.

276
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,800
When I went to the touring, your bike was broken by an unauthorized person in the mountains.

277
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,540
What are you going to do?

278
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,720
Huh?

279
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,680
You're going to build it, aren't you?

280
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,420
Okay, let's go to the next test.

281
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,880
The sixth test.

282
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,900
The seventh test.

283
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,160
The eighth test.

284
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
The ninth test is a draw.

285
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,720
What? What?

286
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,100
Answer the origin of the name of the previous bike manufacturer, Cabton.

287
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,640
It was "Come and buy to Osaka-Nagagawa".

288
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,180
I did it.

289
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,700
What?

290
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,800
62 points.

291
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,480
I just passed it.

292
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,460
I passed the knowledge test.

293
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,500
Next is the final test.

294
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,340
All right.

295
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,300
The final test is that!

296
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,200
You mean I pass that test?

297
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,600
This is not a circus!

298
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,400
When I was touring, I got into the factory of an old furahoop.

299
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,420
That factory became a fire.

300
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,280
What are you going to do?

301
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,520
I got it.

302
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,960
It's good to pass it.

303
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,860
What?

304
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,260
You're gonna give up after coming all the way here?

305
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,600
Time!

306
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,040
Huh?

307
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,680
Hey, Monkey!

308
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,420
Ah, what's up, Dad?

309
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,300
If you have time to go out, why don't you study about motorcycles?

310
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,700
Even if you say that...

311
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,000
You're riding a bicycle, how can you become a great motorcyclist?

312
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,120
But I'm still in junior high school...

313
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,040
Ah, hey! Didn't you already settle the quarrel between parents and children?

314
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,840
Huh? I was being quiet because we were in front of the customers earlier,

315
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,220
but unless you tell me that you're going to close the shop, it won't be resolved!

316
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,400
If you say that... If you say that...

317
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,300
I'm gonna get in a bicycle!

318
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,840
What are you going to do when you get on a bicycle?

319
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,700
No way!

320
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,480
14 years of riding a bicycle!

321
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,720
Honda's son-in-law, Honda Monkey!

322
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,020
This shop is on my level, so I'm gonna ride a bicycle!

323
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,380
I'll change it into a bicycle shop!

324
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,340
Oh...

325
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,380
Your brother's personality changes when he rides a bicycle.

326
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,640
As expected of the Honda family...

327
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,460
Are you still saying such a dreamy thing?

328
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,380
Honda Doll will continue to be a motorcycle shop!

329
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,200
From now on, it's the era of ecology that is kind to the earth.

330
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,780
There will be no more bikes that scatter waste gas!

331
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,320
Let me know the power of the bicycle!

332
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,800
Don't underestimate me, Monkey!

333
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,280
Here crash!

334
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,160
I won't take it anymore!

335
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,860
Hornet...

336
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,020
Hornet...

337
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,360
What's wrong with you?

338
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,920
Hornet...

339
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,900
You'll get hurt again!

340
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,280
Hornet!

341
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:31,480
Hey, hey, Hey!

342
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:31,860
As I expected, there's a lot of other side job,

343
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,220
but I can't keep up with him.

344
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,900
It's not a world where you can't do anything.

345
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,700
It's not like this.

346
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,900
Here we go.

347
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,340
This is the best.

348
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,540
Huh?

349
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,780
Hey, Monki.

350
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,360
Stop it already!

351
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,560
Don't stop, Hayato!

352
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,440
It has nothing to do with you!

353
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
You bastard!

354
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,060
You're gonna get in trouble in front of the customers!

355
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
I'm sorry!

356
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,040
Your family is too messy.

357
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,840
They had a big fight at the store yesterday,

358
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,360
and they've been cleaning up since this morning.

359
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,580
So that's why you closed the store?

360
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,100
Is Dad okay?

361
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,460
I'm sorry, Eve.

362
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,000
Huh?

363
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,720
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

364
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,180
I haven't said anything yet!

365
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Senpai,

366
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,220
what happened to Eve?

367
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,260
No, I thought it would be hard for this kid

368
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,100
to be surrounded by such a family.

369
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,580
I thought it would be hard for this kid to be surrounded by such a family.

370
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
If you have any complaints,

371
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,440
you should just go.

372
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,080
Men get into trouble easily.

373
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,820
I don't have any complaints.

374
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,020
I don't have any complaints.

375
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,260
Oh my!

376
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,960
It's Rikuoh's 7th car!

377
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,680
I'm not gonna get in trouble with a good used car like this again!

378
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,140
I'm not gonna get in trouble with a good used car like this again!

379
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,840
This is a new car.

380
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,760
Don't be so mean.

381
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,520
There's no way there's a new car from Rikuoh.

382
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,940
New cars are used cars.

383
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,140
There's no way there's a new car from Rikuoh.

384
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,160
There's no way there's a new car from Rikuoh.

385
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,180
Don't be so mean.

386
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,600
I want this one.

387
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,260
I can't move until you sell it.

388
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,200
No, I have the car.

389
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,520
I've already taken the test.

390
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,460
What?

391
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,300
You have a test?

392
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,800
I can't even pass the first test

393
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,220
for a guy like you guys.

394
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,380
You can't understand it unless you try.

395
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,140
You can't understand it unless you try.

396
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,620
I don't think it's worth it.

397
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,240
I don't think it's worth it.

398
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,240
I told you it's useless.

399
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,180
I understand!

400
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,600
You're not gonna get in trouble like you guys.

401
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,920
You're not gonna get in trouble like you guys.

402
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,960
I'll remember it!

403
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,920
Who will remember it?

404
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,540
Don't you ever come here again!

405
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,040
Give me the salt!

406
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,180
Okay.

407
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,280
What about my test?

408
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,400
Okay.

409
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,280
How far did you go?

410
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,380
It's a test.

411
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,180
I even took a test.

412
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,520
But where's the test paper?

413
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,740
Where's the test paper?

414
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,620
Here it is.

415
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,920
Here it is.

416
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,000
Wow!

417
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,860
I can't help it.

418
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,880
I'll have to take it again from the beginning.

419
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,080
What?

420
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,340
You're gonna do that again from the beginning?

421
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,020
I went to the two-wheel road.

422
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,680
I found an old bike on the bottom of the valley.

423
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,760
What are you gonna do?

424
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,900
Maybe I'm gonna die.

425
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:29,780
No!

426
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,220
Dad!

427
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,160
My sister!

428
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,240
No way!

429
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,580
Eve!

430
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,680
Dad, this is...

431
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,440
I took care of my daughter.

432
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,060
If you want to give it back, bring me the land.

433
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,840
The second one is the map.

434
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,900
That bastard!

435
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,520
What should I do?

436
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,680
I should have told the police.

437
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,240
We're the police.

438
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,240
I see.

439
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,480
Dad, that's not a landmine, but a double one.

440
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,160
How can you give my bike to those guys?

441
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,260
I'll make you regret fighting so much!

442
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,640
I'll make you regret fighting so much!

443
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:22,820
I'll come back tomorrow.

444
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,640
What?

445
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,740
The back wheel...

446
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,660
What are you talking about?

447
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,780
Come here, my little girl!

448
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,220
You!

449
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:52,000
What's the matter with a little girl like us?

450
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,760
What are you going to do about it?

451
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,240
Monkey!

452
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,740
Shut up!

453
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,600
Get him!

454
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,580
Monkey!

455
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,200
It's already alive!

456
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,660
I won't let you get away!

457
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,460
Damn it!

458
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,620
The Jal is lacking in power!

459
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,580
Leave it to me!

460
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,620
Big brother, I'm counting on you!

461
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,080
I'm going too!

462
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,540
Don't overdo it, Dad!

463
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,480
It's over!

464
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,840
I'm the second of the Minami Senju's!

465
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,840
If you think you can escape, you're wrong!

466
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,820
D- damn it!

467
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,460
The elephant escaped!

468
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:05,960
Eve!

469
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,300
What do we do?

470
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,220
Eve!

471
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,560
It's up there!

472
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,500
We did it!

473
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,100
We got on the elephant's back!

474
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,980
Eve!

475
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,860
What's this place?

476
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,400
Where's Big Brother?

477
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,640
It's all right.

478
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,640
It's on top of the elephant.

479
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,220
The elephant?

480
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,400
This is bad.

481
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,700
What's wrong?

482
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,700
What's so bad?

483
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,300
I just remembered.

484
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,720
That quiet Eve has once changed her personality.

485
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,820
Before Eve went to kindergarten,

486
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,680
she went to the circus and was on the elephant.

487
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,840
Then when Eve got on the elephant...

488
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,140
What?

489
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,600
This is the worst situation.

490
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,380
Arigatou!

491
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,160
Get off.

492
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,980
We're going home.

493
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,240
Get off?

494
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,740
You two were fighting back there.

495
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,060
That has nothing to do with this.

496
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,660
You're going to fight me?

497
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,780
Help!

498
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,760
Help!

499
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,140
Help!

500
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,760
No!

501
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,540
You're the worst!

502
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,800
My light...

503
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,440
residents of the forest!

504
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,320
Don't break my room.

505
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,020
Anyone!

506
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,980
Here, here!

507
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,540
All right!

508
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,580
We'll end up having a new family forever.

Even if I'm a young and cute girl,
