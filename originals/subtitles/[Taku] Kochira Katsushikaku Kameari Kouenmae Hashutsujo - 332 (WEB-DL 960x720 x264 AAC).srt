"Separation"

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,960
Senpai, this is...

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,560
It came out of the drawer.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,340
It's a picture of Yves' wedding.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,380
It's like a father who makes his daughter his wife.

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,020
It was a big deal that Honda made a fuss.

24
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,280
They're good siblings.

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,340
I was worried because they were getting married.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,600
But Yves and Kawasaki are about to graduate, aren't they?

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,900
Where will they get a job?

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,620
I wonder.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,040
Hello, everyone.

30
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,680
Hello.

31
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,440
Kawasaki, Yves.

32
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,640
Long time no see.

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,740
I really appreciate your help at the wedding.

34
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,720
We were just talking about you two.

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,120
Where will you get a job?

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,220
Actually, regarding the job...

37
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,840
I have some advice for you all.

38
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,440
What?

39
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,760
Is that so?

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,460
You two are great.

41
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,880
I haven't told my family yet.

42
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,160
Especially,

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm worried about how to tell my brother.

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,820
That's a big problem, isn't it?

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,080
Don't worry.

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,100
I'll tell Honda.

47
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,420
What?

48
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,020
Senpai will do it?

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,860
I know how to handle Honda.

50
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,720
I know the least shocking way.

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,580
You failed at the wedding, too.

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,740
Yes, yes.

53
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,020
You'll be fine this time.

54
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,280
Leave everything to me.

55
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,460
Y-Yes, sir.

56
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:50,620
Thank you.

57
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,300
See you later, Honda family!

58
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,240
Mr. Ryozuma!

59
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,300
What's the matter?

60
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,060
Why are you suddenly talking?

61
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,700
Huh?

62
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,840
Ryo-chan is the one who's talking.

63
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,400
Is that so?

64
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,140
Hey, you're here, Honda.

65
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,820
What's the matter?

66
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,820
Well...

67
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,520
Yves gave birth.

68
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,620
Yves gave birth!

69
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,320
What?

70
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,720
What?

71
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,080
What?

72
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,980
What are you talking about, senpai?

73
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,580
Yves hasn't had a baby yet!

74
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,920
It's about a game.

75
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,640
A game?

76
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,980
Yes.

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,500
It's a pretty interesting simulation game.

78
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,480
It's like watching a person's life.

79
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,440
A simulation game?

80
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,540
Yes.

81
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,780
So, the character I'm raising now is Yves.

82
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,880
Yves's brother was a boy.

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,460
But...

84
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,400
I want to name him the same as my sister.

85
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,300
What should I name him?

86
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,560
If you name him the name of a friend,

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,640
you'll get a sense of closeness.

88
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,740
But it doesn't make sense.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,620
It's okay. It's a game.

90
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,720
Ryo-chan, I wonder if it's really okay to leave it to one person.

91
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm worried.

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,940
So, what's the story?

93
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,920
Well, it's...

94
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,120
What's going on?

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,540
Yves is going to go far away with her husband's transfer.

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,700
Finally, Yves is going to leave her hometown.

97
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,000
What?

98
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,220
Oh, my God!

99
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,460
Senpai!

100
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,740
Are you all right?

101
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,520
Yves is going to go far away with her husband's transfer.

102
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,200
Don't cry.

103
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,600
Yves!

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,920
What's wrong?

105
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,280
What's wrong?

106
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,140
It's just a game.

107
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,340
I just heard the name Yves.

108
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,580
It's a Honda.

109
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,680
So, you haven't told me about the story yet?

110
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,060
I just talked about the game.

111
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,080
I can't talk about it.

112
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,820
Why do you talk about important things while playing games?

113
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,220
I'm telling you.

114
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,320
While we're talking about the game,

115
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,440
Yves goes overseas.

116
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,700
I thought it would be less shocking if I talked about going overseas.

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,380
Yves is going to go far away.

118
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,520
Yves is going to go far away.

119
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,400
Thank you for your help.

120
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,720
Goodbye.

121
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,320
To overseas.

122
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,680
Yves is going to go...

123
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,940
Hey, Honda!

124
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,340
Mr. Honda!

125
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,500
Yves is going to go overseas.

126
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,720
Yves is going to go overseas.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,320
Are you all right, Honda?

128
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,280
Please be strong.

129
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,700
Please be strong.

130
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,740
Yves is going...

131
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,040
What?

132
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,840
Oh, my goodness!

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,640
Really?

134
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,900
Yves is going overseas?

135
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,800
They're thinking of moving to Africa.

136
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,920
Africa!

137
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,280
Ahhhh...

138
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,880
Is that okay?

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,320
Be calm and listen closely.

140
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,460
Yves is going to Africa.

141
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,860
Now desert is spreading all over the world.

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,580
And it also causes poverty and famine.

143
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,580
To do so, many people are following the land where they live.

144
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,500
And to stop her from eating, you need to eat.

145
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,320
Kawasaki used to volunteer to go to the African Karahari Desert.

146
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,640
He thought it was a good job to spend his life.

147
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,680
So after graduation, he decided to go to Africa.

148
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,280
As expected of the partner chosen by Eve.

149
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,600
He has a very solid idea.

150
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,860
So you don't have to take Eve with you, do you?

151
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,720
You are a married couple.

152
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,140
So you have to stay where I can see you.

153
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,080
Please, please, senpai.

154
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,880
Please make sure Eve doesn't go to Africa.

155
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,760
Hello.

156
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,480
Welcome.

157
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,040
It's the first time you've come to my house.

158
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,000
It's a small place, but please come up.

159
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,440
Yes.

160
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,260
Hey, Mr. Ryotsu.

161
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
What about the story of the example?

162
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,560
Tell me.

163
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,860
I was a little surprised, but I was convinced.

164
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,680
Is that so?

165
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,700
So I have a little discussion about it today.

166
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,140
What?

167
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
I'm at Eve's house?

168
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

169
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,220
I'm wondering if you would like to work with me until I go to Africa.

170
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,400
Why suddenly?

171
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,760
Actually, I talked to the family of Honda about going to Africa.

172
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,640
Are you opposed?

173
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:03,900
No.

174
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,740
If it's a good idea, everyone will agree.

175
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,520
Is that so?

176
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,380
But.

177
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,660
Mr. Honda's father.

178
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,300
He is sad that Eve is not going to be able to see him from now on.

179
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,000
Then how about living with the shop until I leave for Africa?

180
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,760
I see.

181
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,600
I guess the two of them were working at the convenience store to earn money for Africa.

182
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,040
Yes.

183
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,020
But the rent and living expenses of the apartment are not very good.

184
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,940
Then, it's even more convenient.

185
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,940
And, originally, Kawasaki likes motorcycles and has a license as a mechanics.

186
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,280
Yes.

187
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,920
Yes, that's what we're talking about.

188
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,740
We're here to help you.

189
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,420
Right?

190
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:43,960
Yes.

191
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:44,980
I see!

192
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,960
That's the deal!

193
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,180
I'm glad!

194
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,720
And I want to ask you something.

195
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,500
While you're at home,

196
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,680
people in Hondake are hoping that you'll forget about Africa and have a fun day.

197
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,360
Kawasaki, I don't want you to tell anyone about going to Africa.

198
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,020
What do you think?

199
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,040
Yes, I understand.

200
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,160
Hello!

201
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,800
Hey, Ryo.

202
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,480
Long time no see.

203
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,960
What's up?

204
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,060
Actually, I have something to tell you.

205
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,160
What? Kawasaki is at home?

206
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,160
Yes.

207
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,740
He wants to work here.

208
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,480
But why are you here all of a sudden?

209
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,980
Actually, I was talking to Kawasaki the other day,

210
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,640
and he told me about this shop.

211
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,260
He said he wanted to ride on the white horse for the rest of his life,

212
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,140
so he wanted to be a police officer.

213
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,580
So I told him.

214
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,440
My brother's brother hates bikes.

215
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,060
He said he wouldn't ride on a bike for the rest of his life.

216
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,260
So?

217
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,320
Then Kawasaki said he wanted to ride on a bike.

218
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,820
Really?

219
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,380
Yes.

220
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,280
He said he's been interested in riding on a bike for a long time.

221
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,280
Hmm.

222
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,380
That bastard.

223
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,340
He's a bad guy.

224
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,440
I see!

225
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,100
Then it's a deal!

226
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,200
I'm glad!

227
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,220
I'm glad!

228
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm glad!

229
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,500
I'm glad!

230
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,460
But, sir, I have a request for you.

231
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,380
What?

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,180
Kawasaki doesn't want to be spoiled by you.

233
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,220
He wants you to be a good boy.

234
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,640
So I want you to be strict with Kawasaki,

235
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,100
just like a part-time job.

236
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,980
Don't tell him to let you work here.

237
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,860
Don't make him feel at ease.

238
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,900
I got it.

239
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,980
Leave it to me.

240
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,720
I got it.

241
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,080
You're a good boy!

242
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,500
You're a good boy!

243
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:34,820
I'm a very good boy!

244
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,960
You're a very good boy!

245
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,060
But, sir, will this really work?

246
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,520
Yeah!

247
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,940
Anyway, if I can make you two work together, it'll be fine.

248
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,740
Huh?

249
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,260
You got it?

250
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:45,980
Think about it!

251
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,520
What'll happen if you do that?

252
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,600
What will happen?

253
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,700
Kawasaki looks at his father, who works hard every day.

254
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:52,920
He watches his father

255
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,460
But the Honda Ringo is closed down by his father

256
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,640
Kawasaki-kun who likes to ride a motorcycle

257
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,000
It must be hard to watch it

258
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,900
He tries to convince Kawasaki-kun to follow him

259
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,040
Kawasaki-kun can eat a lifetime with his favorite bike

260
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,080
He doesn't have to go to Africa

261
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,980
Your father is satisfied with the after-sale

262
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,920
You are satisfied with the car

263
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,720
Kawasaki-kun is satisfied with the motorcycle

264
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,560
Everyone is satisfied

265
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,240
How is it?

266
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,080
I'm not used to it

267
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,400
Please change the motorbike oil

268
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:48,300
Kawasaki-kun, how long do you need to change the oil?

269
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,680
Sorry

270
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,960
I've finished changing the oil

271
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,840
The brake is getting weaker

272
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,960
I was looking at it

273
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,640
I see

274
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,520
You noticed

275
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,860
I was thinking of doing it later

276
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,220
I'll do it

277
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,060
As expected

278
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,560
I'll show you

279
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,260
No, no, no

280
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,720
Show me

281
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,060
Show me

282
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,020
You want me to show you

283
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,920
Honda Hayate's favorite

284
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,140
Chichikurimanbo

285
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,340
I like it

286
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,240
My father likes it

287
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,180
Chichikurimanbo

288
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,120
Chichikurimanbo

289
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Chichikurimanbo

290
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,720
I like it

291
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,240
My brother is really interesting

292
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,360
Really?

293
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,640
I'm funny

294
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,320
No, no, I was praised

295
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,280
I said I couldn't go to a restaurant

296
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,220
I see

297
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,820
Kawasaki-kun

298
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,960
Eve is making dinner tonight

299
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,400
Did the food get better?

300
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,560
Yes

301
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,920
Please look forward to it

302
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,880
Yes

303
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,080
Eve can cook any ingredients well

304
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,900
For example, Africa

305
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,900
No, no, no

306
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,760
Afu?

307
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,300
I like Afro Namie

308
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,220
Kawasaki-kun

309
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:57,860
Yes, yes

310
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,840
Afro Namie

311
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,980
Afro Namie

312
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,740
That's it

313
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,200
So you can't say you're going to Africa

314
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,120
Oh

315
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,220
Smile, smile

316
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,940
Let's eat

317
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,200
This is also delicious

318
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,140
That's sweet

319
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,680
It's pretty good

320
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,580
I'm happy

321
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,280
Well, it's delicious

322
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,020
Eve has improved a lot

323
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,520
Really?

324
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,100
It's good to have dinner with everyone like this

325
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,420
After all

326
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,520
It has to be like this

327
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:24,840
Hmm

328
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,860
By the way, Ryoji's part-time job

329
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,060
What!

330
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,120
Part-time job?

331
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,340
No, no, no, not that

332
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,820
Ba Ba Ba Barito

333
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,480
Barito is nice

334
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,140
I'm stupid on the southern island

335
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,380
I'm not interested

336
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,100
Yeah, that's right

337
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,460
No, more than that

338
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,740
But I'm very happy, Kawasaki.

339
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,260
So he's coming after me.

340
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,380
- enslaved? - No!

341
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,620
- Ass Octupik! Octupik! Movvvvvvv! - Oh?

342
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,340
- All

343
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,420
- Stububububububububububububububububu! - Stububububububub!

344
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,180
- Is this OK? - Stubububububububububububububububububububububububububububububububu!

345
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,860
- series? - This is quite...

346
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,480
Oh! Sorry a bit, Sturubing!

347
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,780
I'm looking forward to it!

348
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,680
Let's go!

349
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,380
Let's go!

350
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,560
It looks good.

351
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,420
I'm sure this is OK.

352
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,360
Eh? Kawasaki is working for Honda Rinyo?

353
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,880
Yeah, it's a matter of time before he gets a job.

354
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,340
What about going to Africa?

355
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,460
I don't think he'll quit.

356
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,880
No way!

357
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,600
It's OK, Kei-chan.

358
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,720
Ryo-chan's plans won't work out.

359
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,000
Right?

360
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,100
I don't know what to say.

361
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:54,920
This is bad!

362
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,300
They found out everything!

363
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,100
What!?

364
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,360
I knew it.

365
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,980
What are you going to do, Senpai?

366
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,040
What happened, Honda?

367
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,520
Well, that's...

368
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,640
I have to go.

369
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:11,860
I have to go.

370
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,320
Guess I'll get you a car.

371
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:12,940
Like this?

372
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,300
I'll just go.

373
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,380
I'll just take my car.

374
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,360
No.

375
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,440
Jason!

376
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,780
It's been a while.

377
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,800
Since you last saw us.

378
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,160
Not so much!

379
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,800
You drove me all the way to Kakocho.

380
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,240
You scared the fuck out of me.

381
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,420
There's more?

382
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,600
What?

383
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,940
They saw our movie and didn't know when.

384
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,760
What? You want to ban those guys from going out?

385
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,240
Yes.

386
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,840
What's the deal?

387
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,820
If the shop is popularized as a place where the gangsters come and go,

388
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,260
this shop will also be seen with the naked eye.

389
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,540
It will be hard for the general public to enter.

390
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,740
That's a problem I can't solve.

391
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,600
Father!

392
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,180
I choose my customers.

393
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,600
This is how the Honda Ringo works.

394
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,500
If you want to run a shop, remember this.

395
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,120
Run a shop?

396
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,680
What are you talking about?

397
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,200
If I and Eve get paid,

398
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,700
we plan to go to Africa.

399
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,960
I don't intend to run this shop.

400
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,380
What?

401
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,580
Brother, are you okay?

402
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,820
I'm fine, I'm fine.

403
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,500
Did you fool me?

404
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,680
I was the one who fooled you.

405
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,680
What are you talking about?

406
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,140
I didn't ask you to run a shop.

407
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,620
I didn't ask you to go to Africa either.

408
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,000
What?

409
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,280
Stop it, you two.

410
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,140
Father!

411
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,160
Zephyr!

412
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,320
Why did you do this?

413
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,440
Excuse me.

414
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,560
Zephyr.

415
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,220
Kawasaki-kun didn't come back.

416
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,740
Eve has to bring him back.

417
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,940
He's going to be in trouble with me.

418
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,080
Senpai!

419
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,300
Please do something!

420
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,460
What are you going to do, senpai?

421
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,280
Zephyr, Senpai!

422
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,020
Please do something, senpai!

423
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:17,920
Zephyr!

424
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:17,940
Zephyr!

425
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,700
Zephyr!

426
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,360
Zephyr, Senpai!

427
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,780
Zephyr!

428
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,400
No, Zephyr!

429
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,100
Zephyr!

430
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,940
Zephyr!

431
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,440
Zephyr!

432
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,700
I can't forgive the

433
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,400
only the

434
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,480
only the

435
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,040
only the

436
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,200
only the only the only one

437
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,800
Can't you believe that old man?

438
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,120
I can understand if I talk to people

439
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,820
I can understand if I talk to people

440
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,560
I can understand if I talk to people

441
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,720
I don't believe in cheap humanism

442
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,520
But that old man is real

443
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,260
Those who are dating with that old man

444
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,900
I don't think he's such a bad guy

445
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,860
How about you and that old man

446
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,420
I don't think he's such a bad guy

447
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,160
I don't think he's such a bad guy

448
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:19,720
I'm sorry about yesterday

449
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,340
Please let me work again

450
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,080
This is the one?

451
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,280
Yes.

452
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Can you fix it?

453
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,480
Kawasaki A1 Samurai.

454
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,420
No parts left.

455
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,680
The fork is bent.

456
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,520
Is this bike your own?

457
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,700
Yes, it's my husband's.

458
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,100
He liked to use a motorcycle since he was young.

459
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,440
But 20 years ago, he couldn't turn the curve at night.

460
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,080
He was in a hurry because he had a baby.

461
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,080
He left without seeing the baby.

462
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,040
He was taking care of the bike, so he couldn't throw it away.

463
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,240
I see.

464
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,760
I don't like the bike that took my father's life.

465
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,980
I asked my mother to throw this bike away many times.

466
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,080
Really?

467
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,520
But recently, I suddenly thought.

468
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,860
Is the motorcycle so good?

469
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,860
What did my father like so much about the motorcycle?

470
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,420
Then, I wanted to ride a motorcycle.

471
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,960
I took a motorcycle license.

472
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,940
I wanted to ride the motorcycle that my father liked.

473
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,700
Through the motorcycle, I may have wanted to touch my father.

474
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,380
If I could, I could ride this motorcycle that my father was riding.

475
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,340
Really?

476
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,040
What do you think?

477
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,720
Would you like to hear your daughter's selfishness?

478
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,040
Please.

479
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,380
It's okay.

480
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,360
I'll manage it.

481
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,120
You.

482
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,220
Please.

483
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,720
Please.

484
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,500
I understand.

485
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,420
Thank you.

486
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,500
I left this to you.

487
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,680
I'll do my best.

488
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,220
Yes.

489
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,600
It'll be okay.

490
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,060
Are you okay.

491
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,580
Yes.

492
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,780
Sorry.

493
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,240
I was too lazy to repair it.

494
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,540
That's right.

495
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,720
But.

496
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,200
I want to put her on this bike no matter what.

497
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,360
That's what I thought.

498
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:45,800
Aoi.

499
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,120
Work is more severe.

500
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,660
There are things that just don't work out.

501
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,140
Yes.

502
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,300
But.

503
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,360
I think it's necessary to cherish such feelings.

504
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,320
I think.

505
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,580
If you hadn't said it then, I would have been dragged into this.

506
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,760
Father?

507
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,880
Those two are pretty good.

508
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,100
I'm glad.

509
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,580
How are you feeling?

510
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,160
Yes, I'm almost fine.

511
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,280
But this carburetor won't be of any use.

512
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,740
I knew it.

513
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,300
I've asked around the manufacturers and the used shops.

514
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,080
But nowhere.

515
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,940
I see.

516
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,100
If only this could be fixed.

517
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,300
Boss! I found it!

518
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,360
A1's carburetor!

519
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,680
I see. You found it well.

520
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,300
It was pretty hard.

521
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,380
We all went looking for it.

522
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,020
But I couldn't help but listen to my father's request.

523
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,380
If I didn't, I wouldn't have any choice.

524
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,640
Idiot!

525
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,020
Here.

526
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,460
Yes.

527
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,520
Thank you all so much.

528
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,300
Thank you.

529
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,560
Don't throw all those jokes around.

530
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,240
But you didn't do anything bad, right?

531
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,100
That's horrible.

532
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,520
To Heyama

533
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,360
OK, go!

534
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,380
Yes.

535
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,360
We did it!

536
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,300
G существует

537
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,320
It's the feeling, it's the feeling

538
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,320
My feeling

539
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,860
Dad, this is the scenery you were looking at.

540
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,680
If I can carry my luggage

541
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,740
Let's go touring as it is!

542
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,840
Yes!

543
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,200
Go Honda!

544
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,280
Let's go!

545
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,580
Let's go!

546
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,900
Go Honda!

547
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,280
If I can support you

548
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,780
How wonderful would that be?

549
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,360
Dad, you're great at using the microphone.

550
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,060
What? You finally understand.

551
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,900
Please, let me take you to that shop.

552
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,340
It's the feeling, it's the feeling

553
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,960
You...

554
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,020
No!

555
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,920
You're going to Africa, aren't you?

556
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,540
Don't turn back what you've decided once!

557
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,900
I'm going to bike rather than Africa.

558
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,820
I've decided.

559
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,700
No, no!

560
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,780
Everyone in the exhaust,

561
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,600
Thank you for your assistance.

562
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Right now, me and Eve are working as volunteers in Africa

563
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,540
and running a bike shop.

564
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,220
As if to start the name of the Honda Ringo Africa branch,

565
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:18,920
I work hard every day.

566
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,700
Eve....

567
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,340
I'm sad because of my brother

568
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,540
but Eve is well,

569
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,020
so please don't worry.

570
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,360
But sometimes,

571
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,900
elephant comes to the shop.

572
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,020
I'm a little troubled.

573
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,020
Elephant?

574
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,940
This is...

575
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,180
Hey! Hey! Hey!

576
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,760
Don't run like a black sheep!

577
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,920
