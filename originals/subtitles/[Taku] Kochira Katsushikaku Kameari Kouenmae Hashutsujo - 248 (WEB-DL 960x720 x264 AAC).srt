00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,540
Exclusive - Summoning the Super Saiyan

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm the Super Saiyan!

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,100
Here I come!

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,360
If this is the case...

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:31,040
Now, let the mob have a toast to the peace of the world!

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,880
You're really better than the last one.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,920
This one, this one!

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,520
That's it.

9
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,620
That's it!

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,060
You're out, Mr. Monster!

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,800
Hey! How long are you going to keep sleeping?

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,520
Mr. Monster!

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,420
You fool!

14
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,500
When you watch TV, make your room bright and look away.

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,340
"I'm not going to sleep."

16
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,040
Come to me, you poor thing.

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,240
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,980
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

19
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,740
I'm sure it'll be alright.

20
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,740
Do you understand?

21
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,900
I do, I do.

22
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,220
If you do, just shut up and follow me!

23
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,620
Mine Only: Katsushika Pro-Wrestling

24
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,580
Oh, dear.

25
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,880
I'm in trouble.

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,920
I didn't think a real person would show up there.

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,040
But even if you tell me to get to work, the world is peace itself.

28
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,140
Katsushika Pro-Wrestling?

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,400
I've never heard of this organization.

30
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,160
Let's take a look.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,000
Wait.

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,580
What kind of old-timers are they?

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,800
What the hell are they?

34
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,240
"I'm a furu! I'm a furu!"

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,100
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

36
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,540
What's the point of threading a fabulous story like this?

37
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,220
Let's do some other things.

38
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,400
I'll kill you!

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,440
What?

40
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,800
What kind of old-fashioned wrestling is going on in the era of fighting?

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,980
You can't call your guests with that kind of wrestling!

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,380
I found you!

43
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,080
You there!

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,880
You mean me?

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,960
Yes. Can you come up to my ring?

46
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,660
What?

47
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:31,880
What?

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,900
Actually, I've been keeping it a secret, but my Katsushika wrestling has been going on for a long time.

49
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,440
If I don't, the organization will be gone.

50
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,440
You can see it by looking at the secret.

51
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,760
That's true. I've loved wrestling since I was a kid.

52
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,740
I got rid of it last year and finally started my own wrestling organization.

53
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,580
For some reason, my legs are still not straight.

54
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,900
I guess so. No one would want to see that.

55
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,620
Why? I'm doing my best all my life! Why? Why?

56
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,680
First of all, wrestling itself is old-fashioned.

57
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,360
That's the same as wrestling in Rikidouzan.

58
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,560
But that's the kind of wrestling I liked.

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
That's not good.

60
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,700
The martial arts world is evolving every day.

61
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,640
Your wrestling is clearly different.

62
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,100
It's a time-lapse.

63
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,260
Then what should I do?

64
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,700
I see.

65
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,220
Okay, leave everything to me.

66
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,780
Well, then...

67
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,660
I'll become a wrestler and a producer and rebuild this organization.

68
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,800
Really?

69
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,540
However, half of the sales will be mine.

70
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,440
What?

71
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,740
Pro wrestling?

72
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,160
That's right. I'd like everyone to lend me a hand.

73
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,220
Why do we have to wrestle?

74
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,280
I don't want to do that.

75
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,280
I don't like it either.

76
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,740
How pitiful.

77
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,160
You guys are such cold-hearted people.

78
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,440
I'm so pitiful that I'm about to cry.

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,680
Senior.

80
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,200
Ryo.

81
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,760
There was a man once.

82
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,120
He loved wrestling more than anyone else.

83
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,720
And one day, to make his dream come true,

84
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,980
he started a wrestling organization himself.

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,680
That's what Katsushika Wrestling is.

86
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,660
However, due to the ups and downs of the world,

87
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,900
his business collapsed.

88
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,860
He had to give up his business.

89
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,740
But I want to say this.

90
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,500
Do you have to give up your dream?

91
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,400
No, it's not like that.

92
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,680
It's definitely not like that.

93
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,480
You must never give up your dream.

94
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,580
But, but...

95
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,740
You guys...

96
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,120
You guys...

97
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,660
Why do you care?

98
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,160
You became a police officer.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,420
Isn't it to help the people in trouble?

100
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,360
The man who dreamed of wrestling.

101
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,540
Let's make him a beautiful man with our hands.

102
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,720
Isn't that right?

103
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,760
You guys...

104
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,600
Senior, I was wrong.

105
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,660
You're amazing, Ryo.

106
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,500
Ryo, I'll do my best.

107
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,000
All right, that's what I expected.

108
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,800
I'll give you lots of money.

109
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,280
All right, I'll give you lots of money.

110
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,860
I'll give you the rest of the money I have.

111
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,060
Just answer the phone.

112
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,720
If you can promise me,

113
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,340
I'll go there and make sure

114
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,040
I'll go and replace you with someone else.

115
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,580
But, uh...

116
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,200
I have different opinions.

117
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,020
Mapo, please!

118
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,940
He say you're a good person.

119
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,700
A good person?

120
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,640
A good person?!

121
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,880
I see, I see. That's great.

122
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:09,820
I'll teach you that pro wrestling is in America.

123
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,180
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

124
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:22,400
Okay, everyone's here.

125
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,600
I'll hand out costumes and scenarios to everyone.

126
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,660
I'll read them carefully until the match.

127
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,180
Scenarios?

128
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,280
Pro wrestling isn't just about matches.

129
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,900
You need a drama to get there.

130
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,060
You need a wrestler's character and a drama outside the ring.

131
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,340
I see.

132
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,340
You're wearing this?

133
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,460
Do I have to do this?

134
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't like it.

135
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,240
Idiot!

136
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,400
You're in trouble.

137
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,040
You're not going to let me go?

138
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,980
Why did you become a cop?

139
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,220
I was wrong.

140
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,160
You're great, Ryo.

141
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,280
Ryo, I'll do my best, too.

142
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,260
That's what I'm looking forward to.

143
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,020
Let's go!

144
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,680
Everyone at the venue.

145
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,580
From today, I, Katsushika Pro-Wrestling,

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,680
will be reborn as the new Katsushika Pro-Wrestling.

147
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:26,980
The new Katsushika Pro-Wrestling is about to begin.

148
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,260
Now, this is where--

149
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,240
Get out of here, you poor people!

150
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,020
What's that?

151
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,620
What?

152
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,940
Nice to meet you all, the poor people at the venue.

153
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,760
I am the owner of the gorgeous mask,

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,440
Shinkatsu Shika Pro-Wrestling.

155
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,360
I'm the owner of this store.

156
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,820
Today, for the sake of all you poor people,

157
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,140
I will show you the best wrestling.

158
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,960
Because I have money!

159
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,160
What's wrong, former owner?

160
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,360
Pick it up without hesitation.

161
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,240
You're in trouble with money, aren't you?

162
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,360
Now, owner, pick it up quickly.

163
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
Or do you want more?

164
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,200
Here, how about this?

165
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,780
Stop!

166
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,860
I won't forgive anyone who uses money to spoil the entertainment of the common people!

167
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,300
Oh, no. The poor man has come up to the ring.

168
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,100
Go home quickly.

169
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,180
Here, your train fare.

170
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,560
You're a bunch of rich bastards.

171
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,600
You won't let me do whatever you want with this new ring!

172
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,340
I got it.

173
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,280
Then, let's have a match.

174
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,360
If you win, I'll give you the seat of the owner.

175
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,920
I'll accept the challenge!

176
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,180
Red corner, 190cm, 120kg.

177
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,520
Mad Volvo!

178
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,640
Blue corner, 168cm, 82kg.

179
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,480
Kabutori Kamen!

180
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:22,600
B три.

181
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,320
Go!

182
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,500
Come at me!

183
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,340
You can always win in the match.

184
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,220
Shut up!

185
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:30,680
KittyKitty!

186
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,860
He really can play pro-wrestling?

187
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,760
And he's pretty good.

188
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,020
So good!

189
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,780
Now, today's main event.

190
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,100
Huh?

191
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,960
Masked Gambler, where are you?

192
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,440
How are you, Minnanoshu?

193
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,720
What are you doing? It's time for the match.

194
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,580
The match doesn't matter anymore. Look at this!

195
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,420
Oh, that's the company's money.

196
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,460
What's going on?

197
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,220
Wasn't he on the owner's side?

198
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,780
Yeah! Money is everything in the world!

199
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,380
Well, goodbye!

200
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,660
That's mean!

201
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,020
What a guy!

202
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,020
Get up, I'll blow you up!

203
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,340
It's too late!

204
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,800
Let's go!

205
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,620
You're good, Masked Gambler.

206
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,140
This is for everyone!

207
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,340
You're the best!

208
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,200
I-I'm...

209
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,580
I'm...

210
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,020
I'm... a...

211
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,820
I'm... a...

212
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm... a...

213
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm... a...

214
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:03,700
I'm... a...

215
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:11,100
I-I've never received so much applause!

216
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,360
Hehe.

217
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,480
Everything is in the script.

218
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,900
Thank you, everyone!

219
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,880
Thanks to you, we were able to promote the new Katsushika Pro-Wrestling.

220
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,600
Thanks to you, we were able to promote the new Katsushika Pro-Wrestling.

221
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,340
Well, we just did what we had to do.

222
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,180
Well, we just did what we had to do.

223
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,320
Well, let's talk about the next match.

224
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,200
Well, let's talk about the next match.

225
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,680
The next match?

226
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,560
Huh? The next match?

227
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,320
Hey, owner.

228
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,600
The customer just arrived.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,460
He-He left early.

230
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,920
Oh, really?

231
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,520
He-He left early.

232
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,320
Huh?

233
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,500
Hey, what's going on with the next match?

234
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,740
Isn't that the last one?

235
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,840
Ryo, it's the owner's last match.

236
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,920
He said he was going to the end.

237
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,380
Hey, you idiot!

238
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,140
Hey, you idiot!

239
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,960
Today's match is just the beginning.

240
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,460
Today's match is just the beginning.

241
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,240
The new Katsushika Pro-Wrestling is just beginning.

242
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,960
The new Katsushika Pro-Wrestling is just beginning.

243
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,660
You can change your mind in a little while!

244
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,300
But you guys...

245
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,600
But you guys...

246
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,880
I-I know.

247
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,680
Oh, really?

248
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,640
Well, I hope you understand.

249
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,260
Nyehaha!

250
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,660
Nyehaha!

251
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:17,860
Nyehaha!

252
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,160
Nyehaha!

253
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,020
Nyehaha!

254
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,340
Nyehaha!

255
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,620
Nyehaha!

256
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,180
Nyehaha!

257
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,140
Nyehaha!

258
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,480
Nyehaha!

259
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,460
Nyehaha!

260
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,700
Pro-wrestling is awesome!

261
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,240
Good morning!

262
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,320
Huh?

263
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,620
By the way,

264
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,940
Ryo's really not here,

265
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,600
nor is Nakagawa and Reigo here.

266
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,180
Good morning!

267
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,560
I-I'm sorry.

268
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,400
I was late.

269
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,600
Oh, no, you're not late yet.

270
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,720
It's unusual for everyone to go to work together.

271
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
Yeah, well...

272
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,640
Senpai, it's impossible.

273
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,220
Touring around the country while working...

274
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,460
Don't complain.

275
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,080
I managed to make it in time, so it's okay.

276
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,820
I can't let go of such a big chance.

277
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,080
Hey, Ryotsu.

278
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,200
Yes, what is it?

279
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,340
That article is...

280
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,700
Our game yesterday...

281
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,040
There's been an interesting pro-wrestling lately.

282
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,260
Have you seen it?

283
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,340
No, it's my first time.

284
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,240
How about Nakagawa?

285
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,260
How about Reiko?

286
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,000
No, I didn't know either.

287
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,000
Is that so?

288
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,240
I didn't know.

289
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,280
I see.

290
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,960
The president and everyone at the office went to see it.

291
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,680
It was quite interesting.

292
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,960
I'll go see it once.

293
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,300
Reiko!

294
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,340
No, pro-wrestling is...

295
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,360
It's been since the Rikidozan on Gaito TV.

296
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,640
Senpai, it's not good.

297
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,340
If the chief finds out...

298
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,380
Don't worry.

299
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,840
The chief didn't even find out, so it's okay.

300
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,360
But Chief Ohara is surprisingly good at thinking.

301
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,580
R-right.

302
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,720
This is the ticket sales area.

303
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

304
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,480
It's a ticket for Shinkatsu Shika Pro-Wrestling.

305
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,140
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,740
It's sold out.

307
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,880
What? All of them?

308
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:30,740
Yes.

309
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,300
Shinkatsu Shika Pro-Wrestling is as popular as a giant battle ship today.

310
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,460
It's on sale and on sale at the same time.

311
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,120
Oh, is it that amazing?

312
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,780
Oh, that's dangerous.

313
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,260
Oh, hello.

314
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,880
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,640
It's a ticket for Shinkatsu Shika Pro-Wrestling.

316
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,480
It's a ticket for Shinkatsu Shika Pro-Wrestling.

317
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,240
All the tickets for today's sale are on sale.

318
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,880
Oh, no more.

319
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,320
Last one.

320
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,120
Huh?

321
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,300
It looks silver.

322
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,100
Too bad.

323
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:17,820
Here's your tissue.

324
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,400
What?

325
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,720
That's a bad one.

326
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,660
That's not good.

327
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,100
How should I move the ticket?

328
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,780
Hello, you there?

329
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,800
You have a findings on having a chance to be able to watch pro-wrestling, don't you?

330
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,580
Why do you ask me that?

331
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,380
But, you must not watch pro-wrestling.

332
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,860
Why?

333
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,180
if you go and watch it, you will be unhappy.

334
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,780
Understand?

335
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,260
You must not go and watch pro-wrestling on the good stuff.

336
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,740
No, it's not.

337
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,420
Ahahahahah! If you keep it that way, the head of the club won't come to see you.

338
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,180
Ryotsu-san, what are you going to do in the next match?

339
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,520
I've already made a plan. Look at this!

340
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,220
Oh! This is a champion belt!

341
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,080
It's a title match of all the players participating in the Battle Royale format.

342
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,280
The one who remains in the ring until the end is the champion!

343
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,480
It's a size called "Champion"!

344
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,500
That's great! It's the best!

345
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,860
That's right! That's right!

346
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,000
All right! I'll make it fancy next time!

347
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,560
What a thing to do!

348
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,900
It's unfortunate to see a professional wrestler.

349
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,940
Well, I can't get a ticket anyway, so I'll go see it.

350
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,340
Thank you very much.

351
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,480
Here you are.

352
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,200
Oh? This is...

353
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,280
Hey!

354
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,260
This ticket...

355
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,580
What does it mean?

356
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,580
Oh, that's...

357
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,880
Look! Please take a look at that.

358
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:58,420
No, it seems that the venue of the shopping club was pushed together, so I'm giving it to the person who bought it for free.

359
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,800
What?!

360
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,820
Thanks to everyone, the venue is full!

361
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,040
I'm going to be more excited than usual today!

362
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,080
Oh!

363
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,620
And it looks like I'm going to enter the venue and say "Good morning. How are you?"

364
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,640
Come on!

365
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,360
That was great!

366
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,760
Well...

367
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,120
And finally, the dealing of the first dome.

368
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,180
This is the first time ever in recent years.

369
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,860
It's the first time for this match.

370
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,200
How will they enjoy this match?

371
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,820
Welcome to the venue, the poor people!

372
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,260
I didn't expect to get a ticket at such a place.

373
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,040
I'm lucky too.

374
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,580
Tonight, we'll have our first title match.

375
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Who will be the strongest wrestler?

376
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,380
Let's go!

377
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,880
I got the belt!

378
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,540
Move!

379
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,160
You move!

380
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,000
I got the belt!

381
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,500
You coward!

382
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,400
Go!

383
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,420
Come on!

384
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,060
Senpai!

385
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,860
I'm a masked gambler.

386
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,840
Please take a look at the ring side.

387
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,480
Huh?

388
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,040
Hey! Don't take a rest!

389
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,400
Back off!

390
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,180
Why doesn't the manager pay the trains ticket?

391
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,300
What to do?

392
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,960
At least I didn't get Masked.

393
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,300
What should I do Ryo-sama?

394
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,540
When you come to this,

395
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,400
So, we have to make sure that the true identity is not revealed.

396
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,700
Everyone, let's start the infection prevention operation of the chief of Ohara.

397
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:43,680
Wait a minute. I feel like I've seen that wrestler like a bird somewhere.

398
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,000
Please, Sagonji!

399
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,340
What? Damn it! You're not the one who did it!

400
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,160
Hey, hey, hey! Can't you see?

401
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,240
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

402
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,360
I feel like I've seen that wrestler somewhere.

403
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,740
Sir, you are Ohara, aren't you?

404
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
Oh, yes.

405
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,740
We have a visitor who wants to see you, so please come to gate 131.

406
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,540
What?

407
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,840
But...

408
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,340
There's no other way.

409
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,060
All right, it's all good now.

410
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,640
It's finally 72.

411
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,800
If we don't hurry, the match will be over.

412
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,240
It's finally time to settle the score.

413
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,920
I won't lose! The belt belongs to me!

414
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,260
I won't lose! The belt belongs to me!

415
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,320
It's a dead-end. There's no gate 131.

416
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,740
Come to think of it, why did he know my name?

417
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,500
Oh, dear!

418
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,540
I didn't expect Chief Ohara to come.

419
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,460
Really? Really?

420
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,280
We're just doing wrestling. It's not fair to us!

421
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,700
You!

422
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:22,760
Hey!

423
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,600
Chief!

424
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,280
I showed you everything!

425
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,380
Now, I'll explain everything!

426
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,180
1, 2, 3!

427
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,760
We did it! I'm a champion!

428
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,760
"It's the champion!"

429
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,200
"He did it!"

430
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,260
"The Masked Gambler has finally become the first champion of the Shinkatsushika Pro-Wrestling!"

431
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,680
"Now, the champion belt is about to be wrapped around the back of the Masked Gambler!"

432
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,620
"Wait a minute!"

433
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,000
"Huh? Who's that?"

434
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,300
"I don't remember writing such a scenario!"

435
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,500
"What are you doing?"

436
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,260
"Wow!"

437
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,880
"I was hearing you from the first thing in the morning!"

438
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,600
"You're getting everybody involved in the pro-wrestling industry?"

439
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,680
"That's your own business..."

440
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,840
"You're getting agreements that you'll get half of the profits!"

441
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,580
"Look who's talking!"

442
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,220
"I've got to rescue some people!"

443
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,080
"You can't make a profit off of your friends!"

444
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,780
I will never forgive you! I will beat you up again!

445
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

446
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,860
Give up, give up, give up!

447
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,020
Wh- what the...

448
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,860
W- what the!

449
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,880
The man who entered the audience took the tap out from the champion!

450
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,720
The second champion is a mysterious male guest!

451
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,460
That's impossible!

452
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
The man who entered the audience or...

453
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,440
...he's a monster...

454
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

455
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,060
...that's impossible!

456
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,820
The man who entered the audience is a mysterious male guest!

457
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,020
Give up, give up!

458
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,900
The four of us, and the champion entered the audience and...

459
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,280
...the champion entered the audience too!

460
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,760
I'm not interested in it

461
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,420
I'm not interested in it

462
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,660
I'm not interested in it

463
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,700
Even if I lie and cheat a little

464
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,940
I'm helping someone

465
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,480
I'm helping someone

466
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,520
Baby do you know me?

467
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm headed for tomorrow

468
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,180
I'm in a nice breath

469
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,540
I'm in a nice breath

470
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,600
Don't be sick

471
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,760
I'll do what I have to do

472
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,540
I'm in a cute breath

473
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:10,660
That's right I don't want to show you

474
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,880
That's right I don't want to show you

475
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,700
Isn't it better than looking down

476
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Isn't it better than looking down

477
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,620
Isn't it better than looking down

478
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:32,000
Living the dream of the future in a hard way

479
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,520
That would be in the end

480
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,220
It can't be helped because he's the son of a monk

481
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,000
The name of a monk's son is "Goribanto of Life"

482
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,460
By the way, what's the relationship between that and stamp rally?

483
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,020
Next time "Stamp Rally for Dad Who Can't Run"

484
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,600
See you!

485
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,800
There is a turtle over there

486
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,600
There must be a turtle

487
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,760
Everyone come to our town

488
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,800
Thank you!

489
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,000
Thank you for watching!
