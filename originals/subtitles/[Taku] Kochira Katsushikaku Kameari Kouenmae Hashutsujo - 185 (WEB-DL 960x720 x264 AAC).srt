5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,060
I walked while looking back at the rainy afternoon

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,000
I was drawn to the gacha

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,340
I felt a strange feeling at that time

8
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:48,700
So I walked the Akegogai tile only in black

9
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,840
Everyone was a child once, but they all forget

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,780
The politician with a great face and the blue aunt above his eyes

11
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,140
Look around that corner

12
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,480
You can meet everyone

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,400
There is a wall there

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,500
There is a wall there

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,580
There is a wall there

16
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,540
Everyone come to our town

17
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,680
Thank you

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,780
This is a story of an autumn when my senior saw heaven and hell

19
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,140
The story began from the autumn art exhibition hosted by the Katsushika Book

20
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:52,600
It's pretty good

21
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,920
Ohara

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,760
The art exhibition we started to interact with the locals has finally been recognized.

23
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,980
It's really a wonderful work.

24
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,040
It's like a professional work.

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,360
We are honored to be called by the president who is deep in art.

26
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,840
Right, Ohara?

27
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,720
Yes.

28
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,800
This is a work of Jun Nakagawa, the director of our publishing house.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,420
He has been learning painting since he was a child.

30
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,560
I see.

31
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,360
This is a work of my agent, Reiko Akimoto.

32
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,400
This is a wonderful water painting.

33
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,960
It's a real-life work.

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,300
This is a work of my agent, Terai.

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,920
Ohara, are you going to introduce all the works in the book?

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,340
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,380
Everyone worked hard during their work, so it's hot.

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,480
No, no. I'm satisfied.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,400
Is this a work of your agent, too?

40
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,140
This is a water painting.

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,860
Ohara, he must have been very happy with it.

42
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,780
Yes, he should have.

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,380
What did he do?

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,380
He must have put this in the wrong place.

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,280
Ohara.

46
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,600
I'll clean it up right away.

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,860
Get out of my way.

48
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,000
What?

49
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,400
No, it's not that like in my old world.

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,020
OK, this is it.

51
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,140
Good.

52
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,120
Hey, Ryotsu.

53
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,960
What are you doing here?

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,900
You're mean, director.

55
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,680
I will help you.

56
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,000
That is because...

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Where do you want this, kun?

58
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,300
OK.

59
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,120
This.

60
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,900
Yes.

61
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,760
What are you doing?

62
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,180
I'm going to exhibit my works.

63
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,300
My works this time are amazing.

64
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,580
First, paintings, then sculptures, a number of crafts.

65
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,860
And the ship made by Matchbow, the eye of the year.

66
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,300
From now on, please call me Davinci of Katsushika.

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,260
Oh, this is...

68
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,020
Don't touch my art so easily, old man.

69
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,860
Old man?

70
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,420
Excuse me, I need some tea.

71
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,020
Please come here.

72
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,260
Ohara, do something.

73
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,340
Wait, wait!

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,180
Ryotsu, please don't disturb me today.

75
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,480
What do you mean?

76
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,700
I'm just cooperating with the art store.

77
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,780
Listen, calm down and look around.

78
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,000
I know you're in the hall.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,120
Your works are floating around, but you're destroying the harmony of the space.

80
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,640
That's art, boss.

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,140
Art always destroys the atmosphere of the space and destroys the values of the spirit.

82
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,820
But your works...

83
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,440
Last year, you made a figure of a blonde woman on a plastic model tank.

84
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,200
Last year, you made a cosplay of a special hero.

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,280
And this year, you made a battleship Yamato made by Matchbow.

86
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,720
This is art.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
It's not related to the story, is it?

88
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,140
No, it's not.

89
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,540
This is Musashi, not Yamato.

90
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,440
They're almost the same size, but the number of three-layer guns is different.

91
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,540
Is he that detailed?

92
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,400
What do you mean, "detailed"?

93
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,360
I warned you because I said something wrong.

94
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,660
People like you say that a battle machine is a zero-sense gun.

95
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,720
But the five-style guns and Hayate are similar, but they're different.

96
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,780
Stop using too many 'about' words.

97
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,960
Since I'm a police officer, please use correct Japanese.

98
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,500
This is so cool!

99
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,160
Really cool!

100
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,660
I want one!

101
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,960
Look, boss.

102
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,040
Don't you see the heart of my work?

103
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,420
I think those works are real art.

104
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,540
Ryo-tsu, stop.

105
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,160
Art is what Nakagawa-kun and Reiko-kun draw.

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,620
Compared to this, your drawings are just a piece of drawing.

107
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,920
A piece of drawing?

108
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,760
Then I'll ask you, director.

109
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,400
What kind of art is the one that Nakagawa and Reiko draw?

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,520
But, both Nakagawa-kun and Reiko-kun have been studying painting since they were kids.

111
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,240
They have been to many art museums around the world and have been taught.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,200
Your drawing is different than yours!

113
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,860
Is it art if you have been taught to draw by money?

114
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,760
Do you say that there are no artists in poor houses?

115
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,740
I didn't mean that.

116
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,920
Then what do you mean?

117
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,800
Where is the basis that Nakagawa and Reiko's drawings are art and mine are drawing?

118
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,780
That is...

119
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,280
You two have been in the art world for a long time.

120
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,000
That's right.

121
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,180
That's right.

122
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,320
That's right.

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,600
It seems that Nakagawa-kun and Reiko-kun's drawings are recognized as art by the world.

124
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,760
That's the basis.

125
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,760
You are more interested in entertainment than art.

126
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,600
What happened to Ms. Debbie?

127
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,560
What happened to the Kano sisters?

128
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,080
Don't underestimate entertainment.

129
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,860
Can you do a bad job in art?

130
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,880
Will art have a jigsaw battle?

131
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,860
What?

132
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,860
You...

133
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,480
What?

134
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,600
What?

135
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,040
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,300
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,940
Can you do a bad job in entertainment?

138
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,200
You...

139
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,220
Let go.

140
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,800
You're a bastard.

141
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,760
Boss!

142
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,320
I can't stand it anymore!

143
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,600
You're so boring!

144
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,480
You two have a corner to support.

145
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,200
Let go of me!

146
00:07:59,560 --> 00:07:59,740
What?

147
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,220
What?

148
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,740
What?

149
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,640
What?

150
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,240
What?

151
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,780
What?

152
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,460
What?

153
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,700
What?

154
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,120
What?

155
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,800
Oh...

156
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,440
Uwaaaahhh... It feels like a classic.

157
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,780
Your work has a strong personality, so it would be better if this was the one.

158
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,900
Perhaps others would pity it if you only treated it specially...

159
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,340
That's good, Senpai.

160
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,140
I'm sorry, President.

161
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,100
Unlike someone else, you're a key to our conversation...

162
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,420
What's with that mean tone?

163
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,660
Ohara! Cut it out!

164
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,640
Ah... I'm sorry.

165
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,900
Hehehehe

166
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm so sleepy because I finished it in the middle of the night.

167
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,960
Hehehehe

168
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,120
Ohara-kun

169
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:51,280
Bangkok is not a surprise, so there is no battle ship for the city.

170
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,260
As expected of the chief, a wonderful strategy to defeat the enemy.

171
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
You can't do it properly with that guy.

172
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,920
Ohara-kun

173
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,540
I was surprised.

174
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,060
Eeeeee

175
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,120
Nyaaro

176
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
Senpai, what should I do?

177
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,520
Do you know, Naman?

178
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,160
Even if you tell me that ...

179
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,080
What did Ryo-chan do in the middle of the night?

180
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,160
It seems that Senpai's works were put in a cage so that no one could see them.

181
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,060
Finally, this year the chief gave a speech.

182
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,280
What is that?

183
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,420
I did it myself.

184
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,260
Actually, Ryo-san's work is a little ...

185
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,420
It's a work to be exhibited at an art exhibition.

186
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,280
I think it's okay if you enjoy it as a personal hobby.

187
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,620
Eeeeee

188
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:39,700
Eeeeee

189
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,520
Even you guys are all insulting me.

190
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,420
I'll tell you, Ryo-chan.

191
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,820
Art is not such a sweet thing.

192
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:49,820
No way.

193
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,300
Among the artists who are said to be great masters, some people have not been recognized at all.

194
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,800
Eeeeee

195
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,860
So I'm the same.

196
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,540
If no one tries to recognize me, and if I bury my talent, I will be a great loss to the Japanese art world.

197
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,960
It's too much.

198
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,560
Then, why don't you go to an art exhibition?

199
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,580
That's right.

200
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,120
Then everyone will recognize your talent, right?

201
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,680
Yes.

202
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,160
I see.

203
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,180
Then, I will enter a famous art exhibition.

204
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,580
Wait, chief.

205
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,180
I will definitely show you guys a flower.

206
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,240
My painting will definitely be selected.

207
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,520
I'm very confident.

208
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,140
I wonder if it was bad to make him feel that way.

209
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,680
No matter how you think about it, that painting will not be selected.

210
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,520
Considering that it was a easy choice.

211
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,060
Eeeeee

212
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,160
Eeeeee

213
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,620
Eeeeee

214
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,100
Eeeeee

215
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,700
Eeeeee

216
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,240
Eeeeee

217
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,500
Eeeeee

218
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,460
Eeeeee

219
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,480
This year, there are so many works to apply.

220
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,280
That's true.

221
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,120
This is the painting of Akatsuka Gahaku's grandson?

222
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,500
Yes.

223
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,040
100% entry rate.

224
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
It is the highlight of this exhibition.

225
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,800
The exhibition will start soon.

226
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,120
Ah, yes.

227
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,880
Then, please take the works from the entrance to the venue in order.

228
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,680
I understand.

229
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,180
I have to make a mistake, so I will transfer the works of Rakusen to another room.

230
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,640
That's right.

231
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,100
Tsu, Tsu, Tsu.

232
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,800
O-Oh no, I'm in danger.

233
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,280
My feet are dangerous.

234
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,180
Ah!

235
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,360
This is the work of Akatsuka Gahaku's grandson!

236
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,820
That's Rakusen's place, isn't it?

237
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,640
It was a dangerous place to put Rakusen.

238
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,120
Oh my.

239
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,740
Huh?

240
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,140
There are seven paintings in the new signature work.

241
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,580
It's a bad painting.

242
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,300
What is that?

243
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,440
Forget such things.

244
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,080
Really?

245
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,280
No. 52.

246
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,260
A work by Yoshihiro Miyagawa in Shibuya.

247
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,280
It's a masterpiece this year.

248
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,100
It's really terrible.

249
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,360
I heard that this year there will be a painting of Akatsuka Gahaku's grandchild.

250
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,240
Is that so?

251
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,980
I haven't got a gold medal in a few years.

252
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,120
I'm afraid I won't get it.

253
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,420
This is not good.

254
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,580
I'll have some water. I'll drink some medicine.

255
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,640
No. 53.

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,160
This is a masterpiece of Akatsuka Gahaku's grandchild.

257
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,760
What?

258
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,920
It's truly a great talent, Sarah Brett.

259
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,800
How do you like it, everyone?

260
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,000
Yes.

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,800
Certainly.

262
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,360
I feel the unique character in this work.

263
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,260
I feel a strong touch and a strong structure.

264
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,360
Is it okay to say that everyone is the same?

265
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,540
Hey.

266
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,360
It's a gold medal.

267
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,980
Excuse me.

268
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,440
I heard that you got a gold medal for the first time in five years.

269
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,520
Is that so?

270
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,680
That's right.

271
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,060
A wonderful work was born.

272
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,460
Excuse me.

273
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,280
Would you like to have a piece of the work?

274
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,060
Yes.

275
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,360
This is the gold medal.

276
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,180
What?

277
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,560
That painting is different.

278
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,780
Yes.

279
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,560
It seems that the name plate has been replaced.

280
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,260
What about the real one?

281
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:42,340
The one you were talking about?

282
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,000
What's wrong with this one?

283
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
What about the painting of your great-grandson?

284
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,360
It seems that the painting is thought to be an abduction.

285
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,160
It seems that it has been thrown away.

286
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,180
What do you mean?

287
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,480
It seems that it was not painted as a 'picture of the audience'.

288
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,140
Please draw here, too.

289
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,100
Please draw here, too.

290
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:55,960
Please draw here, too.

291
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,560
If this happens, I have no choice but to push the painting through.

292
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,600
Gahaku's painting does not reach the audience.

293
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,300
Oh, no.

294
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,240
So, who is the illustrator of that painting?

295
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,460
It's Mr. Ryozo Kankichi, the director of the Gahaku.

296
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,800
The first entry for the first time.

297
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,980
He's a new police officer,

298
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,860
so he's been picked up by mass media.

299
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,540
It's been a hot topic that a new painter is coming out.

300
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,680
He really is a man of the times.

301
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,460
Tonight, we have a super hot topic.

302
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,400
Mr. Ryozu Kankichi will be on the show.

303
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,480
Good evening, everyone.

304
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,240
I'm Ryozu Kankichi, the hot topic right now.

305
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,020
Why?

306
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,520
Why is this painting so popular?

307
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,760
When I think about it, it looks like a strong line of personality.

308
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,160
Yeah.

309
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,040
When I think about it, there are many artists who are like Ryo.

310
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,900
Hello, everyone.

311
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,100
Ryozu!

312
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,280
What's that costume?

313
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,020
Is it a uniform?

314
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,940
What's that uniform?

315
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,500
Oh, there's a very good art store there.

316
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,320
It's my work, which is recognized for its artistic quality.

317
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,500
Isn't it Mr. Ohara, the director who said that it was a graffiti?

318
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,920
What do you think of that theory?

319
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,180
Thanks to that, the graffiti has a value of 5 million yen.

320
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,100
5 million yen?

321
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,160
No matter what, the world has recognized that I'm a genius.

322
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,540
Because there are such achievements.

323
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,740
I'm a treasure of the art world now.

324
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,760
I'm a treasure of the art world now.

325
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:41,880
You're being hurt.

326
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,640
Because you're wearing a bag.

327
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,640
Because you're wearing a bag.

328
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,060
I don't want to turn it around.

329
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,160
You're more suited to the art world.

330
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,680
You're more suited to the art world.

331
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,200
The director is calling.

332
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,780
Oh, Ryozu!

333
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,480
Congratulations!

334
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,620
You are the pride of my Katoshika-shu.

335
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,300
Actually, I saw your work at the Katoshika-shu art store.

336
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,260
I thought, "What if this is it?"

337
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,260
Why did you surround my work so that no one would see it?

338
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,020
I don't care if the person who won the gold medal is small.

339
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,240
Director!

340
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,680
By the way, Ryozu.

341
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,600
I have a consultation with you.

342
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,400
Consultation?

343
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,660
Actually, the director of the department says he wants to buy the first work of your gold medal entry.

344
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,660
What's the matter?

345
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,140
The director of the department?

346
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,600
I understand.

347
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,560
I'll accept it.

348
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,940
Really?

349
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,260
Oh, good.

350
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,940
Now my face stands out.

351
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,900
That's good.

352
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,760
But there is one condition.

353
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,360
No, no.

354
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,340
How many times do I have to tell you?

355
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,200
You have to stick your cheeks closer.

356
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,340
Like this?

357
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,680
Ryozu.

358
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,040
Are you really going to hide our appearance?

359
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,040
No, I'm not.

360
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,500
I'm not.

361
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,600
He's an artist of the gold medal.

362
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,280
We, the ordinary people, have no choice but to follow the truth.

363
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,260
But...

364
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,360
I understand.

365
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,460
This is in the way.

366
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,520
I don't like it.

367
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:19,980
Ryozu.

368
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,320
You don't like it?

369
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,160
Then I'll stop drawing.

370
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,340
Ohara, you have to be patient.

371
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,140
Be patient.

372
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,020
I don't like it.

373
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,940
I'll do as you wish.

374
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,940
I see.

375
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:36,960
Then,

376
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,200
I'll pose like this.

377
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,000
What?

378
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,400
Ryozu.

379
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,520
Ohara.

380
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,340
Yes.

381
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,460
Is this okay?

382
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,300
Ryozu.

383
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,940
You two are getting better.

384
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,420
Next is...

385
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,300
Ryozu.

386
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,320
Don't move like that.

387
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,700
Then,

388
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,320
it would have been better not to be a model.

389
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,940
That's what art is.

390
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,880
Ohara.

391
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,540
Anyway,

392
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,700
let's forget about him soon.

393
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,620
You're right.

394
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,940
Yes.

395
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,060
Yes, this is Ryotsu, the prize winner of the gold medal at the art exhibition.

396
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,780
Yes, I'd like you to draw a picture for me.

397
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,740
And the budget is...

398
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,440
Wait a minute.

399
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,280
Yes, this is Ryotsu, the prize winner of the gold medal.

400
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,340
Since the park, the price is...

401
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,240
The power of the gold medal is amazing.

402
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,660
You're a good at ordering, aren't you?

403
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,840
I'm sorry.

404
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,380
Is Mr. Ryotsu here?

405
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,820
That's right.

406
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,560
I'm sorry.

407
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,840
I'm sorry.

408
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,680
Congratulations on the gold medal at the art exhibition.

409
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,880
I'm a painter.

410
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,380
My name is Rodoriges Ito.

411
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,580
Nice to meet you.

412
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,320
So what do you want from me?

413
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,840
Actually, I'd like you to help me.

414
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,800
I'm in time.

415
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,920
Don't say such a thing.

416
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,480
Please help me.

417
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:26,920
Let me go.

418
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,620
I'm saying no.

419
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,640
If you weren't here, you could have made a million with the prize draw last time.

420
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,280
What?

421
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,980
Did you sell it?

422
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,880
No, not yet.

423
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,880
That's good.

424
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,660
It's a problem for amateurs.

425
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,100
In that case, first make a lithograph based on the picture.

426
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,340
Lithograph?

427
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,920
It's a stone print.

428
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,920
If you use this, you can copy and paste many pictures.

429
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,460
If you use this, you can copy and paste many pictures.

430
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,460
You can buy it for 10000yen per piece.

431
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,020
It's limited to 500 pieces.

432
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,120
If you sell 500 pieces, you can get 500,000 yen in no time.

433
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,880
You can also get the original.

434
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,280
It's limited to 500 pieces.

435
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,420
Even if you sell 50,000 pieces, you can't get it.

436
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,660
What do you think?

437
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,700
Do you want to work with me?

438
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,260
I think I can work with you.

439
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,160
You finally understand.

440
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,240
You can open a store.

441
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,160
You can work more than two times.

442
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,080
It's like calling your friend.

443
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,060
He's getting popular.

444
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,260
If he opens a store, it will be a big success.

445
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,280
Related products sold very well.

446
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,560
He also developed new games.

447
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,200
He drew 500 meters in the Expo.

448
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,140
He is very popular.

449
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,060
He is a charismatic artist.

450
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,420
He is good at drawing.

451
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,720
He is a role model for many media.

452
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,460
The guest commentator today is Mr.Ryotsu Kankichi.

453
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,620
Hello.

454
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,840
There's another senior commentator.

455
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,880
He is a member of Bunkajin.

456
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,060
He is a member of Bunkajin.

457
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,180
He is a member of Bunkajin.

458
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,780
He is a member of Bunkajin.

459
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
And..

460
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,360
He is a member of Bunkajin.

461
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,220
He is a member of Bunkajin.

462
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,880
He is a member of Bunkajin.

463
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,480
Well, don't worry.

464
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,280
At the same time,

465
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,720
the public and the media are also side of her.

466
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,700
Even though now,

467
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,740
you don't know when

468
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,120
you'll hit her

469
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,700
with your palm.

470
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,180
From now on,

471
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,160
try drawing for her.

472
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,340
And,

473
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,960
now I wanna test your art in the overseas.

474
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,540
I want to try it.

475
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,580
Overseas?

476
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,900
We will have exhibitions all over the world and return as the world's artists and artists.

477
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,580
So please look forward to it.

478
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,380
Sensei, please think about it.

479
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,300
Your work is a domestic work, so it's very difficult to go overseas.

480
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,960
Sensei.

481
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,380
Let go.

482
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,480
Let go.

483
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,680
I don't want to.

484
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,360
Please think about it.

485
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,460
Shut up.

486
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:08,560
I don't want to.

487
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,780
Sensei.

488
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,260
If I have the ability, I will definitely apply overseas.

489
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,400
I don't want to.

490
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,300
No.

491
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,980
Let's look for the next newcomer.

492
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,900
Yes, it's me, Ito.

493
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,340
What?

494
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,940
The elementary school student has entered the department store?

495
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,280
That's amazing.

496
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,280
And his senior opened a private store in New York, Paris, and so on.

497
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,540
However, this became a lifesaver.

498
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,940
This marketingavas aeres for overseasvl.

499
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:40,980
Everyone has been

500
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,880
attacked and run over by the mass media.

501
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,480
Ryo Kankichi's painting is easy to draw or not.

502
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,920
He made news to the news in Japan.

503
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,260
And all the Japanese world came to see him.

504
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:54,960
That's why it became not that great.

505
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,360
That de facto position as a painter has collapsed.

506
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,240
Sensei was hit hard.

507
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,980
Since failing to open a private store overseas, his reputation is falling.

508
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,220
It's terrible.

509
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,380
This is terrible. It's like a one-shot match.

510
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,820
Well, I expected it.

511
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
I was doing it in the morning news.

512
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,800
The people who bought Ryo's painting

513
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,960
They said they pushed the department store and Garou to complain.

514
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,480
I was praised a little, and I was a tengu, so I was punished.

515
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,980
But I feel a little poor.

516
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,400
Where are you now?

517
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,800
Come on, come on, come on.

518
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,280
This is a work of Ryo Tsugahaku, who won the gold medal at the art store.

519
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,560
This is a department store on the corner.

520
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,000
A sister who got white clothes and black clothes and red clothes.

521
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,280
Please give it to me.

522
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,100
50,000 or 100,000 is a waste.

523
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,660
Don't clap when you're in the party.

524
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,200
Wake up, watch your watch, get off, go to the store.

525
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,540
When the door opens, open your fingers.

526
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
First of all, if you draw your eyebrows,

527
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,220
To the station, DASH DASH DASH

528
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,300
My train, my father's back,

529
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,840
One sleep

530
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320
This week as well,

531
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,340
Go-Kuro, Go-muri, Go-mo-to

532
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,040
I'm making a racket with one hand,

533
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,340
But Kyudon, Takumori, Tsuyu, Dakute

534
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,200
As well as the remaining

535
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,320
It's annoying, annoying, and refreshing to solve.

536
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,140
Every day is no problem

537
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,900
If the hot shower goes through

538
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,720
Every day is no problem

539
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,800
A peaceful pillow to recover your energy.

540
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,460
Every day is no problem

541
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,320
Every day is no problem

542
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,060
I love myself like this

543
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,840
Every day is a No problem

544
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,700
My heart is beating

545
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,260
On Monday

546
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,000
Monday Monday Go Go World

547
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,300
Senpai, this is bad!

548
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,440
My sister Eve is having a fever and she fell down!
