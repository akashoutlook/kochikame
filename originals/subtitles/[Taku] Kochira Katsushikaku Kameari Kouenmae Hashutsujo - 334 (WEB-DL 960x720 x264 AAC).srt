Check it out.

00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,560
Delegation Ohtari!

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,120
It's the photo of her grand-tudor's kid!

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,300
It's Rei's...

21
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,300
Daishkey and Sakura!

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,300
They are so cute!

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,600
You guys are like angels.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,480
Oh my, I had only the sweetest time to find one.

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,140
Give me one back.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,080
That's so cute.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,980
You two should be together every day, right?

28
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,220
I think I'm going to get a heart attack.

29
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,020
Well, that's true.

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,400
Is there something good going on today?

31
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,140
No, nothing.

32
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,680
I think the chief is happy today.

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,780
I wonder.

34
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,520
It's because of Reiko-kun's feeling.

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:04,920
Help making noodles?

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,880
You who are thinking of repairing a fake house,

37
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,480
free of charge.

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,140
Give it back.

39
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,700
Are you going to make it a fake house?

40
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,620
Ah, shut up.

41
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,800
If I talk to you, I'm going to be in a bad mood.

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
Let's work hard today.

43
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,140
Okay?

44
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm counting on you.

45
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,560
Yes.

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,100
The chief is weird.

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,380
Really?

48
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,600
The chief made it a fake house and went with his granddaughter.

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,940
I see.

50
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,520
That's why he seemed so happy.

51
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,480
That's what it was.

52
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,140
What? What do you mean?

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,640
Ryo-san.

54
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,560
Ryo-san, help me.

55
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,600
What's wrong, Kiyama's father?

56
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,780
I have no work.

57
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,820
I'm going to be destroyed this time.

58
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,880
The job of a carpenter is to build a house, right?

59
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,880
What's the point of destroying it?

60
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,340
That's why I said I don't have any orders even if I want to build one.

61
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,660
Then, it can't be helped even if you're destroyed.

62
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,060
No way.

63
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,160
Ryo-chan,

64
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,860
you don't have that attitude, do you?

65
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,200
Here you are.

66
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,600
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,920
Because there are no good shops in the shopping street.

68
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,800
Look at the street.

69
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,820
There's no good shop.

70
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,280
If you're destroyed, it's not scary.

71
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:15,960
Stop it.

72
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,880
Ryo-chan.

73
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,440
It's a joke.

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh my.

75
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,660
Ryo-san has had many businesses so far.

76
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,100
How can you get back?

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,660
Tell me.

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,140
Please.

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,540
Stop it.

80
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,720
I understand.

81
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,780
I'll do something.

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,660
Ryo-san.

83
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,320
First of all, I'll reform this store.

84
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,660
Reform?

85
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,800
It's an unprecedented reform boom.

86
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,360
Yes.

87
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,100
I'll make it a fancy design office.

88
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,260
I'll feed new customers who are easy to eat.

89
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,000
And,

90
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,920
you'll reform yourself from a craftsman to a creator.

91
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,720
Reform?

92
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,520
You look a little uncomfortable.

93
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,840
With this outfit.

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
Ryo-san, I want to laugh at you.

95
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,740
That was a polite laugh.

96
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,360
It's okay.

97
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,800
You're pretty cool.

98
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,160
Really?

99
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,600
Listen closely.

100
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,780
Even in Fukuoka,

101
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,400
designer's houses and fancy houses

102
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,940
are sold well.

103
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,920
Even the people in the forefront of business are good.

104
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,020
So, this outfit?

105
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,920
Considering the balance as a duo,

106
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,120
I'll go with a good business style.

107
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,640
I understand.

108
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,640
Yes.

109
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,720
Then, come closer.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,340
Here. Here. Here.

111
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,500
I'm coming.

112
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,220
Yes, I'm waiting.

113
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,560
What?

114
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,200
I'll rely on your style

115
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,480
and get my wife to take over the TV.

116
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,020
Even if you're good at it

117
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,060
and you look good,

118
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,260
you'll get no customers.

119
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,200
It's my first time on TV.

120
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't worry.

121
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,420
Leave it to me.

122
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,880
You're pushing your mother's opposition

123
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,860
and trying to make a living.

124
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,060
I'll do my best.

125
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,620
I'll rely on you, Ryo-san.

126
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,900
But, I'm not good at it.

127
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,800
Hello.

128
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,520
Hello. I'm Ryo-tsu,

129
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,720
the sales and marketing director of Reform Kiyama.

130
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm Ryo-tsu, the sales and marketing director of Reform Kiyama.

131
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,700
I've seen the ribbon many times

132
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,680
with Sanji's wife's reform.

133
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,820
I'm looking forward to something interesting.

134
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,720
Are you the president?

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,520
Yes, I'm the owner and designer.

136
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,100
I'm Kiyama Mokuzo.

137
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,700
The customers are already standing

138
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,300
at the site, so let's go.

139
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,720
Let's go.

140
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,140
Hello. I'm Yamanaka.

141
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,040
Mr. Yamanaka.

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,580
You've been homeless and

143
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,660
blackmailed for 30 years

144
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,680
and you have no money to despise.

145
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,180
How would this help?

146
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,540
If there's no situation

147
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,340
or recognition,

148
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,460
it won't be easy.

149
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,920
Ryo-san, what are you gonna do?

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,420
Don't worry.

151
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,120
I have some solution.

152
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,220
Do you know

153
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,360
I was in deep trouble there.

154
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,420
Thank you for applying for the renewal campaign of the reform Kiyama.

155
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:15,900
Thank you.

156
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,640
Lord Yamanaka is the number one customer to commemorate.

157
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,180
We will accept your request for a special reform.

158
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,300
Like?

159
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,540
Like!

160
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,920
I can't believe you can reform with this like.

161
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,980
It would be great if you could raise it to about 100,000 yen.

162
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
Wait a minute.

163
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,060
I've never heard of a whole apartment being reformed to 100,000 yen.

164
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,340
Please wait a minute.

165
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,300
Yes.

166
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,120
Wait a minute.

167
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,500
So do it.

168
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,480
I told you to do your best.

169
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,160
This is advertising.

170
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,820
Show your motivation in front of the camera.

171
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,020
Now, 30 people who arrived first are receiving the reform with a like.

172
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,320
What?

173
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,620
No way.

174
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,120
I want my own room soon.

175
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,060
Make it a really cool room, Ryo.

176
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,360
Yes, sir.

177
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,220
Junpei, Cappei, Bo-chan.

178
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,680
Two rooms for 6 people.

179
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,620
And what about the budget?

180
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:15,940
Brother.

181
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,760
Yes.

182
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,660
Yes.

183
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,740
Please.

184
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,300
Here it is.

185
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,600
500 yen.

186
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,340
I lost it.

187
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,020
I can't afford a 500-yen reform.

188
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,460
If you think about the advertising effect, I want to make it a success.

189
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,840
Let's go.

190
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,680
But 500 yen is not a cheap work.

191
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,520
I see.

192
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,440
Let's take a big service of the amount of blood.

193
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,360
Really?

194
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,760
President, that's great.

195
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,800
Yes.

196
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,780
I did it.

197
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,020
Ryo.

198
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,740
Yes?

199
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,760
I want to ask for a house in Gonta.

200
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,040
Gonta?

201
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,200
This.

202
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,400
The reform of the doghouse?

203
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,860
I'll do my best to get rid of it.

204
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,520
I understand.

205
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,260
I'll do it.

206
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,920
I understand.

207
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:24,040
I'm really looking forward to it.

208
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm looking forward to it, llamond.

209
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,320
Yes, Ganya...

210
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,860
Wow, who's the owner of Ganya…

211
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,020
It's Mr. Takfromatsu.

212
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,720
I'm really glad to hear that.

213
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,200
So I do the same thing.

214
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,880
Let's go, I'm coming.

215
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,840
After the reform, we'll meet with the Yamanaka-Sou!

216
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,520
T-this is...

217
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,080
From today, the Yamanaka-Sou will be renewed!

218
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,760
Method Versailles Urban Yamanaka!

219
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,540
So, Silbpre?

220
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,240
Versailles!

221
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,960
It's been changed so much with only 100,000 yen!

222
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,120
That's the miracle technique of the reform Kiyama!

223
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,060
It's got a purse!

224
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,800
Ouch, it looks real!

225
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,240
Because of the budget, we've asked the students to help with the construction.

226
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
There's a parking lot behind it.

227
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,060
It's here.

228
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,400
Amazing! It's so luxurious!

229
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,560
I thought so, but it's all gone.

230
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
Well, it's enough to fulfill the role of a luxury car.

231
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,500
Amazing!

232
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,340
We've eliminated all the poverty of the Yasu Apartment!

233
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,140
This is the door to the room.

234
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,780
This is the Yasu Apartment!

235
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,580
This is the entrance.

236
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,200
It's a public place.

237
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,100
There are also various rooms for each theme.

238
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,160
For example, the theme of this room is "Narikin".

239
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,820
I can't tell what's real from the sound of it!

240
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,080
For those who are lonely, this room...

241
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,820
It's a great crowd!

242
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,020
We've incorporated the shoddy city of Shinjuku into the interior.

243
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,920
This room is already being watched by someone.

244
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,920
I think I'll be attracted to the car.

245
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,040
I think so.

246
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,540
It takes some time until you get used to it.

247
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,280
Wow! Amazing!

248
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,800
Wow! It's so fun!

249
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,240
It's made of cardboard!

250
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,560
This might be a hot topic.

251
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,740
It's a Ryo-chan-like idea, isn't it?

252
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,120
That's just the beginning!

253
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,180
Ryo-chan!

254
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,480
Huh? I just saw it on TV.

255
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,840
It's obviously for recording.

256
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,720
Yes, this is Reform Kiyama.

257
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,140
Oh, the owner of Versailles.

258
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,500
What?

259
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:22,640
What?

260
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,100
The whole apartment has a tenant!

261
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,660
But the company of the important Kiyama-san is...

262
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,640
That's the problem.

263
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,540
Thanks for the nice dog house!

264
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,680
As soon as the Reform Kiyama campaign ended,

265
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,200
the customers were full.

266
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,200
This is not only profitable,

267
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,200
but also a good way to return the money that was inflated in the campaign.

268
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,820
And the best thing is the basics of business.

269
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,180
The name of Reform Kiyama has been known around the world.

270
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,380
The game starts now.

271
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,960
Ryo-san, you can trust me, can't you?

272
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:52,920
Hello.

273
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,240
Welcome.

274
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,260
What? The campaign is over?

275
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,760
Unfortunately.

276
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,820
Too bad.

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,940
Then let's go home.

278
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,380
Please wait.

279
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,940
Oh, I saw it on TV.

280
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,880
Consultation is free.

281
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,540
By the way, what kind of reforms do you think?

282
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
The room is small, so even a little...

283
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,860
I want to make it bigger.

284
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,340
Yes.

285
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,460
Let's make it bigger.

286
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,980
Ryo-san!

287
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,460
Huh? Will it be bigger?

288
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,740
Of course.

289
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,940
Ryo-san.

290
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,260
Hey, excuse me.

291
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,120
Hey, hey, hey.

292
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,640
Oh.

293
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,120
Ryo-san.

294
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,360
Ryo-san.

295
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:26,960
It starts with a thief.

296
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,000
If you know that I deceived a customer and did business,

297
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,260
this time you'll be rewarded by mom.

298
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,180
I'm not telling you to deceive customers.

299
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,660
I'm telling you to show me your wisdom.

300
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,380
My art skills.

301
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,660
I can't.

302
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,180
How can you make a small room bigger.

303
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,940
If it's impossible, the reason will be drawn in.

304
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,600
I'll do it.

305
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,400
I don't want to let go of this shop and land anymore.

306
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,300
I can do anything even if I just crush it against the window.

307
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:50,940
What was that?

308
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,080
Demolition?

309
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,220
Why all of a sudden?

310
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,340
Can't you hear it?

311
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,520
The sound of success approaching!

312
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,500
Last time was very popular.

313
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,920
The unique transformation of Reform Kiyama.

314
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,060
Do you remember it?

315
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,900
This time, as the second part,

316
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,940
along with Reform, who surprised us even more,

317
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,080
they have reappeared.

318
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,480
Reform! Reform!

319
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,200
The original Reform!

320
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,780
Please leave it to Reform Kiyama!

321
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,260
Yes!

322
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,240
The client is a couple who just got married this spring,

323
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,180
and they are newly married.

324
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,880
How did it turn out?

325
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,520
I'm really looking forward to it!

326
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,420
Then, let's take a look at the house.

327
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,600
The appearance doesn't show any noticeable changes,

328
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,880
but the interior hasn't changed much.

329
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,200
I see.

330
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,700
This way, please.

331
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,840
What's with this handle?

332
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,520
First, turn the handle at the top.

333
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,760
The top?

334
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,940
What the hell?

335
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,040
What's with this sound?

336
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,200
Nobifu!

337
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,640
I'm surprised!

338
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,800
It's a great idea, President!

339
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,580
It's a Debea that was sent from the window.

340
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,640
Reform Kiyama special guest is coming out!

341
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:17,900
Thank you!

342
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,140
And if you turn this handle...

343
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,940
The ceiling is stretched!

344
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,160
No way!

345
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,080
Reform Kiyama

346
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,200
Here we go!

347
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,120
Reform Kiyama

348
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,480
Here we go!

349
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,920
Reform Kiyama

350
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,620
Here we go!

351
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,220
Another ceiling has been slided from the wall!

352
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:33,940
Reform Kiyama

353
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,940
Here is the floor of the second floor.

354
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,600
Reform Kiyama

355
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,020
Here we go!

356
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,720
Now we have three rooms.

357
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,960
There's another handle.

358
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,320
Reform Kiyama

359
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,620
Reform Kiyama

360
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:49,980
Reform Kiyama

361
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,000
Here we go!

362
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:51,940
Second floor.

363
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,040
If you pull this handle,

364
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,920
there is no gap between the neighbors,

365
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,760
and if you press this button,

366
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,260
the floor will come out.

367
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,580
So cool.

368
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,560
Right?

369
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,200
Morning, gardening.

370
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,380
Night, in the planetarium,

371
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,980
depending on how you use it.

372
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,160
Well thought out idea!

373
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,800
Is the problem a construction standard?

374
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,700
It'll be all right.

375
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,680
If anything happens,

376
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,600
quickly return to Earth,

377
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,860
is

378
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:22,960
just like this,

379
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,260
amazing

380
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,600
.

381
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,300
There are many problems that should be cleared, but

382
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,100
this may be hit.

383
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,560
This house is a study with a roof.

384
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,260
It seems that they are enjoying a bath on a rooftop with the

385
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,680
Absolute

386
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,260
There is an old car.

387
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,680
"Why?"

388
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,520
Now, the DeBea Mansion, which has already been built into DeBea, is also being built.

389
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,480
"I'm Kiyama, the DeBea's room manager."

390
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,400
"And my subordinates..."

391
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,600
"Thank you for coming."

392
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,400
"Yes, I'm Kiyama, the DeBea's room manager."

393
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,840
"Yes, that's right."

394
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,720
"Wait a minute."

395
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,240
"Please, Ryo-san, please answer the phone."

396
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,660
"I'm a customer of the DeBea Mansion."

397
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,060
"Ryo-san!"

398
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,740
"If you take any more orders, we won't be able to handle it."

399
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,800
"Don't worry. I'll take care of the next one."

400
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,740
"Once you get a job at our house, you'll be sent to a subordination company and then you'll be sent to a subordination company for a low price."

401
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,400
"Even if you don't work, we'll give you a lot of money."

402
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,340
"If you do that..."

403
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,580
"You're not going to be able to keep DeBea's room, are you?"

404
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,440
"No, no!"

405
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,220
"This is why you can't be a coward."

406
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
"Come back to your mother, okay?"

407
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,240
"R-Ryo-san..."

408
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,900
"I'll take all the orders."

409
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:55,880
"Okay."

410
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,860
"Yes, DeBea's Reformed Kiyama."

411
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,220
"If you understand, that's fine."

412
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,040
"Well, I'll be the customer of the store."

413
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,100
"Look at me and tell me if I make a lot of money today."

414
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,640
"Oh, Chief!"

415
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,540
"Oh no, why is the chief..."

416
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,360
"Ryo-tsu!"

417
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,180
"Chief, why are you here?"

418
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,860
"What are you doing here?"

419
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,060
"Well, um..."

420
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,240
"I don't even have time to ask you. I can see that you're doing what you're supposed to do."

421
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,520
"You're trying to do something that I don't understand, and you're bothering people again."

422
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,200
"I'm sorry. I was just helping people while patrolling."

423
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,080
"Oh, you're not a detective, but you're patrolling in your underwear?"

424
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,060
"No, this is..."

425
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,760
"Oh, Mr. O'Hara."

426
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,000
"Oh, Mr. Kiyama."

427
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:42,880
"Hello."

428
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,240
"I'm always grateful for your help."

429
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,400
"Oh, this is me."

430
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,340
"Mr. Kiyama, I'm not bothering you."

431
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,800
"I'm telling you that's not true. Tell me the truth."

432
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,140
"I'm really grateful to you, Mr. Ryo."

433
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,840
"It's all thanks to you that the store that was about to collapse was brought back to life."

434
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,100
"Are you sure about that?"

435
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,860
"Yes, that's why I said I was helping people."

436
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,800
"If you helped people, of course you wouldn't have received money."

437
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,160
"I'm sure you didn't have any money."

438
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,060
"Of course, I had a lot of money."

439
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,000
"Of course you had a lot of money, but you didn't receive a single cent of your money."

440
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,640
"I see."

441
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,160
"What did you come here for, Chief?"

442
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,760
"Well, uh..."

443
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,760
"I came here to think about building a two-storey house."

444
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,260
"I see. So you had a pamphlet the other day."

445
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,420
"Yes, my daughter and I live in a house.

446
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,700
"I heard that when a small kid jumps around, he or she will say something or complain."

447
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,540
"Oh, you're so cute."

448
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,900
"I'm glad I didn't have to look after you, Chief."

449
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,600
"I have three grandchildren, so I know how you feel."

450
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,440
"Oh, that must be lively."

451
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,180
"My son is moving to Kagoshima now."

452
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,040
"My wife is going over there now."

453
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,880
"She's crying and talking."

454
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,400
"That's..."

455
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,160
"That's a little sad."

456
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,280
"Well, then I'll excuse myself for having a lot of customers."

457
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,640
"Ryo, please."

458
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,280
"I've been doing a lot of work as a mechanic lately, so I'm very skilled."

459
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,320
"I'll do my best to do this job."

460
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,440
"I'm looking forward to working with you."

461
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,980
"So you're thinking of building a new house that will transform into a robot-type house?"

462
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,400
"Yes, it was a dream from when I was a child."

463
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,080
"`a robot, a robot"

464
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,100
"I'm so happy to hear this story, and I'm glad that even such a small technology school like ours were able to do it like it should."

465
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,760
"We have about three of these robots in our house, so I can understand."

466
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,800
" Admit it. It would be a dream come true if we get help from Mr. Mikiyama of Reform."

467
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,220
"Please leave it to him."

468
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,800
였ля

469
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,900
Thank you for the cooperation!

470
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,860
Me too!

471
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,540
It's a one-in-one robot-figure-like house.

472
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,320
It could be a new way to discover the world of Japan,

473
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,940
or the world of the anime,

474
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,340
or even a new way to discover the world of the anime,

475
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,520
I'm looking forward to it!

476
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,260
Please choose from this catalogue.

477
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,160
Ryotsu-san, we just got a call from the material company,

478
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,840
and they're saying there's not enough rail for the living room.

479
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,140
The rail for the living room?

480
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,100
It's a B-class product, so just tell them to arrange the number!

481
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
If you're late, we won't pay you!

482
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,960
- Okay? - Yes.

483
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,060
It looks like we'll have a nice two-story house, Dad.

484
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,220
I'm glad you asked for it, Kiyama-san.

485
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,620
Thank you very much.

486
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,720
Okay, it's done!

487
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,900
Check complete!

488
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,660
This concludes the third episode of the surprise project,

489
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,300
Robot House.

490
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,320
Complete!

491
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,300
Hey!

492
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,080
Put this on the wall around here,

493
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,640
and deliver it to the company.

494
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,840
Yes sir.

495
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,540
I'm counting on you.

496
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,340
Yes sir.

497
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,160
I haven't slept in three days.

498
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,000
Is this wall okay?

499
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,840
Anything is fine.

500
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,720
But before you leave,

501
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,120
please make me a hot coffee.

502
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,740
Yes, I'll put it in right away.

503
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,600
Hey, Ryotsu-san.

504
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,580
I just got a call from Ohara-san,

505
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,260
and he wants to check it again,

506
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,000
so I'd like you to send it back, but...

507
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,160
Ohara-san?

508
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,140
It's near the CEO's desk.

509
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,080
Okay.

510
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Here it is.

511
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,280
Geez,

512
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,200
this isn't a house for two-story houses

513
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,860
with a big project.

514
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,500
I brought you some coffee.

515
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,660
Sorry about that.

516
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,060
I think I put it on the desk,

517
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,520
but it's weird.

518
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,480
Did I put it back here?

519
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,900
This isn't in here...

520
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,280
This isn't in here either...

521
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,100
Oh, I found it.

522
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,560
This is it.

523
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,860
The color of the tile was this color, too.

524
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,860
Hey, what are you doing?

525
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,880
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

526
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,380
I'll be right back.

527
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,580
Now we just have to wait for it to be finished.

528
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,580
The weather is better than the new building.

529
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,040
Indeed.

530
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,360
After this job,

531
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,840
I'll be able to go to the company

532
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,380
and face my challenges.

533
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,640
I see.

534
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,200
From now on,

535
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,880
I'll continue my work

536
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,320
and introduce you to the third round

537
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,120
of the "Reform Kiyamono Surprise Suggestions."

538
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,500
Here you go, Mr. Young President,

539
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,360
tape cut.

540
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,320
What's so surprising?

541
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,140
It's nothing.

542
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,140
Everyone,

543
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,160
the surprise project is about to begin.

544
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,600
Here you go,

545
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,440
no, no,

546
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,080
Mr. Young President,

547
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,080
ride on.

548
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,140
Huh?

549
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,740
That's weird.

550
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,440
What's wrong, Mr. Young President?

551
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,800
Where's the reform lever?

552
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,180
Huh?

553
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,700
I don't see it.

554
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,020
What's wrong?

555
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:57,840
Huh?

556
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,920
Where is it?

557
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,920
That's weird.

558
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,060
Let me reform it quickly.

559
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,160
That's weird.

560
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,900
No, no way.

561
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,860
This one.

562
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,300
Yes, yes,

563
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,860
I'll be right back.

564
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,420
I'll be right back.

565
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,200
Oh,

566
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,260
I was replaced at that time.

567
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,880
It feels different.

568
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,520
Hmm?

569
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,820
Huh?

570
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,360
Is there a lever here?

571
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,600
Huh?

572
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,640
What?

573
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,220
What's that sound?

574
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,800
What?

575
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,200
What?

576
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,780
What?

577
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:37,900
What?

578
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,860
Robot!

579
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,220
Robot!

580
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,560
Robot!

581
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,240
Robot!

582
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,820
Robot!

583
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,220
Robot!

584
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,420
Robot!

585
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,440
Robot!

586
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:54,800
Robot!

587
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,000
Robot!

588
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,180
Robot!

589
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,740
Robot!

590
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,400
Robot!

591
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,440
Robot!

592
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:56,860
Robot!

593
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,100
Robot!

594
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,160
Robot!

595
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,300
Robot!

596
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,180
Robot!

597
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,600
Robot!

598
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,780
Robot!

599
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,080
What's wrong with Debea?

600
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,060
Did the system of low-level, low-level, and low-level have gone too far?

601
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,280
Ryo-tsu!

602
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,140
Huh?

603
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,860
My long-standing dream is...

604
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,960
It's all gone!

605
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,740
Depp-chan!

606
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,300
Mork's Robot House!

607
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,840
That's it! That's the robot house of the surprise project!

608
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,780
Mork-chan's Robot House!

609
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,680
Yu-san!

610
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,180
What is Debea?

611
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,280
Get out of Earth!

612
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,280
Ehhhhhhhhh!

613
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,180
Jyugem Jyugem

614
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,700
A five-year-old

615
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,100
Shredded

616
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,360
Seedling

617
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,400
Seedling

618
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,840
Jyugem Jyugem

619
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,420
A five-year-old

620
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:51,740
Shredded

621
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:51,960
Seedling

622
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:52,960
Seedling

623
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,440
Always sandals

624
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,620
Always scandals

625
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,060
Don't worry

626
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Don't worry

627
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,480
Play with the coonel

628
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,120
Everyday

629
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,820
Everyday

630
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,300
Tired of it

631
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,120
I rolled it up at the dumpster

632
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
and threw it away

633
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,180
Then I threw it away

634
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,760
Then I threw it away

635
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,620
Then I threw it away

636
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:15,840
Siliveness

637
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,740
Romantic

638
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,700
It's just something I had to come up with

639
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:17,780
From an idiot

640
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,460
To an idiot

641
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,380
With no money

642
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,960
Isn't that nice?

643
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,260
Isn't it?

644
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,720
You should do it however I tell you to

645
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,500
Is that so,

646
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,080
Amazing!

647
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,180
A spark from one side of the boat

648
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,940
The smoke from the head

649
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,520
If I run away

650
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,420
It won't have a back

651
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,120
Isn't a waste of energy

652
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,560
Go to the flower garden

653
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,300
Do it

654
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,100
Vaping typhoon

655
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,720
Let's go!
