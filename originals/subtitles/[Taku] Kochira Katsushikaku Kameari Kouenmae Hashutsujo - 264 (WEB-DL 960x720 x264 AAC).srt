What's That low-quality kid doing?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,440
Low-quality kid?

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,240
When you're watching TV,

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,400
Make the room a bit lighter and look away

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,320

Come!

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm not here, but I'm worried

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,800
Look at the blue sky

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,880
White clouds

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,800
I wonder what will happen

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,980
Tomorrow I know it will be alright

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,360
People without jobs, come to my place

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but I'm worried

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,880
Look, everything's on fire

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,780

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,080
Yes, today's report is from a doggy-only sauna!

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,360
Wow, they seem to be relaxed and comfortable!

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,380
Well then, let's hear their impressions.

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,400
Buddy-chan, how do you feel?

29
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,620
It seems very good!

30
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,320
Even though it's a dog, it's a sauna?

31
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,640
After this, this Buddy-chan will be

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,780
cleaning up with this dog-only estee,

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,420
then having a luxurious meal at a dog-only restaurant,

34
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,480
and then staying at a dog-only hotel for the night!

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,280
What did you say?

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,080
How is it? Aren't you jealous?

37
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,420
Of course I am!

38
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,620
Senpai, don't get too excited!

39
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,420
Well, can I be this luxurious just because I'm a dog?

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,460
I'm not a dog, I'm a family!

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,000
As the owner of a pet, I'm a family!

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,720
I'm going to Hawaii with my Seara tomorrow!

43
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,060
You're going to Hawaii, even though you're a dog?

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,380
Yes, I'm going to participate in the dog contest held there!

45
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,540
Seara is the winning candidate!

46
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,100
Can a dog take an airplane?

47
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,540
The number of services that invite customers is increasing!

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Our airline company also has a pet!

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,920
Oh, me too!

50
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,940
Ryo's bathtub is broken,

51
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,780
and in this cold weather the dog has to stay in his yard a lot!

52
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,620
Oww! So cold!

53
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,040
The dog had already made a ferocious outing.

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,780
And he hasn't eaten with the dog for years!

55
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,460
Dogs do have a better life!

56
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
I pity my dog!

57
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,180
That's because Ryo-chan is bad.

58
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,540
Senpai can't argue with that.

59
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,540
What a cold word.

60
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,500
She said she's better off living with a dog than me.

61
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Hm? I see.

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,700
Then...

63
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,780
That's right, Reiko.

64
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,620
Bring Seara with you before you go out tomorrow.

65
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,440
Sure.

66
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,520
I'm going to meet Komachi-chan and the others here anyway.

67
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,580
What?

68
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,260
Are you going with that noisy girl?

69
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,780
Yes. What is it?

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,940
Oh, it's nothing.

71
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,820
Ryo-san's Dog Life

72
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,460
Good morning.

73
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,500
Hey, you're getting bigger again.

74
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,780
Good, good.

75
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,440
You're really good to Senpai.

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,560
That's right.

77
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,320
Ryo-chan is a face that animals like.

78
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,920
You're right.

79
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,240
You're right.

80
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,360
Let's go for a walk.

81
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,960
All right.

82
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,780
Have a good day.

83
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,680
Okay, Seara.

84
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,220
Let's go.

85
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,920
It's about time.

86
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,800
Oh, here he is.

87
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,020
Hey!

88
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,200
Hi, Ryo-san.

89
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm sorry, Borubo and Jody.

90
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,860
All right, Seara.

91
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,700
I'll be back in two weeks.

92
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,700
Take care of Jody.

93
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,480
LAUREN

94
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,780
What are you doing with a dog?

95
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,080
I just wanted to surprise Reiko.

96
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,740
But it's only been a couple of weeks.

97
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,940
Jody, it's bad for you if Americans pay attention to the details.

98
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,960
Now I'm gonna change my clothes.

99
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,280
Come on, get change.

100
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,940
Tch, tch, tch!

101
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,040
Hmm...

102
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,380
Ryotsu, are you really going to do it?

103
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,380
Of course! The dogs are living a better life than me.

104
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,240
I want to live like a dog!

105
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,280
I'll eat some high-quality food and relax in Hawaii.

106
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,060
Okay!

107
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,320
Okay!

108
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,620
Good! You really look like a dog!

109
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,320
I wonder if I can trick them well.

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,900
Don't worry! My acting skills are like an academician.

111
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,500
Ah, but your eyes are weird.

112
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,720
I'll borrow some.

113
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,520
Okay, this is fine.

114
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,140
Well, I'm counting on you.

115
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,080
Okay!

116
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,920
Reiko-san, sorry to keep you waiting!

117
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,740
Hey, welcome.

118
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,600
Hey, welcome.

119
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,480
Huh? Where's Seara?

120
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,020
Ryo-chan's taking her for a walk.

121
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,260
Mwah! Mwah!

122
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,600
Oh, she's back.

123
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,360
Mwah! Mwah!

124
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,820
Huh? Morubo-san, where's Senpai?

125
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,080
I-I'm just meeting with Ryotsu over there.

126
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,200
I was asked to take care of this dog because I got a job.

127
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,120
What? You're irresponsible.

128
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,300
I don't have any sense of responsibility.

129
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,420
I'm the king of irresponsibility.

130
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,560
Well, you're Senpai after all.

131
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,800
Hey, you guys, remember this later, okay?

132
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,000
Seara, what happened to your sunglasses?

133
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,220
That's because...

134
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,580
Ryo-chan said that the weather in Hawaii is pretty bad, so I have to wear them.

135
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,780
Ryo-chan did?

136
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,840
Oh, Ryo-chan and Kanchi have a lot of good things.

137
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,600
Ah, Seara seems to like them, too.

138
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,400
Okay, nice follow, Morubo.

139
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,900
Ah, ah...

140
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,740
You look good in sunglasses.

141
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,360
You're cute.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,600
Amazing.

143
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,000
It's my first time in the first class.

144
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,900
I finally got sucked in as a dog.

145
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,600
It's a complicated feeling.

146
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm not sure if it's my mood, but the stewardess is pretty.

147
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,860
But...

148
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,480
Look, look! The ship looks so small.

149
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,180
It really looks like a toy.

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,040
It's a scratch sometimes when the two are noisy.

151
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,640
Yes.

152
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,740
Yes.

153
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,400
Are you surprised? That dog can shed blood.

154
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,560
No way.

155
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,560
It's true.

156
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,060
Sorry to keep you waiting.

157
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,900
Yes.

158
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,440
It's true.

159
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,120
Oh, it's a ship.

160
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,240
It's a ship.

161
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,580
What are you doing?

162
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,640
It's kind of a It's kind of an

163
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,280
don't you think so?

164
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,080
Yeah, that probably is.

165
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,540
I can't wait till I get there.

166
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,020
Y saburjya

167
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,180
y saburjya

168
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,080
y saburjya

169
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,660
y saburjya

170
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,480
Wow!

171
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,560
This is our room.

172
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:48,860
Amazing!

173
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,440
Gorgeous!

174
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,320
I did it! I should do it like this.

175
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,140
Are you tired?

176
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,300
I'm not!

177
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
I want to swim!

178
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,440
Okay, let's change!

179
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,440
Let's change!

180
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,900
This is an unexpected showtime.

181
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,760
'Spring Day ' It

182
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,000
's the ocean! You

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,620
look near happy. It

's your 5th visit in Hawaii and you want to see it for the first time? Absolutely

185
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,940
awesome! I

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,000
never imagined that I would still be able to visit Hawaii for free. Enjoy

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,040
your home life! It

188
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,060
's great. There

189
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,160
's a sea.

190
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:42,880
He's back swimming!

191
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,720
That's your dog, Reiko!

192
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,060
When did he learn how to back swim?

193
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,200
Huh? Is that a dog surfing?

194
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,860
You bastard! You can't stand up!

195
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Leave it to me!

196
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,460
This is surfing, right?

197
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Yeah! It's surfing!

198
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,880
Look! It's a pipeline!

199
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,160
Seara, he's surfing!

200
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,860
You're kidding, right?

201
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,700
Don't be surprised by his surfing skills.

202
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,580
I'm better at it.

203
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,340
Go! Go!

204
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,580
Come on! First spin in space!

205
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,900
Go! Go!

206
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,840
This is how you ride a jet!

207
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,720
Seara is so active!

208
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,600
He's like someone's partner.

209
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,160
There are so many interviews coming in!

210
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,600
It's rare to see a jet ski.

211
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,420
What! What! What are you doing?

212
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,620
You're taking a lot of interviews!

213
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,260
I can't believe it!

214
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,120
What? What?

215
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,070
What? What?

216
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,080
What? What?

217
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,060
What? What?

218
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,840
What? What?

219
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,740
What is this?

220
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,560
What?

221
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,940
Are you looking for food, Lainu?

222
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,860
I'm not like you guys.

223
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,460
It's not the same as the other one.

224
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,660
Golf is also a great skill.

225
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,140
I've never taught it.

226
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,940
This is the life of a rich dog.

227
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,020
This is the rich life I wanted.

228
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,940
The sun is full.

229
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm tired of eating steak.

230
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,800
I want to eat something refreshing.

231
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,300
Do you want to eat Japanese food?

232
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
I did it!

233
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,000
Japanese food.

234
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,920
It's delicious.

235
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,960
Japanese food is Japanese food.

236
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,100
Yakitori and sashimi are delicious.

237
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,680
Natto and stew are delicious.

238
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,100
Beer at the end.

239
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,160
It works.

240
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,180
It works.

241
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,380
I fell asleep.

242
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,160
It looks like my dad.

243
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,440
I want to pee in the beer.

244
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,100
I was wearing a costume.

245
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,000
I was wearing a costume.

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
*Sigh*

247
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,840
Let's go to the bathroom and pee properly.

248
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,560
W-what?

249
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,380
What's wrong, Reiko?

250
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,960
Seara's acting weird!

251
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,080
Seara?

252
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,860
Her hair's all messy!

253
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,880
Oh no!

254
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,400
What's going to happen to the contest?

255
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,180
Seara!

256
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,680
Seara!

257
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,740
What? It's not working at all!

258
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,520
It's true.

259
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,620
I'm so glad.

260
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,200
Don't scare me, Reiko.

261
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm sorry. I think I got it wrong.

262
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,580
That was close. I was careless.

263
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,420
Anyway, good night, Seara.

264
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,840
Good night.

265
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,820
Good night.

266
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,160
Grrr!

267
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,700
So heavy!

268
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,640
Gah!

269
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,700
Seara, did you get fat?

270
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,500
Yes, I did.

271
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,720
I only ate after I came here.

272
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,460
It was a contest after all.

273
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,660
Seara, you're on a diet starting tomorrow.

274
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,120
You can't be spoiled.

275
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
You can't even cry.

276
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,040
Hey, hey, what's wrong with you?

277
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,120
Your legs are heavy.

278
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,040
You just started running again.

279
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,500
If you say that, it's hard to run in this school.

280
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,800
Get out of that place.

281
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,900
That's right, that's right.

282
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,280
I can't do it.

283
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,700
What's wrong with you?

284
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,520
It seems impossible to win this.

285
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,060
If you win, you can get 100,000 dollars.

286
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,220
If I win, I get 100,000 dollars?

287
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,560
If I win, I get 100,000 dollars.

288
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,180
Sarah suddenly got excited.

289
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,540
When I asked her for 100,000 dollars, she changed her dog.

290
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,440
No way.

291
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,520
Sarah.

292
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,440
Come here.

293
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,220
Master wants to see you.

294
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,220
Sarah was good at standing on the slope.

295
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,120
Standing on the slope.

296
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,720
Come on, hurry up.

297
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,780
It's that easy.

298
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,240
If you get caught here, you'll get 100,000 dollars.

299
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
And then, the moon came in.

300
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,700
That's right, don't worry.

301
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,320
And then, the moon came in.

302
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,040
And then, the moon came in.

303
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,520
How I am very excited.

304
00:16:59,720 --> 00:16:59,800
I'll show you.

305
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,760
You surprised yourself like this.

306
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,780
That will be the瞬間.

307
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,340
I was excited to beat you.

308
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:15,360
I want to run.

309
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm not scared.

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm not scared.

311
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,440
I want to win.

312
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,260
The next morning

313
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,540
Reiko-san, I'm so sorry. I was just about to ask Bobby.

314
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,360
I'm keeping the Seara at my place so don't worry.

315
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,800
See you later.

316
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,280
How was it, Reiko-san?

317
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,800
I knew it. The Seara was at Jody-san's place.

318
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,120
So that gorilla man really was trying to get rid of the Seara?

319
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,440
Unforgivable!

320
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,540
I'll get rid of it for you.

321
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,780
How?

322
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,040
Actually, tomorrow.

323
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:07,320
Huh? It's not here?

324
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,040
Is there anyone in there?

325
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,420
I think so.

326
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,160
That guy is such a tough guy...

327
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,660
I've been waiting for you for so long.

328
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,900
It's time for the century-long dog contest.

329
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,120
The true heroes of Kano-ku,

330
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,460
Who will win?

331
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,100
It's finally starting!

332
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,400
Ready, go!

333
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,920
The first round is

334
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,640
Super Tokumori Dog Food's

335
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,720
Fast Food Competition!

336
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,220
Dog food, cat food

337
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,800
It's like an egg!

338
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,000
100,000 dollars!

339
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,720
He's eating dog food!

340
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,580
And it looks delicious!

341
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,760
The top is

342
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,880
22nd Seara

343
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,620
18th Liger

344
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,060
50th Thunder Devil

345
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,800
What's the next event?

346
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,940
Sit on a chair

347
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,420
and spin!

348
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,740
Go!

349
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,260
He's trying to balance

350
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,040
Can he cross the bridge?

351
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,780
Next is

352
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,040
360 degree spin

353
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,220
It's like a rain shower

354
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,200
Tommy's trap

355
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,660
He's slow

356
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:38,920
But he's fast

357
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,180
Punching Glove

358
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,740
He's fast

359
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,220
22nd Seara

360
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,820
He's finished

361
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,120
And he's

362
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,440
facing off

363
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,240
Amazing

364
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,000
He's moving more than dogs

365
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,660
He believes he'll win

366
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,580
100,000 dollars

367
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,960
Ryo's desire is his motivation

368
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,200
Next is

369
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,500
Diving from a cliff

370
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,720
300 meters high

371
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:08,700
Climbing a cliff

372
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,800
And getting a treasure box

373
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,600
It's super difficult

374
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:25,100
He's going to lose

375
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
His pride

376
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,300
He's a true

377
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,860
He's a true

378
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,700
He's a true

379
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,040
He's a true

380
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,640
He's a true

381
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,160
He's a true

382
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,460
He's a true

383
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,680
He's a true

384
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,660
The other dogs are also following!

385
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,440
I wonder if they can keep breathing at 300 meters.

386
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,760
Dogs other than Seara failed to land.

387
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,940
They are falling out of the water here!

388
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,920
My breath is getting harder.

389
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,540
Oh, there it is.

390
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
I have to hurry.

391
00:20:59,680 --> 00:20:59,720
I have to hurry.

392
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,040
I can't do this anymore.

393
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,180
What's wrong, Seara?

394
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,500
They are not coming out.

395
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,600
I wonder if they were unable to land at 300 meters or 600 meters.

396
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,600
It's Seara!

397
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,680
This dog is different!

398
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,760
It seems that the diver who was close to her stole the regulator.

399
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,120
I don't know.

400
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,840
In that sense, it's a great dog!

401
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,160
Can dogs do this?

402
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,600
Oh, I can see it!

403
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,100
The last hero who has overcome numerous trials and is running towards the glory of glory!

404
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,740
Now, please give your warm applause and go!

405
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,500
I won!

406
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,120
I can't believe it!

407
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,520
I can't believe it!

408
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,640
Now, Seara, the winner is waiting for a wonderful gift!

409
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,100
Seara, are you ready?

410
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,780
Yes!

411
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,380
I got 100,000 dollars!

412
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,060
You are amazing, Ryo-chan!

413
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,900
Stronger than a dog!

414
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,060
As expected of Ryo Tsukan-kichi!

415
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,100
How was it?

416
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,780
Did you know about me?

417
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,100
Congratulations!

418
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,920
Congratulations on winning!

419
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,060
You were chosen as the world's first famous dog.

420
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,160
Please go

421
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,440
By, by, by, by...

422
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:49,740
Ah, I can walk!

423
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,980
Ryo-chan, stay healthy!

424
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,140
See you next time!

425
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,640
Bye-bye!

426
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:57,780
ute

427
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,860
You're home

428
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,240
Good boy

429
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,620
You're home

430
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,960
Yeah, she's a very good girl.

431
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,340
She's better than my Bobby.

432
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,460
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

433
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,660
By the way, I don't think you can see Ryo-san.

434
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,560
Ahaha, Ryo-chan is currently on vacation on the Meiyo Line.

435
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,220
Eh?

436
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,260
But, is Ryo-chan okay?

437
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,220
She's okay, if she's a gorilla man.

438
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,240
That's right. Ryo-chan is okay, isn't she?

439
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,300
Is it okay, if she's a gorilla man?

440
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,540
Hurry and return her to Earth!

and the chimney of the town was very high.

461
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,720
But this is a story of how I met the artist's sister and the memory we have.
