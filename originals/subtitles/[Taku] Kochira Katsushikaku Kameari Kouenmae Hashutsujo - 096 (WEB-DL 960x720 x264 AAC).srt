00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:29,820
It has been a while since my last video, and I made two videos on the same topic, so I

2
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:29,980
hope you are still happy with my new video In this video, I talk about the

3
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,840
When I kicked the tree, it flew to my shoes

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,240
I wonder if I should go to the gym that I used to go to

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,440
I was laughed at for being a baby

6
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,860
Even if I try to cheer up, there is only a punishment

7
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,020
There is only a punishment, and my yawns are the same

8
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,260
The cityscape is strangely kind

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,720
From the fountain of the Tungari-boshi

10
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,360
The sun sets to the Taishakuten

11
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:23,560
Tomorrow, I will wake up

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:23,840
and go to the gym

13
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,380
It's over

14
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,740
If I win, I will be happy again

15
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,080
I lost it and realized

16
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,720
I'm such an idiot

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:45,600
That day, Senpai and I were asked by Senpai's mother

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,860
to repair the floor of Senpai's family

19
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,180
Ouch!

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,320
Are you okay, Senpai?

21
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,460
Hey, Honda!

22
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,180
Light the hand properly!

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,180
Yes, sir!

24
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,180
The sand is heavy!

25
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:08,960
Yes, sir!

26
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,760
Senpai, what is this place?

27
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,820
Well...

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,080
It's a pot!

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,980
Oh, it's just like in the movies

30
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,400
The pot looks like our mom's

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,300
Oh my goodness!

32
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,820
Well, you know...

33
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:53,840
That's what you think

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,600
*gulp*

39
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,660
Hey, hold on!

*splat*

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,940
The pot...

42
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,900
The pot...

43
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,720
Hey!

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,140
*splat*

45
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,960
The pot?

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,960

50
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:26,980
Huh?

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,540
That pot was hidden by my ancestors somewhere.

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,100
The pot 400 years ago...

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,440
It really was there.

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,860
So what's in it?

55
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,360
I haven't heard about it.

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,100
But it's a pot that the fallen warrior brought with him to save his life.

57
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,660
Well, it's a treasure.

58
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,940
I'll go and buy it.

59
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,980
A treasure?

60
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,940
Is that all?

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,100
Yeah.

62
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,020
Alright, let's take it out, Honda!

63
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,900
Yes!

64
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,520
Hurry up and find it before your father finds it!

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,840
Why?

66
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,580
It's about your father. He's going to demand a share.

67
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,820
I see.

68
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,540
Alright, we're done taking it out.

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right.

70
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,100
Oh, that's...

*splat*

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,380
What is this?

73
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,240
Let's take it back.

74
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,700
*splat*

75
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,740
*splat*

76
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,740
Senpai! I think there's another pot in there!

77
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,360
*splat*

78
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,140
Bring it here!

79
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,760
*splat*

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,180
*splat*

81
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,500
What's this? It's pretty big.

82
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,740
*splat*

83
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,020
One, two, three!

84
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,840
*splat*

85
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,740

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,140

*splat*

93
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,680
How many are there?

94
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,580
How many are there?

95
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,080
That's too much.

96
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,980
You've dug up a lot.

97
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,160
What if there's another pot?

98
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,620
What's the point of being scared of something so unrealistic?

99
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,060
Rather, look at the reality in front of you.

100
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,360
The pots are all mine, Honda!

101
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
*splat*

102
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,240
One pot is 100,000 yen.

103
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,140
That's 1 pot, 1000 pieces.

104
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,360
That's 50 pots.

105
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,540
1, 10, 100, 1000...

106
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,880
5, 5 billion!

107
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,920
5 billion, Honda!

108
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,280
If you have 5 billion, you can have anything.

109
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,880
Give Otohime Nanan a high-end motorcycle.

110
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,200
Give Otohime Nanan a high-end motorcycle.

111
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,300
Give Otohime Nanan a high-end motorcycle.

112
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,060
You're so nice, Honda!

113
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,640
I'm glad you're alive.

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,660
What are you going to do, Honda?

115
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm going to...

*splat*

117
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm going to follow you.

118
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,600
Good!

119
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,940
I'm going to check the treasure.

120
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,760
Hold this.

121
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,580
*splat*

122
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,000
Ouch!

123
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,940
It's a bird!

124
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,740
Ouch!

125
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,920
Someone help me!

126
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,740
You hit yourself!

127
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,760
It's a bad bird!

128
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,980
Otohime!

129
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:12,480
Help me!

130
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,420
Ouch!

131
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,220
Ouch! Ouch!

132
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,660
Ouch! Ouch!

133
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,200
Ouch!

134
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,300
Ouch! Ouch!

135
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,840
Ouch!

136
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,580
Ouch!

137
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,680
Ouch!

138
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,300
Ouch!

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,640
You're a coward, aren't you?

140
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,200
You're a coward, aren't you?

141
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,420
You're an old lady.

142
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,580
What happened?

143
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,400
I put the microwave and the cooler together,

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,260
and the breaker fell off.

145
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,340
I thought so.

146
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,520
Alright.

147
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:44,840
What?

148
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,280
*splat*

149
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,100
Touch it carefully.

150
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,020
That's what I'm going to do.

151
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,440
Hold on...

152
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,020
Hold on, Honda.

153
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,400
Senpai, aren't you going to stop?

154
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,600
I don't want to.

155
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,760
I want to.

156
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,760
I'm going to...

157
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,700
If you want it,

158
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,840
hold it down!

159
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,900
Yes!

160
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,140
You can't hear me, Senpai?

161
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,220
It's the voice of the fallen ghost!

162
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,260
Hey, Gyal!

163
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,780
No! I'm going to get possessed!

164
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,640
Look closely. This is the voice.

165
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,600
Saori!

166
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,040
What's wrong, Sakonji?

167
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,280
I finally got to the place where I can confess to Saori.

168
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,300
But the data disappeared in the power outage.

169
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,260
I hope you understand, Honda.

170
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,160
Yes.

171
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,700
I'll give it to you next time.

172
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,640
Okay.

173
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,500
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chida!

174
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

175
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,380
Please don't hit me! Please!

176
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,400
What's this?

177
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,700
Let's stop it! There's no human head in here!

178
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,500
There's a falling ghost and a hit!

179
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,780
Shut up! You'll understand when you see it!

180
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,140
Shut up! You'll understand when you see it!

181
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,060
I'll show you!

182
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,920
I have a full-on head.

183
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,160
A-a-a-a-a-a-a...

184
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,480
Damn... It's hard to get it.

185
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,620
Ugh, it's no good...

186
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,760
Let's stop this...

187
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,980
Shut up, for God's sake!

188
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,200
Take this!

189
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,980
Oh no! It's blood! Blood, blood, blood!

190
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,620
Blood! Blood! Blood!

191
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,540
This...

192
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,740
Blood, blood, blood.

193
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,500
It's blood, blood.

194
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,160
It's blood.

195
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,900
What the hell...

196
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,460
Blood, blood, blood.

197
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,560
It's blood! Blood!

198
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,960
Honda, look closely! It's just a plum blossom!

199
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,760
What?

200
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,440
Plum blossom?

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,760
It was just a plum blossom?

202
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,540
That's great. It's a plum blossom.

203
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,300
Not good!

204
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
But why are there umeboshi in the pot?

205
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,080
I see. This is probably a dummy to distract the enemy.

206
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,300
The real thing is another pot.

207
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,060
This is also a dummy.

208
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,180
This is also a dummy.

209
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,860
Damn it! It's all dummies!

210
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,220
All umeboshi.

211
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
The five billion of the star.

212
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,960
Five billion.

213
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,480
Five billion.

214
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,280
Senpai, there was a wooden box with us, right?

215
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,520
That's right! There was something in it that was cheap!

216
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,740
Is it just a piece of paper?

217
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,700
No, wait. All the pots are dummies.

218
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,300
It must be written on this paper that there is a real treasure.

219
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,760
I see.

220
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,720
Well, one day, a fallen warrior fell in front of my house.

221
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,660
The warrior carried it and opened the lid of the pot.

222
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,420
And...

223
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,080
Huh?

224
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,880
Umeboshi.

225
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,640
So this is all umeboshi.

226
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
That's right.

227
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,180
All of this is a pot of umeboshi.

228
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,020
Please, take it.

229
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,780
Huh?

230
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,820
Hey! Hey!

231
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,840
I am Shinzaemon Adachi.

232
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,480
I wanted to leave this umeboshi which is passed down from generation to generation to my descendants.

233
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,720
But I am not strong enough for such a thing.

234
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,980
Instead, please eat it.

235
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,940
Please.

236
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,200
Oh, that's fine.

237
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,580
Really?

238
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,240
I put it into my pot.

239
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,460
I guarantee the taste.

240
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,280
Please eat it without leaving a single grain.

241
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,460
Oh, I understand.

242
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,240
Please.

243
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,060
Oh...

244
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,320
I said that, but I am not good at umeboshi.

245
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,780
I have no choice.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,700
I will bury it with this guy.

247
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,340
I will make a grave and bury the umeboshi and the pot.

248
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,620
I will live as a king for five years.

249
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,600
I will take the umeboshi.

250
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,220
What?

251
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,120
So, it was umeboshi after all.

252
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,240
5 billion...

253
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
My 5 billion!

254
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,600
Gakun...

255
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,780
So, what are you going to do with this umeboshi?

256
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,440
Would you like to eat it?

257
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,460
I can't eat the umeboshi that was 400 years ago.

258
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,780
Please let me do it.

259
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,120
Me?

260
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,460
I am not good at eating bugs.

261
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,140
I will beat you with it.

262
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,860
I will beat you with it.

263
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,440
All right.

264
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,760
I will beat you.

265
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,960
I will beat you.

266
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,600
I will beat you.

267
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,780
Sorry about that, Mr. Sh Isaimon Adachi.

268
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,140
You umeboshi will be carried to the garbage collectors from 20th century.

269
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,920
Don't you throw it away.

270
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,460
Don't you throw it away.

271
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,980
Don't you throw it away.

272
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,440
Don't you throw it away.

273
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,420
Don't throw it away.

274
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:49,620
Don't give up your job.

275
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,280
No, no!

276
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,380
It's out! It's out! It's out!

277
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,160
Oh no!

278
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,920
It's a ghost from the Armored Carrier.

279
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,040
That's right. It's definitely a ghost.

280
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,620
I can see it with my own eyes.

281
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,800
Then, you were filming a movie, weren't you?

282
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,980
I'm sleepy. Come out quickly.

283
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,280
It stinks.

284
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,640
I see. It's a movie.

285
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,640
Well, there should be ghosts.

286
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:20,660
There should be ghosts.

287
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,560
This is...

288
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,820
Don't throw away the stick!

289
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:03,620
You're still living!

290
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,420
Useless!

291
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,320
I'm really sad!

292
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,420
Don't say that!

293
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,660
I don't think you'll dare to touch it.

294
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,320
Oh, please!

295
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:20,820
Ah!

296
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,240
I'm not Adachi Shinzaemon.

297
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,260
Ah!

298
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:28,900
No!

299
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,320
You brought a pot, didn't you?

300
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,220
A pot!

301
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,260
Ufufufufu...

302
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,560
I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

303
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,680
What's so frustrating, Shinzaemon-san?

304
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,640
That plum was made with my own effort.

305
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,960
I grabbed it and buried it in the ground without even a single bite.

306
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,660
It's frustrating that you didn't eat the plum.

307
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,500
I'll cut you to pieces and beat you to a pulp.

308
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,160
By the way, who are you beating?

309
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,280
Of course, the human of Ryotsuke!

310
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,800
Alright, I completely believe you.

311
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,900
Ah!

312
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,140
Ufufufufu...

313
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,240
What a cruel villain.

314
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,460
In order to put him to sleep, I'll take this one-and-a-half-dollar card.

315
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,100
Thank goodness.

316
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,180
I'm glad I'm not beaten.

317
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,300
Are you not a human of Ryotsuke?

318
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,160
Yes, I'm a human of the Honda family.

319
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,040
No way...

320
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,260
Ah!

321
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,220
Um, I'm sorry to bother you, but...

322
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,580
Can you teach me a way to eat your plum?

323
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,580
My senior says he doesn't believe in pale

324
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,340
and I wanted to tell him about it, but...

325
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,440
You should have a plum!

326
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,260
So...

327
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,480
If a human of Ryotsuke eats all the plum,

328
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,160
that will be all the pale and no more of your foetal virgins.

329
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,780
You're kidding!

330
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,480
Can I eat a plum from 400 years ago?

331
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,680
But it doesn't rot.

332
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,480
You said it'll last for a long time.

333
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,220
Then, do it.

334
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,800
-You eat it! -No, I'm not from the Ryotsu family.

335
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,360
Hmm...

336
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,220
Wait a minute!

337
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:31,220
Look! I've sent you the report of the foster care unit in the district office.

338
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,160
From today you are my son, Ryotsu Hayato.

339
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,660
Now you are also a member of the Ryotsu family.

340
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,500
Therefore, this pot is...

341
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,940
...your turn.

342
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,780
Are you telling me to eat everything, senpai?

343
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,840
Not senpai! Call me Papa.

344
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,140
Papa?

345
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,060
Alright.

346
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,360
No, I mean don't force me into this...

347
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,000
Shut up!

348
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,920
I am a lioness who will take my child down to the valley of the ancestors.

349
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,720
It's the virtue of love that I want you to raise him to be a strong human being.

350
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,340
Understand?

351
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,020
No way, senpai...

352
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,860
Call me Papa.

353
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,100
Papa...

354
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,680
If you can't eat it all,

355
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,920
I'll give you 4.

356
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,740
I'm the member of the family, so I'll also give you 4.

357
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,600
Don't forget that!

358
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,020
I'll leave it at that.

359
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,480
Please.

360
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,760
How mean!

361
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,960
I'll leave it at that!

362
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,800
How mean!

363
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,300
But is it really edible?

364
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,100
No, it's not.

365
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,040
No, it's not.

366
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,540
It's 400 years old!

367
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,560
It's sour!

368
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,120
But it's just a normal plum.

369
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:08,460
I can eat a lot of rice with this.

370
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,280
I can eat a lot of rice with this.

371
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,420
But I don't need any plum.

372
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:29,520
But I don't need any plum.

373
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
Let's eat!

374
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,880
It's so sour!

375
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,580
It's so good!

376
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,060
It's so good!

377
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,920
Sir, what's this?

378
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,580
It's a bento.

379
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,420
Is it good?

380
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,940
It's good.

381
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,080
Let's eat!

382
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,000
Is it good?

383
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,500
It's good!

384
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,540
Today,

385
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,400
today,

386
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,500
today,

387
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,460
Today,

388
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:13,820
today,

389
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,880
today,

390
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,660
today.

391
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,300
Thank you, sir!

392
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,140
Thank you!

393
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,460
Thank you!

394
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:23,640
This is nothing.

395
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,460
Thank you, sir!

396
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,560
Gochisousama!

397
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,920
I'm so full.

398
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,060
Now, let's eat some dessert.

399
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,260
What? You're not eating only umeboshi?

400
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,980
Give me some.

401
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,320
Mizumi!

402
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,680
What's this?

403
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,980
Umeboshi cake and 100% umeboshi juice.

404
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,300
If you don't eat it, I'll eat it.

405
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,560
It's so sweet and delicious.

406
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,380
I'll eat it with you.

407
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,460
I'll eat it with you.

408
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,100
I'll eat it with you.

409
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,920
I'll eat it with you.

410
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,820
I'll eat it with you.

411
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,800
I'm home.

412
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,160
Welcome back.

413
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,660
How was your trip to Kyoto?

414
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,940
I had a good time.

415
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
I bought something rare.

416
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,360
It's probably something like Shikasenbei.

417
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,140
That's Nara.

418
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm not going to fight with people who say that.

419
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,000
What is it, chief?

420
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,420
Don't be surprised.

421
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,360
How is it?

422
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,600
Umeboshi?

423
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,960
That's right. I bought it at a old store in Kyoto.

424
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,580
I'm not kidding.

425
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,580
You can buy umeboshi in Tokyo.

426
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,540
What are you thinking?

427
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,520
You don't know anything.

428
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,780
The longer you keep umeboshi in the fridge, the more flavor it has and the better it tastes.

429
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,320
What?

430
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,920
By the way, I've been sleeping on this for 30 years.

431
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,260
It costs 3,000 yen per grain.

432
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,000
What?

433
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,280
What?

434
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,580
3,000 yen in 30 years?

435
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,940
That means you're not going to buy it, right?

436
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,060
What?

437
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,620
If you found umeboshi 400 years ago, how much would it cost?

438
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,740
400 years ago?

439
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,160
I don't think that's really possible.

440
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,060
I think it was sold for 10,000 yen in 100 years.

441
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,960
50,000 yen per grain.

442
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,980
No, it might be 100,000 yen.

443
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,400
What?

444
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,880
100,000 yen per grain?

445
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,300
I think that's 400,000 yen.

446
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,980
What do you mean by 400,000 yen?

447
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,320
I think that's 500,000 yen.

448
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,260
What do you mean by 400,000 yen?

449
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,280
100,000!

450
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,220
400,000 yen?

451
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:09,800
It's a lot.

452
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,220
It's only about 400,000 yen.

453
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,260
That's about 1 million yen.

454
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:14,980
400,000.

455
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,320
500,000...

456
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,240
500,000?

457
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,080
500,000.

458
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,740

498

Senpai...

499
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,320
I ate all the plums!

500
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,000
Who are you?

501
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,200
I've been in the business of driving for 35 years.

502
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,860
I'm the 7th class of the traffic safety leader, Tetsuo Ishizu!

503
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,980
I'm here!

504
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,580
You're the one who saw the car, right?

505
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,920
Yes, I did!

506
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,720
I was putting the garbage in my stomach, so I was careful.

507
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:00,900
You!

508
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,240
You're the one who broke the speed limit and broke the rules!

509
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,800
I won't forgive you!

510
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,180
So...

511
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,900
I'll give you a punishment!

512
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:25,980
I'll give you a punishment!

513
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,640
When he realized, the armadillo and the empty plums were gone.

514
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,860
Maybe he came to thank me for eating all the plums.

515
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,720
Hey, stop it!

516
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,860
The garbage in the middle of the night is cash!

517
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,560
Return everything to the owner!

518
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,320
Hey, why do I have to do this?

519
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,960
And you've even taken the empty plums!

520
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,240
Shut up!

521
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,860
Yes, I'm sorry!

522
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,700
Damn it! Why do I have to wear armor?

523
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,060
Nagagawa is the king of the underworld?

524
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,740
Don't make me laugh!

525
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,420
The one who's hiding in the center is the king of the underworld!

526
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:10,920
He's not in town!

527
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,880
If you're upset, take that blackmail,

528
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,080
and go around and look around!

529
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,700
Next time: "Is Nagagawa the child of the town?"

530
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,080
Come on, go around and look around!
