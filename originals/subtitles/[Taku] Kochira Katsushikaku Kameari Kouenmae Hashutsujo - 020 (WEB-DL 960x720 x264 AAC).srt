Yeah, we can't.

00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,420
We're also going to die of a cold before thehog's day.

49
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:02,440
That's right.

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,380
Oh, no!

00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,040
Wait!

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,020
Wait!

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,700
Junpei, stand up!

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,180
You're in the way again.

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,220
Junpei, are you sure you want to study?

56
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,180
You have a test tomorrow, right?

57
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,720
Yeah, but...

58
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,380
Even if I do it now,

59
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,160
I don't suddenly get a good head.

60
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,480
That's true.

61
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,140
Ryo-san.

62
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,580
Gigu.

63
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,640
You're such a good-aged adult,

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,300
but you're with a kid.

65
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,120
I wonder what's so good about that.

66
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,780
It's the best solution for a full-action robot

67
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,020
with a 4-channel radio controller.

68
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,580
Those who understand will understand.

69
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,660
Those who don't will not understand.

70
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,080
I see.

71
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,600
If Junpei can get at least 80 points in the test,

72
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,720
I'll buy you a lot of things like that.

73
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,680
Really?

74
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,200
Really?

75
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,700
You'll buy me a lot of things?

76
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,560
I'm serious.

77
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,240
It's just an example.

78
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,440
You can't get 80 points.

79
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,160
Brother...

80
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,940
I'll buy you a lot of things.

81
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,380
Look at the Nagashima Titans this year.

82
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,240
They turned the 11.5 game difference in the first half

83
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,180
and won the league championship.

84
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,600
If you want to be a human, you can do anything.

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,580
If Junpei gets 80 points,

86
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,920
I'm sure you'll buy him a radio controller.

87
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,440
Well...

88
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,340
I guess so.

89
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,040
All right, I've decided.

90
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,800
What?

91
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,540
Let's go, Junpei!

92
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,120
Let's go, Junpei!

93
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,600
Yes!

94
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,620
Hey, Ryo!

95
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,420
Hey, Ryo!

96
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,340
Ryo, wait!

97
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,500
What?

98
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,900
What are you going to do, Ryo?

99
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,540
What are you going to do, Ryo?

100
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,000
What are you going to do, Ryo?

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,680
Leave it to me.

102
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,640
If you get the radio controller,

103
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,160
I'll buy you one for free.

104
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,360
Yes!

105
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,360
Yes!

106
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,860
I'll do it.

107
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,540
I'll do it for sure!

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,120
What's Ryo's problem?

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,620
What's Ryo's problem?

110
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,400
What's Ryo's problem?

111
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,020
Huh?

112
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,020
What about a family instructor?

113
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,320
What's his problem?

114
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,220
What is he talking about?

115
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,140
No oneCon popcorn?

116
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,020
He got worried about it.

117
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,460
What?

118
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,020
Hi, Ryo!

119
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,580
You're more than welcome

120
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,220
to stay with me for the rest of the week.

121
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,240
There's plenty of free time.

122
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,240
But...

123
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,380
Ryo,

124
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,420
There's something I need to tell you.

125
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,000
I didn't study hard enough to pass the exam!

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,120
I didn't study hard enough to pass the exam!

127
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,900
I didn't study hard enough to pass the exam!

128
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,280
You didn't sleep at all?

129
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,780
Why are you saying that?

130
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,460
I'd forget everything I learned.

131
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,920
I'd forget everything I learned.

132
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,260
That's extreme.

133
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,760
But people don't really stay focused.

134
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,360
But people don't really stay focused.

135
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,540
Yes. They say it's more efficient to take a break at work.

136
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,380
Yes. They say it's more efficient to take a break at work.

137
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,460
That's a silly thing to say.

138
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,540
My ability to stay focused is different.

139
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,040
Common sense is not working like this!

140
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,540
Common sense is not working like this!

141
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,560
It's more correct to say they don't know it.

142
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,800
It's more correct to say they don't know it.

143
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,160
Listen closely!

144
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,440
They'll slowly metroce the pace of the exam.

145
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,800
Then, they'll drop.

146
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,360
Then, they'll slowly metroce the pace of the exam.

147
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,400
I just start sometimes from the peak.

148
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,840
And then, I go back to the exam.

149
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,700
And then, I go back to the exam.

150
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,040
You tell me...

151
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
- corrected! - He

152
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,160
really holds back his concentration. I

153
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,900
can't believe it. But

154
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,360
this is what happens. If

155
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,880
you say you're focused, you become anxious and hurtful. If

156
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,420
I were him, I'm constantly focused on my brain and fingers. My

157
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,840
senses are 100%. But

158
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,560
if anything comes to my attention, I suddenly lose my concentration. I

159
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,280
see. It's like a process plane. That

160
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,080
's most like you.

161
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,220
So, I'm going to use my special technique to start the...

162
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,420
Where are they?

163
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,340
Wow, amazing!

164
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,800
Oh, no!

165
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,760
Oh, I knew it!

166
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,820
I hid my plan!

167
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
Wait a minute!

168
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,340
Stop it! Don't touch it!

169
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,920
Ryo, are you really going to teach them?

170
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,300
I know how concentrated you are, but it's a different matter than your academic ability.

171
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,920
How do you expect Hineru and Ryo to become house teachers?

172
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know.

173
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,440
How long are you going to play?

174
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,120
Are you really going to study?

175
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,620
Of course!

176
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,260
If it's for the radio, it's going to be in the fire or in the water!

177
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,160
Come on, give us the question paper.

178
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,500
What's the exam range?

179
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,500
Okay, let's start with the language question.

180
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,180
What's this?

181
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,420
What does this mean?

182
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,940
"What's the meaning of the following phrase?"

183
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,620
"50 steps, 100 steps..."

184
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,000
What? It's easy, isn't it?

185
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,380
Of course, it's obvious.

186
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,220
It's 50 steps, 100 steps.

187
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,740
This is the starting line.

188
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,620
Okay, Junpei.

189
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,640
Try walking 100 steps from here.

190
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,520
Okay.

191
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,140
One, two, three, four.

192
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,340
Is that so?

193
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,720
Seven, eight, nine...

194
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,880
Hey, Ryo.

195
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,880
Watch out when you're on the street.

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,400
That's just the math you need.

197
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,040
Oh, my.

198
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,060
...100 steps, 100 steps.

199
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,600
Nice one, Ryo!

200
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:39,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

201
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,340
Ryo.

202
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,560
What are you expecting?

203
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,800
What?

204
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,260
46, 47, 48, 49, 50!

205
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,340
-Number 50! -That's it!

206
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,500
Exactly!

207
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,980
In other words, 50 steps and 100 steps means that even if you're 100 steps away from a child's feet,

208
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,640
you can still walk 50 steps if you're an adult.

209
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,940
-Yeah, I got it! -Yeah, I got it!

210
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,100
I see. So that's the kind of interpretation there was.

211
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,460
That's not true.

212
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,340
-You mean, from the second floor? -Huh?

213
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,300
-Hey, Ryo-san! -What do you mean?

214
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,440
Well, you should try it.

215
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,440
Here I go, Ryo-san!

216
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,080
Okay, I'm coming!

217
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,140
Aim well!

218
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,920
I'm really going to use the eye drops on the second floor.

219
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,500
Yay!

220
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,120
What do you think, Ryo-san? Do you get it?

221
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,100
I'm getting dizzy.

222
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,880
I'm going to use the eye drops on the second floor.

223
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,840
If I use the eye drops on the second floor, it'll help me speed up and it'll be very nice.

224
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,800
-Hey, Ryo-san! -Yes?

225
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,280
The explanation is completely different.

226
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,860
-What? -The eye drops on the second floor are useless,

227
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,600
and they're not effective.

228
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,800
50 steps and 100 steps is a saying that was passed down from China.

229
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,220
People who run 50 steps on the battlefield can laugh at people who run 100 steps.

230
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,960
So there's no big difference between them.

231
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,380
Come on, you're a home teacher.

232
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,140
Okay, I'm going to use the eye drops on the second floor.

233
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,760
Hello?

234
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
Shut up, Reiko!

235
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,700
If you're so logical, you can't get married!

236
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,660
What did you say?

237
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,060
Um, the neighbor called and asked us to take a car that was being illegally parked.

238
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,800
I'm going to ask her to take us there.

239
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,660
Fine.

240
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,060
Okay, Ryo-chan, I'll be right back.

241
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,720
It's not a problem to tell me anything.

242
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,580
Got it, got it.

243
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,160
I'm going to go to work.

244
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,360
Just relax.

245
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,880
You can relax and come back.

246
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,780
Really?

247
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,820
Now, you're all quiet, so don't be so loud.

248
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,260
If you have any questions, just ask.

249
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,580
Okay, Ryo-san.

250
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,420
Hm? What is it?

251
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,060
What's a crane turtle?

252
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,500
What? A crane turtle?

253
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,400
This.

254
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,560
Ah, um, what is it?

255
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,960
There are cranes and turtles.

256
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,320
If you count the number of heads, it's 20 in total.

257
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,280
If you count the number of feet, it's 62.

258
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,060
How many cranes and turtles are there?

259
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,720
Hm, the cranes have two legs and the turtles have four...

260
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,640
Um...

261
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,360
It's a crane turtle!

262
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,760
Help us!

263
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,380
Ah, no, help us!

264
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,240
Hey, Ryo-san, are the cranes caught?

265
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,240
Don't be so loud!

266
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,960
Hey, how are the turtles?

267
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,260
They're fine.

268
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,580
They're fine!

269
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,140
They're fine!

270
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,680
Alright, it's about time.

271
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,340
Don't get so angry.

272
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,700
It's the other way around.

273
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,240
Look, there's a turtle.

274
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,740
Alright, now we finally have a crane turtle.

275
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,480
Hey, hey, hey!

276
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,600
You wouldn't know if you stopped your feet.

277
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,960
Stop that!

278
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,780
Oh, come on!

279
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,380
I don't like cranes.

280
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,640
It's Rika! Rika! Rika!

281
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,340
Rika is my favorite animal!

282
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:14,200
Rika, are you alright?

283
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,060
Even though she's got very soft clothes on,

284
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,860
This is Rika...

285
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,360
The issue with a cranes is that

286
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
you naturally have to use the Concrete and Fertility Law.

287
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,080
A Concrete and Fertility Law

288
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,380
is a theory that the individual that borrows power

289
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,060
is also the one who takes the most of it.

290
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,840
If you inject a amount of air in a bottle filled with water,

291
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,860
and send it all the way out...

292
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,520
Wow!

293
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,000
The compressed air will blow out water,

294
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,300
and the same amount of force will be released

295
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,620
from the plastic bottle, and it will fly.

296
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,540
This is the same principle as the real space rocket.

297
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,780
This is the same principle as the real space rocket.

298
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
Hey, Ryo,

299
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,060
can you make a bigger one?

300
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,480
A bigger one?

301
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,840
Alright!

302
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,880
It's a matter of application.

303
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,660
Alright, it's done.

304
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,480
The drum rocket is ready!

305
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,320
Let's launch it!

306
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,040
Alright, let's go!

307
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,660
Ryo, I'm counting on you!

308
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,600
You coward!

309
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,020
Ryo!

310
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,160
Ryo, are you okay?

311
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,160
I'm fine!

312
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Let's go to the society!

313
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,100
Let's go to the society!

314
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,580
Let's go to the society!

315
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,180
Let's go to the society!

316
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Turn right at the intersection,

317
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,120
and there's a small gate.

318
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,780
I didn't think there was a sign

319
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,400
on the map like this.

320
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,060
A blue mark.

321
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,280
You're acting weird.

322
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,500
The circle is better.

323
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,640
The circle is a district office or a village hospital.

324
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,500
Oh! A ninja mark!

325
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:09,860
Yes!

326
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,340
This is a sign for the Manji Shuriken.

327
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,400
There are also cross-shurikens,

328
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,820
hexagonal shurikens and octagonal shurikens.

329
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,920
You're familiar with them, Ryo.

330
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,700
Of course!

331
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,240
By the way, cross-shurikens can be made with origami.

332
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,220
Really?

333
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,560
Yes!

334
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,400
Cool!

335
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,840
I used to make this and play ninja games.

336
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,960
I used to make this and play ninja games.

337
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,300
Tell me!

338
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,220
Okay, first we make the origami into a tatami mat.

339
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,440
Okay, first we make the origami into a tatami mat.

340
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,780
Keiichi Nakagawa, I'm back.

341
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,160
Reiko Akimoto, I'm back.

342
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,400
Thank you for your hard work.

343
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,040
How are your family?

344
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:57,960
How are your family?

345
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,740
It seems they're doing it quietly.

346
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,600
How are your family?

347
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,420
Are you doing well?

348
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,240
Oh!

349
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,480
Oh, crap!

350
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,900
I'm so sorry!

351
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm so sorry!

352
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,080
I'm so sorry!

353
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,480
I'm so sorry!

354
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,400
What?

355
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,520
I'm so sorry!

356
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,900
I'm so sorry!

357
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,700
I'm so sorry!

358
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,800
I'm so sorry!

359
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,140
I'm so sorry!

360
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm so sorry!

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,880
I'm so sorry!

362
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,520
I'm so sorry!

363
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,700
I'm so sorry!

364
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,220
I'm so sorry!

365
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,020
I'm so sorry!

366
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,840
I'm so sorry!

367
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,380
I'm so sorry!

368
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,360
My oh, my oh, my!

369
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,640
Keeki!

370
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,200
History is simple.

371
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,900
If you memorize everything you can get a point for sure.

372
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,060
Yep.

373
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,140
Umm...

374
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,540
How many years was the Great Age of the Deceased?

375
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,300
What?

376
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,520
The Great Age of the Deceased?

377
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,360
No.

378
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,920
It's the Age of the Deceased.

379
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,460
The Age of the Deceased.

380
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,160
Darn.

381
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,020
It's 645 years.

382
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:20,940
Huh?

383
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,680
If you remember it,

384
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,300
you'll remember it as the Age of the Deceased, the Age of the Deceased.

385
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:25,740
What?

386
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,960
I see.

387
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:26,980
I see.

388
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,300
So you can get a point for every person.

389
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,580
That's how you memorize the Heihoukons.

390
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,180
But...

391
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,260
Suihei, Ribe, Boku no Fune.

392
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,220
That's the original.

393
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,320
Huh?

394
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,700
There are other ones like

395
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,580
Nakuyo, Uguisu, Heiankyo,

396
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,340
Iyoku ni Moeru, Kolombusu.

397
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,060
There are also such things.

398
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,580
Yeah! That's it!

399
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,260
Iyoku ni Moeru, Kolombusu,

400
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,940
Suikin, Chikamoku, Dotten, Kaimei,

401
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,800
Kyojin, Taihou, Tamagoyaki,

402
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,220
Oh, Kaneda, Hirooka.

403
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:55,740
Oh!

404
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,560
Kaneda,

405
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,380
Hirooka,

406
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,380
Nanjatte,

407
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,360
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

408
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,680
What the heck is that?

409
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,060
What are you going to teach your children?

410
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,420
That's what I learned when I was a kid.

411
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,500
If you have any complaints, tell me.

412
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,480
Hey, hey.

413
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,600
That's not enough.

414
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,380
Tell me.

415
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,280
Tell me.

416
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,460
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

417
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,680
You remember that the Age of the Deceased was the Age of the Deceased in 645.

418
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,380
Yeah.

419
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,320
Next is Ono no Imoko.

420
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,540
Oh!

421
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,460
I know that one.

422
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,740
Ono no Imoko is Imoku,

423
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,260
and the word "bu" is a popular one.

424
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,160
I miss it.

425
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
How did you become a Kenzushi after eating a potato?

426
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,420
Kenzushi?

427
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,200
Wasn't Ono no Imoko the only person who ate and yelled at Imoku?

428
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,900
Why is there a name left in history?

429
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,660
Because it was the first time I ate and yelled at Imoku in Japan.

430
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,120
I don't like it anymore!

431
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,400
Oh, I can't stand it anymore.

432
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,160
No, no.

433
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:51,940
Hmm.

434
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,740
Hmm?

435
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:53,920
Hmm?

436
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,640
There was a Kenzushi instead of Kenzushi, right?

437
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,840
There was.

438
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,420
It's about 20 years after Kenzushi.

439
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,540
There was a Kenzushi ship, right?

440
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,800
Yes.

441
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,980
It was a ship used to go to China.

442
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,460
Hmm.

443
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,080
Hmm?

444
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,760
Wasn't that ship shaped like this?

445
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,540
The one that many people love, right?

446
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,600
Wow!

447
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,220
I think it was shaped like that.

448
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,840
You remember it well, Ryo-chan.

449
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,360
Yeah.

450
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,480
I'm starting to remember it.

451
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,680
I remember it well.

452
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,120
I remember that a ship was on a shipwreck, and a shipwreck was on a shipwreck.

453
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,720
I remember that a ship was on a shipwreck, and a shipwreck was on a shipwreck.

454
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,440
Wow, that's cool!

455
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,100
But you remember the small parts of the ship well.

456
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,320
I've been imitating the ship many times.

457
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,160
I'll draw Kanrinmaru, too.

458
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,460
Kanrinmaru is a small wooden ship about 50 meters long and made in the Netherlands.

459
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,280
Wow!

460
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,020
I think it was used as a practice ship for the Navy.

461
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,060
It has five cannons each.

462
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,280
It's detailed.

463
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,860
Someone said it was from America.

464
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,460
Who was it?

465
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,200
It wasn't a shipwreck.

466
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,360
It was a shipwreck, right?

467
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Yeah, that person.

468
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,980
He doesn't have any knowledge of history, but he remembers only the picture of the textbook.

469
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,160
I'll draw a person.

470
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,880
How about Ferry?

471
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,240
Ferry?

472
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,980
Hmm.

473
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,480
I think it was a face like this.

474
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,420
Wow!

475
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,760
Wow!

476
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,740
Yeah!

477
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,800
I think it looks like him.

478
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,600
Why are you drawing it right away?

479
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,480
It was on the textbook, right?

480
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,700
I always drew like this during class.

481
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,620
Hahaha!

482
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,740
Sugita Genpak was also here.

483
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
It's like this when I draw it in Ukiyo-e style.

484
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,960
Wow!

485
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,380
He's good, isn't he?

486
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,380
He was the happiest when he drew the most mischief in his life.

487
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:36,900
Wow!

488
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,840
Hey, Ryo.

489
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,380
Can you draw Minamoto no Yoritomo?

490
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,640
What about Hideyoshi?

491
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,360
Yeah, of course.

492
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,700
Wow!

493
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,480
Hahaha!

494
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,380
I'll draw it.

495
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,920
Hideyoshi is a good guy.

496
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,680
Nobunaga is a good guy.

497
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,660
Francisco Xavier is a good guy.

498
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,620
Wow!

499
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,700
Senior, do you know what kind of person Sugita Genpak is?

500
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,220
Of course, you are.

501
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,000
He is a Rakugo artist.

502
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,900
He drew a famous disassembly new book.

503
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,640
Wow!

504
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,120
Hmm.

505
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,080
I thought he was a Rakugo artist when I saw him in the second grade.

506
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,500
He was a person who drew the Yajikita Dochukyo.

507
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,080
That's Juppenshireik, right?

508
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

509
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,680
I can't believe you're such a good student.

510
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,560
I don't know.

511
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,600
Whatever happens in the exam...

512
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,380
Hm?

513
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,080
Ah!

514
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,640
Don't write it down!

515
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:28,920
Ah!

516
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,360
Ah!

517
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,820
Hahaha!

518
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,780
I see he's good at drawing!

519
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,120
You know what?

520
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,880
Ryo can teach us something boring!

521
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm impressed by myself.

522
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,180
That's all for today.

523
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,640
See you again.

524
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,600
Hey!

525
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,280
Hey, what are you going to do with the radio?

526
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,820
I can't do anything about it.

527
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,620
Geez, there's a limit to your mischief.

528
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,580
Ryo, bring it back.

529
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,040
What, me?

530
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,980
You're still learning to say things like that, right?

531
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,240
Geez, where did they go?

532
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,800
They...

533
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,700
Could it be...

534
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,220
What the hell...

535
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,180
Ryo, are you in trouble?

536
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,960
Hey, shut up!

537
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,260
Hey, I found you!

538
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,200
It's...

539
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,000
Ryo!

540
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,900
You guys, stop it!

541
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,680
You're so out of your mind!

542
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,320
I'm sorry...

543
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,820
Hey, Ryo, look!

544
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,620
You're not getting it!

545
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,880
But look! It's just like your favorite cartoon!

546
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,340
Huh?

547
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,640
Ah, that's...

548
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,000
Hey, aren't you gave a good break, huh?

549
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,300
As I thought.

550
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,320
He is always like that!

551
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,040
Stop it!

552
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,340
You guys, let me go!

553
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,180
Ryo! Don't let him get away!

554
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm going to arrest you, Mamushiro Tatsu!

555
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,560
How did you know?

556
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,520
You're really a troublemaker.

557
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,080
I was just telling them that I was going to do something like this.

558
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,080
You're in a good mood.

559
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,960
I wouldn't say that this test was perfect.

560
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,840
If it was perfect, I wouldn't say it.

561
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,340
You idiot! It's obvious that it was perfect!

562
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,180
Who do you think taught you that?

563
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,780
Ryo!

564
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,740
Look! Look!

565
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,620
You did it! 80 points!

566
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,040
No, 50 points.

567
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,760
What? 30 points isn't enough. Why?

568
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,920
I helped arrest the criminal, so I got it from a good cop.

569
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,980
I'm glad.

570
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,160
Yeah!

571
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,460
I'm glad.

572
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,120
It's true.

573
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,880
In this world, study is not everything.

574
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,840
My practical study is the truth.

575
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,520
Yeah!

576
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,440
For example, my boss came here with a single study, so he became so stubborn.

577
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,820
He doesn't even laugh when he watches TV.

578
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,880
He gets angry.

579
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,220
Hey, Senpai.

580
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,280
It's true.

581
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,760
A coward like him can't be a good cop.

582
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,820
He's just a stubborn old man.

583
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,600
Ryo!

584
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,060
Chief!

585
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,720
Yesterday was a good day.

586
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,040
I'm glad that you helped the citizens and arrested the criminal.

587
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,080
And I'm glad that you erased the draft of the practical study.

588
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,340
You're kidding me, Chief.

589
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,400
They did it on their own.

590
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,880
Don't be so stubborn.

591
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,040
Erase it now!

592
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,880
What are you talking about!?

593
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,160
Be quiet!

594
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,720
Shh~

595
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,260
Shut up!

596
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:12,500
I don't have a choice.

597
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,400
I have my own reasons.

598
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
You're trying to kill me!?

599
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,980
Be quiet!

600
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,020
Just shut up already.

601
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,140
Hey,ATA!

602
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,180
I don't understand.

603
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:25,980
Are you stupid!?

604
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,240
What are you doing here!?

605
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,760
Come back!

606
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,420
Don't come back here!

607
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,560
Don't come back here!

608
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,920
Don't worry about us.

609
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,800
Hey, you are my friend.

610
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,380
You don't understand me.

611
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:35,440
Don't, move your head!

612
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:35,840
You can't do that.

613
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,420
I'm so happy to clean up!

614
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:47,620
You forgot to tell us, but we're going to deduct the money from your salary.

615
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,980
What? No way!

616
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,700
Chief Shion!

617
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,460
Bonus, bonus! I'm so happy!

618
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,160
What? You want me to pay back the debt?

619
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,920
No! This is the money I earned by spilling sweat!

620
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,440
I'm not giving it to anyone!

621
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,620
Next time, "Bonus Battle!"

622
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,540
