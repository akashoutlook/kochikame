"Ah, again this year the summer has come."

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:23,000
"Ah, again this year the summer has come."

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,380
"The weather is getting hot, the water is boiling, the hot weather is swollen."

"Wake Up! The Civilian Police!"

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,880
The

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:37,900
The

34
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:37,940
The

35
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:37,960
The

36
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,880
The

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:40,960
The

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,200

48
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,120
The

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,140
The

50
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,160
The

51
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,120
The number of medals?

52
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,000
No, it's not that.

53
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,560
When it comes to the Olympics, there's always something.

54
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,540
The Olympic temperature?

55
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,240
It was good in the Tokyo Olympics, wasn't it, Minami Haru?

56
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,960
No, it was more impactful.

57
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,080
Ah, the one where a woman smacks her face with powder.

58
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
That's compact.

59
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,160
Hmm, it's coming out to the throat, but I can't remember.

60
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,600
Huh?

61
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,720
Huh?

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,660
That's right, it's a cicada.

63
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,140
It's related to cicadas.

64
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,700
Cicada?

65
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,820
The one crying right now is an oil cicada, right?

66
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,440
It's not an oil cicada.

67
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,960
Then, is it a tickling star?

68
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,460
Huh? It's getting closer.

69
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,160
Was there another one?

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,900
Ah, the one that cries "Kana Kana"?

71
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,440
Huh? Is it an idiotic cicada that can't cry with kanji?

72
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,960
It's not that, it's a sunfish.

73
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:45,900
Huh?

74
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,380
Sunfish?

75
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,120
Yes.

76
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,680
I see.

77
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,000
I forgot about it.

78
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,800
It's impossible.

79
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
It's the same as the Olympics, and it's only once every four years.

80
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,600
It's been four years since then.

81
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,160
What are you talking about?

82
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,960
Other than us, the sunfish is working in this office.

83
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,960
Huh?

84
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,940
I don't know such a person.

85
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,480
Me neither.

86
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,780
I don't know you guys have been working here lately.

87
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,880
I guess so.

88
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,540
I guess he was the last one to go to work.

89
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,520
He was working for the Barcelona Olympics four years ago.

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,000
So, you've been working here for four years now?

91
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,860
I'm just a lazy man.

92
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,280
I started working here about three days a month.

93
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,660
But it's become so much easier for me.

94
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,440
I'm only working here once every four years now.

95
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,680
Once every four years?

96
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,400
Yeah.

97
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,540
That's why it's called the Olympic Man.

98
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,380
I can't believe it.

99
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,120
I can't believe there was a man worse than Ryo-chan.

100
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,820
I can't believe I'm being fired.

101
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,680
The sun life has a special ability.

102
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,700
Special ability?

103
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,600
You'll understand if you bring it to me.

104
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,800
E-Ehh...

105
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,080
I-I'll hold back.

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,360
You're the only one who knows about the sun life.

107
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,340
Go ahead and tell me!

108
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,240
Sorry to keep you waiting.

109
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,120
Ah, yes.

110
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,360
What!?

111
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,560
The sun life has a special ability.

112
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,380
Senpai, you're just going to wake me up,

113
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,780
but why do you need heavy equipment like that?

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,620
You'll understand when you come.

115
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,960
You live in the same dormitory as Senpai?

116
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,880
I feel like this is the room.

117
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,420
Senpai, it's a storage room.

118
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,540
It's not a storage room.

119
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,560
People are living here.

120
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,880
Ah, here it is.

121
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,460
It's rusted.

122
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
Nakagawa, open the door.

123
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,340
Yes.

124
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,040
Move, Nakagawa!

125
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,540
Hey, sun life! Are you there!?

126
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,280
I'm not going anywhere.

127
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,700
I'm not going anywhere.

128
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:50,740
You're not going anywhere.

129
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,140
You've been dead for four years.

130
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,760
You're not going anywhere.

131
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,220
But you can't see anything if it's this dark.

132
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,480
Nakagawa, open the door.

133
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,300
Y-Yes.

134
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,820
Y-Yes.

135
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,120
O-O-Ouch!

136
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,860
A-A-A-A...

137
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,660
A-A-A-A...

138
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,180
My face is sticking to my face!

139
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,100
A-A-A-A...

140
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,280
C'mon, show yourself!

141
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,560
Now what are you waiting for?

142
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,140
How are you going to act before a police officer is here?

143
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,580
A batik coat?

144
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,200
It's so bright!

145
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm gonna have to use the bath...

146
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,320
Oh, I was thinking...

147
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,760
that's why you better do your thing.

148
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,520
Nakagawa, lend him that.

149
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,340
Here you are.

150
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:42,540
I'm glad you're here.

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,980
Every time I wake him up, he's like Dracula.

152
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,300
Is that Ryotsu?

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,980
Yes. I'm here to pick you up.

154
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,220
What? It's still the summer of Heisei 4...

155
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,180
No, I slept a little, so it's not autumn yet?

156
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,940
It's been a long time, and this year is Heisei 8.

157
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,840
You're stupid.

158
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,540
Then what happened to the Japanese Shinto, which was booming after the war?

159
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,260
That's not a big deal anymore.

160
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,880
What?

161
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,120
What?

162
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,460
So what about the

163
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:20,140
Then, isn't the Prime Minister Mr. Miyazawa?

164
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,340
Mr. Miyazawa?

165
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,480
Well, that was four years ago.

166
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,820
While you were asleep, you changed to Hosokawa, Hada, Murayama, and now you're Hashimoto.

167
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,580
Did you really change that much?

168
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,100
The governor is also Yukio Aoshima.

169
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,580
I'm Yukio Hiroshima

170
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,140
You can't win me

171
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,360
The Osaka governor is going to say that Yokoyama is a nock

172
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,720
Wow, I understand

173
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,380
Really? What happened to Wakahana and Takahana?

174
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,940
Wakano and Takano were renamed

175
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,300
Oni-chan became Ozeki and the younger brother became Yokozuna

176
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,060
The world has changed so much

177
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
It's like Urashima Taro

178
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:02,720
That's right

179
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,440
Ryo-tsu, who is that young man?

180
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,540
Nakagawa, who became the head of the escape room this year

181
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,120
Anyway, don't sleep and wake up

182
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
Don't say that

183
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,300
I know you'll be mad

184
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,360
First, I'll get a hang of it

185
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,900
I can't do it, I can't do it

186
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,100
Please wake me up

187
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,420
It's broken

188
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,460
This is

189
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,920
I can't get it

190
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,840
I bought it when I went to sleep

191
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,380
Buns and bread are no good

192
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,460
It's red

193
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,100
What about the milk?

194
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,800
No good

195
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,060
It's heavy

196
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,620
What?

197
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,460
It might be cheese

198
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,680
This is okay

199
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,320
You

200
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,720
It's okay

201
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,800
I don't need Mom

202
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,180
Then watch the TV until the end

203
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,040
I'll be making a break

204
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,480
See you

205
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,740
It's good to watch while sleeping.

206
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,920
Next, let's go to the bathroom.

207
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,520
I'm sorry, but I'll take you to the bathroom next time.

208
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,460
Where is the bathroom in this room?

209
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,900
Is the washing machine the bathroom?

210
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,580
You put on your sheets and pillowcase.

211
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,800
I'll wash them with you.

212
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll wash them with you.

213
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,040
And turn the water bottle upside down.

214
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,960
This is the best.

215
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,520
It feels good.

216
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,160
It's a great place to be.

217
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,080
Change into this.

218
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,040
I'm sorry, but please open it.

219
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,060
It's a time-consuming thing.

220
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:01,940
Shut up.

221
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,780
Are you okay?

222
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,760
Yes.

223
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,700
But I'm not feeling well.

224
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,340
I might not be able to sleep.

225
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,760
You're too sleepy.

226
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,160
Am I?

227
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,980
This way.

228
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,440
I'm sorry.

229
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,300
Are you okay?

230
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,020
When did you make the stairs here?

231
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,820
They are old.

232
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,700
Did you forget about them?

233
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,000
Come to think of it, I fell on them four years ago.

234
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,060
Yes, I fell on them eight, 12 years ago.

235
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,420
It's after all.

236
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,700
Hey, don't tell me you came here and walked for 15 minutes.

237
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,180
It's boring.

238
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,340
Let's go by my car.

239
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,640
Did you have a car?

240
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,100
A new car!

241
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,000
It's a new car!

242
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,600
It's a new car!

243
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,440
I bought it 20 years ago.

244
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,580
I've only ridden it twice, so it's a new car.

245
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,980
You can take a taxi twice in 20 years.

246
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,380
It's a pain in the ass to pick it up.

247
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:29,580
You can take a taxi twice in 20 years.

248
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,460
It's a pain in the ass to pick it up.

249
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,840
It's a pain in the ass to pick it up.

250
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,740
I've never been out of town.

251
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,280
I've never been out of town.

252
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,760
I'm going to go.

253
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,040
I'm going to go.

254
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,260
I'm going to go.

255
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,260
Step on the clutch and put the shift lever in the row.

256
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:46,660
Step on the clutch and put the shift lever in the row.

257
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,100
That's right.

258
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,540
The clutch...

259
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,860
The clutch is like a new car.

260
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,960
Turn it down in 3 seconds and you'll be in town.

261
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,840
Turn it down in 3 seconds and you'll be in town.

262
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,020
It's amazing.

263
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,780
But I woke up.

264
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,720
But I woke up.

265
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,360
But I woke up.

266
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,680
But I woke up.

267
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,800
I brought you here.

268
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,620
Thank you.

269
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,720
It's been a while since I walked, so I'm tired.

270
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,600
I'll go to bed.

271
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,860
You're still a big boy.

272
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,240
You're still the same as you were four years ago.

273
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,820
You're really taking care of me.

274
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:30,920
It's him!

275
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,320
Hey, wake up, Higurashi!

276
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,460
Yes, yes, I'm awake.

277
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,900
Say hello to the chief!

278
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,020
Chief, it's been a long time.

279
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,480
Are you still the chief?

280
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,780
Thank you for your help.

281
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,040
I'm a monk who was dismissed three years ago.

282
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,340
Hello, I'm Higurashi.

283
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,020
Y-yoroshiku.

284
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,160
I'm a fan of Mr. Miyazawa Risa.

285
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,320
The other day, I bought a popular photo book called "Yontafu"

286
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,440
and I want to see it with you.

287
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,160
Oh, yes.

288
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,100
I don't like people who talk about such a photo book.

289
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,060
Next is...

290
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,320
I'm home!

291
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,820
Hey, Reiko, I'll introduce you to someone.

292
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,320
Oh, this is the rumored...

293
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:27,320
Hello, I'm Higurashi.

294
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,260
I'm a monk.

295
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,080
I'm Soun Higurashi.

296
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,320
Yoroshiku.

297
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,200
I'm Reiko Akimoto.

298
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,320
Higurashi has finally woken up.

299
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,540
You're weak like a woman.

300
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,280
I can feel it!

301
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,020
What is this?

302
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,720
The incident is calling me!

303
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,060
W-what happened?

304
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,860
Higurashi finally got a real record.

305
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,200
Hidari!

306
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,780
Bring me the unsolved case file!

307
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,140
Okay!

308
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,500
Yes, sir!

309
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,880
The first one is an unknown man.

310
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,960
I see him.

311
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,480
He works in a construction site in Yamagata City in the Northeast.

312
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,260
Terai, write to the headquarters immediately!

313
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,680
Yes, sir!

314
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,600
This is Higurashi, the first officer of Kameari Park.

315
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,840
He woke up!

316
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,020
He woke up!

317
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,960
The second one is a jewel thief.

318
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,140
The culprit is hiding in a house in Sumida River.

319
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,360
The Yamanawa team is taking a detour to the apartment on the other side.

320
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,200
The Kekkon Sagi team is taking a detour to Kaminari-mode in Asakusa.

321
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,220
That's amazing.

322
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,600
They have a lot of investment.

323
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,600
Higurashi solves unsolved cases like this every time he wakes up.

324
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,060
Next!

325
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,140
Next!

326
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,020
Next!

327
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:56,980
Next!

328
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,020
Next!

329
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,060
Next!

330
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,300
I'm tired and sleepy.

331
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,160
Idiot!

332
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,540
You haven't worked for four years!

333
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,900
Reiko, rub my shoulder.

334
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,680
What?

335
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,100
Thank you for your hard work.

336
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,280
Higurashi has a great ability.

337
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,840
OK.

338
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,220
It's a camera.

339
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,340
OK.

340
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,840
Here.

341
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,840
OK.

342
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,980
Here.

343
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,740
See?

344
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,500
What are you doing?

345
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,660
A light shade.

346
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,340
Now Higurashi can record an incident that happens within 24 hours.

347
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,100
You can do that?

348
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,240
Yes!

349
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,100
Yes!

350
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,860
Yes!

351
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,840
Yes!

352
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:46,920
Yes!

353
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,400
Yes!

354
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,200
Yes!

355
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,980
Yes!

356
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,720
Yes!

357
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,500
Yes!

358
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,020
Yes!

359
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,700
Yes!

360
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,160
Yes!

361
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,380
What's that?

362
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,600
It's the underwear thief!

363
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,300
There's been a lot of damage to the ship lately.

364
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,100
But we don't know who the culprit is in this photo.

365
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,880
It's pretty cool that he's hiding in the shadows.

366
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,040
Well then, let's see it in this photo!

367
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,240
Four in a row! That's amazing!

368
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,580
I'm getting more and more good at this.

369
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,620
Huh? What's that? It's a dog!

370
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,520
It's a dog that barks a lot while patrolling.

371
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,180
Alright, let's go!

372
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,000
Okay!

373
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,620
This house...

374
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,820
What's this?

375
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
This is the house that delivers the most underwear theft.

376
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,940
It's called "Toudai Motokurashi".

377
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,840
This house is full of Amura's nasty women.

378
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,320
Amura? What's that?

379
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Amura is a fashion icon of top idol Amuro Nanai.

380
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,140
Wh-What?

381
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,320
Isn't the top idol Ms. Miyazawa Risa?

382
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,840
Risa has lost weight and is currently on a diet.

383
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,880
N-No way...

384
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,440
Don't get depressed, Higurashi.

385
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,140
I'm not.

386
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,360
Let's go!

387
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,420
Why is Taku-chan the culprit?

388
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,540
You can't arrest a culprit, so you're just making excuses.

389
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,800
What?

390
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,460
Wh-What is this?

391
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,860
Higurashi has a motor power.

392
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:52,900
He has a motor power.

393
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,360
This is the secret to their power.

394
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,280
That underwear is stolen!

395
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,220
No way...

396
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,700
Higurashi, you did it!

397
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,260
I can still feel it!

398
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,300
Nakagawa, the camera!

399
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,280
Okay!

400
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,500
So it's a bank robbery this time.

401
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,580
I remember this bank. It's right in front of the station.

402
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,840
Look, the clock is on.

403
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,880
It's 3:05.

404
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,440
We only have 10 minutes left.

405
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,420
Okay, Reiko. We'll head straight to the bank.

406
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,980
You take care of this.

407
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,760
Roger.

408
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,660
Hurry, Nakagawa!

409
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,340
Yes, sir!

410
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,020
The next day

411
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,240
Everybody, raise your hands!

412
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,440
Give me the money!

413
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,400
Welcome!

414
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,580
It's a gorilla!

415
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,420
What's a gorilla?

416
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,660
You bastard!

417
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,200
Hey!

418
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,560
You're in my way!

419
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,240
I'll kill you!

420
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,160
What?

421
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,080
Now!

422
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,700
Damn it!

423
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,400
Put your hands on the table!

424
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,380
Hey, Higurashi! Put your hands on the table!

425
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,300
You're sleeping, you bastard!

426
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,640
You all did well.

427
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,600
But Higurashi has a really great ability.

428
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,920
I don't know why he can't get a job.

429
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,460
What's wrong with Higurashi?

430
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,860
Huh? He's been here before.

431
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,660
I'm tired. I can't take it anymore.

432
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,680
If you don't like the race, just keep the main race.

433
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,820
I don't care how many cars you get, just let me drive.

434
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,340
What are you doing?

435
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,720
Sir!

436
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,600
Higurashi is trying to solve another case.

437
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,860
Is there one or two cars?

438
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,280
Did you hear?

439
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,140
Huh?

440
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,600
Boom!

441
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,380
Wow. I feel it. I feel it.

442
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,540
Which car is it?

443
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,400
Which one? Which one?

444
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,620
I can't believe it!

445
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,400
I knew you were going to use a race car.

446
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:39,780
What?

447
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,560
What?

448
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,620
Oh!

449
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:48,740
What?

450
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,160
I-I'm being pulled into the truck!

451
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,060
Yeah, that's definitely Ryotsu.

452
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,120
That's a bad photo.

453
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,480
Hey, Higurashi! Why would you take a photo like that?

454
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,930
I don't know. I just took it.

455
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,920
It's not a quick death. It might save you from a traffic jam.

456
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,420
I'm not a follower! I'm not going to be pulled into the truck!

457
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,220
Ryotsu, don't worry. There's a mistake.

458
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,740
I'm perfect and confident, but I'm not worth a billion dollars.

459
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,320
Are you encouraging me? Are you bragging? I don't believe you!

460
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,000
You're blushing while saying that.

461
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,160
I'm not joking!

462
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,320
Senior, I'm outside as long as I can see the photo.

463
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,340
I'm safe if I don't go out for 24 hours.

464
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,720
Shut up! You're scared of the police?

465
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,580
I don't believe you!

466
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,640
I don't believe you!

467
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,700
Hey, Senior!

468
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,480
Don't do that, Ryo!

469
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,040
Shut up! I don't care!

470
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,720
I told you to stay out!

471
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,320
I'm not going out!

472
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,300
Hey, Senior!

473
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,040
Ryo!

474
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,520
Are you okay, Senior?

475
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,440
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

476
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,580
So this photo is the moment you hit the truck you're in.

477
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,580
Hey, Higurashi!

478
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,260
You should sleep for a million years!

479
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
Don't wake up!

480
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,500
I'll do that.

481
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,740
But before that, Chief...

482
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,040
Oh, the usual ceremony.

483
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:32,260
Reigo, 10 Tendon, 10 Una-don, 20 Yakiniku, and 10 Sushi, please.

484
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,820
What?

485
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,340
Why don't you...

486
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,160
Ah, I forgot to tell you guys.

487
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,040
topics.

488
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,860
We have two projects taking place.

489
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,080
The first is to go on the road,

490
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,540
and the second is to go to town.

491
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,140
I see.

492
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,180
There have been issues in many places.

493
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,200
They want to see you,

494
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,140
but we aren't very welcome.

495
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,280
I see.

496
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,100
Oh, I see.

497
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,360
Then,

498
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,160
We're going to the Olympics.

499
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,960
I can't believe you're this fat.

500
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,280
You're like a different person.

501
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,360
Then, I'll see you in four years.

502
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,640
Shut up! Go home and sleep.

503
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,040
Well, then...

504
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
I'll see you tomorrow.

505
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,300
Good night.

506
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,680
Next time we meet, it'll be the 2000th year of his life.

507
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,560
The next Olympics are waiting for us.

508
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:39,760
Good night.

509
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,820
Don't be silly.

510
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,600
Go to sleep with us.

511
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,340
You can say that.

512
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:05,300
Do you know Kachidoki Bridge?

513
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,100
When a big ship comes,

514
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,660
the bridge is split in two.

515
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,640
The bridge goes up a little.

516
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,040
Unfortunately, it's not open now.

517
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,920
But this Kachidoki Bridge

518
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,140
has a nostalgic memory of my childhood.

519
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,380
Next time, open Kachidoki Bridge.

520
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,520
Thank you.

521
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,440
Let's smile anytime

522
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,140
Even if something ridiculous happens

523
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,420
Please smile cutely

524
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:49,440
You can go out with a face that doesn't matter

525
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,040
Please smile

526
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,080
You're not bad

527
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,960
Please smile

528
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,860
With the same mood as before

529
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,060
Yeah

530
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,340
Always smile

531
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,220
The woman who has a deep heart

532
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,240
is not beautiful

533
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,900
You should smile right away

534
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,080
If you're not a child

535
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,360
You're not a child

536
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,000
You always had to smile

537
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,060
Even if you are a child

538
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,840
You still have to smile

539
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:39,860
Don't cry

540
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:39,920
Don't cry

541
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,720
Don't cry

542
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,140
Don't cry

543
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,840
Don't cry

544
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,040
