There's a strong market for the oil market.

That's it.

President.

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,420
I want to ask you any questions.

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,300
Sidonie in 10 minutes?

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,540
OK, I'll finish my lunch in 5 minutes.

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,660
Get ready.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes sir!

36
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,220
It hurts!

37
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,160
Boss! What's wrong?

38
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,620
Boss!

39
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,360
Boss! Boss!

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:13,980
What?

41
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,160
Nakagawa is under emergency?

42
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,660
Is that true?

43
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,480
Yes, it's true.

44
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,780
I was eating lunch earlier...

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,960
The latest news has just arrived.

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,660
The world's most famous concert singer,

47
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,160
Nakagawa Group's music director,

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,440
Mr. Nakagawa Keiichi,

49
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,300
suffered from a serious injury

50
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,880
during his flight to Japan today,

51
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,380
and is currently under emergency surgery.

52
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,240
What?

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,400
Nakagawa?

54
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,780
That's what I'm saying.

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,940
He's on the Internet too.

56
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,640
He's been around the world for a long time.

57
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,060
He's been on the Internet for a long time.

58
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,740
That's bad.

59
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,940
Let's go to the hospital now.

60
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,780
Is this the hospital?

61
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,000
It looks like it's Nakagawa Group's hospital.

62
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,800
Yahoo!

63
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,380
What?

64
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:18,740
Yahoo!

65
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,140
Hello…

66
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,720
Excuse me,

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,160
is this the Nakagawa International Hospital?

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,900
That's right.

69
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,340
It seems like Keiichi Nakagawa

70
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,620
is admitted here.

71
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,320
Yes,

72
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,940
it's Mr. Keiichi

73
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,540
who's been admitted to an emergency hospital.

74
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,860
Emergency hospital?

75
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,440
It's a hospital with a medical staff.

76
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,240
What? A hospital with a medical staff?

77
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,440
It's not like

78
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,080
everyone came to visit,

79
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:45,800
was it?

80
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,560
But since we've come here,

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,700
let's have a look at Keiichi's face.

82
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,360
Let's take a look.

83
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,060
So, where's the hospital?

84
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,960
It's on the top floor of that building.

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,220
So this was the hospital after all.

86
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,980
Doctor Mahi Mahi.

87
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,680
It's time for the surgery.

88
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,100
Oh, right.

89
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,700
I'll take the longboard.

90
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,900
This one?

91
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,720
See you later.

92
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,120
Aloha.

93
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,200
Looks like that person was a doctor.

94
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,380
What kind of hospital is this?

95
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,880
Anyway, let's go in.

96
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,180
Thank you for waiting.

97
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,180
I have the permission to meet Mr. Nakagawa Keiichi.

98
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,920
Well, this is the entrance.

99
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,020
What is this place?

100
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,620
This floor is a waterway.

101
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,560
Please proceed by boat.

102
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,360
Yes, sir.

103
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,140
Thank you for waiting.

104
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,200
I'm not here to play.

105
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,700
I just want to meet Mr. Nakagawa.

106
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,600
I understand.

107
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,480
The back of the jungle is the elevator to the special hospital.

108
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,060
All right, get in.

109
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,500
It's like a prince going to save his wife.

110
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,060
Yes.

111
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,280
Hi, everyone.

112
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,340
Did you all get in?

113
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,880
Yes.

114
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,180
Welcome to the jungle boat.

115
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,500
I'm the captain, Donald Cook.

116
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,580
Applause.

117
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,620
Don't be a coward.

118
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,620
Go on.

119
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,340
You're a bad customer.

120
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,540
Let's go.

121
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:37,640
We're finally here.

122
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,280
Yes.

123
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,460
Well, let's go in that door.

124
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's go inside the door.

125
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,500
Yes.

126
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,560
Ah, I made a mistake.

127
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,520
It was a elephant apartment.

128
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,040
This time, Mr. --

129
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,480
This time, it was a elephant apartment.

130
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,640
This time, it was a elephant apartment.

131
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:53,820
This time, I'm coming.

132
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,620
Why are there snakes in the jungle?

133
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,100
This time, it's a backdraft.

134
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,300
What kind of attraction is this?

135
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,040
Just hurry up and take me to the inn!

136
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,500
Understood!

137
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,760
But there are still a lot of bad customers.

138
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,180
The back of this temple is the special room.

139
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,160
It's like a movie temple I saw somewhere.

140
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,380
Where is this place?

141
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,540
It's a hospital.

142
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,300
Are we really going to arrive?

143
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,640
There it is!

144
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,320
Please come in.

145
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,320
Oh, you're finally here!

146
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,180
Ah, hello.

147
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,520
You look much better than I thought.

148
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,020
How are you doing, sensei?

149
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,080
I'm doing well, and I'll be able to leave in a week.

150
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,460
That's good. I was really worried about you.

151
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,060
I'm sorry. I couldn't get in touch with you.

152
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,640
It's nothing.

153
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,480
I'm sorry. I couldn't get in touch with you.

154
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,260
It's nothing. I couldn't get in touch with you.

155
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,620
Are you okay, Kei?

156
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,980
I just had surgery.

157
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

158
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,140
Where should I put your nose?

159
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,280
Let's get the TV out of the way.

160
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,440
Are you okay?

161
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,600
When I smile, my wounds hurt.

162
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,460
Please be careful.

163
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,580
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,800
You're so...

165
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,720
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

166
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,280
I've polished this floor too much!

167
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,060
Nakagawa, does laughing hurt that much?

168
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
Say it, Ryōtsu.

169
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,920
Ah, sorry, sorry.

170
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

171
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,720
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

172
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,280
By the way, Nakagawa,

173
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,000
By the way, Nakagawa,

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,720
why is this hospital

175
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:00,980
why is this hospital

176
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,660
like an amusement park?

177
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,680
I don't know.

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,460
I wanted to make the image of the hospital

179
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,160
like a bright place.

180
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,960
I see.

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,400
I wanted to make the image of the hospital

182
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,140
But when I become a patient,

183
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,360
I don't know because I'm in the hospital.

184
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,280
I don't know because I'm in the hospital.

185
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,000
You found out after you were hospitalized?

186
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,500
You're an idiot, Kaichou!

187
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,700
You're an idiot, Kaichou!

188
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,820
You're an idiot, Kaichou!

189
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,040
Ah, I can't do it!

190
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

191
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,820
You're so...

192
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,060
If you keep it up,

193
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,240
I don't know what Ryōtsu will do.

194
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,440
I don't know what Ryōtsu will do.

195
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,320
He looks fine.

196
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,160
I'll pull him up soon.

197
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,500
He looks fine.

198
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,580
That sounds better.

199
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:31,960
That sounds better.

200
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,680
Well then, Nakagawa-kun, take care of him.

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,960
Thank you very much.

202
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,540
Well then...

203
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
You idiot!

204
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,780
Oh, Ryō-chan.

205
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,720
I came to see you.

206
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,060
Nakagawa-shi, who was hospitalized

207
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,600
at the emergency hospital,

208
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,800
was discharged yesterday safely.

209
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,160
He's still basking in blood.

210
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
You're write that off the news, aren't you?

211
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,260
It was in the CMM news all over the world.

212
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,660
It was in the CMM news all over the world.

213
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:08,720
It was in the CMM news all over the world.

214
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:08,740
In that case,

215
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,440
Nakagawa will fall into a grave disaster.

216
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,580
It will be a huge disaster for Nakagawa.

217
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,160
Even if he falls down,

218
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,240
the whole world will panic.

219
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,880
As you thought,

220
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,600
because of your fart earlier,

221
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,640
the global economy

222
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,140
was in aっていう.

223
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,020
You think so?

224
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,120
This time,

225
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,600
when Kei-chan was hospitalized,

226
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,320
the Japanese stock prices

227
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,180
dropped tremendously.

228
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,520
Are you serious?

229
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,780
I'm sure it's true.

230
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,000
"Nakagawa-san, congratulations on becoming a doctor!"

231
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,940
"Thank you."

232
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,300
"Congratulations!"

233
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,680
"Congratulations!"

234
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,980
"You're very popular."

235
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,060
"You have a huge influence in the society."

236
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,740
"If I got hospitalized, it would have a huge influence on the society."

237
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,680
"I think your case is probably..."

238
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,600
"Did you decide on lunch?"

239
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,260
"I think it's udon."

240
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,980
"Yeah, udon is fine."

241
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,760
"Oh no!"

242
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,040
"My senior has been hospitalized!"

243
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:07,840
"What?"

244
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,120
"Then, I'll order lunch."

245
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,060
"I think soba is better."

246
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,900
"Me too."

247
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,840
"No..."

248
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,380
"It has a 2 second effect."

249
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,620
"That's terrible!"

250
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320
"Hey, Nakagawa, don't laugh!"

251
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:29,760
"What?"

252
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,460
"I'm sorry."

253
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,360
"Captain, please don't make me laugh."

254
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,900
"If I laugh, my wound will still hurt."

255
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,880
"I'm sorry."

256
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,780
"You're the only one who cries."

257
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,520
"You're my best friend."

258
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,500
"You're too nice, Captain, and Kei-chan is too funny."

259
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,460
"No, no."

260
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,700
"We're the same person, so why are we so different?"

261
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,940
"I'm really frustrated."

262
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,180
"Senpai."

263
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,060
"Human beings live simply."

264
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
"Rather than being number 1 like me."

265
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,620
"We envy people like senpai and senpai only likeisa."

266
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,020
"The only one we respect!"

267
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,200
"Honest."

268
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,720
"Hey, listen"

269
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,560
"Don't smile so it doesn't hurt you!"

270
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,200
"What?"

271
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,080
"You said you're from a high position!"

272
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,160
"It doesn't mean there's other high positions!"

273
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,780
"What?"

274
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,840
"High position?"

275
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,320
It's a very high position!

276
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,840
Poor Senpai!

277
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,760
It's a very low position! Poor Senpai!

278
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,660
Let's fix it!

279
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,340
You said a lot.

280
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,020
Ryo-chan, you're pretty twisted.

281
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,340
Because I'm a small man.

282
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,240
Oh no...

283
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,600
It's true that fixing Senpai's mood like this is more difficult than fixing Japan's economy.

284
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,480
Senpai is the only one among the only ones.

285
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,400
Senpai has a unique face.

286
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,040
And his actions are beyond the police.

287
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,540
And his actions are beyond the police.

288
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,620
Nakagawa's face is drawn to his face.

289
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,660
Nakagawa's face is drawn to his face.

290
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,860
If you make him laugh, he'll be the best in the world.

291
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,180
Ah!

292
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,820
Senpai was also the number one in that sense.

293
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,140
Senpai was also the number one in that sense.

294
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,800
Kei-chan, you haven't become a follow.

295
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,480
Kei-chan, you haven't become a follow.

296
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,600
You're getting worse, Ryo-chan.

297
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,200
I know.

298
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,460
What are you talking about?

299
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,020
I'm just kidding, Nakagawa.

300
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,020
I'm just kidding, Nakagawa.

301
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,500
Were you surprised?

302
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,220
Stop it already, Senpai.

303
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,820
You're not the only one who is unhappy about this.

304
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:33,880
You're not the only one who is unhappy about this.

305
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,220
I thought it was strange.

306
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,900
It's just a little bit of a prank.

307
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,980
Then don't hit me that hard.

308
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,240
Sorry.

309
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,240
Sorry.

310
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,400
If you're the best in the world,

311
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
I'll make you laugh like this.

312
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,300
I'll make you laugh like this.

313
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,980
I'll make it hurt.

314
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:52,600
Here I go!

315
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,160
Ryujin...

316
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,720
P-Yanjun...

317
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,920
You're so similar!

318
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,220
Oh, yeah!

319
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,400
Speaking of P...

320
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,620
This is...

321
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,740
This is...

322
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,360
This is...

323
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,400
A little...

324
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,640
A little too old?

325
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,760
Okay, next.

326
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,400
This...

327
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,040
This...

328
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,480
This...

329
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,600
This is...

330
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,880
Oh, this is a little similar.

331
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,340
What's with that face?

332
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,120
Oh, really?

333
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,340
Do you know who this is?

334
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,500
You know, right?

335
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,680
No, not me.

336
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,940
Why...

337
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,580
Senpai, do you think I don't have to go to work?

338
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,100
What are you talking about?

339
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:49,720
I'm not going to work.

340
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,000
You're working for me, too.

341
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,280
I'm just not on time.

342
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,360
The lottery is already on its way.

343
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,120
What?

344
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,760
Oh, no!

345
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,420
Who is the loser?

346
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,500
Aya...

347
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,880
Aya...

348
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:05,940
Aya...

349
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,500
Aya...

350
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,560
Aya...

351
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:09,640
Aya...

352
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,040
Aya...

353
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,220
Aya...

354
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,340
Aya...

355
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,180
Aya...

356
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,980
Aya...

357
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,180
*Refreshing sound*

358
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,960
*Clearing throat*

359
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,140
*Sneeze*

360
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,440
*Clears throat*

361
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,040
*Clears throat*

362
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,060
What?! Nobody's here.

363
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,660
I was in a hurry.

364
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh! Lucky!

365
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,340
This is a sports drink.

366
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,700
I don't know who this is, but it's my treat!

367
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,280
*Clears throat*

368
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,840
*Clears throat*

369
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,060
*Clears throat*

370
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,480
So, what was this about?

371
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,560
Well, well, well.

372
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,900
I'll make you laugh.

373
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,420
Well, that's not what I meant.

374
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,460
Oh!

375
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,700
It's a medicine!

376
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,640
Senpai, did you drink it?

377
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,720
Huh? A medicine?

378
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,480
It's a medicine that took months to develop.

379
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,400
Why would you do this?

380
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,320
Shut up, you guys!

381
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,340
If it's such an important medicine,

382
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,520
don't put it in a plastic bottle!

383
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,740
It's disgusting!

384
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,080
It's the same as putting soba soup in a coke bottle

385
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,500
and making a mistake.

386
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,400
*Clearing throat*

387
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,200
*Clears throat*

388
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,160
Why would you put soba soup in a coke bottle?

389
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,660
I've never put it in a bottle.

390
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,800
Oh, well.

391
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,980
This is why it's so expensive.

392
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,840
Well, that's fine.

393
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,800
I was going to ask Gorilla-kun to drink it anyway.

394
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,140
Huh?

395
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,040
You're trying to experiment with me again?

396
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:25,760
Huh?

397
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,840
What kind of medicine did I take?

398
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,420
Well, soon you'll have a high effect.

399
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,740
What?

400
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,600
The principal...

401
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,640
The principal!

402
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,240
*Clears throat*

403
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,900
*Clears throat*

404
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,240
*Clears throat*

405
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,860
You're so annoying.

406
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,100
Why are you so weird?

407
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,060
You're like a big dog.

408
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,240
Next.

409
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,640
*Clears throat*

410
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,320
Stay there.

411
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,320
Stay there.

412
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,000
*Clears throat*

413
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,260
*Clears throat*

414
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,460
My stomach hurts!

415
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,000
I can imagine the effect of medicine.

416
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,340
You can't help but laugh.

417
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,700
Hey, professor!

418
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,020
What kind of medicine is it?

419
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,260
He's laughing as he gets angry.

420
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,040
Shut up!

421
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,780
I'm angry, but I'll laugh at you.

422
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,880
I'll teach you.

423
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,320
Hurry up!

424
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,660
*Leaves*

425
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,920
*Bark bark*

426
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,400
*Bark bark*

427
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:11,840
*Bark bark*

428
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,800
He's laughing numerous times.

429
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:22,200
It's very painful.

430
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,980
Look.

431
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,100
The dog is laughing.

432
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,280
The dog is laughing.

433
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,360
It's like an appropriate scene.

434
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,940
What are you laughing for?

435
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,320
Ryo-chan drank the relaxation pills that Professor Ezaki invented.

436
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,000
Relaxation pills?

437
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,740
It's a kind of laughing medicine.

438
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,340
That's right!

439
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,680
On the laughing side, it's...

440
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,940
It's here!

441
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,180
That's right! That's right! That's right!

442
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,500
By laughing, humans can release beta-endorphin from the brain and relax.

443
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,680
It's too much! Stop it already!

444
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,920
You drank too much.

445
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,040
It's not. It's actually 3 milliliters.

446
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,500
What did you say?

447
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,340
When are you going to stop?

448
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,220
You're going to stop soon.

449
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,040
It's about the scooter.

450
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,420
Scooter?

451
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,900
The guy who told me about the trouble.

452
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,680
Ryo-chan, I'll do it.

453
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,620
It's okay. I can do it.

454
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,300
I heard that the scooter was found.

455
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,100
I heard that it was broken...

456
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,240
I wonder if there's a scar.

457
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,460
Wait.

458
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,740
Like being captured by the bandit, the parts are missing and...

459
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,340
It's almost a waste of eunuchs.

460
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,400
You don't have to say that.

461
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,820
Geus, you'll return to Rei-kyon.

462
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,740
Sure.

463
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,320
It's your fault, so you were replaced.

464
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,160
No.

465
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,340
No, it's not!

466
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,280
What?

467
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
What are you talking about?

468
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,720
Don't eat me, you bastard!

469
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,880
I got you!

470
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,180
My abs are cramped! Help me!

471
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,880
The culprit will definitely be caught.

472
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,760
What kind of escape room is this?

473
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,300
The medicine is good enough.

474
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,240
It's not the time to take a note.

475
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,960
You'll really die.

476
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,240
You'll die.

477
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,060
I'll pay for it!

478
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,280
Give it to me!

479
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,120
Ryo!

480
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,360
What are you doing?

481
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,920
Could it be...

482
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,360
It's a relaxation medicine.

483
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,940
It works so fast.

484
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,820
I'm sure it'll work faster if we go to the hospital.

485
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,780
Stop taking notes!

486
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,200
Professor, you're not related to science.

487
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,720
I'm sad that I'm a little late.

488
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,960
Senpai...

489
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,940
What?

490
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,880
The futon flew away.

491
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,480
The futon flew away?

492
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,720
It hurts!

493
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,340
It hurts!

494
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,820
I'll be punished for this!

495
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,200
Not only does he laugh, but he also does simple jokes.

496
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,480
It's a side effect.

497
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,240
I can't take it anymore, Kid!

498
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,740
That's enough, Reiko.

499
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,260
If we start laughing, we're done with sadness.

500
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,860
Let's break up, for example!

501
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,800
Well, I'll give it a try.

502
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,700
Are we done?

503
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,000
What is it, Reiko?

504
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,660
What do you dislike about me?

505
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,940
What do you mean?

506
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,000
My chin, my mouth, my nose, my eyes, my eyebrows, my hairstyle...

507
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,680
Oh, really?

508
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:49,940
I knew it!

509
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,180
Well, see you later!

510
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,520
Hello, this is the park exit.

511
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,480
A gold mine!

512
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,280
Sorry, but it's not that weird.

513
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,840
I understand.

514
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,740
Hey, everyone!

515
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,240
The gold mine is filled with robbers and they're hiding in there!

516
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,580
I'm going to go right now!

517
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,680
The next day

518
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,460
You're late for the support.

519
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,420
I wonder what everyone's doing.

520
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,100
Wait, come here!

521
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,400
Leave the rest to us.

522
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,180
And the culprit is...

523
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,960
I'm inside.

524
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,420
Why are you all laughing?

525
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,760
I don't care about that.

526
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,860
Then, should I bow to the culprit's face?

527
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,520
What the hell are you doing?

528
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,500
What the hell are you doing?

529
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
He's like a picture of the culprit.

530
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,800
He's just as I imagined.

531
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,020
I'm not going to laugh.

532
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,820
I'll laugh and shoot!

533
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,300
That's a toy pistol.

534
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,180
What?

535
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:19,980
What?

536
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,460
You're a real culprit, aren't you?

537
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,380
Now I know.

538
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,080
Now, go outside!

539
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,240
A real one is a moped!

540
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,180
Oh, my God!

541
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,380
You can't say that!

542
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,200
Moped!

543
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,620
A trumpet!

544
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,860
Oh, my God!

545
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,720
Mr. Nakagawa!

546
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
He's a bit shy.

547
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,100
He brought his own little tool and said a joke.

548
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,700
What the hell is wrong with you guys!

549
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,780
Come on!

550
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,540
I'm not stupid!

551
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,660
I'm a good guy!

552
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,100
I'm a good guy!

553
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,440
What the hell is wrong with you guys!

554
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,140
Oh no!

555
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,580
I'm an idiot killer!

556
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,520
Help me!

557
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,400
I'm an idiot killer!

558
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,160
Oh no!

559
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,780
Ohara-kun, you're really something.

560
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
You're definitely a police officer.

561
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,740
A police officer?

562
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,820
Is that a good thing?

563
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,800
Don't say such a thing in front of the chief.

564
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,380
I don't have to write much anyway.

565
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,100
I'm sorry for being cheap.

566
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,820
I'm just kidding.

567
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,060
What's wrong with you guys?

568
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,400
The chief just flew away.

569
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,220
You idiot!

570
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,580
What's wrong with Ohara-kun?

571
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,940
I'm going to make you all the worst!

572
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,180
I won't let you do that.

573
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:15,400
Why do I have to be kicked out like this?

574
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,940
I don't want to be kicked out.

575
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,060
If we're all together, it won't be lonely.

576
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,800
The effect of the medicine will last for more than a week.

577
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,520
Don't always take the data.

578
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,220
Stop it!

579
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,680
Thank you for your hard work.

580
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,020
Thank you for your hard work.

581
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,340
Thank you for your hard work.

582
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,380
Thank you for your hard work.

583
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,320
Thank you for your hard work.

584
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,860
Thank you for your hard work.

585
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,540
You two.

586
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,920
Thank you for your hard work.

587
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,720
It's my fault.

588
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,360
Don't be like this doubtful.

589
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:02,700
Watch your own business.

590
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,460
Without thinking about it,

591
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:04,920
we didn't have any other way out.

592
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,680
You also didn't know about the poison.

593
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:06,980
You also weren't Estonia.

594
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,040
We'll be off tomorrow.

595
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,080
We'll be off tomorrow.

596
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,820
Bye.

597
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,380
I haven't done it for a long time.

598
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,060
What?

599
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,960
I haven't done it for a long time, either.
