2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:17,540
I look up at the sunset floating in the river

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,860
If I kick the love stone, it flies to my shoes

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:32,540
I wonder if I should go to the gym that I used to do

5
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,160
I was laughed at as a child

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,640
Even if I try to cheer up, I can't win

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape that doesn't change even one yawn is strangely gentle

8
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,380
From the water tank in Tongari City

9
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,980
The sunset falls to Taishakuten

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,360
Tomorrow is already over like this

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,520
I lost my happiness because of the Katsushika Shiba

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,080
I realized it

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,000
Because I'm an idiot

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,460
Koukon Gamer Sakonji

15
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,560
Next!

16
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,080
He's the one who's the boss, Sakonji Tatsunosuke.

17
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:51,440
Next! He's the one who's the boss, Sakonji Tatsunosuke.

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,600
Not only Judo but Karate, Aikido, and Taekwondo

19
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,060
He's the boss, Sakonji Tatsunosuke.

20
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,220
He's the boss, Sakonji Tatsunosuke.

21
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,740
He's the demon of martial arts.

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,320
The demon of martial arts.

23
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:00,920
The demon of martial arts.

24
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,400
Hey, Ryotsu, I'm here.

25
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:03,680
Hey, Ryotsu, I'm here.

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,020
It's almost time for the match between the chief and the opponent.

27
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,820
You have to train them well today.

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,440
Thank you!

29
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,900
Um, please say hello.

30
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,760
What's that greeting?

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,340
It's not that a man greets you.

32
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,980
A man's greeting is short and simple.

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,540
A man's greeting is short and simple.

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,700
A man's greeting is short and simple.

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:23,840
A man's greeting is short and simple.

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,680
Help me, Senpai!

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,280
It's going to take a long time.

38
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,580
Don't shout!

39
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,600
Don't shout!

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,700
I'm going on a date.

41
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,920
I don't care.

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,360
Dating is a gold medal.

43
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,000
Why don't you go on a date?

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,340
Dating?

45
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,220
Who said I was on a date?

46
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,620
You!

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,900
Do you think you can be strong by going through so much pain?

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,480
No!

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,540
What happened?

50
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,060
I hate girls with thorns!

51
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,840
You bastard!

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,060
I'm not going to teach you how to take a hold on me!

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm not going to teach you how to take a hold on me!

54
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,040
This is it for today!

55
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,940
Thank you!

56
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,780
Hey, Jonji.

57
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,140
I have the videos you asked me to do.

58
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,900
Oh, I see.

59
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,700
How about one more round later in my room?

60
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:14,900
Alright!

61
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,720
How about you guys too?

62
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,000
What?

63
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,580
- No, I mean, I'm... - D...

64
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,680
D... It's all right!

65
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,940
- A game? - No, it's just a fighting game.

66
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,980
But...

67
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,280
- A game? - No, it's just a fighting game.

68
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:56,860
- A game? - No, it's just a fighting game.

69
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,780
K.O.!

70
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,340
All right!

71
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
The protein after cooking is really tasty.

72
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,720
Protein?

73
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,620
How about you? You're getting muscles.

74
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,420
No, I'm fine.

75
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,600
Oh, right. Want to watch the video?

76
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,720
Yeah.

77
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,760
Video?

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,220
I took a video of Kenshin III.

79
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,960
It's hard to get into the right timing.

80
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,860
Tatsunosuke?

81
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,380
What was that voice?

82
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,860
Oh, no! I got the wrong tape!

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,440
Good morning, Tatsunosuke.

84
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,980
This is the behind-the-scenes story of the Doki Doki Memorial that Honda asked me to do.

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,420
Oh, it's Saori!

86
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,680
Doki Doki Memorial?

87
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,020
It's a love simulation game.

88
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:53,020
The player goes to a high school called Kirakira Academy and spends three years of student life there.

89
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:00,400
And on the graduation day, under the legendary cherry tree, the heroine Saori receives a love confession from her.

90
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,480
Want to try it? There's a software.

91
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,100
Me?

92
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,700
No way. But why my name?

93
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,660
This game is a game where you enter your name and birthday first, and the girl who comes out calls the player's name in voice.

94
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,380
This is a game where you enter your name and birthday first, and the girl who comes out calls the player's name in voice.

95
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,080
I just entered your name. I thought the player's name might change the parameters.

96
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,520
It's not a joke.

97
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,860
Tatsunosuke, are you going home now?

98
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,160
Eh? But this voice and this face...

99
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,660
They look alike.

100
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,860
Ah, Tatsunosuke-kun.

101
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:56,680
Ah, Tatsunosuke-kun.

102
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,960
When I play this game, I remember the first time I fell in love with a girl.

103
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,560
Sakonji-san, you have a memory of your first love, right?

104
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,120
No, no, no, not at all!

105
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,000
First love is...

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,540
I-I get it, I get it!

107
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,260
But I didn't know you were this good. You've only played fighting games.

108
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,420
I'm surprised. The great thing about this game is that when you get close to me, you call me by my nickname.

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,520
What!?

110
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,180
Tatsu-chan.

111
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,020
What, do you want to try?

112
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,480
Don't be stupid! Why do I have to do this?

113
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,240
A fighting game. I'm a man among men.

114
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,600
I'm not going to do it!

115
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,000
Then give it back to me.

116
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,780
My-my brother wanted to do it.

117
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,120
Your brother? Did you have a brother?

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,840
It's your first time hearing it.

119
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,760
I did!

120
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,420
Before I die from a disease that I can't even handle, I wanted to play Doki Doki Memorial!

121
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,500
Why!?

122
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,880
He's not into it.

123
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,720
Eh? Sakonji-san?

124
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,280
He's more into the game than the guy who looks like he's not interested in girls.

125
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,200
Sakonji-san is more into the game than the guy who looks like he's not interested in girls.

126
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,460
Sakonji-san is more into the game than the guy who looks like he's not interested in girls.

127
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,080
You're gone.

128
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,760
That's good. No one's looking.

129
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,400
Well...

130
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,580
What should I call you? Saori-chan?

131
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,180
Doki Doki Memorial.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,040
Please tell me your name.

133
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:36,580
Name?

134
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,100
My last name is Sakonji.

135
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,880
My name is Tatsumosake.

136
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,400
My last name is Tatsumosake.

137
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,780
My last name is Tatsumosake.

138
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,480
Game start!

139
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,740
Game start!

140
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:49,960
Game start!

141
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,180
Game start!

142
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,500
Game start!

143
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,080
Good morning, Tatsumosake-kun.

144
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,600
Today is the start of your high school life.

145
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,320
What?

146
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,240
What?

147
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,820
This is so interesting!

148
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,000
Hm?

149
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,620
I see. So you first decide your schedule.

150
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,540
That means you need to improve yourself.

151
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,800
The charm of a man!

152
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,300
That's a body that's been torn out!

153
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
First, you don't need to work every morning.

154
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,220
Club activities are a hero to all sportsmen.

155
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,180
When it's time to go to school, go to the gym and train your body to wipe out air!

156
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,280
Finally we can call it a graduation ceremony.

157
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,600
One year...

158
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,940
But three years...

159
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm doing exercise with my core.

160
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,620
Now I can feel Saori's love for me.

161
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,440
You better die!!!

162
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,640
There's a letter in the desk?

163
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,740
It says "I'll be waiting for you under the cherry tree on the 3rd floor on the right side of the strait."

164
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,120
C-can this be?!

165
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,380
Dacchan... I was simply talking about you...

166
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,420
E-E-E-E-!

167
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,860
Yes! stickers! You can go under the cherry tree!

168
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,640
There's a Gou under the tree!

169
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,640
Tat-chan, please call me Aniki from now on.

170
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,020
Please call me Aniki from now on.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,480
Huh? I hear a strange voice from Sakonji's room.

172
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,960
That's right.

173
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,260
I can't stand the noise because my room is close.

174
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,280
It's a nuisance for the neighbors.

175
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,820
Please say something, Ryo.

176
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,900
Okay, okay.

177
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,260
What's wrong, Saori?

178
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,420
I'm sorry. I have something else to do that day.

179
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,360
I'll see you later.

180
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,580
I'm sorry. I have something else to do that day.

181
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,340
Saori, you're...

182
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,900
I've been on a date with her for 10 times!

183
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,860
Please say something!

184
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,020
Please say something!

185
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,180
Sakonji, it's Ryo!

186
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,260
Huh?

187
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,080
I can't watch TV.

188
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,280
I'm stupid.

189
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Hey, open the door!

190
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,240
Ryo, what's going on?

191
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,700
You must be playing games again.

192
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,300
I can hear your whining.

193
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,360
Is that so?

194
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,740
I'm sure it's Kenshin 3.

195
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm into it lately.

196
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,400
I'll be fine.

197
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,200
I don't know what you're playing, but please don't be so noisy.

198
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,900
I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

199
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,860
By the way, have you been on a date with Saori?

200
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,820
What do you mean?

201
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,720
"Doki Doki Memorial"!

202
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,240
Oh, I see.

203
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,920
I'm not interested in the game, so I totally forgot.

204
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,580
You shouted "Saori" just now.

205
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,440
What are you talking about?

206
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,980
Actually, she hasn't come back from her brother yet.

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,360
I'll return it to you as soon as she comes back.

208
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:58,820
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,240
I didn't do anything wrong.

210
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,120
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,440
"Doki Doki Memorial" is a video game.

212
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,140
When you go to the sea with Saori,

213
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,260
Saori will drown.

214
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,020
And you can do artificial breathing.

215
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,760
Artificial breathing!

216
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,720
When you go to the haunted house at the amusement park,

217
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,740
there are many other events, such as hugging each other,

218
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,000
or watching a movie in the fields,

219
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,640
and so on.

220
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,460
This is the real Ryo-etsu!

221
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:23,920
Hey!

222
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,300
Hey! Why are you getting so excited?

223
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,660
I-I was just thinking that my brother would be happy if I taught him.

224
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,600
Anyway, just do it quietly.

225
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,540
Yeah.

226
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,420
B-By the way, what do you do when Saori doesn't really want to go out with you?

227
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,040
No, my brother was talking about that earlier.

228
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,060
First, invite him to a park nearby.

229
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,680
He'll definitely refuse.

230
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,200
A park nearby? Okay!

231
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,540
Oh!

232
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,740
A park nearby, a park nearby...

233
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,780
Okay.

234
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,320
A park nearby?

235
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,640
Yeah, that's fine.

236
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,640
Yeah, that's fine.

237
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,500
Yeah, that's fine.

238
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,980
I did it!

239
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,080
I did it! I did it!

240
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,780
I did it!

241
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,340
Senpai, you're more noisy than before.

242
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,860
I didn't want to teach you.

243
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,800
But you'll never forget to comfort me!

244
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,080
But you're more noisy than before.

245
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,040
But you're more noisy than before.

246
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,960
You're so noisy, right?

247
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,340
But you're so noisy, right?

248
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,540
You're so noisy, right?

249
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:38,760
You're so noisy, right?

250
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,740
Yeah, you are!

251
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,000
You're so noisy, even if you were a little bit normally.

252
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm really surprised!

253
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,900
Well, so that's it for today.

254
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,920
But it's hard to say that you have to study even if you know it's a game.

255
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,840
What?

256
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,020
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,900
What's with this girl?

258
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,500
Sakonji, you're Tatsunosuke, right? My name is Asahina Miki.

259
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,640
If you don't mind, would you like to come home with me?

260
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,600
She's pretty cute.

261
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,740
No, I'm Saori Hitosuji.

262
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
I don't have time to be involved with other girls.

263
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,660
Sakonji's room

264
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,040
Sakonji's room, okay?

265
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,060
Hey.

266
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,920
Ryo, what am I supposed to do?

267
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,140
Sakonji, what's the matter?

268
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,400
Saori suddenly got cold.

269
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,760
I get cut off when I call, and I get ignored in the hallway.

270
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,540
Why can't I understand what to say?

271
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,420
Ryo...

272
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,180
Stop playing games and go to bed!

273
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,740
I'm not sleeping.

274
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,720
I'm not sleeping.

275
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm not sleeping.

276
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,140
I'm not sleeping.

277
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,400
I'm not sleeping.

278
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,340
I'm not sleeping.

279
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:13,680
I'm not sleeping.

280
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,280
I'm not sleeping.

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,800
Stop it!

282
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,320
I'm not sleeping!

283
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,380
Ryo, please, stop it!

284
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,260
Is this the party report about your brother?

285
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,920
My brother just called me, and if I don't talk to him, he'll kill himself.

286
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,240
I'll let you know when it's tomorrow!

287
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,500
Please let me sleep!

288
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,120
So you give up?

289
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,540
Please, Ryo!

290
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,760
Ryotsu!

291
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,360
Even if Saori is the real one, you can't be too cold to other girls!

292
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,260
Why not?

293
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,160
If you're too cold to other girls, you will make Saori even worse!

294
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,300
Is that so?

295
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,680
You have to be nice to other girls too.

296
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,940
Then the bad rumors will disappear naturally and Saori's mood will be better.

297
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,640
I see. Thank you, Ryotsu! I'm sure my brother will be happy!

298
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,280
What?

299
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,540
Ryotsu!

300
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,940
What are you doing this time?

301
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,560
It's Saori.

302
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,680
Tatsunosuke, are you coming back?

303
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,580
Yes!

304
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,260
Saori's mood has been fixed!

305
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Hey, Tatsunosuke.

306
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,060
Tatsunosuke.

307
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,460
Tatsunosuke.

308
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,740
Tatsunosuke.

309
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,140
Tatsunosuke.

310
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,440
Tatsunosuke.

311
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,680
Tatsunosuke.

312
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,080
Tatsunosuke.

313
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,340
Finally, you're calling me by my nickname!

314
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,420
Tatsunosuke, Tatsunosuke, call me more!

315
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,420
The message continues.

316
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,820
Tatsunosuke, are you free this Sunday?

317
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,260
Yes.

318
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,620
Well, do you wanna go somewhere with me?

319
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,880
What?

320
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,020
W-We might be invited to a date!

321
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,040
Oh no!

322
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,540
He invited me to a date!

323
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,700
Saori invited me to a date!

324
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,260
Of course, I'm okay!

325
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,780
I won't include you ahh.

326
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,400
Hey, Saori!

327
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,140
I'm gonna fight with you.

328
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,640
Oh Papa!

329
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,960
Saori, look at those surprised eyes!

330
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,800
You're the one who's trying toité!

331
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,680
I'm the one who you're trying toité!

332
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,100
It's not funny!

333
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,660
The next day

334
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,680
Hey, Saori-chan, sorry to keep you waiting.

335
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,380
Ah...

336
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,880
You came dressed like that?

337
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,700
Is something wrong?

338
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,740
You have a bad sense of humor.

339
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,160
"I thought I was a man in a man's form."

340
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,900
I thought I was a man in a man's form.

341
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,940
The next day

342
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,180
Go, go, go! There!

343
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,260
Yes!

344
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,540
I did it!

345
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,500
It was a wonderful game, Saori-chan.

346
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,480
I'm not good at this kind of thing.

347
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,860
Oh, my God.

348
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,200
Did Saori hate judo?

349
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,440
My throat is dry.

350
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,540
Then...

351
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,940
This protein juice...

352
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,440
I'm going home.

353
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,900
Wait for me, Saori-chan.

354
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,520
Wait for me!

355
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,480
I hate you, Tat-chan.

356
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:06,700
Yeah!

357
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,940
What?

358
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:17,840
Why did you do that?

359
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,900
I can't do it.

360
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,360
I've never actually dated anyone.

361
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I don't know what to do.

362
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,800
Oh, right.

363
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,000
This is Ryotsuni.

364
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,000
Wait.

365
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,580
Wait, if it's about a date, it's better than a ryo-tsu.

366
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,460
That's right, it's that guy!

367
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,200
Who's calling at this hour?

368
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,340
Yes.

369
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,360
Sakonji Tatsunosuke speaking.

370
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,040
Eh, Sakonji-san?

371
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,640
Huh? Is this how you go on a date?

372
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,220
Alright! I did it!

373
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,040
It sure is a noisy room.

374
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,640
Sakonji Tatsunosuke speaking.

375
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,240
Hey, old lady.

376
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,640
You always work hard.

377
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,980
Eh, are you Sakonji-san?

378
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,700
That's right. The door key's not working properly.

379
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,600
I-Is that so? I'll take a look.

380
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,360
Well, what's going on?

381
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,240
What's wrong, you two?

382
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,600
I've been calling Sakonji-san for days in the middle of the night.

383
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,000
I can't sleep.

384
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,540
You've been calling me for an hour now.

385
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,000
I can't sleep at all, either.

386
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,860
I can't sleep at all, either.

387
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,160
Here's your coffee for you.

388
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,840
Thank you.

389
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,500
Thank you.

390
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,920
Sakonji-san, do you really have any memories of your first love?

391
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,940
I do.

392
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,740
This is the best way to do it.

393
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,240
He had his first love when he was four.

394
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,820
I see.

395
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,360
I see.

396
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,840
I see.

397
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,280
Sakonji-san.

398
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,320
Yeah.

399
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,500
You're going to love her.

400
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,860
It's really beautiful.

401
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,900
And you're going to try to calm him down, right?

402
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,200
And he'll probably never like it.

403
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,700
So, you two not only like each other,

404
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,860
You sure are.

405
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,980
Then,

406
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,280
He won the finals smoothly.

407
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,680
And the final opponent is...

408
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,400
Ippon!

409
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,440
And he was too shocked.

410
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,120
He forgot to go to the bathroom and wanted to compete.

411
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,040
Hajime!

412
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,920
Ippon!

413
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,480
I did it!

414
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,280
I'm sorry.

415
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,580
Sakonji's first love is over.

416
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,480
Poor thing.

417
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,320
After that, Sakonji turned his back on girls...

418
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,180
...and started to live like a fighter.

419
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,200
That's right.

420
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,660
But you didn't get thrown off by a girl from a game, did you?

421
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,400
That's right.

422
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,880
Isn't it a good opportunity to get rid of a fighter?

423
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,900
A girl from a game?

424
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,920
Get thrown off...

425
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,260
...and get thrown off by a girl from a game.

426
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,800
It's finally here.

427
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,240
I'm waiting for you under the cherry tree on the third floor of the main hall.

428
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,660
They're finally here!

429
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,800
What's wrong, senpai?

430
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,900
There's a hidden event at the Doki-Memo!

431
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,980
What?

432
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,600
Eh?!

433
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,800
Tachan! I've been waiting!

434
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,300
S-Saori...

435
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,720
I've always...

436
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,460
...been after you...

437
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,980
When it comes to the final confession...

438
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,180
...it's terrifying when you choose the option...

439
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,520
...to choose "I've chosen too!"

440
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,740
Actually, I've also...

441
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,680
What?

442
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,980
I know. Let's fight!

443
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,100
Stop!

444
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,480
I don't want to fight you!

445
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,500
Takumi!

446
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,120
I hate weak people. Goodbye!

447
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
Too late.

448
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,440
You're a woman!

449
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,600
You're a woman!

450
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,720
Please forgive me!

451
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,820
You've gotten worse. You hate women.

452
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,740
Our second love ended the same way.

453
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,860
Horororororori!

454
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,060
You really got in the way of my business, Chief!

455
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,440
And even the President!

456
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,700
I'll repay you ten times, no, a hundred times!

457
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,680
You two, be prepared!

458
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,060
Next time, "Ogeretsu Shashin Panic!"

459
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,740
Thank you!

460
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,720
Chiharu

461
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,660
There's a rumor that you can't fall in love.

462
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,940
I have so many things I want to do.

463
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:49,440
I want to run through the desert with a motorcycle.

464
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,060
I want to run on the track

465
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,800
I want to be free more than a bird

466
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,200
The speed of the full-scale train

467
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,920
Changes the lady's dream

468
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,680
Love heart

469
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,500
Sorry, wait

470
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,280
The future of the panorama

471
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,180
The dazzling time

472
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,560
You understand, right?

473
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,260
Sorry, wait
