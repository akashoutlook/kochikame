1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,880
"The Valentine's Day"

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,540
Ryo, it's almost Valentine's Day.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,900
Huh? What do you mean?

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,060
That's a ridiculous custom made by a guy from a candy shop to sell chocolates.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,980
Oh, right. It was a day that had nothing to do with Ryo-san.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,700
I want chocolates, too!

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,080
Somebody, give me some!

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,120
"The Valentine's Day"

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,400
When you watch TV, make your room bright and look away!

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,500
Come to me, you poor thing!

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,060
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,720
Look at the blue sky.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
The white clouds.

14
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,260
It'll be all right eventually.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:24,220
Come to me, you jobless guy!

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,480
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

17
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,620
Come to me, you poor thing!

18
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,100
Look at the red clouds.

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,060
The red clouds.

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,680
It'll be all right eventually.

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,540
You got it, right?

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,460
I got it! I got it!

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,660
If you got it, just keep quiet and come to me!

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,940
"The Valentine's Day"

25
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,080
"The Valentine's Day"

26
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,840
You're fast.

27
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,700
You're already 21st century.

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,680
What's wrong?

29
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,560
When I was a kid, in the 21st century, I thought all cars were driving in the tube.

30
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,620
I've seen it, too.

31
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,020
I never imagined it'd happen.

32
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:31,940
"The Valentine's Day"

33
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,960
But, in reality, cars are still rolling on the ground and driving on the same road as pedestrians.

34
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,400
"The Valentine's Day"

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
This is the reason why accidents happen.

36
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,960
I wonder if only cars will never happen in the future.

37
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,860
I hope no accidents happen.

38
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,840
"The Valentine's Day"

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,740
Senpai, I found a bicycle that's not likely to have any accidents.

40
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,900
I found a bike that's not likely to fall.

41
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,460
What?

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,200
A large back mirror that can be seen to the far rear.

43
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,900
The direction that is not likely to be seen.

44
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,220
A protective ring for anti-bombing.

45
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,660
Furthermore, a protector is also worn.

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,600
If you do that much, it doesn't seem dangerous.

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,400
I feel like I saw that bike somewhere.

48
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:21,940
Really?

49
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,460
I feel like it's sealed with a memory I don't want to remember.

50
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,020
I'll go.

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,540
I'm worried.

52
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,100
I'll put it on.

53
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,540
I'm home.

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,680
It looks like a child in this house.

55
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,640
Ishiatama Tetsuiwa.

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:47,900
No.

57
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,420
It's Tetsuo Ishizu.

58
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,180
This is the house of Chief Ishizu.

59
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,400
Ishiatama Tetsuo Ishizu is a policeman who belongs to the Kathushika City Transportation Department.

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,300
He is usually quiet, but when it comes to traffic safety,

61
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,780
Traffic Safety Demon

62
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,640
Ishiatama Tetsuo Ishizu привез 7段交通安全指導士班

63
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:18,680
Ishiatama Tetsuo Ishizu

64
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,480
The Traffic Safety Demon has returned.

65
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,540
I was taught traffic safety before, and I had a rough time.

66
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,400
Oh, that Isshizu-buchou?

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,420
I thought I saw him somewhere on the bike earlier.

68
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,340
He looks exactly like Isshizu-buchou's White Horse.

69
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,260
What do you want from my son?

70
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,360
The White Horse of Yankee!

71
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,020
The Jutsu of Hata-tsukumi!

72
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,800
Oh, it's you.

73
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm sorry. I thought you were a nuisance for being told that you were being stalked by a strange man.

74
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,540
Ippou Tsuko, you should come and apologize.

75
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,700
Yes, sir!

76
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,080
Ippou Tsuko?

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,500
Ippou Tsuko? You mean...

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,660
That girl's name?

80
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,200
Yes. We have six sons.

81
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,520
The eldest son is right-handed, the second son is left-handed, and the third son is straight-handed.

82
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Ippou Tsuko.

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,680
The second son is straight-handed.

84
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,100
Ippou Tsuko, you have an interesting name.

85
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,460
My name is Ippou Tsuko.

86
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,040
Don't you know?

87
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,500
My name is Ippou Tsuko.

88
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,280
Ippou Tsuko.

89
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,880
You could call me Ippou Tsuko.

90
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,740
Ippou Tsuko.

91
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,280
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:45,500
Ippou Tsuko-kun.

93
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,460
My name is Ippou Tsuko.

94
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,140
Is it exclusive to the market?

95
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,800
Hmph!

96
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,560
Sorry to keep you waiting.

97
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,540
You really do change a lot.

98
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,680
What's that?

99
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,860
It's the flashlight that was on the armor's head.

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,760
Is it really that important?

101
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,680
It was the one who gave me the opportunity to take the road to traffic safety.

102
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,520
What?

103
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,940
It's embarrassing to say this, but I used to be the leader of the Thunder Tribe.

104
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
The Thunder Tribe?

105
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,940
Yeah, the old rebel tribe.

106
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,880
It was the Black Meteor Tribe.

107
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,480
Hmph! That sounds pretty bad.

108
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,360
I've committed a number of traffic violations.

109
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,300
But I was confident that I wouldn't cause an accident.

110
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,040
I was confident in my technique.

111
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,500
However, one day...

112
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:56,640
...I was hit by a car.

113
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,660
The car that was chasing us had an accident.

114
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,420
The car that was chasing us had an accident.

115
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,880
The car that was chasing us had an accident.

116
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,140
It was the old rebel who had been trying to make us stronger.

117
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,180
Old man!

118
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,260
Isshisu...

119
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,700
Traffic violations are forbidden.

120
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,300
Sir, even if you're fine, you're annoying everyone around you.

121
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,600
I understand. I understand so don't talk to me anymore.

122
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,940
Traffic violations will never be allowed...

123
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,680
Never ever! I swear on this flashlight!

124
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,480
Old man...

125
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,500
Old man!

126
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,040
And then I became a police officer.

127
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,980
On behalf of my old man, I took away traffic violations from this world.

128
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,340
You were following in his footsteps.

129
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,780
Could it be that it was just a flashlight?

130
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,080
You mean you're an atlantic?

131
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,000
No, I'm still a little over 90 years old.

132
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,320
Oh my.

133
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,880
But my friends didn't keep quiet.

134
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,680
Especially the sub-leader, Watanuki.

135
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,360
After that, he was always following me around.

136
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,940
What are you doing now?

137
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,540
Well, one day, Sakai disappeared and went abroad.

138
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,000
He went abroad, but...

139
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,980
Hmm?

140
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,300
It seems like his eldest son has returned.

141
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,620
This engine is a Porsche.

142
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,120
It doesn't look like it.

143
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,680
I like the professional stubbornness of Porsche.

144
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,320
Huh? This house didn't have a garage, did it?

145
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,620
Are you going to park on the street?

146
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,360
Haha, there's no way I'd do that.

147
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,940
Sigh...

148
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,700
It stopped.

149
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:34,960
Dad!

150
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,040
Dad!

151
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm home.

152
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,960
Dad! I'm home.

153
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,740
Welcome home.

154
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,260
Why did you come out of the garage?

155
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,200
That's my garage.

156
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,980
There's no parking lot nearby.

157
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,120
What a safe device.

158
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm glad you came, so I'll give it to you.

159
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,660
Please wait a moment.

160
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,820
Could it be...

161
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,580
It's called a "running car".

162
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,940
It's called a "running car".

163
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:04,960
Yes.

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,640
Well then.

165
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,500
In 1935, road safety driving, 7th class 작.

166
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,000
The Asahina-sensei R bicycle.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,540
Ishizutetsu has passed.

168
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,660
The appearance was..

169
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,360
I'll give him a car.

170
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,900
You'll wait for me outside.

171
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,860
Yes.

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,420
There seems to be nothing at the entrance...

173
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,660
How are you going to certificate.

174
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,040
Hmm?

175
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,720
Hey! What's that?

176
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,500
Hey! It's dangerous if I stand in front of the garage!

177
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,680
Which is more dangerous? This is the rubber part. It's like a wall.

178
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,920
It's dangerous if I stand in front of the garage!

179
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,060
Put on a 32-point seatbelt properly.

180
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,140
This is troublesome.

181
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,100
It's comfortable to ride.

182
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,980
But what is that board under the accelerator?

183
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,660
It is equipped with a stopper so that the speed does not exceed 50 km / h.

184
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,300
It's dangerous.

185
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,800
What happened suddenly?

186
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,160
The traffic light is not visible in the outskirts.

187
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,620
Certainly.

188
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,020
Where are you going?

189
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,680
Wait a minute.

190
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,680
I know the outskirts.

191
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,040
It is a traffic safety driving market 7.

192
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,380
In recent times, there are many places where traffic lights are in the way.

193
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,560
It's okay to increase the green, but it is also necessary to be careful about traffic safety.

194
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,820
Certainly.

195
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,920
What is it this time?

196
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,440
The pedestrian crossing is on the way.

197
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,200
Is this what you do every time you get in a car?

198
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,520
I have to do it when I notice it.

199
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,600
If an accident happens without doing it, I will regret it.

200
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,420
That's right.

201
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,560
Accident?

202
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,080
This intersection is a blood vessel intersection where accidents have been happening since before.

203
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,720
I'm giving my opinion, but it's not being improved.

204
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,240
I will organize traffic, so please contact me.

205
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,700
I understand.

206
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,160
Senior.

207
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,200
Thank you.

208
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,960
Fortunately, the injury is not a big deal.

209
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:30,900
I see.

210
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,460
That's good.

211
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,840
You're still alive.

212
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,640
Shizu.

213
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,640
Then I will go to patrol.

214
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,300
Thank you for your hard work.

215
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,940
This car.

216
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:58,960
First of all, don't run away.

217
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,840
Stop!

218
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,020
I can't stop.

219
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,560
I can't stop.

220
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,320
What is that mark?

221
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,100
I can't stop.

222
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,580
Watanuki.

223
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,620
Watanuki!

224
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,000
Watanuki!

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,200
Watanuki!

226
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,240
Watanuki!

227
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,300
Watanuki!

228
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,960
Watanuki!

229
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,280
Watanuki!

230
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,460
Watanuki!

231
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,220
Looks like you didn't get hurt, my old friend of the Black Meteor.

232
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,700
You survived?

233
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,760
I went back to Japan after a while.

234
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:29,840
To take revenge on you, the traitor.

235
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,000
What are you doing?

236
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,140
You can't break my black magic!

237
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,720
I don't care.

238
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,480
What?

239
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,200
Do you think I don't know your weakness?

240
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Weakness?

241
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,580
I know.

242
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,220
I know that you swore to destroy the traffic law on that Patroid.

243
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:52,820
What?

244
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,560
That means...

245
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,380
What are you doing?

246
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,160
I'm losing my strength.

247
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,460
Just as I thought.

248
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,320
I'll get him.

249
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,140
From now on, I'll break the traffic law!

250
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,620
Break it!

251
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,440
Break it!

252
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,120
I'll beat him to death!

253
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,840
What is it?

254
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,520
The Patroid of Captain Hizubu was stolen?

255
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,200
That Patroid of the roadside?

256
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,840
Does the culprit know about it?

257
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,100
No.

258
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,100
Yes. He's a friend of the old motorbike, Watanuki-san.

259
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,780
Oh, he's the one who came to talk about Chief Ishizu.

260
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,880
He was a sub-leader of Black Meteor.

261
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,660
And Chief Ishizu?

262
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,140
He lost his motivation completely.

263
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,200
He's been like that since then.

264
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,420
Even my mood changed.

265
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,600
It was a big shock.

266
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,140
I'll cheer him up a little bit.

267
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,580
Hello, Chief Ishizu.

268
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,140
Chief Ishizu!

269
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
Oh, it's you.

270
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,060
Oh, please be strong.

271
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,660
You were stolen the Patronite.

272
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,660
I told you, didn't I?

273
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,180
That was a promise Patronite.

274
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,620
Now that it's gone, I'm out of energy and everything.

275
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,780
Huh? Then who's going to be the traffic safety instructor from now on?

276
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,500
I'll leave it to you young people.

277
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,340
I'm retiring.

278
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,820
Chief Ishizu!

279
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,780
What? An accident?

280
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,140
What's going on?

281
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,180
That's the Patronite of Chief Ishizu who got stolen!

282
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,500
Hey, get up!

283
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,600
Don't think you can get away with a big Honda!

284
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,760
Don't think you can escape!

285
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,820
You're just a salesman, but you're not a big guy!

286
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,280
What did you say?

287
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,780
You're not a big guy, you're a killer!

288
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,200
Stop!

289
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,020
It's a quiz. The blue signal is "proceed", and the red signal is...

290
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,420
Stop! Stop!

291
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,000
It's my fault for ignoring that!

292
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,260
Damn it...

293
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,860
Wait, Chief Ishizu!

294
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,700
The culprit knows!

295
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,100
Let's go get Watanuki together!

296
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,500
Let's go, Chief Ishizu!

297
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,320
Chief Ishizu!

298
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,720
I'm so done...

299
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,480
I'm not old enough to get into it yet.

300
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,140
That's right...

301
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,600
I'm serious! You're the one who can't get a hold of me!

302
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,020
No way! His motorcycle skills are amazing!

303
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,200
The only person who can compete with him is Chief Ishizu when he's serious!

304
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,020
That Chief Ishizu is considering retiring...

305
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,720
We have no choice but to keep him in check.

306
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,500
We have no choice but to keep him in check.

307
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,860
I'm gonna beat you up tonight.

308
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,360
Move it!

309
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,980
I can't be tied to a traffic light!

310
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,120
We found Watanuki! We're going after him!

311
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,760
We're going after him!

312
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,140
A black meteor appears!

313
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,180
A black meteor appears!

314
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,760
Alright, we're coming!

315
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,340
Alright, we're coming!

316
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,540
It looks like there's a lot of cars going into the car tonight.

317
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,860
It's probably a black meteor.

318
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,280
It's the one who stole my dad's light bulb.

319
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,040
I can't park!

320
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,140
Daddy, aren't you going out?

321
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,780
Don't you want to go to the police station?

322
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,340
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

323
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,460
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

324
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:01,740
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

325
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,160
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

326
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,200
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

327
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,780
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

328
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,460
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

329
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,160
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

330
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,700
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

331
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,660
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

332
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,520
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

333
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,060
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

334
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:28,200
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who go crazy on you.

335
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,280
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

336
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,420
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

337
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,760
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

338
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:41,940
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

339
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,020
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

340
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,220
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

341
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,780
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

342
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,700
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

343
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,020
You're supposed to catch the bad guys who break the traffic laws.

344
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,480
*Screams*

345
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,080
Wasanuki!

346
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,080
Are you happy that you got your friend back?

347
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,560
*Screams*

348
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,420
*Screams*

349
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,760
*Screams*

350
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,860
*Cries*

351
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,300
*Screams*

352
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,000
*Screams*

353
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,680
W-what is this...

354
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
*Screams*

355
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:22,000
*Sounds of pain*

356
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,560
Are you hurt?

357
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,980
I'm fine.

358
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm glad.

359
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,740
Chief Ishizumi! Why are you so quiet?

360
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,480
But...

361
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,320
If we don't have that flashlight...

362
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,600
Even if we don't have it, we can't make a traffic violation!

363
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,940
Dad, this is it.

364
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,580
This is...

365
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,700
I made this because I was so lonely after the flashlight was gone.

366
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,060
I couldn't make it well.

367
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,260
You really suck at this.

368
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,920
I'm not good at this.

369
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,300
I'm not good at this.

370
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,600
But I'm good at this.

371
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,820
Thank you.

372
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,160
My heart is now filled with the fire of the flashlight!

373
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,660
*Screams*

374
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,900
*Screams*

375
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,460
*Screams*

376
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,740
*Screams*

377
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,760
*Screams*

378
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,220
*Screams*

379
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,080
*Screams*

380
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,280
35 years since the first traffic violation.

381
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,400
It's been 7 years since the first traffic violation.

382
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,740
Ishizu Railway is over!

383
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,240
*Screams*

384
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,100
Damn it!

385
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,260
Today, the Black Meteor will destroy the steel rail!

386
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,300
*Screams*

387
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,860
*Screams*

388
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,160
*Screams*

389
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,300
Why does it run so fast?

390
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,300
It's clearly 40 km/h.

391
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,160
Hey, it's too fast to run away!

392
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,720
*Screams*

393
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,220
The speed limit for this road is 40 km/h.

394
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,600
The criminal is on pursuit, so it's okay!

395
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,660
*Screams*

396
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,320
That's not true!

397
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,860
Traffic safety is the most important thing at any time!

398
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,980
Hm? That's...

399
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,580
Watanuki!

400
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,160
You showed up again, Shizu!

401
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,520
But I can't catch you!

402
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,640
I'll save you!

403
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:06,940
What?

404
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,800
I did it! I caught you!

405
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,360
I-I'll kill you!

406
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,440
That's it! That's it!

407
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,280
Stop it! This road is 40 km/h limited!

408
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,900
I'm not going to let you beat me!

409
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,920
Bye-bye!

410
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,480
Watanuki!

411
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,560
What are you doing?

412
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,460
I'm chasing you!

413
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,600
But at high speed!

414
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,840
What?

415
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,900
You're making a mess!

416
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,860
Whoa! What are you doing?

417
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,820
I'm speeding up!

418
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,440
Stop it!

419
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,920
This is 40 km/h!

420
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,500
Go!

421
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,820
If you speed up any more, I'll...

422
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,720
I'm over 60 km/h!

423
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,320
Ha! Ha! Ha!

424
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,420
You did it!

425
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,360
Chief Ishizu must've missed it!

426
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,560
Woo-hooo!

427
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,360
Wha- wha-, wha- wha-?

428
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,780
Watanuki!

429
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,680
What?

430
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,520
Gently return the particular parts!

431
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,800
You're finally getting serious about it, Ishizu!

432
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,140
Shut up!

433
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,740
D-dude!

434
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,000
Whoa...

435
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,520
Whs...! Help me...!

436
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,260
Whoa! Whoa...

437
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,540
Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

438
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,400
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

439
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,760
Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

440
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,220
Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

441
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

442
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
How far are you going!?

443
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,320
This is not a world where we can live together.

444
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,440
As expected from the seven-level traffic safety guide.

445
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,780
7.5 meters

446
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,420
So you managed to catch me in Sadogashi?

447
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,080
I don't remember how we crossed the sea.

448
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,620
It must have been tough.

449
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,960
It was tough, Ryo-sama.

450
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,240
Chief Ishizu...

451
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,160
Did something happen again?

452
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,680
That is...

453
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,420
This is...

454
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,760
This is like Chief Ishizu's home.

455
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,920
Is this Chief Ishizu's doing?

456
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,160
Yes.

457
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,780
Hey, Ryo, Tsukankichi!

458
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,260
What did you do to Chief Ishizu?

459
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,400
I didn't do anything.

460
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,120
Because Chief Ishizu was so excited in the morning that he made a show.

461
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,520
And he changed the name of the traffic police to his own.

462
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,320
My name is Seisho School Zone!

463
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,240
Naoko is still better.

464
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,240
I'm the 10th in the school district.

465
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,140
What!?

466
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,120
By the way, I'm a pacifist.

467
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,260
Oh, here it is.

468
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,780
A two-wheeled car with a motorbike.

469
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,460
A bicycle with a motorbike.

470
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,060
A traffic stop.

471
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Could it be?

472
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,520
Is that my name?

473
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,940
Yeah, that's good.

474
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,640
Then, everyone, get changed and gather!

475
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,080
We will now start the traffic safety guidance.

476
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,480
Traffic safety guidance...

477
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,000
Please forgive me for that!

478
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,560
Don't run away!

479
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,080
The car won't stop suddenly!

480
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,560
Can't have a new car, right?

481
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:24,320
When I turn to park my car,

482
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:34,600
I felt a strange feeling at that time

483
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,500
So I walked only in black

484
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:53,360
I saw a child once, but everyone forgets

485
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,300
I saw a child once, but everyone forgets

486
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,400
A politician with a great-looking face

487
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,560
A blue aunt above his eyes

488
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:06,040
Look up at that corner

489
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,620
You can meet everyone

490
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,380
There is a turtle over there

491
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,200
There must be a turtle

492
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,840
Everyone come here

493
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,120
Our

494
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,260
Our town

495
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,420
Thank you!

496
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,600
Do you know a trolley bus?

497
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,840
It's a vehicle that takes electricity from a river and runs on the road.

498
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,000
It's like a combination of a train and a bus.

499
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,960
I used to run a lot when I was a child.

500
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,300
And I have unforgettable memories of the toro bus.

501
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,700
Next time, "Toro Bus Story"

502
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,980
Thank you for watching!

503
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:04,000
Next time, "Toro Bus Story"
