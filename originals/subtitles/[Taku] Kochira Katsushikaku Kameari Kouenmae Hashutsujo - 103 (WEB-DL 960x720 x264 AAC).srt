00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,340
When you watch TV,

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,140
Make sure you look out of the room and look away!

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:27,560
I look at the sunset that floats in the river

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,360
I kick the love stone and the shoes fly

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:41,600
I wonder if I'm going to go to the gym

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,220
I laughed that I was still a baby

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,820
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

9
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,900
I feel like I'm going to win

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,540
I feel like I'm going to win

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,260
The town's waves are so gentle

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,680
From the fountain of a pointed hat

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,320
To Taishakuten

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,460
The sunset falls

15
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,780
Tomorrow it'll end like this

16
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,860
I'm going to Katsushika and Shiba

17
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,540
I'm going to Katsushika and Shiba

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,300
There's no happiness

19
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,400
I've lost my way

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,420
And I realized

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,720
I'm such an idiot

22
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,940
Kame no Ongaeshi

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,820
Kids, look at this.

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,020
What is that, granddad?

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,540
Kids, look at this.

26
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,880
You can't bully a turtle!

27
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,880
No! No! Stop!

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,020
What's so bad about it?

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,800
I think it was a pretty good performance.

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,200
It's hot when you two are together.

31
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,620
Ryo-tsu was the one who split the roles.

32
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,580
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry for the role of a child who bullies turtles.

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,660
I agreed to it because it's a play to be shown in the children's world.

34
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,540
I agreed to it because it's a play to be shown in the children's world.

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,580
Ryo-san, if you don't do it seriously, you'll get no bonus.

36
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,880
That's why I'm doing it seriously.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,560
Nagagawa, you're the worst.

38
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,700
Me?

39
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,440
What kind of person do you think Urashima Taro is?

40
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,420
He's a fisherman, isn't he?

41
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,340
That's right.

42
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,540
He went out to the sea on every day to catch fish.

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay?

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
When you go out to the sea, it's not just sunny days.

45
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,540
There were also rainy days.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,700
There were also snowy days.

47
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,680
On a stormy day, you might have been thrown out into the sea.

48
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,660
And he's a kind person who helps the bullied turtle.

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,700
He doesn't have to live a rich life.

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
He must have worn a suit until it was worn out.

51
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,420
The torn part is the needle and the turtle's butterfly made of fish bones.

52
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,740
The thread that dried the turtle is the thread that hits the next.

53
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,360
Do you think that kind of man has such a refreshing white skin?

54
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you think he has such a tightly fixed hair?

55
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,940
Do you think he's wearing such a clean-up suit?

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,880
You can't feel the severity of living in the sea at all.

57
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,080
The reality is definitely reduced.

58
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,240
If you say so.

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,120
If you say so.

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,980
But Takada's play in the children's world is so much more realistic than that.

61
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,680
Idiot!

62
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,760
Children these days are much more eye-catching than adults.

63
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,980
If you feel that you're missing out on anything...

64
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,960
I'll buy you a new house!

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,060
Then what about my bonus?

66
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,720
You still have 30 years of home loan left.

67
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,420
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,520
Hey, Ryo-chan.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,120
What?

70
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,660
Is it still your turn?

71
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,280
You're like a real princess.

72
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,020
Reiko, you look great in it.

73
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,220
Really?

74
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,520
Not at all.

75
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,280
What?

76
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440
What's wrong with this outfit?

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,640
It's all wrong.

78
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,060
Reiko, how many years do you think you've been at the Ryugu Castle?

79
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,540
That's...

80
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,000
When you returned to your village,

81
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,920
I heard that no one knew you.

82
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,300
We were so young that we hadn't heard of you,

83
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,100
and I could barely Edwards,

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,160
until the day you came to us.

85
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,340
you just became a stubborn old man.

86
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,180
Considering your age and present,

87
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,160
50 years of service might think like that.

88
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,220
At least 50 years you'd stay there.

89
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,080
I see.

90
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,060
Can you keep firing after me?

91
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,760
You think you can do that?

92
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
Then it's three days at most.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,100
Then what kind of clothes do you want?

94
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,120
Yeah, that's...

95
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,380
What are you doing?

96
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,060
What are you doing?

97
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,460
That's not enough.

98
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,660
If it's not that colorful,

99
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,040
I can't put a man in it.

100
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,680
It's a matter of reality.

101
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,380
Then what about Ryo, the turtle actor?

102
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,380
You're going to wear a real turtle, right?

103
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,160
Leave it to me.

104
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,000
You're going to wear a real turtle, right?

105
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,600
That's right.

106
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:38,580
That's right.

107
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,060
I'm just taking a little bit of your shoulder.

108
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,520
Just stay still.

109
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,980
Taking a shoulder from a real turtle?

110
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,040
That's Ryo-tsu for you.

111
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,320
Oh, this is the turtle's costume!

112
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,800
It really looks like it's real!

113
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,380
Ryo-san is really into it this time.

114
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,400
And he's getting a bonus.

115
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,160
I wish he'd work this hard at his usual job too.

116
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,400
That's a good idea.

117
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,520
Nakagawa-san's Ferrari!

118
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,140
Nakagawa-san!

119
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,760
Good morning!

120
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,340
You're Nakagawa?

121
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,440
Yes.

122
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,560
I wanted to use your story as a reference

123
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
and seek out some reality.

124
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,160
This is the ultimate Urashima Taro, right?

125
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,200
It's real, but...

126
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,220
Nakagawa-san's image is...

127
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,920
Ryo-tsu and Kakichi are all so bad!

128
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,540
Ryo-san!

129
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,340
Ryo-san!

130
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:07,400
Ryo-san!

131
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,300
Ryo-san!

132
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,620
How is it?

133
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,320
Ryo-san is very loud, so I came up with a very bold and realistic Urashima.

134
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,080
I-it might be realistic.

135
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,760
But it doesn't have to be that...

136
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,800
Ryo-san, the characters are different.

137
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,240
Oh, as expected!

138
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,220
This is Ryo-san's costume!

139
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,940
I can't believe you let me dress like that!

140
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm not going to forgive that primitive man!

141
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
By the way, what about the important ryo-tsu?

142
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,960
Today is the real show for the children's section.

143
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,920
It's already here.

144
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,480
Komachi!

145
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,660
Who do you think won't be forgiven?

146
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,980
I'm here, Chief.

147
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,180
What?

148
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,180
You can store your limbs inside?

149
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,740
It's real.

150
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,200
It's only...

151
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,140
Thanks to the reality tests,

152
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,300
the legs are over 50 kilograms.

153
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,620
It's really hard to stand upright.

154
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,400
This is bad.

155
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,240
I was wrong!

156
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,640
Stop it!

157
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,100
Yowls can fall easily!

158
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,040
Darn it!

159
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,580
I can't reach it!

160
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,100
If this happens, I'll use my left hand!

161
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,680
One, two, one, two, one, two, three!

162
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,880
That was close!

163
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,040
You were almost there, Senpai!

164
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,940
Now, let's try again!

165
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,660
Alright!

166
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,580
Someone's gotta lend a hand!

167
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,700
I'll practice my turtle movements.

168
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,540
I've got to get used to this guy's weight before the show starts.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
You know when the show starts, right?

170
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,780
If you're late, you're out!

171
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,460
I know!

172
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,960
I think I can practice as much as I want here.

173
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,520
Oh, no. I'm getting tired.

174
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,040
I'll try here.

175
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,180
Oh, no.

176
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,680
Oh, no. I'm getting tired.

177
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:21,880
I'll try here.

178
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,880
I'll try here.

179
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,340
I'll try here.

180
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,840
Oh, no. I'm getting tired.

181
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,540
Oh, no. I'm getting tired.

182
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,480
Ow! Ow! Ow!

183
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,780
I can't get up!

184
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,140
I can't get up!

185
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,240
Oh, no!

186
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,400
I can't get up!

187
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,320
My right chest!

188
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,960
I can't help it.

189
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm going to the toilet.

190
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,760
Ah!

191
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,160
I'm going to the toilet!

192
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:05,720
I'm going to the toilet!

193
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,600
Ow!

194
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,680
Ah!

195
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,080
I lost my will!

196
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,620
I lost my will!

197
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,400
Ow!

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,260
I lost my will!

199
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,180
Ow!

200
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,620
I lost my will!

201
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:20,860
Ow!

202
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:20,980
Ow!

203
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:21,540
Ow!

204
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
A big one just came out of the water!

205
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:23,820
Really?

206
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,180
- This way! - Damn, it came this way!

207
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,480
- It's a turtle! - It's huge!

208
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm gonna run away! Wait!

209
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,440
This is fun!

210
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,400
Hey, you guys try riding it!

211
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
You guys, stop it!

212
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,640
- A turtle spoke! - It's a man-faced turtle!

213
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,440
A turtle is not scary when it turns around.

214
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,240
- I see! - Yeah!

215
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,440
There!

216
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,660
Hey, stop it!

217
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,840
It thinks it's a kid!

218
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,120
Stop it! Stop it!

219
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,160
Damn, if it's a fairy tale, it'll come to help Urashima Taro!

220
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,520
Isn't there a turtle?

221
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,860
Isn't there a troubled turtle?

222
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,960
Isn't there a troubled turtle who was bullied by a kid?

223
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,040
To Be Continued

224
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,120
Isn't there a troubled turtle who was bullied by a kid?

225
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,320
Kids, you can't bully turtles!

226
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,120
To Be Continued

227
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,060
I was saved!

228
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,160
It's out!

229
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,740
Don't hesitate! Just stay still!

230
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm Urashima Taro!

231
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,200
I'm Urashima Taro's ghost!

232
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm Shindoran!

233
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,700
Then, open the box and do like this!

234
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,840
It's not opened yet.

235
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,440
I saved the turtle.

236
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,580
Then, I'll ask him to bring me to the Dragon Castle.

237
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,500
Ouch! The shoulder is really hurt!

238
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,600
Are you hurt?

239
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,460
You're not helping him.

240
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,440
Don't be a little bit passive to help him!

241
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,940
It's not your place to come to my house.

242
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,120
But, you have to bring me to the Dragon Castle.

243
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,260
You can't do that!

244
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,340
What is this old guy doing?

245
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,380
To Be Continued

246
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,460
Huh?

247
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,620
I'm starting to get confused.

248
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,720
This old man...

249
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,880
What's this?

250
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,140
Did he live in such a luxurious house?

251
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,980
He's got a lot of money.

252
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,660
He's got a lot of money.

253
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,240
He's got a lot of money.

254
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,540
He's got a lot of money.

255
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,260
Welcome home, Masai!

256
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,660
Welcome home, Masai!

257
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,320
Wow, it's like a dragon castle.

258
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,060
It's a fake.

259
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,580
An important thing is coming.

260
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,980
An important thing?

261
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,920
In order to get it,

262
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,360
we have to go to the dragon castle.

263
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,180
Flaming Six, is Flaming Six here?

264
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,780
Yes.

265
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,840
Come to my room right away.

266
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,520
Yes, sir.

267
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,880
I'm really flamed.

268
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,280
There's my room in the back.

269
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,200
Why is there such a shabby hut in the building?

270
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,020
Because I'm Uroshima Taro.

271
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,880
Because I'm Uroshima Taro.

272
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:08,900
No!

273
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,840
I don't want to go there anymore.

274
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,980
No!

275
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,020
I don't want to go there anymore.

276
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,520
Thank you, sir.

277
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,200
Thank you, sir.

278
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,400
You did a great job.

279
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,380
I'm saved, old man.

280
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,160
I see.

281
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,260
I'll take you to the dragon castle right away.

282
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,880
I'll take you to the dragon castle right away.

283
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,480
Wait a minute.

284
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,240
Are you serious, old man?

285
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:38,520
I've been studying Uroshima Taro for 78 years,

286
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,980
and I have the evidence that the dragon castle exists.

287
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,580
I've been studying Uroshima Taro for 78 years,

288
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,100
Really?

289
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,360
Really?

290
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,800
You're so annoying.

291
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,400
The dragon castle was in Tokyo Bay, wasn't it?

292
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,020
If you know the place, you can go there by yourself.

293
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,760
Don't get me involved.

294
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,220
At first, I believed that I could go to the dragon castle

295
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,820
if I had this map, but...

296
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,720
At first, I believed that I could go to the dragon castle if I had this map, but...

297
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,900
At first, I believed that I could go to the dragon castle if I had this map, but...

298
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,420
Okay, let's go to the dragon castle shortly.

299
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:22,280
Okay, let's go to the dragon castle shortly.

300
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,140
It's not true, is it?

301
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,100
It's not true, is it?

302
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,740
I found out.

303
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,180
Well, let's get back to the point.

304
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,920
This time...

305
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,960
I'll visit the mountain here.

306
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,560
Ah!

307
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,260
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,440
Now we're talking.

309
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,860
Now?!

310
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,940
That's enough!

311
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,560
Are you a donkey, or a dolphin, or a camel?!

312
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,020
I couldn't reach the Dragon Palace no matter how many times I went there.

313
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,920
I was troubled, but one day I finally understood.

314
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,760
Long ago, long ago, in order to save Urashima...

315
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,180
I see, so that's what it was.

316
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,760
The key to the Dragon Palace was in this song.

317
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,800
It was in the song.

318
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,900
It means...

319
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,360
Death!

320
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,320
If I don't get carried away by the god who saved me...

321
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,000
If I don't get carried away by the god who saved me...

322
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,260
I won't be able to reach the Dragon Palace!

323
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,520
Stop fooling around with people's backs!

324
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,660
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,200
I immediately returned to my mission as Urashima Taro.

326
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,600
And...

327
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,420
From that day on, I went all over the country to save the turtle.

328
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,840
And the turtle I saved...

329
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,380
9,999 times!

330
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,900
But no turtle has ever taken me to the Dragon Palace.

331
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,380
But no turtle has ever taken me to the Dragon Palace.

332
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,340
Of course!

333
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,380
Ow!

334
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,420
You're the first one to have 10,000 turtles.

335
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,120
Now, take me to the Dragon Palace, turtle.

336
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,240
I'm not joking!

337
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,320
I have to go on stage for the children's play!

338
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,660
First of all, I'm not a turtle!

339
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,420
Wait.

340
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,540
He has this much money.

341
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,280
It's no loss to get along with him.

342
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,600
Besides, that map...

343
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,320
Isn't it a map that shows something?

344
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,600
For example, a ship sinking with treasure.

345
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,740
This might be a big story.

346
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,380
Ah!

347
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,520
Urashima Taro!

348
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,460
I'm going to take you to the Dragon Palace!

349
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,880
Oh!

350
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,920
You're so curious, turtle!

351
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,000
Now, I can finally fulfill my wish!

352
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,020
You're late, Ryotsu.

353
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,560
I've been calling my phone a few times, but I can't reach it.

354
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,000
What would he be?

355
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,940
On the other hand, it ain't his fault.

356
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,020
It's got to be this big, right?

357
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,540
Oh.

358
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,480
Oh...

359
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,460
This can't be it.

360
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,880
Come on.

361
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,840
On your way to the Dragon Palace.

362
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:47,880
I'm even glad I rode my turtle!

363
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,300
Me, too!

364
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,220
My friends,

365
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,860
Hey, you're older than the turtle at times like this.

366
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,080
Don't say such stupid things.

367
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,060
Hey, we need oxygen bombs in the future.

368
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,640
Let's go get some.

369
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,620
That's a good idea.

370
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,960
We're going to get some.

371
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,700
Let's go.

372
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:32,820
What about me?

373
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,020
You don't need a turtle.

374
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,860
Oh, that's right.

375
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,000
If you stay on the ground for too long, you forget to breathe.

376
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,700
I can't help it.

377
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,720
I'll just pop it.

378
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,080
I'll just pop it.

379
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,240
Chizuta, it should be about time.

380
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,220
What?

381
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,480
The tide is getting stronger around here.

382
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,520
The turtle is getting stronger.

383
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,740
Damn it!

384
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,260
I can't give up like this.

385
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,900
What should I do?

386
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,640
I said, what should I do?

387
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,340
Oh, Ryugu Castle.

388
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,700
Oh, it's a turtle.

389
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,380
What's this?

390
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,820
Isn't it a sinking battleship?

391
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,200
Why is it here again?

392
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,940
I see.

393
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,340
There's a treasure hidden in this ship.

394
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,720
Treasure, treasure.

395
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,680
Treasure?

396
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,460
Huh?

397
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,660
Oh, my God!

398
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,380
It hurts!

399
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, it's a big box.

400
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,880
Is this the treasure box?

401
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,960
Let's open it and see what happens.

402
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,440
All right.

403
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,400
I'll open this in three, two, one.

404
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,040
I'll give you three!

405
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,120
One, two, three!

406
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
One, two, three!

407
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,180
Let's give this to her as a souvenir.

408
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,840
You can open it when you're in trouble.

409
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,480
Yes, thank you very much, Princess Oto.

410
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,180
She's become a real old man!

411
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,600
How realistic!

412
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,360
I'm a bug.

413
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,740
I'm a dragon queen.

414
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,820
Are you okay?

415
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,700
You're Princess Oto?

416
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,680
No, I'm not.

417
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,500
We finally met.

418
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,280
Now I have no regrets in my life.

419
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,380
Thank you.

420
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,860
I'll give you Princess Oto!

421
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,480
No!

422
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,900
Give it back!

423
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,580
Princess Oto!

424
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:56,940
No!

425
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,600
Thank you!

426
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,940
According to the research,

427
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,800
there have been a lot of accident in that area.

428
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Recently, a demolition ship has sunk during the exercise.

429
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,380
Yes.

430
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Then, why is there a dragon's tomb on the map of that old man?

431
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,780
It seems that a person who caused a disaster in that place

432
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,260
was called like that because he was scared and became white-headed overnight.

433
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,620
What a thing!

434
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,440
Ah!

435
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,640
Huh?

436
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,900
Huh?

437
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,360
Hey, stop it!

438
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,420
One more time!

439
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,080
I'll wear this clothes and become Princess Oto!

440
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,300
No!

441
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,660
No!

442
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,800
No!

443
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,520
It was my dream!

444
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,460
Please, one more time!

445
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,740
I said no!

446
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,100
Princess Oto

447
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,380
Princess Oto

448
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:04,460
Princess Oto

449
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,760
Princess Oto

450
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,260
Princess Oto

451
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,240
Princess Oto

452
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,260
Princess Oto

453
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,240
"Oriya!"

454
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,860
ze no youma saimo no eneruki

00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,320

460

Episode 2

461
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,880
Oh no! The new car the manager bought has been damaged!

462
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,820
If I don't do something about it, I'll be a big help to the manager again!

463
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,960
Well, well, well, I guess I don't know anything about this at all!

464
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,100
Next time, "The New Car of Manager Henshin"

465
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,140
See you then!
