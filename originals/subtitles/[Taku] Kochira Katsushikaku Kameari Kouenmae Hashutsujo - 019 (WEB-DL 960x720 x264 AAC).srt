This bastard is dangerous!

29
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,080
Bastard!

30
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:03,960
Senior!

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,220
This guy...

32
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,420
He's the gourmet commentator who's been on TV and magazines lately.

33
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,780
It's you, Chogoro.

34
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,680
This taste is not just any ordinary taste.

35
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,960
As usual, the store is not just any ordinary taste.

36
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,040
Is there a chef?

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,480
Oh, this is the teacher.

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,420
Please come in.

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,900
Oh, it's a split, you bastard!

40
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,240
Well, well, senior.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,260
Here you are.

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,600
This is not just any ordinary taste.

43
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,180
You're so great.

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,680
I've been waiting for three hours under the cold sky.

45
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,640
Do you know the taste of the

46
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,680
the best

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,620
the

48
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,400
best

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,420
of

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,640
the

51
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:20,660
best

52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,120
I found something that's not your specialty, Maeda-sensei.

53
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,540
I knew it. This soba is the best!

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,020
It doesn't matter if it's your specialty.

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,040
When you're done eating, get out of the seat.

56
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,660
My lord, I want to sell this soba to my acquaintances.

57
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,720
I want 200 soba.

58
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,300
200 soba is more than 100,000 yen.

59
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,980
My lord, I'm the best gourmet of Japan,

60
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,280
and you're the best gourmet of Japan.

61
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,020
Of course, I don't need any of that.

62
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,820
Please, everyone, enjoy your meal.

63
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,220
I'll be more diligent from now on.

64
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,500
Thank you very much.

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,020
Ah, finally it's gone.

66
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,440
Well, it's our turn next.

67
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,220
W-what?

68
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,960
Hey, old man! What's with the closed store?

69
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,120
We've been waiting for three hours under this cold weather

70
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,600
because we want to eat warm soba!

71
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,680
Oh, Maeda-sensei took all the soba.

72
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,280
What?

73
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,000
No way!

74
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,120
I'm the one who wants to cry!

75
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,000
I shouldn't have been put on this magazine!

76
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,540
Damn it!

77
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,840
I see.

78
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,860
Because it was introduced on this magazine,

79
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,240
suddenly there are more customers.

80
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,160
So they're selling it for free.

81
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,940
They're really something.

82
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,680
Damn it.

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,380
If this continues, it'll be a little bit of a disaster.

84
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,220
Is there any restaurant that can make us eat warm soba?

85
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,580
Senior, how about this soba restaurant?

86
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,800
What?

87
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,080
It's as if there's no customers here.

89
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,080
This place is dangerous!

90
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,900
Let's get out of here.

91
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,860
Eh? Why?

92
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,780
You don't know?

93
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,320
It's not normal for this place to be so popular.

94
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,020
If we eat a lot,

95
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,560
we'll have to make a bad soba that we can never eat again.

96
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,360
Are you a customer?

97
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,560
I was going to say that.

98
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,540
Thank you very much.

99
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,800
What's wrong?

100
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,760
Actually, you are the fifth customer.

101
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,640
The fifth customer today?

102
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,440
Well, I guess that's it.

103
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,380
No, it's the fifth since the restaurant started.

104
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:37,920
What?

105
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,500
Wait a minute!

106
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,320
When did the restaurant start?

107
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,760
Three years ago.

108
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,400
Three years ago?

109
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,480
I'll make it right away.

110
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,800
What should I do?

111
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,800
Actually, I suddenly feel a little hungry.

112
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,020
Senior, I feel sorry for you.

113
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,040
Let's eat it.

114
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,440
What should we do if we eat soba here and really feel hungry?

115
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,560
If something happens,

116
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,460
we'll do something with Nakagawa Zaibatsu's medical team.

117
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,020
Let's be the fifth customer.

118
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,640
Please.

119
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,560
I understand.

120
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,460
I'll be the fifth victim.

121
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:25,560
Thank you for waiting.

122
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,600
It's a bad soba.

123
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,460
Let's eat it quickly and go back to the delivery.

124
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,820
What?

125
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,880
Don't look at me!

126
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,000
The customer's reaction is a little...

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,880
You're worried about the soba, aren't you?

129
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:41,880
Yes.

130
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,560
I'll tell you after I finish eating.

131
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,500
So go over there while I'm eating.

132
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:47,820
Yes.

133
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,560
It's a soba with no weirdness.

134
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,860
It's not that bad that you can't eat it.

135
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,400
What's this?

136
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,140
What's wrong, Nakagawa?

137
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,100
Master, I have something to ask you.

138
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,680
Yes, what is it?

139
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,860
Is this soba made from the soba flour made at Yamada Farm?

140
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,380
Yes, it is.

141
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,180
What's Yamada Farm?

142
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,700
You know it.

143
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,300
It's the farm of the soba maker,

144
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,180
Dengoro Yamada.

145
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,260
It's said that the soba made here is the best in Japan.

146
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,920
It's difficult to get,

147
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,860
so even the Nakagawa group's cooking department

148
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,540
uses it only in a few shops.

149
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,420
I've known the Yamada grandpa for a long time,

150
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,480
so I've been using it cheaply at home.

151
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,060
I knew it.

152
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,560
And the soba made from the soba broth,

153
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,800
isn't it the one made by Sato Jozo?

154
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,920
Yes.

155
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,240
Sato Jozo has been making handmade soba for years.

156
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,200
It's said to be the birthplace of soba.

157
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,340
It's a traditional taste of Kishu.

158
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,520
The soba made here is called "soba in soba".

159
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,520
No, it's called "soba".

160
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:02,880
It's not just soba.

161
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,020
It's also called "katsuobushi" and "konbu".

162
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,460
It's a must-have for this rich broth.

163
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,640
The green onions are well-cooked,

164
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,020
and it's a great, glossy dish.

165
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,460
And the chili peppers,

166
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,900
the 7 flavors bring out the perfect harmony.

167
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,400
The spiciness is just right,

168
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,740
and it's a very well-chosen ingredient.

169
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,920
Hey, hey, why do you use such a great ingredient

170
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,560
to make only ordinary soba?

171
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,240
Ordinary?

172
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,400
Senior, please have a look at your bowl.

173
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,120
When did you find it?

174
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,580
This is what it means to be delicious.

175
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,360
It goes into your body naturally.

176
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,420
Old man, that's for you!

177
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,200
One more, please!

178
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:44,740
Yes!

179
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,340
It is true that it tastes good when you chew it.

180
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,040
Right?

181
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,460
You're putting out such a great flavor.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,420
You should promote it more!

183
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,740
I'm not good at making flashy things.

184
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,860
But even so,

185
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,500
It's strange to think about it.

186
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,900
If it tastes like this, it seems like it's going to attract customers.

187
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,580
But there's a deep reason for it not to attract customers.

188
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,800
Deep reason?

189
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,440
Three years ago, I won't forget.

190
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,920
On a day when the snow was falling, this store opened.

191
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,860
I was nervous, waiting for the first customer.

192
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,220
Then...

193
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:26,880
Sorry.

194
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,720
What? You're Mr. Oomaeda?

195
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,800
You're Mr. Oomaeda. Did you come here to eat?

196
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,100
No, I came to borrow the bathroom.

197
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,040
So this was a soba restaurant.

198
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,060
I didn't realize it was so ordinary.

199
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,400
But it's just right. Let's have lunch here.

200
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,340
Yes, I'll make it right away.

201
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,380
It was my first customer, so I made it with my own hands.

202
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,600
Here you go.

203
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,900
Thank you.

204
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,480
How was it?

205
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,420
It's just an ordinary taste.

206
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,060
Is that so?

207
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,120
Oh, it will be 700 yen, but...

208
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,160
Sir, I don't think you know me.

209
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,260
I'm Chogoro Omaeda, a food critic.

210
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,040
Yes, so it will be 700 yen for a bowl of kakesoba.

211
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,040
I'm Chogoro Omaeda, a food critic from Nippon-ishi!

212
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,020
So, 700 yen for a bowl of kakesoba.

213
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,580
I said I'm Omaeda!

214
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,600
So, 700 yen for a bowl of kakesoba.

215
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,480
I said I'm Omaeda!

216
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,840
700 yen...

217
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,940
I'm sorry, but I don't have any cash.

218
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,460
I'll have to pay you back later.

219
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,560
I'm sure it'll be 20,000 or 30,000 yen.

220
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,280
Thank you very much.

221
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,620
Sir, what's the name of this shop?

222
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,400
Tanaka Soba.

223
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,380
Tanaka Soba.

224
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,560
I'll remember that.

225
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,980
In the end, the full-year room was a complete fake.

226
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,040
What a sad story.

227
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,480
I was surprised a week later.

228
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,120
They were so mean to our shop.

229
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,360
It's not a human's fault.

230
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,700
Even if the world forgives me, I won't forgive it.

231
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,220
-7 times.

232
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,280
That's terrible.

233
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,580
Don't put this on display.

234
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,320
But our shop is introduced.

235
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,580
It's just a negative image.

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,840
It's a terrible article.

237
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,320
It's full of criticism.

238
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,240
I can't forgive you for bringing soba that I was supposed to eat.

239
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,960
You're so good at this.

240
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,680
It's strange that a person who doesn't know the taste is a gourmet critic.

241
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,460
Okay.

242
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,300
I'll get angry, and then tell you what's going to happen.

243
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,280
All right?

244
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,240
Yes, if it's possible.

245
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,340
Leave it to me.

246
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,000
I have a good idea.

247
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,720
Wash your head and wait.

248
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,000
Hey, you!

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,140
I need a sacrifice to make a fool of you.

250
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,120
Are you prepared?

251
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,660
Yes.

252
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,340
Well, now, we'll start the strategy to make a fool of you.

253
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,100
I'm starting a strategy to make you laugh, Chogoro.

254
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,640
What are you doing?

255
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,940
You can't let a regular store like this be accepted by a gourmet critic.

256
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,500
We need to have a tradition and a style!

257
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,580
I see.

258
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,700
You're trying to fight back the feelings that have been with you for many years.

259
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,180
That's right.

260
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,460
You can't let a regular store like this be accepted by a gourmet critic.

261
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,020
You can't let a regular store like this be accepted by a gourmet critic.

262
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,620
My store...

263
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,540
Senior, do you need any help?

264
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,340
Yes, anything.

265
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,960
Bring me something that has a tradition and a style.

266
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,940
I understand!

267
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,340
Next...

268
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,460
Hey, Ryo! What are you doing?

269
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,420
Hey, Ryo! What are you doing?

270
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,740
Hey, I'm here at a good place.

271
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,400
I remember you saying you made some rice balls during the school's school lunch break.

272
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,780
I remember you saying you made some rice balls during the school's school lunch break.

273
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,120
Yeah, but they're covered in dust and have cracks.

274
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,100
Yeah, but they're covered in dust and have cracks.

275
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,220
It's a good thing.

276
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,460
Bring that here.

277
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,200
And borrow some for your friends.

278
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,260
Okay, Ryo!

279
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,060
You've made it, haven't you?

280
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,760
An abandoned happening at a news conference.

281
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,240
An abandoned happening at a news conference.

282
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,300
An abandoned happening at a news conference.

283
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,140
An abandoned happening at a news conference.

284
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,360
An abandoned happening at a news conference.

285
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,060
An abandoned happening at a news conference.

286
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,480
I borrowed this from the museums around the world.

287
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,260
All of these mucus are storytelling the history of mankind.

288
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,980
Hello, hello.

289
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,660
Uh...

290
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,780
there's a thing like this in this toy shop.

291
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,560
It looks very natural.

292
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,100
No, it isn't.

293
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,680
I should have told you.

294
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,700
Oh, right.

295
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,800
I'll call this a celebration of the rotation of the Cleopatra.

296
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,340
It's so messy.

297
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,920
I wonder if it's this big.

298
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,500
I'll leave one pillar here.

299
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,340
Please don't.

300
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,460
If you cut this, the building will break.

301
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,180
That's true.

302
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,920
Ryo!

303
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,340
I'm waiting for you!

304
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:16,520
Good.

305
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,320
Good job.

306
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,560
The restaurant is ready.

307
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,480
Now...

308
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,660
No way!

309
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,980
Please stop!

310
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,460
Please stop!

311
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:26,860
Stop it!

312
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,800
The one who will be the judge is the owner!

313
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,640
Stop it!

314
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,100
Stop it!

315
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,680
Don't speak like that!

316
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,760
Huh?

317
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,000
That bicycle is...

318
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,460
It's a forfeit.

319
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,280
You're not sure about this, are you, Kankichi?

320
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,080
Huh?

321
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,580
Mr. Nakagawa!

322
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,700
You finished it.

323
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,500
Come here.

324
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,980
But...

325
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,800
Don't be shy.

326
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,040
I'm sure you're not sure about this.

327
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,120
I'll tell Chief Ohara.

328
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,700
Hey!

329
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,600
Hey!

330
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,600
I... I'm retired...

331
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:10,940
I... I... I'm retired...

332
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,460
I'm so happy...

333
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,880
Oh, you're that happy?

334
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,860
I'm lamenting my own misfortune.

335
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Now the stage is set.

336
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,240
Nakagawa, prepare the cherry blossoms.

337
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,340
Yes.

338
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,680
Now we just have to drive in the prey.

339
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,400
Is there really a good soba restaurant that can line up in a place like this?

340
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:39,920
Yes.

341
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,720
According to the viewers,

342
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,080
you can line up two kilometers a day.

343
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,780
Oh, isn't that it?

344
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,760
Wow!

345
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,020
So this is the line that goes to the soba restaurant?

346
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,840
I wonder what this current line looks like.

347
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,940
Today we are interviewing the best gourmet actress in Japan,

348
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,220
Omaeda Chomoro.

349
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,000
With her, we will try to find out who is the best Tak Ent,

350
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,740
I am Omaeda Chomoro!

351
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,380
What are you two?

352
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,620
I heard you want us to interview a restaurant,

353
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,360
would you mind?

354
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,620
Would you like to join us?

355
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,860
Yes, please do not disturb us.

356
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,560
Sir, what is your first impression of the shop?

357
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,940
Do you know? This shop has been open for 20 years.

358
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,880
It is said that it is a very important cultural asset of the country.

359
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,560
A very important cultural asset of the country?

360
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:02,420
This shop is probably the one that has been around since the beginning of the world.

361
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,320
This shop must have been a place where fierce battles were fought between the Ishin and the Bakufu armies.

362
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,900
Even though it is a shop made by a senior, it is easy to be deceived.

363
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,460
This is a great treasure that has been kept for a long time.

364
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,860
This shop is not just a treasure.

365
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,400
This shop is a treasure.

366
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,700
This is a treasure that is not just a treasure.

367
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,360
This is a treasure that is likely to be popular with the public.

368
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,840
Hello.

369
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,660
You are stupid. Get out of my way.

370
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,140
This shop is a shop where chili peppers are sold once.

371
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,720
Please use it twice.

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,660
Please tell the store manager to open the shop.

373
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,760
What are you doing?

374
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,020
Hurry up and come out.

375
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,520
Are you really going out in this costume?

376
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,120
Of course.

377
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,420
Don't be too hard on me.

378
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:02,140
Because of the article he wrote, only five customers came in in the last three years.

379
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,820
Just remember that.

380
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,340
Come on, let's go.

381
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,660
I'm sorry, store manager.

382
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,480
The one who doesn't keep the style of the shop is a customer.

383
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,680
Don't come back.

384
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,640
Wow! It's a shop for craftsmen!

385
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,880
What do you think, Mr. Maeda?

386
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,300
Oh, man!

387
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,380
He must have kicked out the people of the Royal Court of Britain with that attitude!

388
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,260
But now, he's back and enjoying himself here,

389
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,120
and he's serving water to the Buckingham Palace every week!

390
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,540
Royal Court of Britain...

391
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,260
He's just trying to keep the taste of soba,

392
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,400
and his way of being an angel!

393
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,480
He's wearing a traditional coat,

394
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,640
but he doesn't fall for the tradition,

395
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,160
and he's actively taking on Western styles!

396
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,560
He's experiencing the western fusion of the West and the West!

397
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,600
The owner of the shop...

398
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,100
is not an ordinary person!

399
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,820
He's not an ordinary person again!

400
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,540
Why? Why, you guys?

401
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,100
Don't you know me?

402
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,680
I'm the gourmet commentator, Maeda Chogoro!

403
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,680
I came for a TV interview!

404
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,240
What? A TV interview?

405
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,660
You idiot!

406
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,620
Don't do interviews!

407
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,440
If you do a TV interview,

408
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,940
the people who don't know the taste of soba will come and push you!

409
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,820
If there's any more customers,

410
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,520
I'll be too busy to take care of them!

411
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,220
Hey, don't shoot!

412
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,400
There's no customers!

413
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,220
We just serve the usual soba!

414
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,420
Yes, of course!

415
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:37,840
Wonderful!

416
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,960
I've tried all the dishes in the world,

417
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,220
but this is the first time I've ever eaten so delicious soba!

418
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,300
I'll leave the food here!

419
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,600
Here it is!

420
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,500
Here it is!

421
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,160
Here it is!

422
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,000
Here it is!

423
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,260
As expected, the chief of staff of the United Nations is a regular customer.

424
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,280
People who say this is bad are not human!

425
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,080
The chief of staff of the United Nations!

426
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,200
The chief of staff of the United Nations!

427
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,740
Wait!

428
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,600
Well, how about the taste of the soba?

429
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,140
How about the taste of the soba?

430
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,820
The way the soba is kneaded,

431
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,940
the way the soup is made,

432
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,100
the way the leeks are cut,

433
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,880
and even more,

434
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,360
this artistic bowl!

435
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,940
I made it!

436
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,840
Whichever you take is good!

437
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,440
It's really not a normal one!

438
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
I'll give you the proof that this Omaeda Chogoro's

439
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,500
top-notch is not a normal one!

440
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,620
Seven stars!

441
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,440
You must be happy, too!

442
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,000
Hey, you!

443
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,820
What's going on?

444
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,100
What are you doing?

445
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,900
You're a rude guy!

446
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,720
Shut up!

447
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,420
Look at him!

448
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,640
Shut up!

449
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,940
Shut up!

450
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:12,840
Shut up!

451
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,660
Tanaka Soba?

452
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,100
You still don't remember me?

453
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,580
You still don't remember me?

454
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,780
You still don't remember me?

455
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,600
What's this place?

456
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,860
You finally remember me.

457
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,780
You're the Tanaka Soba

458
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,300
who made the -7-star soba

459
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:27,540
three years ago!

460
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,980
What?

461
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,320
What's going on?

462
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,120
What's going on?

463
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,560
This place has been making soba

464
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:33,920
for three years,

465
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,100
and it's still the same!

466
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
It's been using the best ingredients

467
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,660
from the first class for a long time!

468
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,820
It's been using the best ingredients from the first class for a long time!

469
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,040
I wonder if that's true.

470
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,740
It's been using the best ingredients from the first class for a long time!

471
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,000
You saw yourself belittling him yourself!

472
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,700
You saw yourself belittling him yourself!

473
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,780
It really means you can't understand the taste of soba!

474
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,440
You saw yourself belittling him yourself!

475
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:50,760
Oh no!

476
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,140
You can't call yourself anаче

477
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,260
or a gourmet两聖子,

478
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,140
it's just a loss of one flavor!

479
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,320
that's all.

480
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,180
You've gotta be kidding me!

481
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,740
Are you serious?!

482
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,440
Just make it clear to me!

483
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,920
N-No comment!

484
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,860
Tanaka Soba,

485
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,900
We did it!

486
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,620
The plan was a success!

487
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,380
The magic soba restaurant was built, but Oomaeda's was a disaster.

488
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,240
Tanaka-san's soba restaurant has been in good shape since then.

489
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,240
Yeah.

490
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,620
But since then, Oomaeda-sensei has been very quiet.

491
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:28,900
What?

492
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,340
What's wrong?

493
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,560
A mysterious home cooking critic has appeared.

494
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,700
Recently, a person who is known as a home cooking critic has appeared in the city,

495
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,840
and has been eating with his family in the city.

496
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,560
Is this Oomaeda-sensei?

497
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,180
He's such a guy!

498
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,900
He's not just a normal person.

499
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,380
He's not just a normal person.

500
00:23:53,300 --> 00:24:05,920
If you want to study,

501
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,260
you can't make a living by only memorizing ideas.

502
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,240
Having a quality life is what makes a life meaningful.

503
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,980
Learning style through your body.

504
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,880
I'll teach you the practical ways for studying!

505
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,280
Next time, the preposition test in the preparation ritual.

506
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,760
Take care and look forward to it!

507

Don't stare at me

514

Let's laugh and live

515
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:57,360
Even if it rains today

516
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,240
