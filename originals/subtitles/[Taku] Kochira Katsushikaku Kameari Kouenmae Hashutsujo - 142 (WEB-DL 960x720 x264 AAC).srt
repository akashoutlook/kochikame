The year, 1999.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,380
The sudden outbreak of war seemed to be a long-term situation.

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,820
Later, it accelerated to a slowdown.

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,020
and then...

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,200
Stop!

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,200
You can't catch me!

34
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,620
I'll make you turn around from here!

35
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,760
Tensai!

36
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,260
It's a good match.

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,440
No way!

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,520
I did it!

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,580
It's been two hours and fifteen minutes.

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,260
I finally won!

41
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,260
Fight, Trump's Dome!

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,340
How frustrating!

43
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,120
Even though I'm Trump, I lost to Ryo-chan!

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,780
Then, I'll let the loser get a penalty.

45
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,680
A penalty?

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,100
What's this?

47
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,680
Reiko-san!

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,320
Yeah!

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,880
Yeah!

50
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,560
Yeah!

51
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,680
Yeah!

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,640
Yeah!

53
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,360
Yeah!

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,300
What are you doing, senpai?

55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,860
I lost to Trump, so I'll get a penalty.

56
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,040
Trump?

57
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,540
I'll definitely pay you back.

58
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,980
Hey, the war will take time, so let's make it a faster match next time.

59
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,980
Then, how about speed?

60
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,340
Speed?

61
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,520
I want speed.

62
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,740
Speed.

63
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,520
It's a game about speed.

64
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:20,700
It's a game about speed.

65
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,520
You have to take out a card from your hand, and you have to take out the rest of it regardless of the mark.

66
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,040
The one who loses the fastest wins.

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,480
If it's speed, I've never lost before.

68
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,200
You're stupid.

69
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,200
You think I can win with speed?

70
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Ready, go!

71
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,660
3 and 9.

72
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,100
So it's 4 and 10.

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,240
You're too naive, Reiko!

74
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,580
You're too naive, Reiko!

75
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,380
You're too naive, Reiko!

76
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,680
It's so fast!

77
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,960
What are you? A speed patrol!

78
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,440
This is...

79
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,820
The speed of Senpai is so fast that I can see many of your hand solar plexus.

80
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,140
The game of soldier mode.

81
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,020
Ouch!

82
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,260
Ryosan is so strange.

83
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,100
It turns out even Reiko didn't play any.

84
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,400
The balance is too much.

85
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,640
You know how hard it is?

86
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,840
It's ten years faster than winning with speed.

87
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,600
Then, let's play a penalty game.

88
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,240
One more.

89
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,940
Let's play it together next time.

90
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,280
How about Indian Poker?

91
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,520
Indian Poker?

92
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,340
You put a trump card on your forehead and the one with the most numbers wins.

93
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,840
Thirteen is the strongest.

94
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,640
I can't see mine.

95
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,560
That's different from the normal poker.

96
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,320
If you think the opponent is stronger, you'll get off.

97
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,040
I see.

98
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,180
Match ball is the tip.

99
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,280
Let's go.

100
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,880
One, two, three!

101
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,820
They are so strong.

102
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,740
I can't beat them.

103
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,820
I can't beat them at all.

104
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,500
I can't beat them at all.

105
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,100
I can't beat them at all.

106
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,860
Then, it's a tip.

107
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,500
First, five.

108
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,220
I'll get off.

109
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:17,960
I'll get off.

110
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,340
I'll get off.

111
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,220
Was it this?

112
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,820
I'm so frustrated. I shouldn't have got off.

113
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,940
Now I don't know how to play.

114
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,040
Nakagawa, what are you going to do?

115
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,020
Me?

116
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,860
Get off or play with me?

117
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,880
Which one?

118
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,700
That's...

119
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,220
Ten!

120
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,660
What are you going to do, Nakagawa?

121
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,040
Wait a minute.

122
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,500
Senpai.

123
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,360
I have three cards.

124
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,020
Normally, I have a low chance of losing.

125
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,460
But Senpai's confidence...

126
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,820
Could it be that I have one or two?

127
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,960
Twenty.

128
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,540
You're going to play a game, aren't you?

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,900
Don't regret it.

130
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,620
Thirty.

131
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,360
It's okay to play a game.

132
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,800
But don't regret it later.

133
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,300
It's a game, Nakagawa.

134
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,160
I'm going to get off.

135
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,280
I'm going to get off.

136
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,160
Good.

137
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,200
I'm the winner.

138
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,000
I've got five.

139
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,620
Three.

140
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,160
Two.

141
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,840
Benz price, this time.

142
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,520
That's right.

143
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,220
Ten.

144
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,240
I won't do that.

145
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,940
I will win.

146
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,100
Three.

147
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,140
O!

148
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,760
Ten!

149
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,140
Seven!

150
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,040
Eight!

151
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,420
Nine!

152
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:34,980
Ten!

153
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,260
You can't watch it!

154
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,860
Ryo-chan, why don't you just do a no-fault game?

155
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,740
No way! I don't have the fun of playing games then!

156
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,920
Huh? I have an idea. A game that's no-fault but still fun.

157
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,640
Huh?

158
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,980
The winner sits on the chair, and the loser is kneeling on the ground.

159
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,340
An ultimate game.

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,660
An ultimate?

161
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,620
Game?

162
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,660
The game is called...

163
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,060
"The Wind of the Wind".

164
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,620
"The Wind of the Wind"?

165
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,400
I don't know.

166
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,820
What kind of game is it?

167
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,460
I've brought it, Ryo-tsu!

168
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,380
Hey, Sakonji Okuda!

169
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,940
Senpai, what is this chair?

170
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,380
It's a no-fault chair that you use when playing Daito.

171
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,580
The winner is the only one to sit on this chair.

172
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,280
Huh? This is...

173
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,520
Hey! I told you this is a no-fault chair!

174
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,460
Don't touch it!

175
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,280
I can't afford to lose today's game.

176
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,820
Why not?

177
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,720
Huh?

178
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,720
Ah!

179
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,520
A Doki-Memo cushion!

180
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,420
I've never been able to become a no-fault.

181
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,600
But I have the will to win.

182
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,500
I can't let you take this chair away from me!

183
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,340
It's over!

184
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,580
"The Wind of the Wind" is a game where you get a bigger number of cards than the previous players, and the one who dies first wins.

185
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,160
Three is the weakest, and two is the strongest.

186
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,380
If you get two or more cards in the same number, you can get them all at once.

187
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,180
Then I'll go first.

188
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,860
Three...

189
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,620
Then I'll go with eleven.

190
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,800
Wait a minute!

191
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,640
I'm going to throw away the cards that are smaller than four!

192
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,440
No, eleven is the smallest.

193
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,420
What?

194
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,440
One.

195
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,360
Hey, what's with Reiko?

196
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
Because the only cards in the picture are one and two.

197
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:13,820
What?

198
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,620
Me too!

199
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,840
Then, are these two the only ones with strong cards?

200
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,000
I can't win.

201
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,140
I can't give up. Saori's chair is on it.

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,240
Thirteen, double.

203
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,820
One, double.

204
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,100
Eleven.

205
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,280
Twelve.

206
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,440
One.

207
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,500
Eleven, double.

208
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,720
Twelve, double.

209
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,120
Twelve, double.

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,500
Two, double.

211
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:40,880
Two, double.

212
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,580
Pass.

213
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:41,600
Pass.

214
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:41,900
Two.

215
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,560
Two.

216
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,280
Thirteen.

217
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,300
I'm number one!

218
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,180
Two.

219
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,280
Two.

220
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,940
Twelve.

221
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,360
I'm number two!

222
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,540
No! Saori!

223
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,820
Then I'll go next.

224
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,340
Three and...

225
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:55,580
Three and...

226
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:55,820
Four.

227
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,400
Four.

228
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:56,660
Five.

229
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,320
Five.

230
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,660
Five.

231
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,300
All I have now is one card.

232
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,780
I know you'll say, "No, 4, no, 14."

233
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,200
I know.

234
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,200
But I never really remember the number.

235
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,380
If Saori was number one,

236
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,640
that would mean she knew it.

237
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,280
Really?

238
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,580
I'm so sorry for him.

239
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,800
I don't know what to do.

240
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,940
I'm at my limit.

241
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,160
Three and...

242
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,680
Five.

243
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:19,920
Three and...

244
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,140
Three and...

245
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,900
Your game is useless.

246
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,060
"You're useless."

247
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,120
"You're useless."

248
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,400
"You're useless."

249
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,080
This bloke.

250
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,680
"You're useless."

251
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,640
"You're useless."

252
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,660
-The last one! -That's so dirty, Terai!

253
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,580
Why don't you take out one?

254
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,940
I'm not trying to be a traitor.

255
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,520
I don't want to be the last one.

256
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,320
That's right, Senpai.

257
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,680
You remember Ryo-chan, don't you?

258
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,640
What will happen to the last one?

259
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,400
What?

260
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,420
Damn it! I didn't expect to sit here.

261
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,340
Terai-san doesn't have a seat, Sakonji-san has one,

262
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,500
I have three, and Kei-chan is the top.

263
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,880
Then I'll take a seat.

264
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,160
What... what is it?

265
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,800
Nothing.

266
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,380
It's a natural right of a great man to sit there.

267
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,040
I-I see.

268
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,260
Then...

269
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,400
What is it?

270
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,000
You can sit.

271
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
I don't mind.

272
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,420
Then...

273
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,420
Then let's sit on the back.

274
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,680
That's good, right?

275
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,620
If you want to do that, then it can't be helped.

276
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,480
Then...

277
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,180
If you want to do that, then it can't be helped.

278
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,220
Hey you, Biri, hand over the trump!

279
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,360
I understand, mess!

280
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,100
I'll go off the wall holdin' it right then and there!

281
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,440
My two luckys has come, that'll give me another shot!

282
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,280
My two luckys has come, that'll give me another shot!

283
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,100
Ryo-san, you give it up!

284
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:40,820
Huh?

285
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,280
Huh?

286
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,540
I have to be the last one to hand out the two best numbers in my wallet to Daifugo.

287
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,200
There are two groups of Buffy here, so you should share both of them.

288
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,360
We're starting to run out of space.

289
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,580
Yes, senpai.

290
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,180
Damn, I came all the way here.

291
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,100
Oh, my goodness. I've become a terrible person.

292
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,720
Then, I'll start with Ryo Iri.

293
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,640
You're the boss.

294
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,840
Huh?

295
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm sorry. That's exactly right.

296
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,820
See? I knew it.

297
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,920
Damn it. Don't think you can live like this.

298
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,700
"Diamond Five-Round"

299
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,880
Impact! Diamond Five-Round!

300
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,800
I didn't think you would have such a hand.

301
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,160
Can you do this, senpai?

302
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,700
Yes, you can put the same number of lines on the same table.

303
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,600
Ryo always uses this rule.

304
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
So, there are various local rules.

305
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,440
So, don't complain that the rules are different.

306
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,240
Everyone, give up.

307
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,240
Okay, this is the end.

308
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,520
I did it, Saori!

309
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,380
But, Kei-chan has already gone up, so it's three.

310
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,120
Oh, when will I reach your place, Saori?

311
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,420
Damn, I only have one more.

312
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,940
Is it a rematch between the Terai and me again?

313
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,840
Ryo, pass?

314
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,780
Yes, you.

315
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,920
Can I give it up?

316
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,380
Hey, let's start the game.

317
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,660
Then, I'll give it up.

318
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm going to do a rematch.

319
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:24,600
In fact...

320
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,740
Oh, it's a draw...

321
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,020
Wait a minute.

322
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,120
Eh, can you give it up, Ryo-san?

323
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,540
I don't think so...

324
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,620
Pass.

325
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,420
Then, let's start the "Double Five-Round."

326
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,080
Ah, I got it!

327
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,140
It's a non-civilian-competitive pair attack.

328
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,180
Ryo-san, you said "Pass."

329
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,580
Pass.

330
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,420
Double Seven.

331
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:42,620
Pass.

332
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,700
Double Nine.

333
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,600
Pass.

334
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,680
Three, please.

335
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,200
I lost.

336
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,180
Ryo-chan, you're getting the best of it...

337
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,800
It fits perfectly in your seat.

338
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,740
Shut up!

339
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,240
I had a F and a 2 at first.

340
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
If I had that, I could have won.

341
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,700
You're a loser.

342
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,480
I should have avoided my first card.

343
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,100
Saori!

344
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,900
I can't get up because I'm going to take the card.

345
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
Even if you say that, that's the rule.

346
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,840
The odds are falling and the big bad is more and more against.

347
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,560
That's the rule.

348
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,100
This is Japan.

349
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,560
It should be capitalistic.

350
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,660
It's unfair.

351
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,400
This game is capitalism.

352
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,780
Eh?

353
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,540
Those with power will win.

354
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,080
That's unfair.

355
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,800
Those who stop the poor will be equal.

356
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,340
That's the world of capitalism.

357
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,320
Isn't that socialism?

358
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,220
You seem to be fundamentally mistaken.

359
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,000
Eh?

360
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,160
You think you're poor and make a fool of yourself.

361
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,220
No, Ryo. Don't say that.

362
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,320
Is there any big bad that is big bad?

363
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,920
It's the same.

364
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,080
That's what you said.

365
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,380
You're right.

366
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,920
The real poor are Billy and Booby.

367
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,760
It's the poor's fault.

368
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,120
Ryo, calm down. It's a game.

369
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,040
Don't you want to become a big bad?

370
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,140
Don't you want to be the best in the game world?

371
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,780
But I don't want to become a big bad.

372
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,720
You're so naive.

373
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,200
It's a man's way of life to get up with any hand.

374
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,780
Ryo is the only one who does that.

375
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,420
Any hand?

376
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,380
Yes.

377
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:18,540
Right.

378
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,040
I was just curious.

379
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,340
These guys were all amateurs.

380
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,260
There was nothing fanciful about the game.

381
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,700
This game is fun.

382
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,720
It is.

383
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,500
Even the amount of Nico-nico is popular here.

384
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,240
I'll use it.

385
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,760
The ultimate hidden trick, the picture card.

386
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,260
You collect cards when you have one or two good cards, and they come up.

387
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,500
When you cut it, the good part will not move.

388
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,760
You only cut the upper part.

389
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,400
When you hand them out, just take out your own cards from the bottom.

390
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,840
Like this...

391
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,400
I did it! It's perfect!

392
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,100
Here, Senpai.

393
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,460
Nakagawa, you gave him a third one.

394
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,860
It's from Ryo-chan.

395
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,920
I'll show you how I do a great miracle!

396
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,680
I'll show you how I do a great miracle!

397
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,080
It's a King's Three-card!

398
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,800
What's this card all of a sudden?

399
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,460
It's a long-term card.

400
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,260
Hey, are you going to hand them out or not?

401
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,620
Pass.

402
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,240
Pass.

403
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:28,840
Pass.

404
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,180
Then it's my turn.

405
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,760
Ace's Four-card!

406
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,180
-It's amazing! -It's amazing!

407
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,100
Double Two!

408
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,240
-It smells good! -It smells good!

409
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,380
And finally, Nakagawa gets the third pair.

410
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,000
Kei-chan, did you really exchange them?

411
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,660
Yes. It's true that Senpai gave me two of them.

412
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,340
Then... then all the good cards went to Ryo-chan.

413
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,140
How could this happen?

414
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,120
Then I'll apply the rule of the country.

415
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,020
The rule of the country?

416
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,940
The rule of the country.

417
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,740
If the best one gets the top,

418
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,020
the worst one gets the bottom.

419
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,220
If the best one gets the bottom,

420
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,600
the worst one gets the top.

421
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,960
Then I'll be the bad one!

422
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,860
Then I'll get closer to Saori.

423
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,820
Sakonji-san is in the middle,

424
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,620
so you can't change your position.

425
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,640
That's not true.

426
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,080
That's...

427
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,720
I haven't even put out one card yet!

428
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:32,860
Shut up!

429
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,400
Come on, move!

430
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,960
That's my seat!

431
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,920
Sigh...

432
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,500
What a mess.

433
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,440
The rules are rules.

434
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,860
Even if it's a mess, the rules are rules.

435
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,700
Well, let me get closer.

436
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,260
This is good.

437
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,060
Saori!

438
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,300
The big bad guy's seat is comfortable to sit on.

439
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,020
Saori!

440
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,600
Ryo-chan, what are you doing?

441
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,260
You won't forgive my Saori!

442
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,720
You won't forgive me?

443
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:09,980
What are you talking about?

444
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,340
Who are you talking to?

445
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,820
If you're upset,

446
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,380
come here yourself.

447
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,880
I'll take care of Saori until then.

448
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,540
Hehehe.

449
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,080
S-sorry, Saori.

450
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Please hold on a little longer.

451
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,940
Then I'll give you the card.

452
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,440
It's a good job for a big bad guy.

453
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,380
Hohohoho...

454
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,540
Huh?

455
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,180
Hey, wait a minute!

456
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,240
W-what?

457
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,040
I'll give it to you.

458
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,700
Eh?

459
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,340
But...

460
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,820
It's the best man's job to give the card.

461
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,680
Why? You're a big bad guy.

462
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,960
I told you it's good for the best man.

463
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,880
Shut up!

464
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:47,940
What?

465
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,100
I'm not like you.

466
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,380
I know the suffering of the poor.

467
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,140
Even if you're a big bad guy,

468
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,800
you're doing the work you don't like.

469
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,760
That's dangerous.

470
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,320
If I don't pack it properly,

471
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,280
I'll be in trouble.

472
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,440
This is the best hand for a big bad guy.

473
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,800
Senpai.

474
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,440
Yes?

475
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,200
Hmm...

476
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,660
Oh, this is the best.

477
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,340
It's a good card.

478
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,240
Then,

479
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,260
I'll take care of this.

480
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,820
Oh!

481
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,560
A better card than the one I gave you has returned!

482
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,500
What?

483
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,720
Hohohoho...

484
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,940
Maro is a kind man.

485
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,860
But is it really good?

486
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,840
It doesn't matter.

487
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,200
Start early.

488
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,700
Then I'll start.

489
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,660
Yes.

490
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,980
From 3 to 13,

491
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,020
it's a series of cards.

492
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,720
No!

493
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,740
I can't believe it.

494
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,300
I've never seen this before.

495
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,560
Ryo-chan, it's a joke.

496
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,200
No, it's not a joke.

497
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,220
I can't stand such stupid things.

498
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,520
It's a pile of cards.

499
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,360
Senpai gave it to me.

500
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,620
What?

501
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,860
What do you mean by a pile of cards?

502
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,840
It's a game of picking a good card for yourself.

503
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,080
Come to think of it,

504
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,840
Ryo-chan's hand was too good.

505
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,560
That's right.

506
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,440
And it's a big failure.

507
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,920
but it's strange that I don't have the duty to hand out cards.

508
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,340
Senpai, no way.

509
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Well, Boku-chan,

510
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,940
let's go back to the meeting room.

511
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,800
Because Boku-chan is the one who will cut the trump card.

512
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,840
So, Nagagawa-chan,

513
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,280
you go there.

514
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,380
I don't like it.

515
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,600
Everyone is so suspicious.

516
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,700
I don't blame you.

517
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,580
Damn it.

518
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,900
I can't put it in anymore.

519
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,780
Are you not going to leave now, Ryo-chan?

520
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,440
Fine.

521
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,280
But why are you just standing there?

522
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,040
I'm sure you're thinking like that.

523
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,460
The others here are also MIKE.

524
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,260
You two have to get out of here as soon as possible.

525
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,620
introductions

526
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,360
I just said nothing.

527
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,060
Let's go back to our meeting room.

528
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,420
It's been a long time.

529
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:05,920
Another double?

530
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,160
Gah!

531
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,640
Come on! Pick it up, you poor things!

532
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,980
Here, a double for eleven.

533
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,200
So you had it.

534
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,520
Hey, here's your favorite, a shot.

535
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,040
Shut up!

536
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,620
This is an important moment, so stay quiet.

537
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,360
Hi, my sweet honey. How are you?

538
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,360
Sorry for making you lonely.

539
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,000
Now, drive my Porsche to the tavern.

540
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,460
Sorry, but I'm getting a little sick, so go over there.

541
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,580
Here, ten!

542
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
Why aren't you going to take Reiko?

543
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,220
I'm begging you, everyone, mind your own business!

544
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,140
Pass, pass, pass.

545
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,860
Why don't you join us, Shiratori-san?

546
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,900
The Grand Fugou.

547
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,900
The Grand Fugou?

548
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,620
It's a game that's good for me.

549
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,600
No, it's not an exaggeration to say it's a game for me.

550
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,560
Okay, I'll be happy to join you.

551
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,680
Shiratori's in, so let's start over.

552
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,060
That's unfair.

553
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,100
This is...

554
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,740
There are two "Ni"s, right?

555
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,720
It's a chance to become a Grand Fugou!

556
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,480
Hey, Shiratori, you're a beginner, so I'll let you do it first.

557
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,840
You're foolish. I'll make you regret it right away.

558
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,040
Look at me!

559
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,920
This is the true power of the Grand Fugou.

560
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,000
N-no way!

561
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,440
Two "Ni"s all of a sudden.

562
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,080
How's that? Did I scare you?

563
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,320
You're an idiot!

564
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,560
What did you say?

565
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,460
What are you going to do after this?

566
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,220
What did you say?

567
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,580
Oh no! The rest is just "Kasu"!

568
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,920
Pass.

569
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,740
But if you don't play, it won't be a game.

570
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,620
I-it can't be helped.

571
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,580
Here.

572
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,720
Yes.

573
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,560
Yes.

574
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,440
Yes.

575
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,160
Yes.

576
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,780
Yes.

577
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,300
Pass.

578
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,720
Yes.

579
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,600
Yes.

580
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,040
Yes.

581
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,040
Pass.

582
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,420
Yes.

583
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,300
Yes.

584
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:06,860
Yes.

585
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:07,820
Yes.

586
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,520
Pass.

587
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,160
Yes.

588
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,060
Yes.

589
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,220
Yes.

590
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,040
Yes.

591
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,880
Yes.

592
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,060
Pass.

593
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,060
So Shiratori is the best.

594
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,200
It's too late to be alive. I'll be a Grand Fugou right away!

595
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,660
I'm not forgetting anything about Billy's Shiratori,

596
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,320
but I have to give you a card.

597
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,200
I know!

598
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,540
Lucky!

599
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:32,980
Lucky!

600
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,140
This time, two cards are four.

601
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,340
Here, Shiratori-san.

602
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,660
Yeah.

603
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,680
But there are still two cards, so it's okay.

604
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Hey, it's your turn. Hurry up and give it to me.

605
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:43,620
Hmph.

606
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,400
Look at this.

607
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,740
My card!

608
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,660
Here it is!

609
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,260
What?

610
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,160
No one can cut this card.

611
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,580
I-I can't cut it, but...

612
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,300
So, what are you going to do after this?

613
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,580
What did you say?

614
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,400
Oh no!

615
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,140
It seems to be going to be the same as before.

616
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,280
What?

617
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,280
Let's see.

618
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,020
Hmm...

619
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,020
This will make Shiratori-san Billy 20 times in a row.

620
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,700
It's not like he's just bad at cards.

621
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,580
He only sends out big cards.

622
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,980
Well, in other words, he's a weakling.

623
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,400
I've never seen someone so weak.

624
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,500
From here on, I'll call you Billy-kun.

625
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,240
See, Shiratori-Billy-kun?

626
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,440
See, Billy-Billy-Shiratori-Billy.

627
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,560
You're as like a game as you really are.

628
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,800
Huh?

629
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:29,940
Huh?

630
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,000
Even if the game is Billy, I'm a big loser in reality!

631
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,260
Take this!

632
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,800
That's what happened yesterday.

633
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,360
Just like the game, I became a poor person in the real world.

634
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,280
You must be satisfied too.

635
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,980
I really thought I'd be a loser...

636
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,460
Sorry, I wasn't mean, Billy-kun.

637
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,860
I won't be a loser again!

638

639
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:59,760

Check out the description for the

642
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,520
I will make something like this

643
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,660
Next time "Departure Robot Police"

644
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,980
Thank you for watching
