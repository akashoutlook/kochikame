00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,800
ENG SUB by

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,260
You should look at the face of the room like a mirror.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:11,460
Hey!

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,620
Hey!

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:26,580
You should look at the face of the room like a mirror.

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,440
I kicked the love stone, and I flew to the shoe

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:41,920
I wonder if I'm going to go to the gym that I was saving

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,140
I laughed at the fact that it was still a

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,660
I laughed at the fact that it was still a

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,520
I laughed at the fact that it was still a

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,020
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can't win

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,140
Sushi,

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:03,200
It's kind of perlex

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,320
From the water channel of the Tungari bus,

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,860
The sunset goes down to theesi

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,800
Tomorrow is also a blue sky

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,900
Yes, I put my head down

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:23,780
Yes, I put my head down

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, I put my head down

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,420
It's over, right?

21
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,420
If I win, I'll lose again

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,400
I lost my happiness

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,200
I realized

24
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,620
Because I'm an idiot

25
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,440
Don't call me papa!

26
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,060
Huh?

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,440
Huh?

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,620
It's a baby!

29
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,320
Who are you? Where did you come from?

30
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,860
Who's there?

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,480
The baby is crying!

32
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,640
What are the parents thinking about?

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,780
If they're left in front of such a cold place, they can't take a nap, can they?

34
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
Hey! Don't be so quiet!

35
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,000
You're laughing

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,740
Is something on my face?

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,100
I'm home

38
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,080
Hey, Reiko

39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,900
What a cute baby!

40
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,720
Whose baby is it?

41
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,540
It's a stolen one

42
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,620
What?

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
It seems the search request has not come out

44
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,160
After all, is it a stolen one?

45
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,320
I can't believe that they abandoned such a cute baby

46
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,540
Who is it?

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,500
You don't know who left it?

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,720
It must be sleeping

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,020
It's the time to report an emergency or deliver a stolen item

50
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,140
Don't lie

51
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,060
I can't believe you can't satisfy even the hotel

52
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,680
Shoo! Shoo!

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,560
What?

54
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,500
Shoo! Shoo!

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,320
It says Shoo! Shoo!

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
The diaper is wet, isn't it?

57
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,020
I think there was a new diaper in the car

58
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,660
Oh, this one?

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,280
Who is it?

60
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,580
Let me see

61
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,300
Here

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,840
What?

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,120
Good, good, it felt bad

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,980
You have a good hand, Chief

65
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,560
When my grandson Daisuke comes, I always change diapers

66
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,780
What?

67
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,440
It looks like a letter

68
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,540
It came out from under the diaper

69
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,020
What?

70
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,300
I'll read it

71
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,340
This is your son

72
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,920
Please take Taro with you until he comes to pick you up

73
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,860
This baby is called Taro

74
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,140
Didn't you just say your son?

75
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,700
What?

76
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,500
Come to think of it...

77
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:00,700
Kazue

78
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,040
So, someone here is Taro's father

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,660
What?

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,360
Who is he? Tell me honestly

81
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,760
According to the probability

82
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,140
What?

83
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,780
Are you doubting me?

84
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,860
Anyway, Nagagawa is a housewife who comes from over there even if she is silent

85
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:22,960
He is a strange man

86
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,340
It wouldn't be strange to have ten or twenty children

87
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,120
Senpai, don't say like an old man

88
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,920
Nakagawa, look into my eyes

89
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,820
Do you really remember me?

90
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,660
No

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,080
Nakagawa is white

92
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,940
So, you believe in me? Chief

93
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sure that you are a policeman

94
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,020
If I say white, you are white

95
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,600
That's right, Ryo-chan. Kei-chan is not that kind of coward.

96
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,920
That's right, Ryo-san.

97
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,920
What?

98
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,640
Rather than playing around like Nakagawa,

99
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,000
a guy as serious as you is the real deal.

100
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,120
See?

101
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,000
Your nose looks exactly like mine.

102
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,420
Ryo-san...

103
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,620
Hurry up and put on some weight, you old man.

104
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,500
I-I-I'm not going to cheat on you!

105
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,860
Look at my eyes.

106
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,120
Chief...

107
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,820
It's white.

108
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,660
These eyes are the eyes of the honest who don't lie.

109
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,880
Thank you, Chief.

110
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,720
No, the honest who don't lie may have made a mistake once.

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,960
Ryo-san, I'll get angry if you don't stop!

112
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,240
Then, the Chief will stay.

113
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,020
Here.

114
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,060
What?

115
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,280
No way.

116
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,720
Chief Ohara is suspicious.

117
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,700
I can't believe he's so suspicious.

118
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,220
That's right, Ryo-chan.

119
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
It's not true, is it?

120
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,500
I'm the son of a grandchild.

121
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,840
In this case, the probability that the person who no one thinks is the real culprit is very high.

122
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,440
I-If you say so...

123
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,140
No way...

124
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,260
Only the Chief...

125
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,500
What's with that "maybe"?

126
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,580
There's a medicine that can help you soon.

127
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,080
I can't be compared to you because you're an old man.

128
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,260
You idiot!

129
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,860
Good night!

130
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,280
I'm sorry, I was so surprised.

131
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,760
Chief, please look at my eyes.

132
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,940
What?

133
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,100
If you don't remember them, you shouldn't be afraid.

134
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,980
Of course, I want to.

135
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,180
There's an unusual movement in the black eye.

136
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,320
It's because you're all together!

137
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,280
I don't think I'm the Chief.

138
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,540
I think so, too.

139
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,240
Yes.

140
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,000
Thank you, thank you.

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,620
I'm going to be interesting from now on.

142
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
What's wrong with you, Ryo-san?

143
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,580
That's right. Ryo-san is still here.

144
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,320
That's right. Senpai is one of the suspects, isn't he?

145
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,580
I don't care.

146
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,040
Can you prove it?

147
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,480
Look at this round-eyed person who doesn't lie.

148
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,740
I can't even see the truth.

149
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,400
It's a big liar's eye.

150
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,860
It's an eye that's trying to get rid of the responsibility.

151
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,000
It's an eye that can't even be placed on a man's umbrella.

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,040
It's a cowardly eye that can't even be placed on a man's head.

153
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,500
You're all so mean!

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,560
When Ryo-chan is in a bad mood, he'll make a big noise.

155
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,760
Papa!

156
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:29,900
What?

157
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,280
He just said "Papa."

158
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,820
He said "Papa" when he saw Ryo-san's face?

159
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,600
I heard it, too.

160
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,600
Me, too.

161
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,100
Here, Ryo-chan.

162
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,960
That's not true, is it?

163
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,020
Papa!

164
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,340
Hey, don't say anything bad about him.

165
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,560
Papa!

166
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,700
Hey, this old kid can only say "Mama" and "Papa."

167
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,280
So, he can say "Papa" and "Papa" to anyone he sees.

168
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,340
What?

169
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,840
What?

170
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,280
What?

171
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,060
You're such a fool!

172
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,180
Ryo-chan, you're such a coward.

173
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,180
No, I'm not!

174
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,460
That's proof that your eyebrows are not moving.

175
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,500
You're a coward, Ryo-chan.

176
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,180
That's true.

177
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,100
You don't remember anything at all.

178
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,960
I don't know anything, Chief!

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,080
Until your mother comes back, you'll be responsible for her child as a person and father.

180
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,660
You can go home now.

181
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,020
No way!

182
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,920
Papa!

183
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,580
I'm not Papa!

184
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,020
I'm Nureginu!

185
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,880
Good work!

186
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,700
I wonder if he'll be all right.

187
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,500
I don't think he can take care of a baby all of a sudden.

188
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,680
No matter how much he cares about his father,

189
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:44,940
he's still a child.

190
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,640
Wait, Ryo-chan!

191
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,640
I'm coming with you!

192
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,040
Which one do you want to have your hair dyed?

193
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,100
Papa?

194
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,900
The one you'll never have to get a new one.

195
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
There's no way that's possible.

196
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,500
Why do I have to do this?

197
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,280
Oh, my cute boy.

198
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,660
You're just like your father.

199
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,620
He's not my child!

200
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,360
Papa! Papa!

201
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,540
Papa!

202
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,500
Hey, you're calling me Papa, aren't you?

203
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,400
Huh?

204
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,420
You're just kidding.

205
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,640
I'm your father, so you have to behave yourself.

206
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,140
Don't talk like that, Papa!

207
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,440
Ryo-chan,

208
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,520
you should just talk to him like that.

209
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,980
It's because you call me Papa!

210
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,860
That's what I'm saying.

211
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,660
No!

212
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,240
Papa!

213
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:36,880
No!

214
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,220
Papa!

215
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,640
This is a nightmare.

216
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,600
Papa!

217
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:41,680
Papa!

218
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,800
Papa!

219
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,900
Ah!

220
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,660
I cleaned up, because it was so dirty.

221
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,920
My Promo!

222
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,160
My game!

223
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,340
Hello, Mrs.

224
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,020
Welcome.

225
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,620
The head of the club asked me to take you home with your baby, so I asked to make a phone call.

226
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,320
I was too nervous.

227
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,340
Because I had no other choice but to come to this room.

228
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,080
If you stay here, I don't have to worry.

229
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,200
He's dead.

230
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,820
Come on, Taro. This is your home.

231
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:12,980
Welcome.

232
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,280
You're a strong kid.

233
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,020
Oh, a triangle robot.

234
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,300
You were safe, weren't you?

235
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,720
Good, good.

236
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,760
Hey, don't break it.

237
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,480
Taro, you won't just give away toys, right?

238
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,540
It's not just a toy.

239
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,800
This is a toy I made for the boy jet

240
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,680
as a model for the triangle robot.

241
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,620
It's Yonezawa's robot that's gone now.

242
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,320
Ryo, you're already a father.

243
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,440
It's not the time to play with toys.

244
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,940
That's why I'm not a child.

245
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,980
Hey, that's not food. Give it back.

246
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,520
Boy, you must be hungry.

247
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,460
I'm preparing the rice.

248
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,320
Ryo, you take Taro to the bathroom.

249
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,100
Me?

250
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,740
Well, good luck, Dad.

251
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,780
Oh, Reiwa.

252
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm going.

253
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,160
Yeah, yeah.

254
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,200
Why don't you say "Mama"?

255
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,400
Papa.

256
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,780
Papa.

257
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,820
I don't know.

258
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,500
If you're going to be a human, say "Thank you."

259
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,920
That's Ryo's hidden treasure.

260
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,240
Yeah, the hidden wife made a debt and ran away with a young man.

261
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,100
The story is getting bigger and bigger.

262
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,360
Good.

263
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm going in one more time.

264
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,840
Okay, huh?

265
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,520
Uh-oh.

266
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,200
I'm going to be the first who get any food from the original costs.

267
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,660
Huh?

268
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,320
Get dinner on time.

269
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,060
Uh-oh.

270
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,440
I'm calling for it.

271
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,500
Don't push it so hard.

272
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,640
Keep it really gentle.

273
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,760
You're weak.

274
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,200
I'll take care of the other two kids.

275
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,100
You're fine.

276
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,120
Take care of Yoro-chan, too.

277
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,240
Let's go, advice is always helpful.

278
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,420
Come on.

279
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,060
Wow wow...

280
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,160
Hey, what's up, Grandma? You're acting so differently!

281
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,300
I've always said that children are precious!

282
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,220
I'm not kidding! I've been being swung around by this guy since morning and I'm sick of it!

283
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,580
Once the real parents show up, I'll give you plenty of baby-sitting pills!

284
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,300
I understand. This is a service, so you have to take care of it properly!

285
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,960
I have to do that...

286
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,340
I knew it, Grandma! You know what to do!

287
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,060
I'll give you a glass of water...

288
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,080
What's this?

289
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,280
Wow wow...

290
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,740
You're just like the mischief lovers!

291
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,240
Hey, Maro! It's 11 o'clock! Stop sleeping already!

292
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,780
Teiju!

293
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,120
Are you serious? Go to sleep!

294
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,580
Go to sleep!

295
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,100
Ugh...

296
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,240
Do whatever you want! I'm going to sleep!

297
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,380
Grandma!

298
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,020
Shut up!

299
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,500
Grandma!

300
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,700
I said I'm going to sleep!

301
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,960
Grandma!

302
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,640
Huh?

303
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,060
You're a piece of shit.

304
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,140
Here.

305
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,240
Here.

306
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:40,900
Here.

307
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,700
Here.

308
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,520
What is this?!

309
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,140
Taro!

310
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,360
Ryo?

311
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,240
This is your job, right?

312
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,780
Taro, where have you gone this whole time?

313
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,760
This is me, Ryo.

314
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,860
Taro! Where are you? Taro!

315
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:03,940
Dad!

316
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,120
You're the father? I just bought it!

317
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,660
I'll have to pay for it!

318
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,920
N-no way!

319
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,260
You're such a good boy.

320
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,240
Yeah.

321
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,140
Listen, you and I have the same eyebrows, but we're different people.

322
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,000
We're different people.

323
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,000
That means I don't have any rights or responsibilities to take care of you.

324
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,200
Do you understand?

325
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,180
Taro!

326
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,300
You should be grateful for taking care of me.

327
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,160
No!

328
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,480
Shut up!

329
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,380
Go somewhere!

330
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,820
Dad!

331
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,920
I don't care anymore!

332
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,360
I thought you were a baby, but you were just a baby.

333
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,080
Taro!

334
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,520
Hey! Where are you going?

335
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,420
Taro! Stop the motorbike!

336
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,500
Where's the floppy?

337
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,660
It's here.

338
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,800
In here?

339
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,020
Yeah.

340
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,200
The guys in the company are starting to notice.

341
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,400
I want to stop them this time.

342
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,140
Don't be so cocky.

343
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,580
This is a deal.

344
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,000
You pay for it, don't you?

345
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,520
Huh?

346
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,220
What?

347
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,900
It's gone!

348
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,160
That car!

349
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,400
Dad!

350
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,560
What are you doing?

351
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,160
Chase after him!

352
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,320
Stop!

353
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,820
Taro!

354
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,100
It's a cut!

355
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,600
This is bad.

356
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,200
Hey, Ozo!

357
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,680
Get on!

358
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,480
Are you alright?

359
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,960
Hey, listen...

360
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,980
Stop this car right here!

361
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,560
He's getting out of control!

362
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,260
It's not a lorry, daddy!

363
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,660
Stop!

364
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,180
I'm on my way!

365
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,400
He's getting out of control!

366
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,900
Hey, stop it!

367
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,080
Please stop the car!

368
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:16,740
What are you doing?

369
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,900
Stop the motorbike!

370
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,200
Stop, stop the motorbike!

371
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,280
*Slow motion*

372
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,900
*Slow motion*

373
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,000
*Slow motion*

374
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,320
*Slow motion*

375
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,200
*Slow motion*

376
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,380
Hey!

377
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,760
Haven't you seen the baby?

378
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,160
No way...

379
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,660
Batman!

380
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,900
Huh?

381
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,780
*Slow motion*

382
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,360
Why are you over there?

383
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,280
Is there no one else?

384
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,960
The stairs?

385
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,100
I can't help it.

386
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,900
The police kid.

387
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,100
It's bad if we get back to them first.

388
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,320
It's bad.

389
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,680
*Slow motion*

390
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,140
*Slow motion*

391
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,720
*Slow motion*

392
00:16:59,720 --> 00:16:59,780
*Slow motion*

393
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,220
It's heavy.

394
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,260
Let's help him.

395
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:01,940
Sorry.

396
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,100
*Slow motion*

397
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,180
Watch out!

398
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,440
*Slow motion*

399
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,520
*Slow motion*

400
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
Are you alright?

401
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,360
I'm just a kid.

402
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,420
I got it.

403
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,120
*Slow motion*

404
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,440
*Slow motion*

405
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,080
*Slow motion*

406
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,400
*Slow motion*

407
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,840
*Slow motion*

408
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,220
*Slow motion*

409
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,840
*Slow motion*

410
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,860
*Slow motion*

411
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,520
*Gasping*

412
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,740
Eh?

413
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,560
You're not moving!

414
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,360
*Gasping*

415
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,520
*Gasping*

416
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,580
*Gasping*

417
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,800
*Gasping*

418
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,740
*Slow motion*

419
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,120
*Gasping*

420
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,140
*Gasping*

421
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,340
*Slow motion*

422
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,240
Taro!

423
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,820
Are you alright?

424
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,680
I'm fine.

425
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,780
When did you get here?

426
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,140
This is ours!

427
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,140
It's mine!

428
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,540
Taro!

429
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,020
Wait for me!

430
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,920
I found it!

431
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,000
No, it's not.

432
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,460
This isn't the robot I brought.

433
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,180
Then the kid will still be here.

434
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,120
Let's go!

435
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,140
Let's stop.

436
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,740
This is very troublesome.

437
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,680
Don't joke!

438
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,740
This started when you were a child!

439
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,860
Hey, the police!

440
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,520
You idiot! Are you going to kill me?

441
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,280
But...

442
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,460
It's fine.

443
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,460
Call the police!

444
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,100
A strange police officer took my trainer!

445
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,200
Please help me!

446
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:24,960
No!

447
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,520
I'm tracking down the DAP and a strange sedan with a strange engine!

448
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,260
Ask the police for help immediately!

449
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,760
The police officer's child!

450
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,320
Let me go!

451
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,380
I have nothing to do with it!

452
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,600
It's over!

453
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,340
You're a thief too!

454
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,080
If you don't get your revenge, you won't have a life!

455
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,260
What is it?

456
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,580
Are you sleeping?

457
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,980
Why are you crying?

458
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,220
There's a strange child!

459
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,900
I'm glad I'm safe.

460
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,300
It's Taro!

461
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,780
Ryotsu!

462
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,340
Senpai!

463
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,460
Bujo!

464
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Nagata! Reiko!

465
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,860
I'm fine.

466
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:18,700
I'm fine.

467
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,100
I'm not hurt.

468
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,580
Don't worry about me!

469
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,780
Ryo-chan is a teacher from the chief.

470
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,820
Senpai, please reflect on yourself as a father.

471
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,800
I'm sorry.

472
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,780
I'm a fool to let a child be in such a dangerous situation.

473
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,220
If it's a terrible situation, it's our fault, chief!

474
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,240
Baba!

475
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:35,820
Huh?

476
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm sorry.

477
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,520
What's wrong with the robot?

478
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,440
Huh?

479
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,760
This isn't my robot.

480
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,860
There's a gap in this place.

481
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,580
What's this old thing?

482
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,000
A floppy?

483
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,320
Ryotsu-san, actually...

484
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,960
Oh, I found it.

485
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,020
It's a floppy!

486
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,640
Those two were working part-time as industrial spies in the police office.

487
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,700
And this is?

488
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,940
Oh, it's mine.

489
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,440
A good gift.

490
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,580
Yeah.

491
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,340
Well, I did the normal job as a policeman.

492
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,320
I knew that they were criminals at first sight.

493
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,980
It just happened to be a coincidence.

494
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,760
Yeah.

495
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,260
Yeah, that's part of the skill.

496
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,760
Dad!

497
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,720
What?

498
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,280
Hoshi!

499
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,720
The award ceremony for Taro has just ended, hasn't it?

500
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,960
Yeah. Ryo and the others are late.

501
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,200
We're back!

502
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,320
Huh?

503
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,360
What's that?

504
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,820
I'd like Taro to appear in our show.

505
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,180
For now, we'll pay him 100 million yen.

506
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,260
I see. 100 million yen.

507
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,040
And you?

508
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,940
I'd like Taro to appear in our new show.

509
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,740
The cast is Ryoko Hirose.

510
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,800
I see, I see.

511
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,720
Ryo is just like Taro's manager.

512
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,500
In the end, Senpai is changing love for money.

513
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
He's so stingy.

514
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,060
I see, I see.

515
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,700
And who's next?

516
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,340
Ryo!

517
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,780
I found Taro's parents!

518
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,020
What?

519
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,340
They're connected!

520
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,480
Taro...

521
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,280
Dad!

522
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,960
Dad!

523
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,300
Hey!

524
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,600
Dad!

525
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,120
Dad! Dad!

526
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,060
Dad!

527
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,020
Taro...

528
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,500
Dad.

529
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,800
I'm so glad.

530
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,160
I'm sorry, Taro.

531
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,960
Dad!

532
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,580
You can say it yourself?

533
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,160
Taro...

534
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,040
Mama...

535
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,260
Why did you throw it away?

536
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,500
I didn't!

537
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,920
We got divorced right after Taro was born,

538
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,780
and she took Taro.

539
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,440
But I lost the confidence to raise him on my own,

540
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,640
so I left Taro in front of his apartment.

541
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,660
Huh?

542
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,780
But the cart was in front of the station!

543
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,140
My apartment is three blocks from this station.

544
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,820
I put three of my papers next to it.

545
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,040
Maybe he came here to take something.

546
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,500
I saw the news this morning, and I was surprised to contact him.

547
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,020
It's a shameful story.

548
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,700
Thank you very much.

549
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,840
Taro!

550
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,560
You'll never forget this!

551
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:31,620
Hey!

552
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:31,780
Wow!

553
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,540
Hehe.

554
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,300
Hehe.

555
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,440
Hehe.

556
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,320
Bye, Nato.

557
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,580
Hm?

558
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,600
Taro!

559
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,520
Bye-bye, Baba.

560
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:49,840
Huh?

561
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,040
Bye-bye!

562
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,560
Taro!

563
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,420
Come play again!

564
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:31,600
