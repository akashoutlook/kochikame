1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:03,940
A

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,600
When watching TV

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,700
Remember to keep your room light, and look away

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,960
The house after a rainy day

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:25,320
That seems to be someone's home

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,360
After the rain, I walked while looking back

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,180
My mom was holding my hand

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:42,080
I felt a strange feeling at that time

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:51,640
So I walked on the black tile of the arcade

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,180
I saw it

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,280
Everyone was a kid once

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,680
But everyone forgets

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,240
A politician with a great face

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,780
A blue aunt above his eyes

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,080
Look around

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,160
That corner

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,780
I can see everyone

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,100
There is a wall

19
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,620
There must be a wall

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,460
Come to our town

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,720
Thank you!

22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,480
It's starting tomorrow, right?

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,000
The Sydney Olympics

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,780
What's wrong, Ryo?

25
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,460
I feel like something important happened at the Olympic year

26
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,960
I think you said the same thing when you were in Atlanta

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,900
Didn't you talk about cicadas?

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,360
Cicadas?

29
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,320
I remembered

30
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,420
Fat cicadas

31
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,800
Minmin cicadas

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,860
Tsk-tsk hat

33
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,060
Sunflowers

34
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,920
Ah! Sunflowers!

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,560
I'll sleep for 4 years

36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,820
I'll wake up for only one day

37
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,640
I'll solve all the difficult cases in the long run!

38
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,420
Super-powerful police officer!

39
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,640
You're Higurashi Neruo, right?

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,940
Yes, sir!

41
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,040
Tomorrow is the fourth year since Higurashi slept

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,860
So, Ryo

43
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,580
Can you wake up Higurashi tomorrow?

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,680
Me again?

45
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,760
It's hard to wake him up

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,120
By the way, it was hard to wake him up four years ago

47
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,140
I'm excited to go into that room again

48
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,100
I'm getting more and more excited

49
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,340
Wait a minute

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,980
Where is Higurashi now?

51
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,640
Where?

52
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,820
It's definitely in Nico Nico Ryo

53
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,480
Ah!

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,520
I remembered!

55
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,280
When Ryo was being repaired

56
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,260
He threw Higurashi with the trash

57
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,440
So, he woke him up on the island of dreams

58
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
It's a big deal

59
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,600
I see

60
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,900
So, what happened after that, chief?

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,140
Idiot

62
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,500
Nico Nico Ryo's Higurashi room is gone

63
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,840
So, I left it to the head of the town

64
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,280
You're the one who left it

65
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,960
That's right

66
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,680
To the head of the town's spirit room

67
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,660
That's why, tomorrow

68
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,860
I'm going to the head of the town

69
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,100
Wake up Higurashi

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,500
Okay, Ryo?

71
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,760
Yes, yes

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,360
I understand

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,600
Why do I have to wake Higurashi up?

74
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,520
But Higurashi is good

75
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,680
I can get paid even if I sleep all the time

76
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:42,780
Wait

77
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,680
By the way, four years ago

78
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,240
Before Higurashi fell asleep

79
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,300
Ryo was stressed

80
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,600
You could take a look at the documents

81
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,700
Please

82
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,080
For my brothers

83
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,440
They're longer than me

84
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,260
Higurashi won't

85
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,940
do the same things

86
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,060
Because I'm sleeping

87
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,980
Don't worry

88
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,000
All right

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,540
I'll sleep

90
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,740
No problem

91
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,480
This wasn't good

92
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,060
It's true

93
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,460
You were worried

94
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,040
Ryou

95
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,100
Don't be me

96
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,120
Because of you

97
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,360
I thought I'd just have to pay him back the 30 million yen, so I secretly borrowed the 30 million yen.

98
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,760
Then I found out that the 30 million yen was gone at the end of the road.

99
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,420
I thought I did something bad, so I was worried for a night.

100
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,120
But I forgot the next day.

101
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,640
Oh, no! If they find out that I used it...

102
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,580
Hey, you! Don't you dare say anything about my money!

103
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,360
Ugh! I-If I don't do something about it, I'm going to die!

104
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,020
The End

105
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,140
Ryo, if you succeed, you'll really be able to pay me for our overseas trip, won't you?

106
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,080
Hey, if you don't mind, I can let you go on a space trip with Jody in 2001.

107
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,120
A space trip? Not bad.

108
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,160
Yes, then I'll do it.

109
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,260
What was that just now? That was a pretty loud noise.

110
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,140
The End

111
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,380
I don't get it.

112
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,460
I understand that they're supposed to be around here...

113
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,080
Arghhh!

114
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
I was wrong. I was next to it.

115
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,200
Is it really alive?

116
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,900
Don't worry and get him out of here.

117
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,020
What is this room?

118
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,320
My senpai told me to recreate the room of Higurashi-san.

119
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,020
And the finishing move is this.

120
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,680
Did he really live in this room?

121
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
It's already perfect.

122
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,440
It's perfect.

123
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,320
All that's left is to build a

124
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,620
fire escape room in Ryo's garden.

125
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,480
A fire escape room?

126
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,380
A fire escape room in Niko Niko Ryo's garden?

127
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,340
Okay, all set.

128
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,140
I'll wake Higurashi-san up.

129
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,960
You guys do as I say.

130
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,100
Okay.

131
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,080
Hey, wake up, Higurashi.

132
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm still sleepy.

133
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,180
Hey, wake up!

134
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,880
The Sydney Olympics have begun!

135
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
It's the year you started working!

136
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,960
The Sydney Olympics?

137
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,340
I think the last time I woke up was the Sydney Olympics.

138
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,220
Darn it.

139
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,460
I woke up a year and a half ago,

140
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,620
and I said that and you fooled me.

141
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,440
It's all my fault.

142
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,780
I'm still young.

143
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,460
I'm 2000 years old.

144
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,360
The Olympics are starting today.

145
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,700
Something's wrong.

146
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,180
Something's wrong?

147
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,300
I'm gonna take a shower and change into my uniform and go to work.

148
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,260
The sun's so bright.

149
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,300
Look.

150
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,720
You're pretty well-prepared.

151
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,560
I'm waking you up every four years.

152
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,620
You'll get used to it.

153
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,420
Let's go.

154
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,020
Isn't it this way?

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,320
Why is there a fire escape room in front of Ryo?

156
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,940
While you were asleep, I moved in.

157
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,620
From a fire escape room in front of the park,

158
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,180
it became a fire escape room in front of the Nico Nico.

159
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,700
Good morning, everyone.

160
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,460
Good morning.

161
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,740
When did you start working at the fire escape room?

162
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,880
While you were asleep,

163
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,120
there was a fire escape room.

164
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,400
And this is the newcomer, Volvo Saigo.

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,360
Nice to meet you, Mr. Higurashi.

166
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,100
I heard from the head of the Ryo-tsu branch.

167
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,300
The head of the Ryo-tsu branch?

168
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:37,800
The head of the fire escape room?

169
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,560
What about the head of Ohara?

170
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,440
He moved to the Ryo-tsu branch.

171
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,000
And I became the head of the fire escape room.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
I heard he's still dreaming.

173
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,280
Hey, don't sleep.

174
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,000
You have to do a lot of things with your superpowers.

175
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,200
Superpowers?

176
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,240
I can see it.

177
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,980
The soccer representative of Japan will participate in the World Cup.

178
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,560
I came out two years ago.

179
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,560
The song of the Dango may be a big hit.

180
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,180
I'm sure it will be a big hit.

181
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,780
Such a boom has already ended.

182
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,800
The Kochikami may become a movie star.

183
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,480
It's not just a movie, but it's also a stage.

184
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,060
The national tax may be used correctly.

185
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,180
I don't think so.

186
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,700
I can't get any good sleep.

187
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,220
It can't be helped.

188
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,680
I'll go to training for you.

189
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:26,960
Training?

190
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,360
Higurashi, go!

191
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,240
Yes.

192
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,340
I'll go soon.

193
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,760
A programme for you!

194
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,100
Good for you, Higurashi.

195
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,400
If you have Higurashi's superb powers,

196
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,840
you can easily get back the 300 dollars you spent on it

197
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,580
and come fishing.

198
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,540
What?

199
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,080
Ryo-tsu is in danger?

200
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,920
I got a call this morning,

201
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,320
super hot temperature is appropriate for him.

202
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,680
He's asleep.

203
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,000
These fools have been taking a day off

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,840
I'm sure it's a day off!

205
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,340
I brought the unresolved investigation file to solve the problem with Higurashi-san.

206
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,920
What should we do?

207
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,380
Higurashi can work only for one day today.

208
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,420
Let's leave Ryotsu alone and go to wake him up.

209
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,840
I ate it.

210
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,500
It's a great superpower to eat the specialties of an eel.

211
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,220
Thank you for the meal.

212
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,620
Senpai, we have patrols.

213
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,840
Good work.

214
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,540
Don't forget about the sword.

215
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,040
Leave it to me.

216
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,740
Let's get down to business.

217
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,660
Where's the unresolved investigation file?

218
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,740
I don't have the file.

219
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,340
I want you to get a fire.

220
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,720
What are you going to do?

221
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,120
The culprit of the goldfish.

222
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,820
He loves gambling.

223
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,180
I'm sure he'll come to the match tomorrow.

224
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,600
I see.

225
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,500
We have information that the culprit always watches the match near the goal.

226
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,560
I want you to get a fire on the moment the horse reaches the goal from the first to the twelfth race.

227
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,220
The culprit may be in the picture.

228
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,160
I can do it.

229
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,520
I saw it.

230
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,280
Take this.

231
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,400
Take this.

232
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,460
Take this.

233
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:25,960
Take this.

234
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,000
Take this.

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,240
Take this.

236
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,080
Take this.

237
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,100
Take this.

238
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,640
Take this.

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,020
Take this.

240
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:34,980
Take this.

241
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,920
Take this.

242
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,960
Take this.

243
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,200
Take this.

244
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,320
Take this.

245
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,480
Take this.

246
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,480
Take this.

247
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,220
Take this.

248
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,500
Take this.

249
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:46,860
Take this.

250
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,360
Take this.

251
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:47,860
Take this.

252
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:47,900
Take this.

253
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,480
Take this.

254
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,760
Take this.

255
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,980
Take this.

256
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,620
Have you ever thought about me?

257
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:53,720
I've thought about you all.

258
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,360
I'll tell you why I'm here today.

259
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
Let's play some game.

260
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,020
Good job

261
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,180
The final number is 5.5 times 7 and 8

262
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:08,600
1 times 130 times 2 times 12

263
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,220
It's like this

264
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,880
I can't display it

265
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:14,900
God

266
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,500
99.26 billion times

267
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,620
If you buy a rock and roll it at 100 yen

268
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,860
It's 99.26 billion yen

269
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,000
I think it's good

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,100
I think I asked Ryotsu for something when I was sleeping

271
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,080
It's a Japanese series

272
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,020
It's a Japanese series

273
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,480
Bad video broke

274
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,940
I couldn't shoot it for 4 years

275
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,740
It's a pity

276
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,640
Bad

277
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,360
I left it to Ryotsu

278
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,960
It was a problem of 2000 years last year

279
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,240
The computers in the world are malfunctioning

280
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,260
The world is in chaos

281
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,820
What?

282
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,060
It wasn't that big

283
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,260
Did you fire the missile?

284
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,260
I'm glad there's nothing

285
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,980
That's right

286
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,920
I'm thirsty

287
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,380
Yes

288
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,080
I'll buy you a juice

289
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,220
Then use this

290
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,640
You have a lot of money

291
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,840
I took the money and slept the next day

292
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,280
I don't use it

293
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,120
Lend me a little.

294
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,500
You have 200,000 yen.

295
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,280
If you transfer this money to the market,

296
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,760
it will become a astronomical amount.

297
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,020
Higurashi, this money is old and useless.

298
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:36,820
What?

299
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,900
There are a lot of fake money,

300
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,320
so I changed it to new money six months ago.

301
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,780
I'll change it to new money.

302
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,400
See?

303
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,940
That's right, new money.

304
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,360
And it's 2000 yen.

305
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,360
But I should have given you 200,000 yen.

306
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,860
I see, you didn't know.

307
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,800
At the same time as the new money was issued,

308
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,660
it became a denomi in Japan.

309
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,340
Denomi?

310
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,840
Yes, that is, the unit is reduced by two.

311
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,420
The old 100 yen is now 1 yen.

312
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,200
The 1 million yen is now 10,000 yen.

313
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,280
I didn't know.

314
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,600
Has the world changed so much?

315
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,560
Anyway, I'll buy you juice.

316
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,440
Wait for me.

317
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,140
There's no Higurashi.

318
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,980
He's already awakened.

319
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,880
That's not true.

320
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,820
Every year, Higurashi will never wake up until Senpai wakes him up.

321
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,180
Until Ryotsu wakes him up?

322
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,460
It's Ryotsu.

323
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,540
It must be his doing.

324
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,740
Did something big happen?

325
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,480
When you enter the capital,

326
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,120
you can't think of it as Senpai's doing.

327
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,840
There must be a specialist.

328
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,960
Anyway, I don't know Ryo.

329
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,780
Let's go eat.

330
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,240
It's hot.

331
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,680
I've been exposed.

332
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,060
What's wrong, Higurashi?

333
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,760
What's up with this idol?

334
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,780
Is it something from Okinawa again?

335
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,900
It's Morning Komusume.

336
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,680
It's a big hit produced by the Kuntsu of Sharanpi.

337
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,200
It was five at first,

338
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,240
but it became eight,

339
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,580
and then one left,

340
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,760
and then another one came in,

341
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,660
three more,

342
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,100
five more,

343
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,520
and it's probably about 50 now.

344
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,780
I see.

345
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,180
I especially like this one.

346
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,260
It's Mari Goto, who will make her solo debut this time.

347
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,260
Oh, it's Mari.

348
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,200
She's so cute.

349
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,160
Let's continue the investigation.

350
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,260
Higurashi is weak to women.

351
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,180
What's going on this time?

352
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,480
Mari is appearing live.

353
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,700
Ryotsu, let's go see the TV.

354
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,960
No, no.

355
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,480
You're only awake for one day today.

356
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,220
There's still a lot to do.

357
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,920
Hello?

358
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,540
This is bad, Senpai.

359
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,260
I've been exposed.

360
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,140
The chief of the Oogara club is heading there now.

361
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,080
I understand.

362
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,320
I'm going to get out of here.

363
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,580
You do what you don't know.

364
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,260
But...

365
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:06,800
All right?

366
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,680
Yes.

367
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,980
Higurashi.

368
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,100
Let's go see Mari.

369
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,420
Really?

370
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,140
Yes.

371
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,460
Then I'll call you back.

372
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,520
He's not here.

373
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,740
It's Mr. Honda's room!

374
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,340
What?

375
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,060
What's wrong, Nakagawa?

376
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,380
I think he used it to trick Higurashi.

377
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,640
It's like a spy plan.

378
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,260
What's wrong?

379
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,920
He's out!

380
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,380
Ryotsu!

381
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,540
He's a coward.

382
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,320
Don't act like a coward!

383
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,100
What's that?

384
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,960
Look, chief.

385
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,980
I see.

386
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,600
Ryotsu has seduced Higurashi into predicting tomorrow's match.

387
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,680
It's like Senpai's doing it.

388
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:01,820
Yes?

389
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,600
I thought it was easy.

390
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,820
But it looks like he doesn't know where Ryo-chan is.

391
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,020
Now all we have to do is catch Mr. Honda.

392
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,540
Ryotsu.

393
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,500
I'll catch you even if you split the grass!

394
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,100
The last challenger, Shimizu!

395
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,860
There's no time! 10 seconds left!

396
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,420
He's doing it! He's doing it!

397
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,240
Jump at once!

398
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,240
He did it! It's a success!

399
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:31,860
Congratulations!

400
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,420
The winning prize is 1 million yen!

401
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,920
Thank you very much!

402
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,200
Shimizu-san, there are still other wonderful presents.

403
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,320
What?

404
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,140
Today's special guest is Goto Mari-chan, the morning girl!

405
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,620
Oh, it's real Mari-chan!

406
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,760
Congratulations!

407
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,780
If it succeeds, Mari-chan will do such a good thing.

408
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,880
Let's go to the next challenge!

409
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,960
The next challenge is...

410
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
That one!

411
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,600
It's 50 meters high!

412
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,520
The top of that platform!

413
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,640
If you jump from there, you'll get 1 million yen!

414
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,140
If you have the courage to do it, please get on the stage!

415
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,160
Okay!

416
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,680
Ryo-chan, you're not going?

417
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,760
I'll do 1 million yen plus Mari-chan's kiss.

418
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,340
I don't care about the kiss, but 1 million yen is fine.

419
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
It's 100 million yen before tomorrow's Okuman-choja.

420
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,820
Okay, let's go!

421
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,680
Chief! Kya-chan! Where's Honda-san?

422
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,000
I've come to see him. But I don't know where he's going.

423
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,600
I have to know the location.

424
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,100
Damn it! Where did Ryo-chan go?

425
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,020
The players have left!

426
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,440
It's about the senior. They're doing something terrible.

427
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,240
Or do you want Mari-chan's kiss?

428
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,420
Chief, this is bad! Ryo-chan and Higurashi-san are on TV!

429
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,680
What?

430
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,360
What are you doing?

431
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,460
They're really doing something terrible.

432
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,120
Okay, let's go to the TV station!

433
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,060
Let's go to the TV station!

434
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,740
Let's go!

435
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,220
I'm going to be in danger!

436
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,560
Me, too!

437
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,420
I'm going to be in danger, too!

438
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,700
Me, too!

439
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,580
No way!

440
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,560
You're so mean.

441
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,920
Higurashi, it seems you're going to have a match with me.

442
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,560
I'll take Mari-chan's kiss.

443
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,500
Wow! Higurashi-san flew!

444
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,500
Amazing!

445
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,480
Amazing!

446
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,460
Amazing!

447
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,240
He just barely made a hole in the water, but he landed!

448
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,020
Higurashi-san's got super powers.

449
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,540
Well, I can jump in, too.

450
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,120
Okay!

451
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,640
Chief!

452
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,120
Ryo-chan, come down here!

453
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,840
Chief Ohara, didn't you go to Saihase-cho?

454
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,700
Chief Ohara, didn't you go to Saihase-cho?

455
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,880
Higurashi, you're being tricked by Ryo-chan.

456
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,100
I'm still the chief of the

457
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,200
What?

458
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,880
What?

459
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,660
That's a lie!

460
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
That's a lie!

461
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,640
That's a lie!

462
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,660
What?

463
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,480
What?

464
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:17,700
What?

465
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,280
What?

466
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,920
What?

467
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,500
What?

468
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:21,920
That's lie!

469
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,800
That's a lie!

470
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,300
The Honda and Volvo are lying about everything!

471
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,440
You'll be finished soon!

472
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:35,940
Higurashi, calm down!

473
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,460
The superiors are lying!

474
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,540
I don't believe them!

475
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,660
How about the 30 million yen you saved?

476
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,920
I'll be the chief tomorrow to pay you back.

477
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,140
I'll be the chief tomorrow to pay you back.

478
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,760
I knew you were cheating!

479
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,140
I won't lose!

480
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,180
I won't lose!

481
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,120
It's dangerous.

482
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,960
I won't lose!

483
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,300
Amazing!

484
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,980
Turn the camera!

485
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,860
I won't let you escape!

486
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,300
It's a big deal!

487
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,440
Mr. Higurashi was a super-powerful man!

488
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,720
Mr. Higurashi was a super-powerful man!

489
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,460
The Sydney Olympics is starting today.

490
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,320
The Sydney Olympics is starting today.

491
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:22,800
Kimura will be the winner.

492
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:22,980
Kimura will be the winner.

493
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,760
What's the point of the weather today?

494
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:35,080
The ballast observatory has fallen!

495
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,060
The ballast observatory has fallen!

496
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,480
Something is in front of us now!

497
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,720
It's a dragon!

498
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,220
It's a dragon!

499
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,020
I'll bury the first blow with the biggest power!

500
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,020
I'll bury the first blow with the biggest power!

501
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,620
Stop it, Higurashi!

502
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,000
If you do more...

503
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,220
Stop it!

504
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,820
Stop it!

505
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,840
I can't hear you!

506
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,840
Higurashi is weak to women.

507
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,720
Especially to Goto Mari.

508
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,260
Mari, let's pray together.

509
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,800
What?

510
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,700
Mari, let's pray together.

511
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,020
Higurashi!

512
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,460
Mari, let's pray together.

513
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,500
Higurashi, please calm your anger.

514
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,460
Higurashi, please calm your anger.

515
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,720
Higurashi, calm your anger.

516
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:34,820
Please!

517
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:38,960
Oh.

518
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:56,200
One hour later...

519
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,600
I...I'm back to normal...

520
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,100
Mar-Mari...

521
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,240
Yes...

522
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,340
Give me your signature, please.

523
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,880
Here you go.

524
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,140
Thank you. I'm so happy.

525
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,420
Oh, Higurashi!

526
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,560
Higurashi, don't sleep! You haven't done any work yet!

527
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,740
Higurashi, wake up! Higurashi!

528
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,900
Wake up!

529
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,960
What?!

530
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,700
You want me to deduct Higurashi's salary from my salary for the next 4 years?

531
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:37,160
Of course. Higurashi fell asleep after that and didn't solve any case.

532
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,140
And the TV station has a request.

533
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,040
No way!

534
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,400
Well, that's how it is. You should quit and get a good job.

535
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,820
Ouch! What's going on? I'm so tired!

536
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,240
