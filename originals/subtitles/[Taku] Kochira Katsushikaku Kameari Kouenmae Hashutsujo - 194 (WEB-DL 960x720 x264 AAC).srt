1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,580
Let's Go Home

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,800
When watching the TV, make the room bright and look away from the TV.

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,920
Come to me, people without money!

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,940
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:35,900
Look at the blue sky and white clouds

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,120
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

7
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,300
Come to me, you jobless man

8
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but don't worry

9
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,560
Look, the red moon is burning

10
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,100
The red moon is burning

11
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,640
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,480
I know, I know, I know

13
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,780
If you know, shut up and follow me

14
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,240
Go, Sosamo!

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,920
Did you understand?

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,380
If you understand, don't ever be late again!

17
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,900
Eeeh?

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,660
Ah, you're so noisy in the morning, aren't you?

19
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,200
Eeeh?

20
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,460
Eeeh?

21
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,420
Oh no!

22
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,140
I forgot to come to Yamanaka today!

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,320
Eeeh?

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,740
Well, there's a park called Toyo in that area, isn't there?

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,980
Oh, Toyo Elementary School?

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,820
It's close to Toyo Elementary School, isn't it?

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,120
By the way, Ryo-chan

28
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,000
Ah!

29
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,180
Huh?

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,680
When did you come?

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,500
Ryo-chan, you're going to get out again!

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,280
But he's not noticed at all

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,180
Ryo-chan is really a genius of escape

34
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,860
Damn it, the No. 2 is crazy there

35
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,540
This is also a debt life this month

36
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,240
Maruhi

37
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,300
Passing through point A

38
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,680
Passing through point B

39
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,040
I've been feeling something for a while

40
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,280
Maruhi has noticed

41
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,120
Okay, ready!

42
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,820
Ah!

43
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,560
What is this?

44
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,640
Ah!

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,660
Damn it!

46
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,260
Damn it!

47
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,780
Ah!

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,140
Damn it!

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,580
Damn it!

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,560
Damn it!

51
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,580
Damn it!!

52
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,200
Damnit!!

53
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,840
Damnit!!

54
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,760
Damnit!!

55
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,580
C You are kidding me

56
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:23,800
Uh ...

57
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,280
Welcome back, Ryo-chan

58
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,300
Oh, jeez!

59
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,200
C Presents

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,400
K

61
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,780
K

62
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,100
R

63
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,660
U

64
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,020
I'm going to punish him.

65
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,020
80%?

66
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,440
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,900
I won't do it again.

68
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,300
I can't eat if he punishes me 80%.

69
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,860
Please, chief.

70
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,160
Then, Ryotsu, I'll give you a special task.

71
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,900
Special task?

72
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,100
Yes.

73
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,100
We're going to use a new system to find the culprit.

74
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,320
We'll do a big investigation training with 101 police officers and the police station.

75
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,700
The suspect is set to escape, and the suspect will be in the area where the PHS signal reaches Tokyo 23 district.

76
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,480
And you will be the one to do that escape.

77
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,600
Me?

78
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,540
The fact that you escaped early was proven in the preliminary test.

79
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,460
So that's what happened just now.

80
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,960
What do you think, Ryotsu?

81
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,740
If the case is closed and you escape,

82
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,080
then you'll be the one to be the culprit.

83
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,620
It's like a gold rush.

84
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
Gold rush?

85
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,740
What do you think, Ryotsu?

86
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,440
Will you accept this task?

87
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,480
Yes!

88
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll gladly accept it, chief Ryotsu!

89
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,640
Is it okay to say that to your senior?

90
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,300
If he really escapes, he'll be the one to escape.

91
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll do my best, Ryotsu.

92
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,880
Now, we're going to do a big investigation training as planned.

93
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,240
Everyone, please be a part of this task.

94
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,520
The police officer who played the culprit

95
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,000
will be given a real police officer.

96
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,040
I know that, but we'll have to get the police officer in the know.

97
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,820
I'll see if you can get him to feel safe.

98
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,900
I'm going to investigate juice and take care of it.

99
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:12,980
I know who's in charge of the case,

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,900
Everyone, wait a moment.

101
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:13,940
Please wait, I'll go.

102
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,340
Question 3, you two are scapegoats.

103
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,760
And 3 of you, I'll protect the crime.

104
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,520
Name, situation, topic, number, stage.

105
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,260
Name, situation, topic, stage.

106
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,960
Name, situation, topic, stage.

107
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,740
Name, situation, topic, stage.

108
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,500
Name, situation, topic, stage.

109
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,660
Name, situation, topic, stage.

110
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,520
Name, situation, topic, stage.

111
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,540
I'll be the JR for now.

112
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,500
Let's begin!

113
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,060
Everyone, turn on the PHS.

114
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,220
I've got it.

115
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,320
Right now, the three of us are in front of Tokyo Street Hotel, in the center of Tokyo Station.

116
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,540
I'll capture them all in an hour!

117
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,700
Then, let's go to Yamate Line.

118
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,440
What?

119
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,200
It's already here!

120
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,260
It hasn't even been an hour yet!

121
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,120
Ryotsu, you...

122
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,760
Take them all! Get them!

123
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,960
Is that okay!?

124
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,860
Hey! We're the culprits!

125
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,960
That's true, but...

126
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,820
You stand out when they're all stuck together!

127
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,700
I'm the JR!

128
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,220
I'm the inside!

129
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,300
I'm the outside!

130
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,480
Ryotsu won't make it in time.

131
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,360
Ouch!

132
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,620
Don't be reckless.

133
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,240
The culprit is right there.

134
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,620
The culprit has been separated into three directions.

135
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,720
It seems that a police officer has entered Tokyo Station.

136
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,120
He escaped from the touch screen.

137
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,540
However, this light is the only thing that's on and off.

138
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:48,840
Why?

139
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,700
Probably not inside the car.

140
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,580
Probably outside the car, close to the pantograph.

141
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,880
What!?

142
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,180
Damn it! It's a new car!

143
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,940
I wonder if it's...

144
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,660
The window is open!

145
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:01,860
It's open!

146
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,400
Yes!

147
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,820
The next station is already full of people!

148
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,560
I'm pretty good at this!

149
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,040
Okay, let's switch trains!

150
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,680
He's running from train to train, and then switching trains!

151
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,860
I guess Senpai is the one who does that.

152
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,560
It's amazing how you can tell just by looking at him.

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,360
One of the culprits returns to Tokyo Station.

154
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,160
The police at Tokyo Station have already left.

155
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,720
The police at Yurakucho Station just informed us that the culprit is not on the train.

156
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,200
Send them to Tokyo Station immediately!

157
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,680
Roger that.

158
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,240
Hey, it's Tokyo Station!

159
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,080
That's it!

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,800
Help me with the investigation training!

161
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,820
I got it!

162
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,180
Well, it's about time everyone headed for Tokyo Station.

163
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,420
I'll be right there!

164
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:01,960
It's the police!

165
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,300
Sorry to have you worried!

166
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,300
I'll be counting on you for your investigation training!

167
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,000
The culprit has switched trains again.

168
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,800
What?

169
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,380
He's a tough guy.

170
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,280
What's wrong, Captain?

171
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,740
Are you going to take a U-turn again?

172
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,580
Ah, let's see what's going on for a while.

173
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,560
The culprit is in the middle of the train.

174
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,940
Please ensure that the police are not noticed by the culprit from the front and rear.

175
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,740
Roger that, Captain.

176
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,180
Roger that.

177
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,440
-Captain! -Roger that!

178
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,220
He's fast on the sea speed.

179
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,240
What?!

180
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,600
Oh no! I can't stop him, so there's no escape route!

181
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,220
We've found the culprit!

182
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:49,980
He's driving in the car!

183
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,580
He wasn't on the sea speed!

184
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,040
From the front!

185
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,720
Tatsunosuke Sakonji

186
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,860
I won't let you catch me for free!

187
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,800
I'll teach you how hard it is to arrest me!

188
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,520
-Gah! -Gah!

189
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,660
-How many? -How many?

190
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,640
-How many? -How many?

191
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,700
It looks like the culprit was caught in the center of the ship.

192
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,000
We just got a message that he's fighting with the culprit!

193
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
Alright, well done!

194
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,180
I won't let you get away!

195
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,360
The other one got off the train and is running through the Akehabara electricity district.

196
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,140
It's easier to escape when you're surrounded by people!

197
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,200
-I'm going! -I'm going!

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,860
-That way! -Come on!

199
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,500
-Stop! -Wait!

200
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,880
-You! -You!

201
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,360
-Come on! -Come on!

202
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,400
-Come on! -Come on!

203
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,620
He's gone!

204
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,240
- There! -There!

205
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,420
He's not here!

206
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:09,760
Go after him!

207
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,560
-Wait! -Wait!

208
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,160
Don't let him get away!

209
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,500
Damn it!

210
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,860
Alright!

211
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,680
Goodbye, Akechi-kun!

212
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,520
Damn it...

213
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,820
That was close.

214
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,240
Next is Shinbashi.

215
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,840
A-Heey! I'm very sleepy too!

216
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,500
Mmm...

217
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,520
"I don't have any money, but I can afford to buy a car."

218
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,780
"I don't have any money, but I can afford to buy a car."

219
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,380
"I don't have any money, but I can afford to buy a car."

220
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,360
"I don't have any money, but I can afford to buy a car."

221
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,400
"I don't have any money, but I can afford to buy a car."

222
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:10,800
"I don't have any money, but I can afford to buy a car."

223
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,200
"I don't have any money, but I can afford to buy a car."

224
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,900
"I don't have any money, but I can afford to buy a car."

225
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,240
"I don't have any money, but I can afford to buy a car."

226
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,240
"I don't have any money, but I can afford to buy a car."

227
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,060
"I'm sure that he is on this train."

228
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,540
"Why can't I find my number while driving like a madman!"

229
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,980
"I was message from a helicopter because I can't find my number."

230
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,180
"The man is driving straight."

231
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,040
"The helicopter found the man."

232
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,580
It seems that it's going to attack us.

233
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,080
What!?

234
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,560
The culprit has been transferred to the rock.

235
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,700
What!?

236
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,460
This is the end!

237
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,500
Special forces are coming!

238
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,400
This is it!

239
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,420
Kakuo!

240
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,540
The light has gone out.

241
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,860
The culprit has been transferred to the Shiba Island.

242
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,580
The culprit has been transferred to the Shiba Island.

243
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,680
Special forces are heading to Odaiba.

244
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,040
Damn it!

245
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,260
This is good.

246
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,700
It's like a ride in the sky on an Advalon.

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,560
It's already here.

248
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,160
What!?

249
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,160
What!?

250
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,860
No, I can't anger them!!

251
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,060
I can't!

252
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,320
I'm got food!

253
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,060
I'm got food!

254
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,760
"What's wrong?"

255
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,540
Now this is "Awaiting the At Mess"!!!

256
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,580
Some told me the still-wrestling team justters found the girl being arrested in Advaleon, and apparently disappeared!

257
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,180
What?

258
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,120
The killer was on the highway, probably running away in his car.

259
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,280
Ugh! What kind of people are they!?

260
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,520
............

261
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,940
We can't reach the edge of the river.

262
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,320
So...

263
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,360
Looks like we're off to a good start.

264
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:49,080
You can do it.

265
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,520
Eeeh?

266
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,340
It's repeating again!

267
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,200
Hello?

268
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,920
Hey, Tsuka.

269
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,420
What? Where's Volvo?

270
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,480
Where are you now?

271
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,420
I fell into the truck's bed.

272
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,300
If I run away from the highway, I won't use it.

273
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,580
Are you an idiot?

274
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,700
Why?

275
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,200
Why?

276
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,220
The highway has L systems that are higher than PHS.

277
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,180
And the exit is surrounded.

278
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,120
The police are good at that.

279
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,700
What should I do?

280
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,360
Jump down and get off the emergency stairs.

281
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,160
The

282
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,680
Hey, Volvo!

283
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,440
Volvo was caught.

284
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,300
What did Sakonji do?

285
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:05,580
I'm in the car.

286
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,400
They're in trouble.

287
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:32,960
They're in trouble.

288
00:16:52,400 --> 00:17:03,500
They're in trouble.

289
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,160
They're in trouble.

290
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,660
They're in trouble.

291
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,700
They're in trouble.

292
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,060
They're in trouble.

293
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,500
They're in trouble.

294
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,000
They're in trouble.

295
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,420
They're in trouble.

296
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,900
They're in trouble.

297
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,040
They're in trouble.

298
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:03,700
They're in trouble.

299
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,120
They're in trouble.

300
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,980
They're in trouble.

301
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,640
They're in trouble.

302
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,800
They're in trouble.

303
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,460
The ones I've met are all very stubborn.

304
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,460
Tch.

305
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,720
It's no use talking to me.

306
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,720
Come on, Kirigiri.

307
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,140
Hey!

308
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:42,980
Huh?

309
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,660
The culprit of the robbery...

310
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,340
-Ah! -A-Ah!

311
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:46,640
-A-Ah! -A-Ah!

312
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:46,780
That's right.

313
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,360
If you pull this guy out, I'll be caught too!

314
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,080
-A-Ah! -A-Ah!

315
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,700
What the hell is this?!

316
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,240
-A-Ah! -A-Ah!

317
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,500
-What? -A-Ah!

318
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,720
-A-Ah! -A-Ah!

319
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,240
-A-Ah! -A-Ah!

320
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,580
-A-Ah! -A-Ah!

321
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:57,640
-A-Ah!

322
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,100
You're a cop, aren't you?

323
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,020
Why are you running away?

324
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,480
There are many reasons!

325
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,060
Hey!

326
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,700
You can't go anywhere!

327
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,640
Huh?

328
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,220
We've caught the culprit.

329
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,500
He's probably in the sewer.

330
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,460
Don't let him escape!

331
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,140
Arrest him!

332
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,160
Take him!

333
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,580
Or we'll kill him, too!

334
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,660
Arrest him!

335
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,480
If he was a cop, why would he have him?

336
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,200
-What? -What?

337
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,000
-Why would he do that? - Prioritize him!

338
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,480
I'm not a knight!

339
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm a soldier!

340
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,760
Get out of here!

341
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,120
Finally we caught up.

342
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,040
But someone is with us.

343
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,200
Ryotsu, give up!

344
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,260
Damn it!

345
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,280
It's the police!

346
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,780
Ryotsu!

347
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,260
I'm gonna get caught!

348
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,920
You're the one who's gonna get caught!

349
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,340
Shut up!

350
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,100
Stop!

351
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,480
It's dangerous!

352
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,240
Ryotsu!

353
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,700
He's gonna fall!

354
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,220
Who's there?

355
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,460
This is...

356
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,880
The punishment for the fear of the command!

357
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,820
Please!

358
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,660
Arrest him!

359
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,460
We're all gonna talk!

360
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,420
WHAT!

361
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,080
This is a big prize!

362
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,580
Contact the head Princely Head dept.

363
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,460
Let's settle it in a tight car!

364
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,020
Search the place!

365
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,860
Yes sir!

366
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,200
Reiko, look at this.

367
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,260
Right.

368
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,460
Um...

369
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,780
Oh, I found it.

370
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,820
Huh?

371
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,200
Hmm?

372
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,040
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

373
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,140
Senior!

374
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,540
Ryo-chan the real one?

375
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,880
Yes. Why aren't you looking for me?

376
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,980
The investigation training is already over.

377
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,040
If it's over, tell me right away.

378
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,000
I was running around Tokyo, being chased by my dream every day.

379
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,160
Idiot! Where is the idiot who keeps running for three months?

380
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,260
I don't have a salary because I'm not working!

381
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,120
Well, that's...

382
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,960
I'm done.

383
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,980
No, I'm just an idiot.

384
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,100
Please, go home right now!

385
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,500
I love you so much!

386
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,100
Wait, what is he doing?

387
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,460
It's a big picture, isn't it?
