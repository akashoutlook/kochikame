1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,340
When you watch TV,

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,920
make sure to keep your room bright and keep away from all eyes.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,480
I look up at the fooled sun that floats in the sky,

4
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,260
The cityscape that never changes is strangely gentle

5
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,760
From the main street of Tongari Boshi

6
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,460
To Kaishakuten, the sunset falls

7
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,740
Tomorrow will end like this

8
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,960
Weaboo of Katsushika will forget the happiness

9
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,240
And realize that I am stupid

10
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,400
Kameyon's night is gentle

11
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,220
Wh... what is that?

12
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,960
Eh? What about you?

13
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,680
Let me out!

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:54,720
Let me out!

15
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,260
Isn't this a bento?

16
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,540
That's right.

17
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,560
I said I don't need it, but I made it.

18
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,680
Yes, honey.

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:07,960
Wow!

20
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,020
It's like a Japanese food life.

21
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,460
It's like a Japanese food life.

22
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,640
I didn't know it was still in this world.

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,960
Ryo, what about dinner?

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,660
I have decided that I will have a cup ramen for dinner.

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,620
Look, these are the three dishes I prepared for today's dinner.

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,800
Is cup ramen a smart dinner?

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,980
Of course.

28
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,960
It's been almost 30 years since cup ramen appeared as a revolutionary emergency food that produces a small amount of high energy.

29
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,260
Various menus that are in the middle of the world.

30
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:50,340
The progress of cup noodles in recent years, which have been able to reproduce the taste of the professional until the last minute, and the noodles that have been boiled.

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,900
It's exactly what the heavens gave.

32
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,060
It's a miracle.

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,400
It is even awarded the Nobel Prize.

34
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,700
I don't know if I'm going to eat such a noble food.

35
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,860
I see.

36
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,960
My wife made another one for Ryo.

37
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,240
You don't eat it, do you?

38
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,720
I'll eat both of them, so it's okay.

39
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,260
Well, ramen, yakisoba, fox udon.

40
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,080
Well, where should I start?

41
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,340
I wonder if I can eat it.

42
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,060
Before that, I'll pour the water.

43
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,120
Add the powder and the soup base.

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,860
Now I'm ready.

45
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,520
Aren't you going to eat?

46
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,320
You don't do your best for the rice lunch.

47
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,500
When the water boils, I'll put in the tea and eat it.

48
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
I'll tell you.

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,100
That's the water I'm boiling for my cup noodles.

50
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,700
There's enough water for the tea, right?

51
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,840
Sorry.

52
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,740
I'm only boiling water for a cup of ramen.

53
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,160
I'll consider the amount of evaporation.

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,120
455cc.

55
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,720
So there's no more.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,480
Oh, really?

57
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,340
Then it's fine.

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,620
I'll add the powder and the soup base.

59
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,160
Then it's fine.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,240
I'll add the powder and the soup base.

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,880
Then it's fine.

62
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

63
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,420
Before that, I'll add the ramen soup base.

64
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,980
Add the powder.

65
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,520
Now the soup base.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,460
While waiting for this, I'll add the powder.

67
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:34,860
It's almost over.

68
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:34,960
I'm back.

69
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,680
It's hot.

70
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,540
This is so hot.

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,420
What are you doing?

72
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm not going to do that!

73
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,200
I'm not going to do that!

74
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,260
You're going to do that!

75
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,300
You're going to do that!

76
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,480
You're going to do that!

77
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,480
You're going to do that!

78
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,560
You're going to do that!

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,180
You're going to do that!

80
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,100
You're going to do that!

81
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,820
You're going to do that!

82
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,440
You're going to do that!

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,660
You're going to do that!

84
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,880
You're going to do that!

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,380
You're going to do that!

86
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,020
You're going to do that!

87
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,820
That's great.

88
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,720
That's awesome!

89
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,640
Sorry.

90
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,560
Is this an ice cream bento too?

91
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
What kind of ice cream bento is this?

92
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,400
That face is a loner.

93
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,320
What a poor guy.

94
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,760
Don't make up your face.

95
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,740
Find your wife.

96
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,780
And get her some ice cream bento to make.

97
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,160
It's not my job.

98
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,080
As soon as I marry her,

99
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,580
It's not like I'll get a bento for free.

100
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,340
In other words, you're a fraud.

101
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,000
Congratulations!

102
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,500
Why don't you get married soon?

103
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,200
Oh no!

104
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,420
The hot water evaporated while I was drunk!

105
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,400
Maybe it's too little water.

106
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,340
Shut up!

107
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,780
Ouch!

108
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,200
Are you okay?

109
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,520
Hey, don't just lie there, Terai.

110
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,020
Pour the hot water into the line inside.

111
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,140
Wait four minutes.

112
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,920
You don't need to wait four minutes.

113
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,520
Help!

114
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, it's your wife.

115
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,660
No, no!

116
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
Hurry up!

117
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,100
Wait, what's wrong? Tell me!

118
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,080
You're here!

119
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,300
I'm here!

120
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,420
I'm in my room!

121
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,040
What? You're a newcomer to a room for young women?

122
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,160
Ryo-san!

123
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,780
Chief!

124
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,020
So, are you a thief or a cop?

125
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm a cockroach.

126
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,420
Ugh!

127
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,380
You idiot!

128
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,040
Don't come to the station for that!

129
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,340
I mean, there's no one else to ask for it.

130
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,220
The police's job is to protect the lives of the citizens, right?

131
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,680
That's not what the police do.

132
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,520
It's the security office and the police station.

133
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,060
That's what they do.

134
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,880
There's no one else to look after the health insurance.

135
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,500
Ryo-san, if you're going to look after him, I'll go.

136
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,640
Huh?

137
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,840
I'm feeling a little sick.

138
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
Are you okay?

139
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm scared to go home.

140
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,080
Well, I'll go.

141
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,320
Thanks, Omari-san.

142
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll be back soon.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,300
I'll be waiting for you.

144
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,040
So, is the house near?

145
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,500
Yes, it's in that apartment.

146
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,100
Where is it?

147
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,360
It's about five centimeters black.

148
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,160
It went into the back of the stereo.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,620
Is it here?

150
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,560
There's no shadow or shape.

151
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,740
That can't be true.

152
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,280
It must be clinging to something.

153
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,660
Look for it.

154
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,940
It's okay.

155
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
It won't come out anymore.

156
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,760
How can you say that?

157
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,640
What if it comes out again?

158
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,400
I wouldn't die if a cockroach came out.

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,840
And it's about three minutes.

160
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,720
No!

161
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,120
Get rid of it and come back!

162
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,480
I hate people who are half-hearted!

163
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,660
I don't care if you don't like it.

164
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,080
I'm not your husband or lover.

165
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,960
Please, I'll put in some coffee.

166
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,320
Don't go home.

167
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,580
Sit here.

168
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,620
I'll be right there.

169
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:33,960
I can give you a bit.

170
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,240
Good?

171
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,180
Huh, you can't give me some coffee.

172
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,740
There must be something wrong.

173
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,840
I'm thinking.

174
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,160
Oh, no.

175
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,380
Are you begging me to open the door?

176
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,920
Okay, fine.

177
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,580
I can't seem to open the door.

178
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,260
And you're worried about the sound of a cockroach.

179
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,740
Hey.

180
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,560
Don't tape me.

181
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:33,520
What about you, Mr. Sato?

182
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,540
Huh?

183
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,340
He's here!

184
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,080
He's here!

185
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,600
He's here!

186
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,400
He's here!

187
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,400
He's here!

188
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,480
Thank you very much, sir.

189
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,700
Good luck with your work.

190
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,260
Good luck with your work.

191
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,560
Good luck with your work, you idiot!

192
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,600
It's so good, and so cold!

193
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,740
Hey, you!

194
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,120
Welcome back, Mr. Ryo!

195
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,820
Welcome back, Mr. Ryo!

196
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,540
Welcome back?

197
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,460
I didn't drink!

198
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,900
No, I'm really happy!

199
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,220
I have something to tell you!

200
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,640
Your wife is a very good cook and beautiful!

201
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,000
She's a very good cook and beautiful!

202
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,760
She's a very good cook and beautiful!

203
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,340
You're a fool to take someone's words!

204
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,040
You're a fool to take someone's words!

205
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,800
You're a selfish man!

206
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,240
You're a selfish man!

207
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,500
Do it yourself!

208
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,060
Pour it all the way in.

209
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,200
In three minutes...

210
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,340
In three minutes...

211
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,200
Blur!

212
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,600
Blur...

213
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,380
Blur...

214
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:03,980
Blur...

215
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,840
Blur...

216
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,200
Blur...

217
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,480
Blur...

218
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:08,700
Blur...

219
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,300
Blur...

220
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,540
Blur...

221
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,720
Blur...

222
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,120
I'm having a hard time.

223
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,140
I'm going out for a bit.

224
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,980
In three minutes, throw away the yaki-soba.

225
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,100
Okay, I'll throw it away.

226
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,880
Don't throw it away!

227
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,780
Don't forget! It's only three minutes!

228
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,680
Are you guys fighting?

229
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,180
You're so noisy that I can't sleep.

230
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,260
Do something, Mr. Omari.

231
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,640
I can't help it.

232
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,940
Hey, get away! Get away!

233
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:42,980
Ouch!

234
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,220
Stay still, Mr. Omari.

235
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,400
You bastard! I won't forgive you!

236
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,380
Where did he go?

237
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,180
What a suspicious guy.

238
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,700
To be continued

239
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,520
What are you doing there?

240
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,780
Hey, don't run away!

241
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,400
What's your name and address?

242
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,220
I'm Matsu-fuji.

243
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,520
My address is here.

244
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,220
What?

245
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,600
This is my house.

246
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,620
Why were you peeking in your own house?

247
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,880
I drank and got home late.

248
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,120
I was locked in the door chain, and I think my wife is asleep.

249
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,700
What should I do?

250
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Wake up your wife.

251
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,800
If you don't want to, you can do it here.

252
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,560
That's a little...

253
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,920
I don't care. Do whatever you want.

254
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,480
Wait, Mr. Omari!

255
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,120
Please apologize to your wife.

256
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,240
Why do I have to apologize to your god?

257
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:08,860
Please!

258
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,160
If you're with me, will you forgive me?

259
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,100
Please!

260
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,200
Please!

261
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,240
Please!

262
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,780
Are you really that strict?

263
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,360
You worked all day and got home late.

264
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,720
You drank and got home late.

265
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,460
What's wrong with you?

266
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,420
You're right.

267
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Hang in there.

268
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,760
What are you going to do if your god gets scared?

269
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,840
If you're a man, show him your manliness.

270
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,920
Alright.

271
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,200
Okay.

272
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,820
Where did you think you were going?

273
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,660
I mean the shop.

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,900
I brought you here because I became a drunken master.

275
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,820
It makes no sense to do things that are not your business.

276
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,480
Please do something about it, Mr. Omari.

277
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,480
No! It doesn't make any sense!

278
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,260
Oops!

279
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,680
You're drunk again!

280
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,400
Stop it!

281
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,760
You can drink as much as you want!

282
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,320
A man should be able to have a manly relationship!

283
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,420
Don't you dare talk to my family!

284
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,600
You!

285
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,320
I won't forgive you for being a woman!

286
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,420
Damn you!

287
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,540
Please don't resist!

288
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,920
My wife is a former world champion of women's wrestling!

289
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,040
What?

290
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,240
Idiot!

291
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,700
Say that to your wife!

292
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,400
What are you doing to my wife?

293
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:52,180
I'm praying that she will come home soon without drinking.

294
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,260
Ouch!

295
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,240
You're praying to my wife?

296
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,560
Drinking is bad for your health.

297
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,700
Drlessness is good for you.

298
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,300
You're still into this, right?

299
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,460
Red Corner 320 lbs former world champion of TOTOWC!

300
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,980
Blue Kong!

301
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,560
Now, let's see who we hit first.

302
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,380
I'm the killer of the second, Bullkong!

303
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,160
How many seconds do I have to get rid of him today?

304
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,700
What are you doing?

305
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,640
It's time to start the match.

306
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,660
Hey!

307
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,920
Wow! A series of moves that can be moved!

308
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,180
What do you think?

309
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,860
Mr. Miru Tabigara!

310
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't feel any trouble since the Gen'eki era!

311
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,500
I don't feel any trouble since the Gen'eki era!

312
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,900
How did you become a wife of a woman like this?

313
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,140
I was a big fan!

314
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,260
How big of a fan are you?

315
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,180
That person said,

316
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,220
"If you marry me, I'll listen to anything you say!

317
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,820
I don't care if I die!"

318
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,720
Can you see it?

319
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,680
The special Death Valley Bomb!

320
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,840
It's a one-shot!

321
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,640
Hey!

322
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,560
It's a one-shot!

323
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,380
Champion! Defend!

324
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,260
Hunter!

325
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,800
You!

326
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,600
I love you!

327
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,740
Why am I so...

328
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,260
This is mine.

329
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,720
This is my yakisoba.

330
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,740
Welcome home.

331
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,640
What are you doing?

332
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,000
Ryo-san, I'm sorry.

333
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,240
You can't hold the lid properly, so it will spill.

334
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,900
You made a big mistake.

335
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,100
You're such a bad person.

336
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,020
In addition, why are you throwing away the hot water now?

337
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,920
It's been three minutes already.

338
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,300
I talked to Sasaki-san and finally ...

339
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,660
Finally?

340
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,560
Do you know how I got away from the yakisoba that I just poured hot water with?

341
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
You will be cut off.

342
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,840
You will be devoured.

343
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,620
You will be devoured.

344
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,920
It was a painful and sad feeling.

345
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,840
Ryo-san, I'm sorry.

346
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,600
That's enough.

347
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,280
I was an idiot who trusted a monk.

348
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,140
I've met you like this.

349
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,980
Forgive me.

350
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,960
I can taste the taste of tears.

351
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,680
I'm really hungry.

352
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,120
This time, I'll be honest for the third time.

353
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:50,980
It's hot.

354
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,580
I'm not getting there.

355
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,360
What is this hose?

356
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,280
It stinks.

357
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,880
Sasaki!

358
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,560
Please don't stop it.

359
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,340
Why?

360
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,820
There are two idiots who commit suicide at night!

361
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,720
I was chased by my work and I came home.

362
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,000
Three months early, my beloved wife escaped.

363
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,340
I ran away three months earlier.

364
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,920
Run away, run away!

365
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,940
You're running away from your wife!

366
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,080
Ryo-san!

367
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,320
Since then, I've been jobless.

368
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,800
My life has been ruined.

369
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,140
I'm already at the limit of being a man.

370
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,520
It's hard to go home alone.

371
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,240
I finally got rid of it.

372
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,500
I feel like there's nothing good about living as it is.

373
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,340
So...

374
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,440
It's hard to live, but...

375
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,320
There must be something more fun than that.

376
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Sasaki-san!

377
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,300
As long as I have this guy, I don't need a troublesome wife.

378
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,440
This time, I won't leave you no matter what happens.

379
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,760
Pnyu~

380
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,500
This is my wife.

381
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,440
She's beautiful, isn't she?

382
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,280
There are things to be proud of.

383
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,740
Reiko Ohara, Yuyuko Asano, and Norika Fujiwara.

384
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,140
They were popular in the neighborhood.

385
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,340
I like cleaning and washing the most.

386
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,800
I'm good at cooking.

387
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,980
I'm bright and honest.

388
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,940
I'm loved by everyone.

389
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,440
I'm a waste of a good wife.

390
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,820
Let's have hope, Sasaki-san.

391
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,400
Maybe your wife is regretting leaving the house somewhere now.

392
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,180
She might come back one day.

393
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,080
That's right.

394
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,920
No.

395
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,360
Your wife is a beautiful woman now.

396
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,620
She's living happily.

397
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,420
She must be drinking champagne while living a luxurious life.

398
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,900
Ryo-san!

399
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,820
If I were this beautiful, I would never marry her.

400
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:54,920
I would be forced to pay her taxes.

401
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,280
Sasaki-san's wife is not like that.

402
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,100
In the first place, this beautiful woman is not a rich girl.

403
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,640
She married you.

404
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,080
It's like an accident.

405
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,280
If you are an adult with a certain gender,

406
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,200
you should have noticed before you got married.

407
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,480
You should have given up because you thought it was a good dream.

408
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,340
That's Ryo-san's prejudice.

409
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,900
Does Ryo-san, who has never married,

410
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,880
know anything about a married couple?

411
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,520
I don't want to know.

412
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,820
The night guard is calling me.

413
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,680
My wife is not coming back.

414
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,220
I will die!

415
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,840
Don't worry about what Ryo-san said.

416
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,960
Please don't worry about what happened.

417
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,620
Please don't stop me.

418
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,380
I'm sorry, Sasaki-san, who didn't solve the problem.

419
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,680
Ryo-san, don't say anything that stimulates me.

420
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,500
I'll eat you now.

421
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,440
Damn it!

422
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,740
Goodbye!

423
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,320
Please stop!

424
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,420
If you're going to die, you have to die!

425
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,100
Sasaki-san!

426
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,940
Ryo-san, stop it!

427
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,260
Don't worry, Terai.

428
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,180
If you really want to die, you will die.

429
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,940
You can't come to a restaurant like this.

430
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,880
All right! Time's up!

431
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,880
Please don't die!

432
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,420
Please don't die!

433
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,280
Please don't die!

434
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,300
Please don't die!

435
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,320
I'm serious!

436
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:33,000
Ryo-san...

437
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,160
My fox udon...

438
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,680
Damn it!

439
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,200
I won't forgive you!

440
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,820
I'll die!

441
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,160
I'll die!

442
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,480
Please stop!

443
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,580
Sasaki!

444
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,060
Please don't stop me!

445
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,760
Who's going to stop you?

446
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,380
I'll help you!

447
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,920
Help me!

448
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,160
Please stop!

449
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,420
No!

450
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,460
You're killing me!

451
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,800
Please stop!

452
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,600
No!

453
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,740
No!

454
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,180
Stop it, you fox!

455
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,120
No!

456
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,580
No!

457
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,920
Idiot!

458
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,700
You want to die?

459
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,660
S-s-save me!

460
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,720
I can't swim!

461
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,020
I want to die!

462
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,820
Isn't that perfect?

463
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,020
I don't want to die!

464
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,380
Sasaki!

465
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,740
Please wait!

466
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,240
I'll save you!

467
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,600
Help me!

468
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,680
Help me, Ryota!

469
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,780
Ryota!

470
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,400
I can't help it.

471
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,540
Here, hurry up and get him!

472
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,920
Ryota!

473
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,020
Come on, hurry up and get him!

474
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,660
One by one!

475
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,320
Wait, wait, wait!

476
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:53,960
Hey!

477
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,280
Hey!

478
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,320
Good morning.

479
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,600
Ah, sir. Good morning.

480
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,700
Oh, I thought it was Ryo-tsu and Terai-kun's shift until noon.

481
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,640
That's right. Terai-san called to say he wanted to switch shifts because he was cold.

482
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,900
I see. So, what's up with Ryo-tsu?

483
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,340
Senpai, well...

484
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,120
Hm?

485
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,380
He's such a pathetic guy.

486
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,020
He hasn't woken up since he started talking.

487
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,560
He must be tired.

488
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,720
That's impossible.

489
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,440
His face is all white.

490
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,320
He must be playing around with the others.

491
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,720
Ramen...

492
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,340
He's not married, so he's always playing around.

493
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,060
He can't be conscious of himself as a person.

494
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,100
Hey, Ryo-tsu!

495
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,480
Can you make me some yakisoba?

496
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,660
You idiot!

497
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,880
How long are you going to dream about others?

498
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,680
Wake up, Ryo-tsu!

499
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,540

Don't worry, Ryo-tsu! The chief is Dai's coach!
