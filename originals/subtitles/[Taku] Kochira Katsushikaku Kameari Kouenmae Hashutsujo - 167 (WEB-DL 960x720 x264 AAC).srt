1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,920
One- stirringÎ¹

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,900
When you're watching TV

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,460
Make sure to lighten your room's lighting and try to stay away

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:28,500
It's the end of the rain

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,220
I walked looking back at the black place

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,300
I was walking

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,800
I was walking

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,740
I felt a strange feeling at that time

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:49,580
So I tried to walk only the black place

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,420
I tried to walk only the black place

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,480
I tried to walk only the black place

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,780
I was a child but everyone forgot

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,240
Politicians with a big face

14
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,820
And a blue aunt above my eyes

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,520
Turn around and see

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,020
That corner

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,800
I can see everyone

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,080
There is a turtle

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,360
There must be a turtle

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,420
Everyone come to our town

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,580
Thank you!

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,720
What happened?

23
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,040
Special exhibition

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:49,660
Monalisa's big explosion!

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
I was beaten!

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,060
It's Kami-kaze Gout Dark!

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,220
It's here!

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,460
It's a girl's manga!

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,520
It's here again

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,980
Kami-kaze Gout Dark

31
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,100
This is the fifth one this month

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,920
Leave it alone!

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,420
It has nothing to do with us

34
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,140
He's only aiming for art

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,900
Senpai, Ryo

36
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,640
Idiot!

37
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,900
Chief, are you here?

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,320
That's a lie!

39
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,800
Ah!

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
As usual, we're playing with this!

41
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,500
It doesn't matter if it's a theft!

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,960
It doesn't matter!

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,020
It's a light joke!

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,780
Well, we're playing with this until today

45
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,400
Eh?

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,720
In order to solve this case

47
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
Specialists from the main office will be sent

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,260
We will all join the command

49
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,420
Eh?

50
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,580
There was this pattern before

51
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,820
It's always that pattern where perverts come out

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,900
I'm sure something strange will come again

53
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,160
Maybe, maybe, maybe that specialist is a special detective!

54
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,620
Well, well

55
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,880
I knew it

56
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,300
Hmm

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,800
The person who came from that detective didn't seem like a decent person

58
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,320
This time, it's okay

59
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,960
There was me, but I was in a very ordinary outfit

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,520
And my behavior was also decent

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,160
What kind of person are you?

62
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,980
I didn't hear your name, but you were probably called Profiling Deca

63
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,380
Profiling Deca?

64
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,360
What is that Profiling Deca?

65
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,240
What is that Profiling Deca?

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,540
Answer me

67
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,420
Huh?

68
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,160
Profiling is a method of extracting the criminal image from a small clue and dividing the criminal

69
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,460
For example, this tank

70
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,460
It looks like a normal plastic model

71
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,120
But in fact, it's actually a little reinforcement material

72
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,060
This shows that it was made of plastic before Gunpla

73
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,320
Therefore, the age is from the late 30s

74
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,660
to the late 40s

75
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,780
The finishing of each part is also very delicate and polite

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,660
But in fact, this kind of work is more suitable for a thick and rugged finger

77
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,100
And it has a slightly manly smell

78
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,960
Moreover, this is not in the bath for three days

79
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,280
That means the possibility of a single man is strong

80
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,260
Judging from the above information

81
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,040
This will start!

82
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,880
It must be yours!

83
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,560
Amazing!

84
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,780
I got it!

85
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,020
How about this?

86
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,180
This is Profiling!

87
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,800
Then you are!

88
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,000
Profiling Deca Aso!

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
Good, it's pretty good!

90
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,800
No, I can't be relieved

91
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,740
That's right, how many times have we met with painful eyes in this pattern?

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,440
I have a lot of work to do

93
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,500
Then let's start the investigation meeting immediately

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,080
The culprit has never been seen before

95
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,640
But there are several clues

96
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,380
First, five illustrations left at the crime scene

97
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,460
It's written in a political ink in Kento city

98
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,280
And this part is used in the screen tone "S-401"

99
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,820
Screen tone?

100
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,540
Screen tone is something like a sticker used by a manga artist

101
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,180
Exactly

102
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,680
In other words, the culprit can be assumed that he is a manga artist

103
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,020
So the culprit is a manga artist?

104
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,420
It's naive!

105
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,880
It is not a manga artist because he is a manga artist

106
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,200
What?

107
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,220
From what I saw, the culprit is a woman who wants to become a girl manga artist

108
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,720
Why can you say that?

109
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,540
This card

110
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,320
It smells like cosmetics

111
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,660
There is no man who paints and writes manga

112
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,320
And this name

113
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,660
This is clearly a girl manga

114
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,300
Now the culprit can know more about girl manga

115
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,880
Furthermore

116
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,160
If you're a professional, you can't draw other people's manga

117
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,860
Really?

118
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,460
Probably

119
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,100
OK, let's focus on the girl manga artist

120
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,040
All of you, go out

121
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,160
Yes

122
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,880
Wait a minute

123
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,680
What?

124
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,180
Do you have something to talk about?

125
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,100
Do you think the profiling is complete?

126
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,220
But now

127
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,640
The real profiling will start from now

128
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,300
Jyuteemu Jyuteemu Lali Poppi

129
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,620
Become a girl manga artist

130
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:37,020
What is this?

131
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,800
Have you ever heard the voice of a star?

132
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,460
The voice that whispers from beyond the night sky

133
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,880
It may be a message from him to you

134
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,900
It may be a message from him to you

135
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,500
It began after all

136
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,120
The voice that whispers from beyond the night sky

137
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,400
The voice that whispers from beyond the night sky

138
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,500
The voice that whispers from beyond the night sky

139
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,140
The profiling is complete

140
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,940
Aso, Ruri

141
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,980
Now, she has transformed into a beautiful girl

142
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,080
I'm a girl manga artist's daughter

143
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,680
Call me Ruri Rin

144
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,420
What?

145
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,520
What do you mean a girl manga artist's daughter?

146
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,280
A girl with beautiful face

147
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,680
I didn't expect I'd become such a pervert

148
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,020
How cruel

149
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,100
You should not say I'm bad

150
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,820
It's not such a problem

151
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,940
But it's okay

152
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,540
I'm sure he'll understand

153
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,840
The real face hidden under my glasses

154
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,960
No

155
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,980
You should say it's cuter to take off your glasses

156
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,240
Can I say that?

157
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,500
Yes, you can

158
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,720
I don't know what a girl manga is.

159
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,240
I guess we all have to transform.

160
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,660
What?

161
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,520
Jyuteemu Jyuteemu Lali Poppi

162
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,440
Let's be girls of the girl manga world together.

163
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,280
What is this?

164
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,920
What is this?

165
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,520
What is this?

166
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,260
What is this?

167
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,940
What is this?

168
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,840
Why are we dressed like this?

169
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,480
Because we have to understand the feelings of the criminal to do profiling.

170
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,120
Can you understand it with this?

171
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,600
The criminal's hobby this time is girl manga.

172
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,560
That's why we have to immerse ourselves in the world of girl manga.

173
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,560
What's wrong with Nakagawa and Reiko? They haven't transformed.

174
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,200
They are still in the world of girl manga.

175
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,820
I see.

176
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,960
Don't you understand?

177
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,480
Don't you think it's embarrassing to be dressed like this?

178
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,340
Right, chief?

179
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,660
But why do you look like a ballerina?

180
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,340
Because in girl manga,

181
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,960
the ballerina is the standard.

182
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,380
I see.

183
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:03,520
Is that so?

184
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,180
Mizusawa Megumi's writing like that, you know.

185
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,420
Well, I will teaching you a lot of world of girl manga from now on.

186
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,680
It's important that we create a mood for girl manga.

187
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,600
Let's build up this silly atmosphere with the theme of girl manga I made.

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,880
Then, let the music begin.

189
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,960
Music

190
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,760
Lululala Lulala

191
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,800
One step to the beat of spring

192
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,220
I will grow wings and fly away

193
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,340
No matter how hard it is

194
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:59,440
No matter how much tears I'm about to shed

195
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,840
I won't lose

196
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,380
Because I have that person

197
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,020
Lulululu Fight! Lululul

198
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,900
Fight! Lulululu

199
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,640
Everyone's voice is calling

200
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,180
Lululala That kind of smile

201
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,760
Is the best energy

202
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,820
See? It's like you're doing a girl manga, right?

203
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,620
Yes, it is.

204
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,660
No, it's not a girl manga this time!

205
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,220
Let's move on to the next step.

206
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,480
Yes.

207
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,160
No, it's definitely not.

208
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,200
That's right, Masumi.

209
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,880
One step to the beat of spring

210
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,140
I will grow wings and fly away

211
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,740
I can't believe I'm going out in this outfit.

212
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,440
Now, the next step is...

213
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,640
Everyone will be able to experience the world of girl manga.

214
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:02,780
How?

215
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,180
Don't worry.

216
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,700
In times like this, it's magic.

217
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,280
Chute M Chute M Lali Popping

218
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,600
Become the perfect home for the main character of a girl manga to live in.

219
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,200
What is he doing?

220
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Somehow, I get the impression that...

221
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,280
he is in love with this girl.

222
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
Oh, it's done.

223
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,160
I knew it. I found the right way.

224
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,000
Don't mind the details.

225
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,620
But I think it's better to buy a house that is more luxurious than the main character of a girl manga.

226
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,560
Then I will buy a house that is my own.

227
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,120
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

228
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,480
Don't attack me!

229
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,320
Yes, everyone knows nothing about this.

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Most of the readers are ordinary girls.

231
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm just a normal girl.

232
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,600
If you make the main character rich,

233
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,480
you can't have a reader's sympathy.

234
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,000
I see.

235
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,500
Next is the main character's room.

236
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,440
Chutemu Chutemu Lali Poppin

237
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,160
Become the main character's room of a girl manga.

238
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,240
This is going to take a long time.

239
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,660
Me too.

240
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,140
I'll go with you.

241
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,580
I'll go with you.

242
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,520
Hey!

243
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,180
You're cheating, Reiko!

244
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,360
You ran away from me!

245
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,900
Calm down, senpai!

246
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm surprised you made it this far.

247
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,760
I'm ready.

248
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,180
I'll show you the world of girl manga.

249
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,520
This way!

250
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,560
This way!

251
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,060
I knew for a long time that the prince on the white horse was gone.

252
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,800
But I believed that someday we would meet again.

253
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,420
No!

254
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,980
Why didn't you wake me up?

255
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,460
I woke you up many times.

256
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,360
I'll warm up the milk right away.

257
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,080
I don't need it anymore.

258
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,740
I don't need it anymore.

259
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,720
I'll go.

260
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,640
I'll go.

261
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,000
What a good idea.

262
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
I hope you can be a little more like a girl.

263
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,280
Ouch!

264
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,640
Are you all right?

265
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,040
Are you all right?

266
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,100
What?

267
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,080
What?

268
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,340
What?

269
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:47,960
What?

270
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,500
That was the meeting with that girl.

271
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,080
What a girl's manga scene!

272
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,560
Isn't it great?

273
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,360
What are you going to do with the bread I eat?

274
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,340
Don't worry about it.

275
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
I'm a girl manga.

276
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,600
I've been concerned about it since a while ago.

277
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,920
I feel that the shape of the car is strange.

278
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,680
Don't look at it!

279
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,060
I'm not good at making girl manga.

280
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,200
But, but...

281
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,680
What is this flower?

282
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,020
Where does it come from?

283
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,920
You don't get it, right?

284
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,440
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

285
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,760
Then we should make a world without bread and cars.

286
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,420
Once upon a time, there was a princess Jaja-uma.

287
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,100
Princess! Princess! Where did you go? Princess!

288
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,000
Princess!

289
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,440
You still haven't found her?

290
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,000
Yes.

291
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,260
You're in trouble for being a princess.

292
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,780
You're in trouble for being a princess.

293
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,300
Oh, that!

294
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,800
Princess! I'm in trouble!

295
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,420
Please come back, princess!

296
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,420
Don't worry, uncle. I want to see how you live.

297
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,520
Are you alright?

298
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,600
You're a bad boy! Don't touch me!

299
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,540
You're a good princess.

300
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,800
Actually, I'm a young lord from the neighboring country.

301
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,180
How romantic! This is how you should act in your own time!

302
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,760
Hey, isn't this a little strange?

303
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,060
Normally, there are many ponds around the castle.

304
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,540
Besides, there's no use in being around the castle.

305
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,600
If you're around the castle, you'll be suspicious.

306
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,880
Don't worry about that. It's a girl's manga.

307
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,260
How long has this been around?

308
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,940
How many years has this been around?

309
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,540
If you don't know that, you won't be able to set up your clothes or background.

310
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,980
Shut up!

311
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,440
Then, let's go back to the original point and...

312
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,840
...be a ballet dancer!

313
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,600
Then, I'll announce the next character.

314
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,760
Asou Rurika, the heroine.

315
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,880
Yes.

316
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,540
As expected. As expected of Rurika.

317
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,480
The heroine.

318
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
The leading role.

319
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,680
The connection eyebrow.

320
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,100
That's right.

321
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:16,380
You.

322
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,260
What?

323
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,020
What's your response?

324
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,160
What's going on?

325
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,180
What's going on?

326
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,900
It's a mistake.

327
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,440
I don't believe it.

328
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,120
Coach, I can't do it.

329
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,800
It's only been a month since I started ballet.

330
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,000
Is that all you have to say?

331
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,580
Huh?

332
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,320
Well...

333
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,160
The practice starts in 10 minutes.

334
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,200
Don't be late.

335
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,720
I... I...

336
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:42,840
I'm sorry.

337
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,960
Hurry up, hurry up.

338
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,040
If you're late, congratulations to the coach.

339
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:51,940
Ouch!

340
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,900
The nails by the toe shoes.

341
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,720
Who did this?

342
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,880
Mr. Otoha.

343
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,900
I'm sure it's Mr. Otoha's doing.

344
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,240
I'm thinking that I have taken away the role of the opponent of Ms. Rurika.

345
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,120
Oh, what should I do?

346
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,920
Mr. Coach, please help me!

347
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,080
-Please come here! -That's great!

348
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,480
This is the essence of girl manga!

349
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,040
Hey, who is this Otoha-san?

350
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,020
The villain of the girl manga has always been Otoha-san.

351
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,800
Let's move on!

352
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,800
-You're still going to do it? -Enough!

353
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,180
What are you saying? The culprit hasn't been caught yet!

354
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,520
The culprit?

355
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,100
Kamikaze robber, Dark!

356
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,500
Oh...

357
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,100
He hasn't forgotten about the incident.

358
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,180
I guess he hasn't forgotten about the incident.

359
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,760
We can't stop researching girl manga until we arrest the culprit.

360
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,080
But if we keep this up, when will we be able to...

361
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,440
That's right! The camp!

362
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,980
-The camp? -The camp?

363
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,080
Let's study girl manga in the camp!

364
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,580
What? Ryo-sama is in a camp?

365
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,540
That's right. It was a week ago.

366
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,780
So, when is he coming back?

367
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,780
I haven't been able to contact him.

368
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,720
Huh?

369
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,360
Huh?

370
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,920
What?

371
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,560
Huh?

372
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,300
âª Lu-la-la, lu-la-la âª

373
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,140
âª One step towards the summer âª

374
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,740
âª I'll jump into the world and become a doll âª

375
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,700
âª No matter how sad things may be âª

376
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,280
âª My heart is about to break âª

377
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,860
âª I won't let you down âª

378
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,580
âª I won't let you down âª

379
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,560
âª Because everyone is here âª

380
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,120
âª La-la-la-la âª

381
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,840
âª Fight! Lu-li-lin âª

382
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,680
âª Fight! Lu-li-lin âª

383
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,520
âª Your voice is smooth âª

384
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,560
âª Your bright smile is the greatest policy âª

385
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,220
âª Your voice is the biggest policy âª

386
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,180
Ah, I have a dizziness...

387
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,140
Ah, I have a dizziness...

388
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,520
He-Reiko?

389
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,760
You're back, Maria!

390
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:15,900
You're back, Maria!

391
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,600
Ryo-sama?

392
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,360
Ryo-sama?

393
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,900
Yes! I'll bring tea!

394
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,160
Hey, Reiko!

395
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,520
What happened between us and Luz?

396
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,800
What happened between us and Luz?

397
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,020
Even Chief Ohara...

398
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,340
Huh?

399
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,660
Anything strange about me?

400
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,240
Oh, no...

401
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
What was this?!

402
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,080
Ouch!

403
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,540
It's because of the camp.

404
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,700
She's become a perfect woman.

405
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Maybe she's more than me.

406
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,500
How about you, Kei? What's wrong?

407
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,800
Did you call me?

408
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,200
It's said that a person's dream is fleeting.

409
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,900
A person's dream is truly fleeting.

410
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,500
Kouchi!

411
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,220
It's okay. Until the day when the fire of life burns out,

412
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,740
I will continue to chase my dream.

413
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,700
Kouchi!

414
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,740
Even Kei...

415
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,380
Let's all make Kouchi's dream come true!

416
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,720
Yes!

417
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,420
Our dream is...

418
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,440
To catch Kamikaze Gout Dark, who is touching the world!

419
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,380
It seems that you haven't forgotten about your job.

420
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,920
As a result of thorough profiling,

421
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,000
I've come to understand what the culprit is thinking.

422
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,760
Everyone, let's transform!

423
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,520
Yes!

424
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,380
Jyutem! Jyutem! Narikopin!

425
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,300
Become Kamikaze Gout Dark!

426
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,460
What are you doing?

427
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,320
I'm changing.

428
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,840
Kamikaze Gout Dark has arrived!

429
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,860
Kamikaze Gout Dark has arrived!

430
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,360
Lord Ryo, what is that outfit?

431
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,360
Kamikaze Gout Dark is definitely dressed like this.

432
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,420
I guessed it from the results of the profiling.

433
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,000
Yes!

434
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,180
It can't be helped if you only know the outfit.

435
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,200
Yes!

436
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,360
But you know what the culprit is aiming for next.

437
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,460
Yes!

438
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,840
Really?

439
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,760
It's amazing!

440
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,540
Because...

441
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,740
It's written on this sumikko.

442
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,460
The author often does it in shoujo manga, right?

443
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:29,980
Yes!

444
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,320
Then, let's go, everyone!

445
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,260
We'll catch him tonight!

446
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,180
Yes!

447
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,260
Everyone, fight!

448
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,560
Yes!

449
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,300
Everyone, do your best.

450
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,260
I'll always be watching over you.

451
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,780
Nakakawa, are you okay?

452
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,560
Don't let him catch you, Maria.

453
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,460
It's just a play.

454
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,300
A play.

455
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,120
I see.

456
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,680
Even the bones of the bones are painted in shoujo manga.

457
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,480
Oh, no!

458
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,720
I'll go after the ace!

459
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,620
That's enough!

460
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,360
Thieves who stir up the world...

461
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,240
We won't forgive you!

462
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,720
We're arresting you today!

463
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,100
Oh, no!

464
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,220
He's a man, just like us!

465
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,120
Hey, didn't you say the culprit was a woman?

466
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,100
I've made a few mistakes, too.

467
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,340
It's a big mistake!

468
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,540
What?

469
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,940
It's not that bad.

470
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,780
You're always like that.

471
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,580
That's not true!

472
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,820
That's not true!

473
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,360
Anyway, an arrest of the culprit is ahead.

474
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,140
Look!

475
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,340
He's running away!

476
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,480
It's him!

477
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,840
Let me go!

478
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,120
Hey!

479
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,320
I managed to arrest him with your help.

480
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,280
It's brewing time for tea!

481
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,300
Yes!

482
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,480
Okay!

483
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,980
I'll be watching you forever.

484
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,820
I made some mint tea today.

485
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,980
Wow, it smells good.

486
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,820
It's hot.

487
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,460
Well, the important thing is the store.

488
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,740
Since then, it seems that everyone has stopped coming back from the world of girl manga.

489
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,720
What are you doing?

490
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,620
Well, this kind of thing often happens at this time of year.

491
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,760
Everyone, go back to your original place.

492
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,560
No, no, even if you say that,

493
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,260
Goodbye!

494
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,600
Wait! Do something!

495
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,760
It will be all right!

496
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,720
I'll be watching you forever.

497
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,440
Goodbye!

498
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,120
Goodbye!

499
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,760
Goodbye!

500
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,420
Goodbye!

501
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,440
Goodbye!

502
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:25,800
Goodbye!

503
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,000
Goodbye!

504
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,880
Goodbye!

505
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,100
Goodbye!

506
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,380
Goodbye!

507
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,640
When the hot shower turns blue

508
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,620
Everyday is No Problem

509
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,960
I'm in the pillow, I'm feeling better

510
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,440
Everyday is No Problem

511
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,020
I love myself like this

512
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,920
Everyday is No Problem

513
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,280
My heart is beating on Monday

514
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,020
Monday, Monday, No Problem

515
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,400
Hey, Ryotsu!

516
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,600
Ah, what was it again?

517
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,640
I've only been remembering it until now, but...

518
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,580
Ah...

519
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,800
Oh, that's right!

520
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,360
Next time, when you've forgotten the Waza-Wive,

521
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,380
let's do it again!

522
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,640
There's a wall over there

523
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,960
I'm sure it's worth it

524
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,660
Everyone, let's go to our town

525
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,720
Thank you!
