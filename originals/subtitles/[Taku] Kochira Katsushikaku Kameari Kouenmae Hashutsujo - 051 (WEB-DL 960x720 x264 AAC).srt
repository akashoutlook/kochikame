00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
『Fantastic Girl』

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,500
中川に浮かぶ 夕日をめがけて 中川に浮かぶ 夕日をめがけて

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:29,980
砥石を蹴ったら 靴まで飛んで 砥石を蹴ったら 靴まで飛んで

4
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,680
居たすけど 辿り着くのかしらに 居たすけど 辿り着くのかしらに

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,120
楽器のまんまだと 笑われたのさ

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,220
楽器のまんまだと 笑われたのさ

7
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:47,460
どっかに元気をクコとしても ぶつしくためあり 悪夢も非常

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,580
どっかに元気をクコとしても ぶつしくためあり 悪夢も非常

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,220
違わらない街並みが 妙にやさしいよ

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,200
違わらない街並みが 妙にやさしいよ

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,220
トンガリ帽子のシュ geldiと バラバラと

12
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,880
トンガリ帽子のシュasmaと

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,940
From the east to the west, the sun sets

14
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:15,400
Tomorrow will end like this

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,400
I lost my happiness because I was happy

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,100
I realized I was stupid

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:47,360
I lost my happiness because I was happy

18
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,940
Yay! Meichu!

19
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,080
Okay, let's go!

20
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,040
Yeah!

21
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,200
The children just now didn't have a ghost competition.

22
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,640
They're not interested in anything.

23
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,500
Yeah, that's right.

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,080
The children who are used to the recent movie SFX

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,980
They laugh at the first one.

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,860
What is that SF something?

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,260
There's something special about it.

28
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,180
Don't put seeds here, Ryo.

29
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,180
But when we were children, we were looking forward to the ghost competition and the test of the liver.

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,560
We're going to the shopping street.

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,500
I wonder if the traditional events of the past are also abandoned.

32
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,300
I feel lonely.

33
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,540
In short, there are two.

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,200
As long as there are some tricks that make the children happy.

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,000
Do you have any other ideas?

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,640
Well, it's impossible if you leave it to me.

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,360
How about it?

38
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,200
Can't you give me all the sales of the stalls at the shopping street?

39
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,320
Idiot!

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,080
It hurts, this bastard!

41
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,120
Chief!

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,040
Good guy!

43
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
Are you going to make money to help the citizens?

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,120
You idiot!

45
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,320
Come on!

46
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,120
Chief!

47
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,220
Why are you so angry?

48
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,080
I bought it at this sports exhibition for the sake of my subordinates who are burning.

49
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,400
Yeah, yeah.

50
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,420
The citizens are free to give it to them.

51
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,720
It's our job!

52
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,520
Do you understand, Ryo?

53
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,900
I got it.

54
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,640
Yes!

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,960
I can't believe I'm just working in this hot weather.

56
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,800
And I don't think the modern children are surprised by the first child.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,500
Don't worry.

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,960
Leave me alone.

59
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,680
I have confidence in my make-up.

60
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,800
This is the latest special make-up material from Hollywood.

61
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,320
The result will be surprisingly realistic.

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,620
Well, let's get started.

63
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,180
Yeah, whatever you say.

64
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,980
The ingredients you need are:

65
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,920
cast iron, silicon and foam latex.

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,620
Let's make them.

67
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,580
First, apply silicon to the face to remove the mold.

68
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,780
Next, apply cast iron and silicon to the face.

69
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,660
Make a mold and then make the face of the first kid with clay.

70
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,700
Then take the mold out of the mold and throw away the unnecessary clay inside.

71
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,780
Next, make sure to mix the latex foam well to make it even.

72
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,420
After filling the mold with the latex foam, bake it slowly in the oven.

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,920
It looks like you're making a cake.

74
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,680
When you open the mold, it's done.

75
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,800
All you have to do is to stick the glue and paint it.

76
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,260
That's all.

77
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,680
It's easy, so please try making it.

78
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,480
The end.

79
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,420
It's pretty realistic.

80
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,700
All right, I'll try to scare the chief.

81
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
I'm home.

82
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,040
Who are you?

83
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,000
You are...

84
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,620
You're a loser!

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,560
Stop it! It's me!

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
I'm your cute subordinate, Ryo-tsu!

87
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,500
You're not getting away with this!

88
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,560
Chief, that's really Ryo-chan!

89
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,820
Reiko made a special make-up!

90
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,340
I can't believe it!

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:18,960
Really?

92
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,400
Please take a look.

93
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,520
It's over there!

94
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,320
What?

95
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,500
It's a 5-yen coin.

96
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,020
Well, I'll take this.

97
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,100
No doubt.

98
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,340
That's why I said it.

99
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,280
My head is spinning.

100
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,000
What are you doing?

101
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,540
I'm going to the ghost festival tonight.

102
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,420
I don't really want to do it, but I'm wearing this.

103
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,820
Don't get too close.

104
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,160
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,660
Senior, I have to go to the venue soon.

106
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,860
Is it that late?

107
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,260
Are you going to go like that?

108
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,800
I'll drive you there.

109
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,660
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,980
I don't want to get in trouble.

111
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,600
Hey, are you okay?

112
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,800
Did you notice me?

113
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,240
Ryo-chan, go ahead.

114
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,860
What?

115
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,360
Look!

116
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,640
Look!

117
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,060
That's Mr. Nakagawa's Ferrari!

118
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:21,960
Really?

119
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,740
Yes.

120
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,880
I'm so lucky!

121
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,820
Let's go drive it together!

122
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,120
Let's do that!

123
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,260
Mr. Nakagawa!

124
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,020
Wow!

125
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,480
It's so beautiful!

126
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,340
It's a 5-yen coin.

127
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,440
It's a 5-yen coin.

128
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,380
It's a 5-yen coin.

129
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,340
It's a 5-yen coin.

130
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:48,620
Let's win!

131
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,280
It's a 5-yen coin!

132
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,320
It's a 5-yen coin!

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,860
Mr. Nakagawa, please stop messing around.

134
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,220
They just called me.

135
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,920
I'm going to look around.

136
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,160
Wait a second, please.

137
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,940
All right.

138
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,560
Until you arrive, go back to bed.

139
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,060
Oh!

140
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,700
Oh, no!

141
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
I didn't think I'd get a Ferrari.

142
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,300
I'm sure it'll sell well.

143
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,980
I think I heard a moan.

144
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,780
I'm starting to feel bad.

145
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,760
The driving is rough.

146
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,020
Idiot!

147
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,200
What was that?

148
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,120
I saw something weird.

149
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,040
What is it?

150
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,560
Who are you?

151
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,880
What is it?

152
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,420
Are you a car thief?

153
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,640
Hey, car thief!

154
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,520
Don't let me get away!

155
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,580
Don't catch me!

156
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,960
Help!

157
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,120
Help me!

158
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,840
I got it.

159
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,040
What?

160
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,140
I got it!

161
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,380
Don't leave me!

162
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,700
Damn it!

163
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,800
You stole my property!

164
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,800
I have to hurry.

165
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,520
The ghost competition is about to start.

166
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,600
It's closed.

167
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,680
I'm coming!

168
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,160
I made it.

169
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
Did I have any change?

170
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,840
I've been collecting my money since last time.

171
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,860
Is that it?

172
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:14,320
I can't believe it.

173
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,640
No.

174
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,840
I made a ghost.

175
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,680
If you break the rules in town,

176
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,940
you'll be punished by the president.

177
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,420
But no.

178
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:28,860
We need to...

179
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,360
You... you...

180
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,740
You can't take that!

181
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,260
There he is!

182
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,420
G-gosh!

183
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,060
Geeeees!

184
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,640
This is bad! If I get caught, I'll be caught too!

185
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,020
Yellow, orange, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue...

186
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,820
It's over!

187
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,940
Let's try it again!

188
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:20,460
You monster! You can't run away!

189
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,620
Hurry up!

190
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,220
Get out of here!

191
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,220
You monsters!

192
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,740
Stop resisting and come down!

193
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,380
Hey! Where are you?

194
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:38,600
Hey!

195
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,220
I managed to escape.

196
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,980
What should I do now?

197
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,880
Taxi? I can't help it.

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,640
I'll try going back and forth.

199
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,540
Hey, driver, don't be surprised.

200
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,820
What is it?

201
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,840
See?

202
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
But if you look at this, you can tell it's makeup.

203
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,500
Everyone's in a hurry.

204
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,500
I'm glad you're a good driver.

205
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,600
Which one?

206
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,820
I'll take you to Manpuku-ji.

207
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,860
There's nothing to worry about.

208
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,680
I'm late.

209
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,700
I'm so tired.

210
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,400
It's over, isn't it?

211
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,880
What? What's that taxi?

212
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,760
I haven't paid money and it's already gone.

213
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,840
Never mind.

214
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,320
I'll just look around.

215
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,380
It's so dark you can't see my feet well.

216
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,580
I don't know who it is, but I'm curious.

217
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,180
Oh, sorry for being late.

218
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,960
Who are you?

219
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,120
Oh, you're the old lady from the candy shop.

220
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,500
You're wearing such a thick makeup, I can't see your face.

221
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,980
Ura-meshi...

222
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,280
Hmm?

223
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,220
Your hands are a little different, aren't they?

224
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,880
About this much?

225
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,540
Ura-meshi...

226
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,420
Oh, you're a person who likes to participate in the competition, too.

227
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,440
That's the way it is.

228
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,780
Oh, come on, come on.

229
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,240
Everyone has a great makeup.

230
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,180
I don't think it's a competition for a gift at a shopping street.

231
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,720
Okay, I'll hide over there.

232
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,940
I'll scare you a lot.

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,600
See you.

234
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,940
I'll get rid of you right away.

235
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,500
I'll get rid of you right away.

236
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,140
See you.

237
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,960
Where were you last night?

238
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,560
That's my line.

239
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,780
I've been waiting for you all the time.

240
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,740
But no one came.

241
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,260
What?

242
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,660
Manpukuji?

243
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,800
Ryo, the ghost festival was not called Manpukuji but Bunpukuji.

244
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,020
What?

245
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,800
You're lying!

246
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,340
I'm not lying.

247
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,980
Look, it says it here.

248
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,660
What?

249
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,660
Huh?

250
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,420
It's true.

251
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,460
But I've met other ghosts.

252
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,740
Manpukuji is a temple, and there's no one there.

253
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,640
What?

254
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,080
What?

255
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,080
Then I've met one.

256
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,180
I don't think you can say you've met a real ghost.

257
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,460
You can't say you've met a real ghost.

258
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,500
They're too realistic to be a group of people from a shopping street.

259
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,160
No way.

260
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,600
There's no way a ghost exists in this modern science.

261
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,200
Stop it, Ryotsu!

262
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,580
I'm late, so I can't lie about it.

263
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,860
Oh, there was a ghost festival yesterday.

264
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,700
What?

265
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,880
You're not lying, are you?

266
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,560
No, I'm not.

267
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,220
But what I said is true.

268
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:33,720
Huh?

269
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:33,780
Huh?

270
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
What are you talking about?

271
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,880
There's no way a ghost exists.

272
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,700
If there really is a ghost, I'd like to pay for it.

273
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:42,420
Huh?

274
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,380
I see.

275
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,960
If we use those ghosts...

276
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,080
Well, well, welcome.

277
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,180
120% fear.

278
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,100
We can shake hands with everyone.

279
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,780
It's a game that doesn't wait!

280
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:54,680
Thank you!

281
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,820
Hey!

282
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,060
Here's the entrance!

283
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,020
And there's a two-shot camera that can take photos of ghosts.

284
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,620
Let's take a picture!

285
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,240
My sis will be at the rice paddler's tomorrow.

286
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,520
Hey!

287
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,860
As you said, it's a little dark outside.

288
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,020
Maybe that's why we need these three ghosts?

289
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,040
23 ...

290
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,460
24 ...

291
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:41,260
Y-you're the one who's scary!

292
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,420
You're not the one who's scary!

293
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,860
It's me!

294
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,140
The first kid you saw yesterday!

295
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,440
But...

296
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,000
You were putting on makeup for a special show!

297
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,280
See, that's him.

298
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,460
Guys, come over here!

299
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,480
Jake!

300
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,440
Come on!

301
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,380
"I'm sorry, I thought you were human."

302
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,620
"I thought you were just a friend."

303
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,820
"I thought you were just a friend."

304
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,140
"I don't want to!"

305
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,640
"Why are you guys standing here? You're a ghost!"

306
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,760
"If you have time, why don't you go out and scare people?"

307
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,400
"But, you know, these days, wherever I go, it's bright even at night."

308
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,120
"I can't stand behind those who play mobile phone games or play games."

309
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,140
"I can't even notice them."

310
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,540
"You're too stimulating."

311
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,380
"Really, this is going to make my business go up, right?"

312
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,120
"I'm sorry."

313
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,840
"Oh, you're pathetic, I'm Sueda, but you guys are still ghosts."

314
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,540
"You know, ghosts are scary and mean."

315
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,700
"I'm sorry."

316
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,660
"Okay, from now on, I'll train you to be a ghost and not be embarrassed."

317
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,640
"Okay?"

318
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,500
"But..."

319
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,020
"Do you have a problem?"

320
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:54,960
"No."

321
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,560
"Okay."

322
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,300
"My eyes are spinning."

323
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,320
"I'm going to wait for you."

324
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,920
"Don't look at me, you idiot!"

325
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,440
"One, two, three, four..."

326
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,460
"Four, four, four?"

327
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,660
"You idiot, I can't do four!"

328
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,920
"There's no way you can do it!"

329
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,500
"Five, six, seven, eight..."

330
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,580
"Five, six, seven, eight..."

331
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,320
"Five, six, seven, nine..."

332
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,020
"You idiot. Fives..."

333
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,200
"Five, six, seven,"

334
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,080
"Five, six, eight, nine, ten..."

335
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,500
"Five, six, seven, point."

336
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:40,940
"Five, six, seven, two..."

337
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,660
"Five, six, seven, one..."

338
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,880
" eternally."

339
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,560
"Five, six, seven,"

340
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,660
"Five, six, seven, two.

341
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,940
" purpose?"

342
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,900
"Five, six, seven, nine?"

343
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,780
The first stage of the game.

344
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:54,860
The first stage of the game.

345
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:55,960
The first stage of the game.

346
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,740
The first stage of the game.

347
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,360
The first stage of the game.

348
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:04,380
The first stage of the game.

349
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,420
The first stage of the game.

350
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:04,940
The first stage of the game.

351
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,360
The first stage of the game.

352
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:05,920
The first stage of the game.

353
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,980
The first stage of the game.

354
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,100
The first stage of the game.

355
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,960
The first stage of the game.

356
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,520
The first stage of the game.

357
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:21,960
The first stage of the game.

358
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,800
The first stage of the game.

359
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,120
The first stage of the game.

360
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,800
The first stage of the game.

361
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,360
The first stage of the game.

362
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,220
The first stage of the game.

363
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,940
The first stage of the game.

364
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:29,980
The first stage of the game.

365
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,180
The first stage of the game.

366
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,160
The first stage of the game.

367
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
The first stage of the game.

368
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,080
The first stage of the game.

369
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,820
500 times in a row!

370
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,880
I can't do it anymore...

371
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,220
Shut up! Do the Kuchiko-Tensetsu!

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,640
It's finally time for tomorrow's night's party.

373
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,200
The Okuman Chouja is right in front of us.

374
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,120
Huh? Ryo-chan?

375
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,500
Ryo-chan?

376
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,740
What's wrong?

377
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,900
What's wrong with you?

378
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,240
You look pale.

379
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,580
Are you sick?

380
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,780
I'm fine.

381
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,500
I'm not sick, but...

382
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,320
You're not sick, but...

383
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,880
Really? You look very pale.

384
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,860
Besides, you left half of the katsudon.

385
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,160
Besides, you left half of the katsudon.

386
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,220
You're eating katsudon and ramen and yakisoba, aren't you?

387
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,620
You're eating katsudon and ramen and yakisoba, aren't you?

388
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,600
I sometimes eat tandoori, too.

389
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,620
What? I just don't have the energy for food.

390
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,500
I just don't have the energy for food.

391
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,260
It's hot every day.

392
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,900
I guess you should talk to the director.

393
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,140
I guess you should talk to the director.

394
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,500
It's...

395
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,820
Anyway, today is the first day tomorrow.

396
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,060
Right. I should go with him.

397
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,060
Yes.

398
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,780
Listen, it's the first day tomorrow.

399
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,740
Listen, it's the first day tomorrow.

400
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,360
We will show you what you've learned.

401
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,740
We will show you what you've learned.

402
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,900
Today is the last day and we'll be harsh.

403
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,340
Today is the last day and we'll be harsh.

404
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,200
It's... it's the real ghost.

405
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,360
That's a ghost!

406
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,480
What Ryo-chan said was true.

407
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,060
Senpai is possessed by a ghost.

408
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,060
He might get killed by this.

409
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,080
What should we do?

410
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,820
What did you say? I'm possessed by a ghost?

411
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,540
Yes.

412
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,740
That face already has a secret.

413
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,800
Secret?

414
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,780
If you go to the ghost tonight,

415
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,240
you'll be killed for sure.

416
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,580
This is bad.

417
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,040
If the plan is revealed here,

418
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,920
Motomoko will be gone.

419
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,260
You have no idea what he's talking about!

420
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,720
You idiot!

421
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,380
Our Gachon Temple has a good evil spirit.

422
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,220
That's right.

423
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,660
Listen to me, Ryotsu.

424
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,020
It's for your own good.

425
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,260
No matter how much you hate it,

426
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,780
you can't abandon it.

427
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,200
As your superior, as a man,

428
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,680
I will protect you.

429
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,560
No.

430
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,980
Today is an important day.

431
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,760
I have to go.

432
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,420
I have to go.

433
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,740
I have to go.

434
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,720
Everyone, get in the car!

435
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,480
What are you doing?

436
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,500
What are you doing?

437
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,620
You pervert!

438
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,740
You're a bad boy!

439
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,660
What are you going to do with a man?

440
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,860
I'm going to spell the spell of the devil.

441
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,660
You're so annoying.

442
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,480
Stop it!

443
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,220
Be quiet.

444
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,600
You can't spell it well

445
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:19,800
unless you're focused.

446
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,000
Well...

447
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,080
Don't look up the characters!

448
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:27,960
What is it?

449
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,780
Hear my spell.

450
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,220
I'll show you how I spell magic.

451
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,800
I'll do it.

452
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,320
I'll give this spell.

453
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,180
Who's trying to make an excellent monster?

454
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:46,980
Who's trying to make an excellent monster?

455
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,320
I'll give them all a spell of terrible evils.

456
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,980
I'll use magic to Peters.

457
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,100
I'll give it a spell that cubes,

458
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,060
so you don't have to watch the game anymore.

459
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,160
I'll just do what he's doing.

460
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,580
Gachon.

461
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,120
Gachon.

462
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,980
I had no other way.

463
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,420
Gachon, Gachon.

464
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,940

I've borrowed all the money from the haunted house!

Wait! Senpai!

489
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,180
Oh, so you guys came to pick me up?

490
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,480
Alright, alright.

491
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,040
Senpai. Ryo-chan.

492
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,220
Ryo-chan, come back!

493
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,300
Alright, let's head straight to the venue!

494
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,900
S-save me!

495
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,320
That person is scary.

496
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,200
Wh-what?

497
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,020
What's going on?

498
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,520
That person is not scary!

499
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,430
Um, we came to refuse this job.

500
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:30,940
Um, we came to refuse this job.

501
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,040
I know you're working hard, Ryo-san.

502
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,820
I know you're working hard, Ryo-san.

503
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,800
But we're not coming with you.

504
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,360
I'm really, really tired.

505
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,580
Then you guys must be stuck with Ryo-san.

506
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,860
No, no.

507
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,320
He's the one who's stuck with us.

508
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,640
He's the one who's the real king of money.

509
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:47,600
He's the one who's the real king of money.

510
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,280
What?

511
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,180
What are you going to do with the $122,500 I borrowed?

512
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,540
I'm going to get fired!

513

I'm going to get fired!

514
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
Wha-what?

515
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,400
Wait, you radish rascal!

516
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,760
Ryo-chan!

517
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,280
