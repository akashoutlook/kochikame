00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,440
"Cute and

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,720
"Cute and

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,100
"Cute and

4
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,580
"Cute and

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,740
"Cute and

6
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:06,840
"Cute and

7
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,240
When you watch TV,

8
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,660
brighten the room

9
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,880
and look away.

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,020
Come to me,

11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,320
you poor guy!

12
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,380
I'm not here,

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,960
but I'm worried.

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,760
Look at the blue sky

15
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,980
and white clouds.

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,680
I wonder

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,020
how they'll end up.

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,960
I wonder how they'll end up.

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,540
I wonder how they'll end up.

20
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,900
I know, I know, I know!

21
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,220
If you know,

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,920
then shut up and

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,160
follow me!

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,760
If you know, then shut up and follow me!

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,120
I'm an actress,

26
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,460
Ryouko Kameari.

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,480
Senpai,

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,420
what are we going to do now?

29
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,160
In the end,

30
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:16,840
we won't get any votes

31
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,540
in the final race.

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,100
I'm hungry.

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,060
The race is a man's romance.

34
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,740
I'm a man. I'm a man who doesn't eat samurai.

35
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,900
What's that? I'm not a samurai.

36
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,460
Men are idiots.

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,400
Really, they're idiots.

38
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,800
Shut up!

39
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,660
You're a man who can't win a match, but you're a man who can't win a match, so you're a man who can't win a match, right?

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,380
Man...

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,340
Shut up! Don't write on the ground!

42
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,220
What do you girls know?

43
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,640
Then what is this?

44
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,500
Oh, the main race manpa sword?

45
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,160
What? Hey, why are you talking about that?

46
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,740
I won 100 yen for a car ride yesterday.

47
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,640
Is it your bread?

48
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,060
Wait!

49
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,500
I'm getting sick of it. I'm a man, and I'm a man.

50
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,900
Buffet Viking?

51
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,060
One person.

52
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,760
500 yen including tax?

53
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,480
Wow!

54
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,960
But that's money we can't afford.

55
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, that's right.

56
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,920
When I was in trouble, my grandmother gave me a 1,000 yen coin to protect me.

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,420
Really?

58
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,080
Yes. With this, this Viking...

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,200
Oh, this is a woman's limited edition.

60
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,700
What?

61
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,940
What? Only women can eat it for 500 yen.

62
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,920
Only women can eat it for 500 yen.

63
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,240
Why? Why can't men eat it?

64
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,980
Well, men can't get a foothold, right?

65
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,700
That's not true.

66
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,900
There are men who can eat a lot, and there are women who can eat a lot.

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,860
That's the theory, but...

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,820
I'm a woman. I'm a man.

69
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,960
I fight for true equality between men and women.

70
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,500
A man who can eat a lot, but can't get a foothold.

71
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:17,560
A man who can eat a lot, but can't get a foothold.

72
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,220
A woman's ability!

73
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,460
Wow, looks delicious.

74
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,860
Let's eat, Hayako.

75
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,060
Is this a way of fighting?

76
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,040
Yes. This is the true equality between men and women.

77
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,200
This is the true equality between men and women.

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,800
Thank you for the meal~

79
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,220
Hey Mr. Hayako.

80
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,400
You should eat a little more carefully!

81
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,020
Hey! Why does everyone eat so focussedly.

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,640
I can't eat effortlessly alone.

83
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,440
Shigo, shigo.

84
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,020
Really, I'll have some too.

85
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,300
Our battle has just begun.

86
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,780
That's right.

87
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,320
Huh? Huh?

88
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,900
This is bad, senpai.

89
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,800
What's that?

90
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,660
A wonderful meal of manly food.

91
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,780
No, I don't want to.

92
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,700
Would you like to come with me?

93
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

94
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,860
I'm like this.

95
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,960
The TV station's producer?

96
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,420
I'd like you to appear in our drama.

97
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,340
Here, it's done.

98
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,840
Senpai, it's beautiful.

99
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:08,900
Really?

100
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,120
Hanayama Tour, just like the TV.

101
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,940
Just like the TV.

102
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,440
Who is the main character of my drama?

103
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,960
The main character is Shiori Momoyama.

104
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,200
The number one actress you want to marry?

105
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,600
I'll go see the real thing.

106
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,760
Wow, it's Shiori Momoyama.

107
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,360
Wow, she's so serious.

108
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,000
I can't eat this much.

109
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,580
If I get fat, I'll die of hunger.

110
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,600
Yes, okay.

111
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:40,680
Okay.

112
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,780
What's my role?

113
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,520
You'll play Takako, the main character of Shiori and the same school.

114
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,120
Please.

115
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,300
Well, good luck.

116
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:52,780
Huh?

117
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,540
Well, um...

118
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,480
I'm Momoyama. Nice to meet you.

119
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,660
I'm Ryouko Kameari. Nice to meet you.

120
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,800
As expected of a popular number one actress.

121
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,620
She's so beautiful that I don't think she's from this world.

122
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,580
Is it okay if I eat this?

123
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,040
You're already saying it so much.

124
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,740
Well, let's start the real thing without rehearsal.

125
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,360
Ready!

126
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,080
Start!

127
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,400
Ah!

128
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,680
Okay!

129
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,860
Hmm...

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,300
Y-Yes, okay!

131
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,660
Weird drama...

132
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,560
I'm sorry, I can't drink alcohol.

133
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,740
In other words, I want Ryoko to play another Takako in the main character's fantasy.

134
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,180
One sandwich will be 235 yen.

135
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,900
Hmm...

136
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,480
One more mochikin!

137
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,060
You ate that much, but you're eating a lot of lunch, aren't you?

138
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,200
If you don't eat, I'll take it.

139
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,440
This is for dinner tonight!

140
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,340
Oh, right. This is from the producer.

141
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,980
I ordered the price at the same time.

142
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,820
Which one? He-Hoo or Meat?

143
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,580
Hmm...

144
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,860
It's like a dream to eat and get a gift for lunch, Hayako-chan.

145
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,020
Then, as soon as you got out of the car, you were lucky, weren't you, Ryoko-senpai?

146
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,140
Here you go.

147
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,060
Um, I have more work to do, so please don't go home yet.

148
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,760
And next time, I have a line, so please read the script.

149
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,000
Line?

150
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,700
Isn't that amazing, senpai?

151
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:07,800
I'll be waiting for you.

152
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,420
Oh, it's starting!

153
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,180
What? What?

154
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,780
The drama of Shiori Momoyama, starting today.

155
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,200
It's amazing how she's overshadowed the common sense of the past.

156
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,720
Huh?

157
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,400
Takako-san, it's my treat today, so please eat a lot.

158
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,800
Oh, it looks delicious!

159
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,400
But I can't eat this much.

160
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,460
Takako-san, you're eating a little.

161
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,740
Ah...

162
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,020
Here you go.

163
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,720
It's just not enough to eat this much!

164
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,560
This, this!

165
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,760
This drama is really interesting!

166
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,080
Was it not enough to eat?

167
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,300
My wife's watching, too.

168
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,500
It's not enough to eat!

169
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,460
Right?

170
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,860
Right, right.

171
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,120
The actress who appeared in the fantasy scene of Shiori Momoyama

172
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,740
It's a masterpiece. It's just like Ryo-chan.

173
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,480
Eh? Is she an actress like Senpai?

174
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
I see. She was talking about her face somewhere.

175
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,920
It was even rumored in the book this morning.

176
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,700
Is that drama that interesting?

177
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,880
It's a drama about a woman who eats a lot.

178
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,220
It's a drama about her eating a lot.

179
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,440
It's a strange drama, isn't it, Senpai?

180
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,800
It's not a strange drama!

181
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,120
What?

182
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:47,040
It's a humorous and fantastic story about a woman who is being abused by a man named Momoyama.

183
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,280
It's not a strange drama like you say.

184
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,180
What?

185
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,560
Huh? Senpai, did you shave your beard?

186
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,380
By the way, you don't have a beard.

187
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,440
No, I don't. Men nowadays have to shave their beards.

188
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,280
You're late, Ryojiro-dono!

189
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:05,760
What?

190
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,540
You're late, Honda!

191
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,260
I'll let you go for about four hours.

192
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,240
I'll let you go for about four hours.

193
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,000
Senpai, you're weird.

194
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,220
Yeah, you're pretty weird.

195
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,380
I've never been so popular with girls before.

196
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,660
I've never been so popular with girls before.

197
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
You're not going to apologize all of a sudden, are you, Ryouko-senpai?

198
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,300
Good morning!

199
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,160
Huh?

200
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,080
Shiori-chan, open this up a little.

201
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,340
I can't finish all of it by today, Producer.

202
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,280
That's not good.

203
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,620
What's wrong?

204
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,880
Oh, Ryouko-chan!

205
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,620
I'm so sorry to hear that you're in a bad mood.

206
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,240
Senpai, it's a night shift today, right?

207
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,700
I have to go back to school as planned, so it's not good.

208
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,600
But...

209
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,660
It's the moon, and you're still being so selfish.

210
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,640
Why are you doing this?

211
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
Open this up!

212
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,620
How dare you!

213
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,220
Don't!

214
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,300
Shiori's more delicate than you are!

215
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,440
Yeah, and I don't want to open them up.

216
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,700
Ryouko-san, are you okay?

217
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,080
It's okay!

218
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,120
It's okay!

219
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,360
It's okay!

220
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,320
It's okay!

221
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,820
It's okay!

222
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,120
It's okay!

223
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,100
So, quickly, why did you bend your navel?

224
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,960
If I, the side character, got hit by a spot and got mad,

225
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,780
I wouldn't be worried about such a stupid thing.

226
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,760
I don't have any character with you,

227
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,220
and I think it will work well in the entertainment world.

228
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,580
Well, the queen of Lendora is not guaranteed, but...

229
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,700
I'm not worried about that.

230
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,440
Oh, right.

231
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,220
I fell in love with you...

232
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,160
I was dumped!

233
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,700
No way!

234
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,340
That's unbelievable!

235
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,040
What a surprise!

236
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,220
And who's the other one?

237
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,100
Ah, perhaps, the famous rock band's vocalist Perry?

238
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,200
Yes, I heard about him.

239
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,220
He's busy, and he doesn't have much time to meet up.

240
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,380
Then he said he had a crush on someone else.

241
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,580
Give it back! You're a lucky guy!

242
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,600
He played in the commercial before.

243
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,860
He's a six-year-old talent.

244
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,680
Ah, perhaps, the Queen of Gravia, Monaco.

245
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,020
That's the reason.

246
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,620
You're familiar with it, aren't you, Ryoko?

247
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,480
What? I'm not a girl!

248
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,740
The sports newspaper's entertainment industry is...

249
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,940
...checking everything about you.

250
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,240
Ever since he started dating me,

251
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,960
he's been dating her at the same time.

252
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,520
What?

253
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,560
That means he's been cheating on you?

254
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,640
Ugh, I'm so jealous!

255
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,060
No, I mean, he's such a jerk!

256
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,280
What do you want to do?

257
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,920
Do you want to start over with Perry?

258
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,780
No...

259
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,580
But...

260
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,200
I'm still frustrated.

261
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,980
Of course!

262
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,480
I got it.

263
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,460
Leave this to me!

264
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,440
Huh? What are you going to do?

265
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,780
I'm going to make you a fool!

266
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,140
You're a funny guy, aren't you, Ryoko?

267
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,280
Instead, you're just going to keep on working on this show.

268
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,500
30 million people are waiting for you.

269
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,180
Okay?

270
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,960
I got it.

271
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,760
Thank you.

272
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,620
What?

273
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,040
I'm going to make you a fool!

274
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,000
You're not getting away with this!

275
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,340
I'm going to make you pay for this!

276
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,640
They're getting more and more excited.

277
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,640
It's okay!

278
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,680
Thanks for your hard work!

279
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,120
I don't want to do this anymore.

280
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,620
Let's hurry, Ryoko-senpai.

281
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,500
I'll be right out!

282
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,300
Before we go back to the station,

283
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,880
I need to go somewhere.

284
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,340
Ugh!

285
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,260
My dog's soba is about to turn upside down.

286
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,620
By the way, Perry-san, there's a rumor that you're playing with Shiori Momoyama.

287
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,760
What's the truth about it?

288
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,660
Love is a fleeting mirage.

289
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,500
The new song is "Kanojo ni Kurakura".

290
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,920
But is there a model for the woman who appears here?

291
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,500
The answer is yes.

292
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,880
And no.

293
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,700
Because I'm an artist.

294
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,820
There's a rumor of a new love soon.

295
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,200
I'm waiting for the goddess to appear to heal my wounded heart.

296
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,860
Oh, is that so?

297
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,560
Then how about me?

298
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,520
You're Shiori's...

299
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,360
Don't put your hands on me, you punk!

300
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,120
Ouch!

301
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,460
Hey, what are you doing to my Perry?

302
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,900
You're the manager.

303
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:23,980
Yes.

304
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,140
I don't know if you're a rocker or a shocker.

305
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,600
But if you're the manager, you should teach this young man what justice is.

306
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,600
Yes.

307
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,440
If you call me again, I'll be back.

308
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,160
Thank you for looking for me.

309
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,380
I'm sure you'll get more and more popular.

310
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,280
I'll do my best.

311
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:00,680
This is an email from Shiori.

312
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,000
Ryoko, can I have a little time after the shoot tomorrow?

313
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,600
Of course.

314
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,240
I'll date you at midnight, Ryoko.

315
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,240
Yaaaa!

316
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,420
I knew the first-class entertainers would be different.

317
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,580
The night view is beautiful.

318
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,080
There's no shooting tomorrow, so if you'd like, you can stay tonight.

319
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,220
What?

320
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,180
Of course.

321
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,460
This time, you troubled me, so I want to apologize and thank you.

322
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,960
Thank you, Ryoko.

323
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,980
It's okay, it's okay.

324
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,960
Don't worry about it.

325
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,680
I'm your man.

326
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,400
I'm not saying that the man of the day has a lot of grudges, but...

327
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,840
This is the latest model, right?

328
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,680
Huh? Why isn't it working?

329
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,940
I've been in a bad mood for the past few days...

330
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,200
I wonder if it's broken.

331
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,220
Would you lend me a screwdriver?

332
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,000
What? Can you fix it?

333
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,200
Oh, wow! You can do anything, Ryoko!

334
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,180
Well, sure.

335
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,580
Oh, it smells good!

336
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,240
It's delicious! Shiori-chan, you're a good cook, aren't you?

337
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,240
How about a little more wine?

338
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,700
Not a little, but plenty.

339
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,700
Ryoko-san, there's a bath in the Juggsy.

340
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,060
Let's go in together later.

341
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,460
Because I want to.

342
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,780
Take off your towel and pode yourself.

343
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,440
I'm not! I'm strong and I'm muscular, and embarrass myself!

344
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,600
I have a lot of complexes, too.

345
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,480
Huh? You have some really badored feelings.

346
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,200
I'm glad I met you, Ryoko-san.

347
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,880
Huh?

348
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,200
In the arts, it's difficult to make friends that trust one another.

349
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,480
Right.

350
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,060
But, Ryoko-san is my friend, right?

351
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,380
You can always be my friend.

352
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,540
Of course.

353
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,080
Ryoko-san, your nose is bleeding.

354
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,840
No! I think I got it up.

355
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,200
Kourin, bring it here.

356
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,000
It's okay, Ryoko-san.

357
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,400
I'll go up first.

358
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,240
Ryoko-san?

359
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,340
It's okay. I'll go first.

360
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,800
I drank so much, but I'm still not sleepy.

361
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,140
I'm tired of doing this.

362
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,220
Ryoko-san, the president of the Katsushika office is coming today.

363
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,820
That Kameyari Ryoko is coming.

364
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:05,760
Really?

365
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,000
Really?

366
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,820
I'm going to get a line.

367
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,620
I'm sorry, Ryoko-san.

368
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,440
What do you mean?

369
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,520
I should have refused when I got an offer.

370
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,880
The producer of the drama said that it would be a promotion.

371
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,280
So I talked to him.

372
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,740
What are you doing?

373
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,480
I have to do it.

374
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,860
I'm sure you'll be found out.

375
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,440
I have a saying that I live in Todaimoto.

376
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,440
I may be okay.

377
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,660
This is a good outfit.

378
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,360
Where is she going?

379
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,840
To the hospital.

380
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,800
Is this a

381
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,820
A hospital?

382
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,940
That's it.

383
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,360
You're not good enough to be the assistant president.

384
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,660
Keep it up.

385
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,420
Excuse me.

386
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,320
Oh, there you are.

387
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,760
I heard that you are a little late.

388
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,100
I need to go to the toilet.

389
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,520
Hurry up.

390
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,880
I'll use this ceremony to make the trouble I've been in into a bubble of water.

391
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,640
The ladies' toilet is in a mess.

392
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,120
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,700
Mr. Ryouko Kameari.

394
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,740
I appoint you as the head of the Katsushika-shou.

395
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,580
I'm counting on you.

396
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,080
I'll do my best.

397
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,000
By the way, where did Ryouko go?

398
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,600
I'm sorry.

399
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,560
If I can get through here...

400
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,680
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:01,880
I'm sorry.

403
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,180
I'm sorry.

404
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,640
As soon as I turned back into a man, I was in trouble.

405
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,700
What's wrong, Komachi?

406
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,040
Hey, Ryouko.

407
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,900
The chief is looking for you.

408
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,940
What are you going to do to me?

409
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,120
Ryouko?

410
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,540
What's wrong, Shiori?

411
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,060
I was called as a special guest to surprise you.

412
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,920
I was called as a special guest to surprise you.

413
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,240
But I was found first.

414
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,940
I'm so surprised that I'm about to die.

415
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,360
That villain.

416
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,380
If you find him, I won't leave him alone.

417
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,900
Oh, look.

418
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,260
Shiori Momoyama and Ryouko Kameari.

419
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,520
I'm a fan.

420
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,720
Please shake my hand.

421
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,680
I was a little confused earlier.

422
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,100
Yes.

423
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,800
I'm ready.

424
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,800
Ohara.

425
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,380
I haven't found Ryouko yet.

426
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:57,940
I haven't found him.

427
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm sorry.

428
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,380
Please wait a little longer.

429
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,740
Ryouko is a good man to ignore the chief's orders.

430
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,040
I'll go fix my makeup.

431
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,700
Ryouko, where have you been?

432
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,340
I'm sorry.

433
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,840
I'm hungry.

434
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,620
Ouch.

435
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,260
Your face is white.

436
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,360
Are you okay?

437
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,760
I think I should go to the doctor.

438
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,880
Before that, I want to take a picture.

439
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,360
Oh, it's Ryouko.

440
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,240
I think Ryouko's not here.

441
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,420
Is he still in the dressing room?

442
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,280
It hurts there.

443
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,280
Ouch.

444
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,340
Ryouko.

445
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,740
Wait.

446
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,280
Ryouko, you went to fix your makeup.

447
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,620
Let's go on the parade.

448
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,140
I feel like I'm in Nakashimari.

449
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,900
Watch out!

450
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,360
Watch out!

451
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,000
Jyotsu!

452
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,620
Ryoko...san?

453
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,760
Jyotsu!

454
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,340
Chief!

455
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,400
What the hell is going on here?

456
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,080
Y-y-y-you're wrong, Chief!

457
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,320
Chief!

458
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,520
What's so wrong with you, you idiot?!

459
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,600
Ryoko-san?

460
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,900
S-Shiori!

461
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,200
Ryoko-san...is he...a man?

462
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,180
Our friendship is eternal, right, Shiori?

463
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,240
Usagi!

464
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,860
Wait! There's more to this!

465
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,780
Do something you can't even imagine!

466
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,280
What?

467
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,000
A true man and a true woman!

468
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,220
For the equally-

469
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,320
Uwaaaah!

470
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,080
A true man and a true woman for the equally-

471
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:20,520
And just like everyone else, at the end of the show...

472
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,200
We walked around this place with the rain falling...

473
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,680
...and of course it was raining...

474
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,720
I'll hold my mom's hand

475
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,240
I felt that strange feeling at that time

476
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,120
So I walked on the Ake-do-gai's tile

477
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Just a black spot

478
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,220
Everyone was a child once

479
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,380
But everyone forgets

480
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,940
A politician with a great face

481
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,740
And a blue aunt above her eyes

482
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,160
Turn around and look at that corner

483
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,740
You'll see everyone

484
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,480
There's a turtle over there

485
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,320
I'm sure there's a turtle

486
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,180
Everyone, come to our town

487
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,980
Come to our town

488
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,400
Come to our town

489
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:26,620
Thank you!

490
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,240
Thank you!

491
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,840
Where are we?

492
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,180
Why are we trapped in such a dark space?

493
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,480
Could we be caught in a crime?

494
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,280
Could we be caught in a crime?

495
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,640
By the way, who are you?

496
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,400
Next time, "The Worst Escape in the World"

497
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,460
Next time, "The Worst Escape in the World"

498
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,920
There's a turtle there

499
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,180
There's a turtle there

500
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,940
Next time, "The Worst Escape in the World"

501
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,000
Next time, "The Worst Escape in the World"
