I'll be there in a minute.

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,100

It locks automatically.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,760
Huh?

33
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,740
The key is this electronic lock key.

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,420
That's amazing. It's so quick.

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,000
Now we don't need to arrest the culprit.

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,180
Finally the high school students are here.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,180
Today's night shift was tough.

38
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,300
You look pretty sleepy, Ryo.

39
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,960
I'm not sleepy at all.

40
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,360
I went to the beach five days ago.

41
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,900
Every night I went to the night club to sing and drink.

42
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,940
Then I played the iron man for 70 hours.

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,380
And I went to the night club right away.

44
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,960
I haven't slept for 120 hours.

45
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,860
You're so silly.

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,940
I'll sleep for 100 hours when I get home.

47
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,880
My body's tired.

48
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,300
You have to change your lifestyle.

49
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,000
I can't order.

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:54,920
I can't.

51
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,560
What's that?

52
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,060
This is a new stroller.

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,020
It locks in 0.2 seconds.

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,540
That's interesting.

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,120
I can touch it.

56
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,660
This is useful.

57
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,220
I'll open it with this key.

58
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,400
Cool!

59
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
This is interesting.

60
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,780
It's so quick.

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,320
You were so sleepy.

62
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,600
He has no eyes for play.

63
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,740
Well, I'm done with the training. Let's go home.

64
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,900
I want this.

65
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,520
If you're tired, go home and sleep.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,800
You're with your child.

67
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,220
What?

68
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,740
I said go home!

69
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,660
You're under arrest!

70
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,880
What?

71
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,500
The key!

72
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:50,540
The key!

73
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,400
He ate it!

74
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,880
Hey!

75
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,720
Damn it! He ran away!

76
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,320
What are we going to do?

77
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,660
I don't care!

78
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,980
Hey, do something, Nakagawa!

79
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,820
It's not me. It's a guy Terai borrowed from the headquarters.

80
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,560
I'll try to get in touch with him.

81
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,720
He should have the spare key.

82
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,400
We'll get you all out of trouble.

83
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,080
Yes, that's right.

84
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,940
You talked so loudly, you little fool.

85
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,160
He ran away, you know?

86
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,340
You should have taken him away!

87
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,400
I don't want to know why you caught him.

88
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,080
That can't be it.

89
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,940
He went, you know...

90
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,240
He's on vacation.

91
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,680
Huh?

92
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,120
When's he coming back?

93
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,840
He's staying here until the next day.

94
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,840
What?

95
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,160
What?! You've been with Reiko for 48 hours?!

96
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,500
That's my line!

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,680
Wait!

98
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,140
Is it Saturday today?

99
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,740
I don't know...

100
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,240
I'm not kidding!

101
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,200
It's the day of the festival!

102
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,420
We don't have time for this!

103
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,140
We have to do something about it!

104
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,100
That's the latest style!

105
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,040
I can't get a scratch!

106
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,320
I can't get a scratch!

107
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,620
I've had a bad feeling since we were playing on the table.

108
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,120
Then, I'm sorry, but I'm busy, so I'll go home.

109
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,620
What?! Hey!

110
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,080
Wait, hey!

111
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,240
Ryo-chan will work with me!

112
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,240
What?!

113
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,740
Hey, hey, hey!

114
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,720
Wait a minute!

115
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,840
I haven't slept for 120 hours!

116
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,980
Are you going to make me work for another 8 hours?!

117
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,320
But I can't help it!

118
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,280
Today is the day of the festival!

119
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,140
Why are you working?!

120
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,260
It's okay.

121
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Then, you can sleep freely.

122
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,080
Yeah.

123
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,260
Of course, of course.

124
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,620
I'm going to sleep.

125
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,200
Wow!

126
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,240
It didn't take even a second!

127
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:54,860
He can sleep anywhere.

128
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,920
He's just like an animal.

129
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,160
Yes, this is the Kamianari Park branch.

130
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,720
Yes, I'm here.

131
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,080
Reiko-san, the headquarters is calling.

132
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,160
Me?

133
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,680
Ouch!

134
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,220
My eyes are cold!

135
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,680
Come here!

136
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,660
Hey, hey!

137
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,280
Yes, I'm here.

138
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,720
Yes.

139
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:19,820
Huh?

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,840
Are you going to the library?

141
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,760
Right away?

142
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,620
Yes, I understand.

143
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,020
My head is burning!

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,280
Hey!

145
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,100
Hey!

146
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,560
What are you doing?!

147
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,600
I'm going to the library.

148
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,020
No!

149
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,200
I'm not going!

150
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm not going!

151
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,500
What are you going to do?

152
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:42,760
Huh?

153
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,360
You!

154
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,820
Maybe you're in a hurry!

155
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,320
Hey, hey!

156
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,180
I'm going!

157
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,680
Stop!

158
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,760
Hey, see? Reiko!

159
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,760
Why do I have to run?

160
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,900
It can't be helped.

161
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,060
Two people can't ride when the chain is attached.

162
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,340
Well, let's do it!

163
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,220
Do your best!

164
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,320
Stop!

165
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:03,960
NoOO!

166
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,940
I won't be so rude anymore.

167
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,460
What? That was definitely a world record!

168
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,080
Get your hands together.

169
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,280
If you find it, you'll be embarrassed.

170
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,740
Boss, what a brave couple.

171
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,120
They're a perfect match.

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,440
Hey, stop!

173
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,320
What?

174
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,500
Over here. I want to pee.

175
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,020
I can't go with you.

176
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,040
I can't? What are you going to do? I'll take it!

177
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,500
I'm in trouble.

178
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,520
That's right.

179
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,180
What if I pee in the back yard?

180
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,780
You want to pee in the back of the book?

181
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,200
I can't stand it.

182
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,100
I can't stand it.

183
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,300
Hurry up.

184
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,860
Oh, no.

185
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,240
What's wrong with you?

186
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:10,780
Reiko!

187
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,660
What are you doing in such a place?

188
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm going to the sun.

189
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,600
No, Reiko.

190
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,680
Let's play volleyball.

191
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,060
No!

192
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,400
Oh, no!

193
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,980
It's still too early!

194
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,660
What?

195
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,120
I can't!

196
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,860
What?

197
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,660
It's too early!

198
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,880
Oh, no!

199
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:38,900
You said it's early!

200
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,300
I must have been treated like a pervert!

201
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,200
No way.

202
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,940
So, excuse me!

203
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,580
Yeah.

204
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,020
Good job.

205
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,160
Ryo.

206
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,440
Huh?

207
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,900
I guess you have work to do.

208
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,080
Let's get going.

209
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,500
Well,well...

210
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,340
You're going to the bathroom?

211
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,120
Well, if I come along,

212
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,300
I'll have to be a real pervert.

213
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,580
I'll be in trouble!

214
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,040
Just do it outside like me.

215
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,600
I'll close my eyes and do it.

216
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,740
You can't do that, can you?

217
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,820
Then, wait until I get back to the station.

218
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,980
There's only one way.

219
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,440
How?

220
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,680
Like this...

221
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,440
And this!

222
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,500
I don't like this kind of life anymore.

223
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,920
They treated me like a pervert, too.

224
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,780
I'm tired.

225
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,640
My left hand hurts.

226
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,900
I'm tired, too.

227
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,080
I'm lack of sleep, so I'm dragging you around.

228
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,680
I'm sweating.

229
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,040
Should I take a bath?

230
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,200
What? A bath?

231
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:50,800
Hm?

232
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
No, no, it's okay.

233
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,600
I'm sure you can't see.

234
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,020
What's with your eyes?

235
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Are you trying to make me look like a swine?

236
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,980
Ryo...

237
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,480
But just in case.

238
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,680
Damn it.

239
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,340
You're making me faint again.

240
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,340
Don't hit me every time I change my clothes or go to the bathroom.

241
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,100
You're getting more and more resistant.

242
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,680
You're getting more and more aware of it.

243
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,920
You're talking like a cockroach.

244
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,980
Are you going to take a bath?

245
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,640
Let me in, too.

246
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,280
Wait, I'll be right out.

247
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,660
No, I'll be right out.

248
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
Don't get naked in here.

249
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,840
If you want to go in, go ahead.

250
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,840
Don't be so reckless.

251
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,160
But how did you change your clothes when your hands were tied?

252
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,140
Hm?

253
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,280
I have a little tip for you.

254
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,880
That was refreshing.

255
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,600
I'm not refreshing at all.

256
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,020
I'll take a bath while I'm wearing my clothes.

257
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,260
I told you to go in!

258
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,480
Oh, who could it be?

259
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,680
Mr. Akimoto.

260
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,700
It's the manager's aunt.

261
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,680
That aunt is famous for her talk.

262
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,480
I don't know what kind of rumors will spread if I find her in a place like this.

263
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,380
It doesn't matter what you say.

264
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,280
I'm not going to go.

265
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,780
Mr. Akimoto.

266
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,340
Mr. Akimoto.

267
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,420
Mr. Akimoto.

268
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,500
Santalum.

269
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,320
Santalum.

270
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,960
Hello.

271
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,040
Sorry I kept you waiting.

272
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,340
Oh, were you in the bathroom?

273
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,820
The luggage is here.

274
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,680
Thank you.

275
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,080
Then...

276
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,860
Oh yes.

277
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,960
Do you know the girl in room 8?

278
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,380
I don't like rumors very much.

279
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,660
If I were that girl, I'd take you to different places every day,

280
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,200
and then take you to your room every day,

281
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,820
and I wouldn't give you a bath.

282
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,860
I have a little thing for you.

283
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,640
Uwaaaah!

284
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,100
What was that just now?

285
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,720
You're quite unusual compared to that.

286
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,760
You're not fluttering like a weirdo.

287
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,700
Ugh, this guy's tough...

288
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,880
Let's go to bed.

289
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,900
Let's change into your pajamas...

290
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,020
Huh?

291
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,860
You didn't do anything and you fell asleep.

292
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,560
If you sleep in a place like that, you'll catch a cold.

293
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,440
It's not impossible.

294
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,880
You've been up for 135 hours.

295
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,320
Yes?

296
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,100
It's me, Papa.

297
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,500
I'm Pum Pum.

298
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,400
What are you doing at this hour, Papa?

299
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,300
I'm heading over there.

300
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,340
Oh, you're going to Tokyo?

301
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,240
What's that?

302
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,200
What?

303
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,900
I'm not going to the wedding!

304
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,060
That's strange.

305
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,760
Anyway, tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.,

306
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,140
the other party will be Tenkamaru Shoji, the boss of our business.

307
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,820
But even if you say that so suddenly...

308
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,060
Besides, I'm not going to get married yet.

309
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,080
Huh?

310
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,200
Are you going to have a lover?

311
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,860
It's not like that, but...

312
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,760
Chief, I didn't do it.

313
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,780
Reiko!

314
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,240
What was that man's voice?

315
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,320
Oh, no, Papa.

316
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,080
It's the sound of the TV.

317
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,700
Oh, no.

318
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,940
It's the sound of the TV.

319
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,280
It's Ryo.

320
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,760
No, Reiko.

321
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,360
Stop it.

322
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,280
I asked you to stop it.

323
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,080
Just now, you said Reiko.

324
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,820
Ah, the TV...

325
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,360
I'm sorry.

326
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,540
Oh, I see.

327
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,320
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

328
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,060
Good night.

329
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:31,840
Phew...

330
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,940
I'm in trouble.

331
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,380
If I take Ryo with me like this, it'll be a big commotion.

332
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,400
Papa might be shocked and fall asleep.

333
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,360
I think it's about time, but I'm sorry.

334
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,180
No, I don't mind being a little late.

335
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
I can wait for you for hours.

336
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,980
Right, Papa?

337
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,260
Yes, Tomo.

338
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,380
Excuse me.

339
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,560
Oh, Reiko-san?

340
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,420
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.

341
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,100
Oh?

342
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,320
I'm sorry. I got caught up in traffic.

343
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,760
I'll leave you here for a moment.

344
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,420
Here we go.

345
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,300
Isn't she cute? I love her.

346
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,860
She's always with me wherever I go.

347
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,040
Ryo-chan has been sleeping since yesterday.

348
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,160
If she stays asleep, everything will be over.

349
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,200
Reiko-san, you're so cute.

350
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,360
I like it when you say that.

351
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,560
Well, thank you.

352
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,500
I'm Tenkamaru Daisuke, the daughter of Tenkamaru Shoji.

353
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,280
I'm happy to have you with me on this trip.

354
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,600
Nice to meet you.

355
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,180
Nice to meet you, too.

356
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,420
Hi.

357
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,400
What's your hobby?

358
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,980
I like money.

359
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,300
I have too much money, so I have a hard time using it.

360
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,220
That's a good hobby.

361
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,780
What's your hobby, Reiko-san?

362
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,340
It's just my imagination.

363
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:15,860
What?

364
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,480
This is mine.

365
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,240
If you still don't tell me, I'll just call you a fool.

366
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,720
I'll tell you my imagination.

367
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,080
I'll tell you my imagination.

368
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,440
I'm glad I brought you here.

369
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,260
Ryo-chan, good night.

370
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:32,960
Please go home now.

371
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,000
It's my first time seeing you in a magic operation.

372
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,060
So am I to be dressed like a raccoon?

373
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,700
Ryo-chan, please.

374
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,200
Don't tell anyone until the wedding is over.

375
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,660
You...

376
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,800
Do you like such a stupid guy?

377
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,980
No, I don't.

378
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
He's my dad's important business partner.

379
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,240
If things go well, I'll buy you the Radicon helicopter Ryo-chan wanted.

380
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,440
What? Radicon?

381
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,940
Okay, I'll take it.

382
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,960
Leave it to me.

383
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,540
It seems that the girl is doing miscalculation.

384
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,340
Even though it is a Radicon, it's pretty hard to stay still.

385
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,220
Huh?

386
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,640
It looks delicious. There's alcohol, too.

387
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,740
Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything since last night.

388
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,360
Okay, watch me.

389
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,220
Anyway, my family is...

390
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,500
The first-rate investor is Himiko's mother.

391
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,180
Ryo-chan's...

392
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,880
Ryo-chan's...

393
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,860
This is how you should treat her.

394
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,500
Ryo-chan's...

395
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:41,560
Ryo-chan's...

396
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:41,960
Reiko.

397
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,260
Yes.

398
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,140
If you're getting married, where would you like to live?

399
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,920
Ashiya? Den-en-chofu?

400
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,640
Anywhere.

401
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,660
Really? I don't mind anywhere but the city of the town.

402
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,660
What?

403
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,460
No, wait.

404
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,680
You can't do that with a Radicon.

405
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,960
The town is old-fashioned and ugly.

406
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,580
Damn it.

407
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,600
I don't like it.

408
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,320
I don't like the town I've been in for a long time.

409
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,980
It's so ugly.

410
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,860
I really don't like it.

411
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,280
What do you think, Reiko?

412
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
It's delicious.

413
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,220
Water!

414
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,560
Water!

415
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,420
Water!

416
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,720
Give me water!

417
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,920
Water!

418
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,380
Water!

419
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,840
Water!

420
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,760
I need water.

421
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,880
Water!

422
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,120
Water!

423
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,920
Water!

424
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,040
Water!

425
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,240
Right, Tenkamaru-san?

426
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,060
That's right.

427
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,220
Reiko-san.

428
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,700
Yes?

429
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
Finally, we're together.

430
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,960
Y-Yes.

431
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,420
Reiko-san...

432
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,900
Ever since I saw you...

433
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,120
U-Um...

434
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,320
Reiko-san...

435
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,580
We're doing a Dragon King show over there!

436
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,420
What? Dragon King?

437
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,620
Dragon King!

438
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,680
It seems the raccoon was running out of breath.

439
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,720
Dragon King!

440
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,680
Dragon Queen!

441
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,940
Dragon Jack!

442
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,400
Dragon King!

443
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,740
Ah, I like things like this sometimes.

444
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,300
Y-Yes.

445
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,800
I just took the chance.

446
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,360
Good, Dragon King.

447
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,860
There! Dragon King!

448
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,280
Ah!

449
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,360
Oh, what's wrong?

450
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,580
Ah...

451
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,480
No, it's nothing.

452
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,860
That's strange.

453
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,900
Calm down. Calm down.

454
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,220
Dragon Jack!

455
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,380
Ah!

456
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,480
Dragon King!

457
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,340
This is the Kachikachiyama raccoon!

458
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,840
Ryo, let's go!

459
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,340
Kachikachiyama!

460
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,280
Eh?

461
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,400
That was really close.

462
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,820
But, it's all right.

463
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,340
Even with only half of your face, you're safe.

464
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,600
Damn it.

465
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,820
But, there's a problem.

466
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,400
At this rate...

467
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,100
Reiko-san!

468
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,020
Reiko-san!

469
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,540
What should we do?

470
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,180
We'll be caught!

471
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,640
What should we do?

472
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,620
Oh?

473
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,300
Reiko-san!

474
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,120
Reiko-san!

475
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,980
Reiko-san!

476
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,760
Ahhhhh!

477
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:07,900
Ahhhhh!

478
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,940
Why are you so quiet?

479
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,040
What?

480
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,920
You're here?

481
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,480
It's your turn!

482
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,720
Hurry up!

483
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,440
What?

484
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,520
Here, take this!

485
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:19,900
Ah!

486
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,660
Ahhhhh!

487
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:24,620
Dragon King!

488
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,760
You're here, Dragon King!

489
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,560
Ah!

490
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:26,880
What?

491
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,140
But, who is this girl?

492
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,380
Oh, Dragon King!

493
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,720
I'm a big fan!

494
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,700
Ah!

495
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:35,940
Ah!

496
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,680
Look!

497
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,640
Pink Devil!

498
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,400
Hey!

499
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,280
Hey!

500
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,520
Ah!

501
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,760
Ah!

502
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:46,900
Ah!

503
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,100
Devil Shogun Pink Devil is here!

504
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,760
What are you doing?

505
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,060
Reiko, you do it too!

506
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,660
What?

507
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,620
What?

508
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,320
What?

509
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,680
He's serious!

510
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,040
If he's really into it, let's do it too!

511
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,140
Yeah!

512
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,840
Oh, no!

513
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,460
I can't do it!

514
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,740
Ah!

515
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:10,720
Ah!

516
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,640
Ah!

517
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,440
Ah!

518
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,760
Ah!

519
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,240
Ah!

520
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,460
Ah!

521
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:17,920
Ah!

522
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:17,940
Ah!

523
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,500
Ah!

524
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,520
Ah!

525
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,540
Ah!

526
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,000
Ah!

527
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,600
Ah!

528
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,100
Ah!

529
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,640
I won!

530
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,040
I won!

531
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,580
No!

532
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:35,780
Where is he?

533
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,740
Ah!

534
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,820
Ha?!

535
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,680
Reiko!

536
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,480
Ah!

537
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,540
Ah!

538
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,180
Ha!

539
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,000
Reiko!

540
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,200
Reiko!

541
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,760
Reiko!

542
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,660
Reiko!

543
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,340
What?

544
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,540
You're not getting away!

545
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,880
It seems that Tenkamaru's temper is not suitable for you.

546
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,500
The rest was a mess.

547
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,780
But I'm relieved that I finally got the handbook.

548
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,520
I was really impressed by the handbook.

549
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,220
But you may still be lucky.

550
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,940
The person in charge said that he's been absent for a month.

551
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,100
A month? That's a dangerous place!

552
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,900
By the way, where's Reiko's engagement ceremony?

553
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,400
Of course, she refused from the other side.

554
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,400
This?

555
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,920
Yes, the promised Radicon Heli.

556
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,940
I did it!

557
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,100
So, did the engagement ceremony go well?

558
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,800
No, no.

559
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,660
I don't have the right to get married anyway.

560
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,260
I got my father's face up and had an engagement ceremony,

561
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,020
but I didn't like it that much.

562
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,280
I was worried about how to refuse.

563
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,220
It's all thanks to Ryo.

564
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,700
I thought so, too.

565
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,240
This handbook is useful, too.

566
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,380
Ryo.

567
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,780
Chief!

568
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,320
Good morning.

569
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,640
You're playing with that again while you're on duty?

570
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,940
No, I'm not.

571
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,620
I always have a job.

572
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,140
Look, this is not a toy.

573
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,720
It's the latest handbook.

574
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,760
Hmm.

575
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,100
Right?

576
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,920
It's amazing, isn't it?

577
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,920
I see.

578
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,020
I got it, so take it off.

579
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,020
Yes, sir.

580
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,940
This key is...

581
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,560
Huh?

582
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,180
Huh?

583
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:23,660
Huh?

584
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,240
Huh?

585
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,360
Huh?

586
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,920
Ah!

587
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,500
Ah!

588
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:27,820
Ah!

589
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,220
Ah!

590
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:28,860
Huh?

591
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,420
Take it off now!

592
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,540
Chief!

593
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,980
What's wrong?

594
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,280
Can't you take it off for a month?

595
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,600
You!

596
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,820
What are you going to do?

597
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,680
I'll die, if I'm with Chief.

598
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,740
Don't forget that.

599
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,180
He's really ropey.

600
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,160
Hikari

601
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,200
Hikari

602
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,560
Hikari

603
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:56,660
Hikari

604
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:56,720
Hikari

605
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,220
Hikari

606
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,620
Whisucker

607
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,200
This is Kameyari, from Hikari.

608
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,620
I was busy...

609
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,200
What?

610
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,400
There's a turnout in the shopping street!

611
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,920
I can't take responsibility for it, so get this!

612
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,780
Wait, why do I have to go?

613
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,300
Next time, I'll go with Zou!

614
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,040
Even if I try to stop the clock

615
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,200
Time will pass

616
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,520
Don't look at me

617
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,480
Don't look at me

618
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,120
Let's laugh and live

619
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:57,360
Even if it rains today

620
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,220
Tomorrow will be clear

621
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,280
Bye bye

622
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,920
Let's wash our hands

623
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,020
I don't want to

624
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,280
I don't want to

625
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,340
I don't want to

626
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,260
Oh Yeah

627
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,500
Oh Yeah

628
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,060
Let's live the way we like

629
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,400
There is something good

630
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,100
The sunset calls me outside the door
