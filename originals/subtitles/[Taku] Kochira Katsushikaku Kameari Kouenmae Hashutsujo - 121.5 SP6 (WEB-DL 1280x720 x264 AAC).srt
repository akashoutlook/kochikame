1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,920
When you watch TV

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,720
Make the room brighter and try to look away

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:21,400
I look at the sunset floating in the middle of the river

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,440
I look at the sunset

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,420
I kick the pebble and fly to the shoes

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:40,480
I wonder if I'm going to the gym I was working on

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,520
I was laughed at as it was

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,500
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,340
I can't help but cry

10
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:58,000
The cityscape is strangely gentle

11
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,300
From the fountain of the Tungari-boshi

12
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,920
To the Taishakuten

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,000
The sunset falls

14
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,380
Tomorrow

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,800
Tomorrow

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,400
It ends like this

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,140
If I win or lose

18
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,820
I'll lose my happiness

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,780
I realized

20
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,220
Because I'm stupid

21
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:37,760
Ryo's Ambition

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,100
Time Slip Sengoku-den

23
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,840
How are you all spending the warm spring sun?

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Even so

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,480
It's very easy to spend

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,680
That's right

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,260
Well, my son has been a freshman since this year

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,440
Itadakimasu

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,760
It was a celebration

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,020
Itadakimasu

31
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,280
It was a wonderful celebration

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,780
Well, that's all for this season's greetings

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,860
What's the topic today?

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,340
Well, there's a big commotion in the village in the northeastern region

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,000
Ryo-chan just got paid

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,980
It's a very delicious lunch

37
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,280
Next, Ms. Nagano

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,460
Mrs. Kanegiroshi

39
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,780
Reiko-san

40
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,620
What?

41
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,480
What's wrong?

42
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,380
You must have done a bonus with a pachinko

43
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,360
Ms. Reiko

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,060
What's wrong?

45
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,780
What's wrong?

46
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,440
Oh, I got it

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,720
You're a stupid, Ryo-chan

48
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,560
That's why you're in a hurry

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,880
Ms. Reiko

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,600
What?

51
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,280
What's wrong?

52
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,080
It can't be helped that you're not selfish

53
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,080
Reiko, you guys

54
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,900
Let me tell you

55
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,580
Hurry up

56
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,480
Amazing

57
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:44,860
What?

58
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,760
How would you do it for 500 million yen?

59
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,340
This is Mr. Yamada who dug up 100 million yen liberty

60
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,140
Mr. Yamada, how did you find it?

61
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,140
Well, it!

62
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,880
The pot I'm buying in my home

63
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,980
They were high in the backyard

64
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,800
It's so noisy and loud

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,840
So when I laid out trees and dug it

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,620
Lying down, la hugging

67
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,500
I was really feeling cramped

68
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,900
I thought I would die with it

69
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,200
I thought so too!

70
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,100
What?

71
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,100
I said I was going to pay the bills, but you're kidding me!

72
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,900
You don't do that on TV, do you?

73
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,820
I can't stand this unfair thing!

74
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,740
I can't forgive you as a human!

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,780
There are some lucky people in the world.

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,560
Ryo, why don't you dig somewhere?

77
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,460
Maybe you'll find hidden treasures of the Tokugawa family and the Toyotomi family.

78
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,140
I used to do it on TV.

79
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,900
I searched for it in the library or the metal detector,

80
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,380
and I pulled it for 2 hours, but nothing came out.

81
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,780
Right, Senpai?

82
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,840
What?

83
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,000
Ryo, you're kidding me.

84
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,840
There's no way there's hidden treasure here.

85
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,080
That's right, Senpai.

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,560
You should stop it.

87
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,400
It's definitely a bone-carving zone.

88
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,020
I pulled the TV for 2 hours, but nothing came out.

89
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,140
I have to dig something to find out.

90
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,820
Ryo, I brought a guest.

91
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,240
A guest?

92
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,880
I'm busy right now.

93
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,240
Please leave it to me.

94
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,780
Ryo!

95
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,400
I found it!

96
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,580
What?

97
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,780
Is he a member of a ninja club or something?

98
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,620
Senpai's relationship is wide-ranging.

99
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,300
He might be a real ninja.

100
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,440
I don't know you at all.

101
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,000
That's terrible.

102
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,240
You're telling a girl who just came out of prison such a cold thing.

103
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,780
I really don't remember anything.

104
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,060
What a coward.

105
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,520
That girl at her age,

106
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,460
I don't know what she's doing if she thinks about it.

107
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,920
Don't say scary things.

108
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,340
I really don't know.

109
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,100
This is embarrassing!

110
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,380
I don't know.

111
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,540
Is that a joke?

112
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,200
Don't talk about it for a long time.

113
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,280
No one will.

114
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,340
What?

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,080
What happened to my grandpa?

116
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,260
I don't know.

117
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,760
He doesn't know about it, either.

118
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,560
That's why I got lost.

119
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,400
I didn't even know it.

120
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,680
If it's about a ninja club, I'll see.

121
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,920
It doesn't matter who goes there and who goes home.

122
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,300
I'm frustrated.

123
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,600
Because you don't go there or goes home.

124
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,100
G tiempo.

125
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,560
I'm sure about that.

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
He used to call me by G.

127
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,820
G time?

128
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,680
Then you are...

129
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,400
That Tengu's granddaughter!

130
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,100
Yes, I am Koume. Nice to meet you.

131
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,960
Weren't you a friend of Ryotsu, the cosplayer maniac?

132
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,940
There's no need to stand around here. Can I come in?

133
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,780
Sure.

134
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,280
I didn't know that Hanayama had such a cute granddaughter.

135
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,800
So, what are you doing here?

136
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,760
Actually, I came here from home.

137
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,840
From home?!

138
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,100
You went to the underworld on purpose from heaven?

139
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,540
Yeah.

140
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,120
If it's heaven, it's probably a better thing than the underworld.

141
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,640
That's not true.

142
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,640
Grandpa's discipline is really strict.

143
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,220
Shadow.

144
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,580
Koume, give me more slaps!

145
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,960
Yes!

146
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,840
Look at me! Look at me!

147
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,460
Kado.

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,800
Hi.

149
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,840
What did you do?! Say it properly! Say it properly!

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,340
Nihonbu.

151
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,560
Oh, damn you, you!

152
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,920
Ah!

153
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,940
Heh! I've got to beICKY, palabras, I've got to beICKY, and I'm still going to make mistakes!

154
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,320
If you really say so, then studying is your true desire!

155
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,220
And who knows, you might even suffocate!

156
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,100
Let's study-

157
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,280
But it's that old man Hideo.

158
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,980
Heaven also has exams, huh?

159
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,220
genauso

160
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,380
So it's the same in every world.

161
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,520
Let's play once in a while. Sometimes I want to go to the underworld to play too.

162
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:32,680
I'd love to, but I can't play in the underground. You don't understand, Heide.

163
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,600
I heard that a 16-year-old girl like me plays there.

164
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,280
So...

165
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,860
I understand. I have experience, too.

166
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,880
But you're relying on Ryo-san.

167
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,480
Grandpa always talks about Ryo-san.

168
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,700
I have a crush on him, too.

169
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,060
When I go to the theater, I always ask Ryo-san at the Katsushikaku Kameari Park Exhibition.

170
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,460
It's like a movie about a tiger.

171
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,980
I see. I see. That old man told me about it.

172
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,300
I've done a lot of work for him.

173
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,620
What did he say?

174
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,780
Well, I think...

175
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,700
He said he was a hopeless, hopeless man with no plans and a dirty life.

176
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,720
That old man! Did you say that in the theater?

177
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,300
Wait.

178
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,440
That old man said that?

179
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,040
That old man's grandson means that Koume-chan can use magic, too?

180
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,740
Yeah.

181
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,040
That's interesting.

182
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,380
Would you try it?

183
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,740
Sure.

184
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,840
♪ Over a mountain, a cliff, a cliff ♪

185
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,820

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,020
That was a relief.

203
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,800
Chief! Please be strong! Chief!

204
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,020
You can even use a bigger one, like the Pronto-Zaurus.

205
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,800
Enough already!

206
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,880
I know that magic can be used.

207
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,000
But it's amazing.

208
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,160
Everyone in Heaven can use magic.

209
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,740
I'm going to learn it in class.

210
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,480
I'm still very young, though.

211
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,320
No, no.

212
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,820
If you can do something like that at that age, that's a big deal.

213
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,260
You can't even beat that old man.

214
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,580
Huh? Old man?

215
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,920
Old Man Rikao?

216
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,700
Oh, right.

217
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,520
I was just talking about Old Man Rikao.

218
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,000
But maybe, maybe,

219
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,920
that old man's name is Rika?

220
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,580
That's right.

221
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,000
He thought a girl was going to be born,

222
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,100
so he decided that name.

223
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,560
That's why he's called Rika Hanayama.

224
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,360
I'm Rika.

225
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,020
Nice to meet you.

226
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,920
Rika.

227
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,020
Rika-chan.

228
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,300
Ryo.

229
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,900
Harajuku.

230
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,400
Can I show you around?

231
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,660
Right now?

232
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,860
If you start from Kameari, you're going to take an hour.

233
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,380
Don't worry.

234
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,180
I can go there in a second.

235
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,120
Huh?

236
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
If you go up a mountain,

237
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,540
you'll reach Harajuku.

238
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,020
He disappeared.

239
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,760
He could teleport.

240
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,640
It must've been hard for many people to visit him.

241
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,400
Hey!

242
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm working here!

243
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,540
Old Man Hanayama!

244
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,740
Ah!

245
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,180
Koume is coming, Koume!

246
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,020
Where is Koume? Where is he hiding?

247
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,900
I'm here, Hayayuu.

248
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,080
What? That man?

249
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,800
I'm here, you seduced my cute grandchild!

250
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,440
You too! Why did you stop?

251
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
I'm here, Koume.

252
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,520
Then, where is Harajuku? Where is Harajuku?

253
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,440
Hayayuu...

254
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I think it's here.

255
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,440
No, it's here.

256
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,480
No, it's here.

257
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,640
It's here.

258
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,420
It's here.

259
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,540
Which one is it? Which one?

260
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,520
Which one is it?

261
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,420
Well, here is like this. And here is like this.

262
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,240
No, but it's here.

263
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,800
And here is like this.

264
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,460
Again?

265
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,220
Oh, it's here.

266
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,560
You two are completely different!

267
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm sorry.

268
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,100
It's not here.

269
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,340
It's here.

270
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,680
It's here.

271
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,320
It's here.

272
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,140
It's here.

273
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,420
It's here.

274
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,300
It's here.

275
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,680
It's here.

276
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:43,860
It's here.

277
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,300
Come back!

278
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,100
Come back!

279
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,040
What?

280
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,280
What?

281
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,240
What?

282
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,620
Mr. Pochii.

283
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Uncle Tenbatsu.

284
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,700
Koume!

285
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,520
What is that outfit?

286
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,660
It's disgusting.

287
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,060
Change your clothes!

288
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,400
No thank you.

289
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,680
It's my money.

290
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,700
It's my right, right?

291
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,980
What are you talking about?

292
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,080
A human from the PI security office?

293
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,800
Don't talk about that.

294
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,620
It's okay, why do you say that?

295
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,160
I'll tell this stubborn old man some respect.

296
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,620
You are useless for the go.

297
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,500
Shut up, you!

298
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,460
I'm Kouji Kouji!

299
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,580
This feels so bad!

300
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,860
What are you doing?

301
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,480
She's the one who's getting in my way.

302
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,360
I'll put you back.

303
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,920
You're a real bastard.

304
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,400
I'm Jinmen Ken!

305
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,560
You're so weird!

306
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,840
What are you doing?

307
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,980
What the hell is this?

308
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,840
I'm Kouji Kouji.

309
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,860
I'm Kouji Kouji!

310
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,640
I'm Kouji Kouji!

311
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,620
I'm Kouji Kouji!

312
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,620
I'm Kouji Kouji!

313
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,980
I'm Kouji Kouji!

314
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,220
How's that?

315
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,020
You bastard!

316
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,220
You're playing with my body!

317
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,940
I'll beat you to death!

318
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,980
Hey, Ryozu!

319
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,940
I don't want to lose!

320
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,040
You're a rock-a-mole, you're a cockroach!

321
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,680
Come on, Koume.

322
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,980
Let's go back to Heaven together!

323
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,220
No. I'm not going!

324
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,360
You're a good boy.

325
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,000
Go home!

326
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,800
No!

327
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,700
Don't make things up!

328
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,520
I don't want to!

329
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,860
Don't try to be a shield to your grandchild!

330
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,760
Rika-chan.

331
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,460
D-You...!

332
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,060
How did you know of my name!?

333
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,820
You've been investigated properly.

334
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,580
Rika-chan.

335
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,260
You Papaya,

336
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,740
went to school

337
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,960
and ate poop in school.

338
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,520
Well done.

339
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,840
Rika-chan.

340
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,040
Yeah! And her nickname was Omo-rasi Rika-chan.

341
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,160
I can't believe it!

342
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,460
They froze the secret of the big brother!

343
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,620
I just answered because they asked, isn't that dangerous?

344
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,120
No, if it's dangerous, that's...

345
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,960
But I'd like to share my opinion on it!

346
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,600
It's a masterpiece to say an apology for the dialogue that got Rika-chan to her grandmother!

347
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,460
Root!

348
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,620
Hey, Mr. Yaochi!

349
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,800
You're so kind.

350
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,860
You're always working hard.

351
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,800
It must be hard for you, Ryozu.

352
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,880
It's hard for me, too.

353
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:18,920
I'm in charge of the store,

354
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,220
so please understand.

355
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,180
So, I won't say anything else.

356
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,360
Right, Ryozu?

357
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,300
Then, I'll listen to what you say.

358
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,780
Then, I'll listen to what you say.

359
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,900
Just one week until the spring break is over.

360
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,680
Just one week until the spring break is over.

361
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,160
You can stay in the basement.

362
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,440
However, the air in the basement is dirty.

363
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,660
There are many bad guys.

364
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,200
It's not a place for humans to live.

365
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,600
It's not a place for humans to live.

366
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:44,860
Thank you very much.

367
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,240
Because everyone says that the basement is fun.

368
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,000
I want to buy cute clothes and walk around Shibuya and Roppongi.

369
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,280
I want to buy cute clothes and walk around Shibuya and Roppongi.

370
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,980
Everyone is lying.

371
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,480
In fact, the basement is...

372
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,160
the scary place where demons from hell come to eat humans.

373
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,420
the scary place where demons from hell come to eat humans.

374
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,860
the scary place where demons from hell come to eat humans.

375
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,740
Don't say such a thing.

376
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,960
It hurts. It hurts.

377
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,460
I'm educating my children like that,

378
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,840
so I'm going to do it at home.

379
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,420
I'm going to do it at home.

380
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,600
Shut up! You're a big-ass!

381
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,880
I heard you cried and asked me to do it.

382
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,920
If you don't marry me,

383
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,660
I'll cut your balls and jump to hell and commit suicide.

384
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,020
I'll cut your balls and jump to hell and commit suicide.

385
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,560
I'll cut your balls and jump to hell and commit suicide.

386
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,700
I understand. I was just talking nonsense.

387
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,080
All right.

388
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,420
I'll take care of it with responsibility,

389
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,120
so don't worry.

390
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,460
But...

391
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,860
You're telling the cute children to go on a trip, aren't you?

392
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,960
We're with you, so don't worry.

393
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,220
It's okay.

394
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,540
It's okay.

395
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,620
Mr. Hanayama.

396
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,380
I understand your feelings of concern for your grandchildren.

397
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,040
I understand your feelings of concern for your grandchildren.

398
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,220
But what do you think?

399
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,200
Your grandchildren are 16 years old.

400
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,180
I think it's a good chance to develop their self-esteem.

401
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,960
Mr. Hanayama.

402
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,920
Can't you entrust your grandchildren to us?

403
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,800
I understand.

404
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,980
Then it's okay.

405
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,580
Then it's okay.

406
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,660
Thank you, grandpa.

407
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,020
If anything happens, I'll call you right away.

408
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,320
I'll come to pick you up right away.

409
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,600
I got it.

410
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,840
And then...

411
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,820
This is your grandfather's money.

412
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,800
Yes!

413
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,740
This is a secret from my mother and father.

414
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,620
Thank you, grandpa.

415
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,400
You're acting like a wizard in heaven, but you're acting like a human.

416
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,960
You're acting like a wizard in heaven, but you're acting like a human.

417
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,340
You have to be careful with your health, Koume!

418
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,040
Yes!

419
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,440
Bye-bye, Rika-chan!

420
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,500
Rika-chan, stop it!

421
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:31,780
Rika-chan, stop it!

422
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,520
Bye!

423
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,340
Koume-chan, you can do anything with magic, right?

424
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,740
Yes, roughly.

425
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,720
I'll give you soft cream, so come with me.

426
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,840
I'll give you soft cream, so come with me.

427
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,020
I'm so happy!

428
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,660
I'm afraid of your kindness.

429
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,640
I have a bad feeling about this.

430
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,900
I'm going to go out for a while.

431
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,840
Don't take your eyes off Ryotsu.

432
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,480
Okay!

433
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,760
Look, there are a lot of horses running.

434
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:57,980
Yes.

435
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,820
This is a video of the horse sports event, isn't it?

436
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,500
Look at this horse called "Billy No Hope".

437
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,200
It's always Billy.

438
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,680
Don't you think it's pitiful?

439
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,080
It's pitiful.

440
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,300
I want to make this horse the best once.

441
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,600
I want to make this horse the best once.

442
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,160
Koume-chan.

443
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,540
Then, I'll make you the best with Koume's magic.

444
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,820
But, is that okay?

445
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:19,900
But, is that okay?

446
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,920
Of course!

447
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,920
If Billy gets first place, the big hole will be full of money.

448
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,140
No, the horse will be happy.

449
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,580
Then, let's go back to the past together and go to the sports event.

450
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:30,960
Then, let's go back to the past together and go to the sports event.

451
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,700
Then, let's go back to the sports event.

452
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,560
You idiot!

453
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,780
Grandpa!

454
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,960
Have you not returned to heaven yet?

455
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,600
If you think this is the case,

456
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,680
you're right.

457
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,760
If you change the past, the future will change.

458
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,600
If you try to make Koume do that this time,

459
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,680
I'll make you go to hell.

460
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,260
I've seen that on a school trip.

461
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,700
I've seen that on a school trip.

462
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,360
It's so scary.

463
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,980
It's not a hell trip.

464
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,380
I'll take you to the real hell.

465
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,580
Remember that!

466
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,060
You're right.

467
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,600
I learned in class that changing the past

468
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,060
is a crime of time violation.

469
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,840
Then, there's no magic.

470
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,440
Then, there's no magic.

471
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,320
Wait.

472
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,420
I see. You have to change the past.

473
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,700
Koume, can you teleport to the future?

474
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,800
I can.

475
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:20,960
I learned it last month.

476
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,720
Next Sunday.

477
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,880
Can you do it?

478
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,020
I think I can.

479
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,520
Then, let's go.

480
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,940
Let's go to the mountain.

481
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,560
Let's go to the mountain.

482
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,900
Let's go to next Sunday.

483
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,120
Ryo and the others are so quiet.

484
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,080
I'm worried.

485
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,620
Koume!

486
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:52,920
Senpai!

487
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,720
Huh? He's not here!

488
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,620
He's gone again!

489
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,760
You're changing Koume into the taxi.

490
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,840
I should have helped him.

491
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,520
I should have helped him.

492
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,200
I should have helped him.

493
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,840
I did it!

494
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,420
I came to the future of a week.

495
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,820
But it doesn't feel like the future at all.

496
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,580
Six days won't change anything.

497
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,300
What?

498
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,780
I'm standing here.

499
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,160
It's Ryo-san's appearance after 6 days.

500
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,260
He's still skipping work, huh?

501
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,620
This is so creepy.

502
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,760
He's stretched his nose and reading an etch-book.

503
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,040
But he looks like this to others.

504
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,020
I'll be careful from now on.

505
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,660
Look at yourself and fix my behavior.

506
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,220
Koume, go buy a news paper about the race.

507
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,040
Me too.

508
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,620
If I go and find him, we'll be in trouble.

509
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,580
That's true. I'll be right back.

510
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,780
I'll be waiting outside.

511
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:44,900
I'll be waiting outside.

512
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,340
I'm sure he'll be on the race results on Saturday.

513
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,060
He's going to be a big deal.

514
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,760
Pull! Pull!

515
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,540
Shoot!

516
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,620
What? A mirror?

517
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,840
I'm such an idiot.

518
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,960
I'll go take a look.

519
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,040
Senpai!

520
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,780
Huh? He's not here.

521
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,820
He disappeared again!

522
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,160
You're using Koume as a taxi driver, aren't you?

523
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,440
We have to solve this, though.

524
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,500
What?

525
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,720
Senpai! Koume! Where have you been?

526
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,460
I went to see Mirai.

527
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,640
Mirai?

528
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,300
But why is he going to see Mirai again?

529
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,780
Ta-da! I bought this.

530
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,120
A news paper about the race?

531
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,080
This has the results of the race on Saturday this week.

532
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,800
Are you going to make money out of it?

533
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,760
You idiot! Why?

534
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,740
You're going to get a thousand times more than what you've earned in the last five races.

535
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,960
Even if you spend 10,000 yen, it's still 10,000.

536
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,840
If you spend 1 million yen, you'll get 1 billion.

537
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,960
But what are we going to do with the money?

538
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,100
That's right, Senpai.

539
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,060
You'll lose a lot of money with the pachinko, and you won't get a thousand.

540
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,900
You're out of your mind, Gagawa!

541
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,820
You're going to lend me 1 million yen, aren't you?

542
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,720
Kei, you can't lend me money.

543
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,800
I know. I won't lend you money.

544
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,620
The manager also said that lending money to you is forbidden.

545
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,480
Don't say such harsh things.

546
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,140
If you make money, I'll double it.

547
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,940
No, you can't.

548
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,420
Then I'll give you a hundred million.

549
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,440
No, I'll give you a hundred million.

550
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,220
That's a very good story.

551
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,600
Chief!

552
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,180
Is that what you're talking about?

553
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,760
Yes, I heard everything.

554
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,220
No, it's all a joke.

555
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,640
It's a joke, of course.

556
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,360
Please don't be serious.

557
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,380
You idiot!

558
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,180
What is he thinking in the hands of a policeman?

559
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,700
It's a joke.

560
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,000
Are you really safe?

561
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,920
I'll drive you far away.

562
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,400
You can't go where you're going.

563
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,320
You should pay me.

564
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,060
Hey, enough gurgling.

565
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,140
What's a gurgling?

566
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:52,900
He's going to take me with him.

567
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,480
You are not going.

568
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,200
That's rude.

569
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,420
You are going to be imprisoned.

570
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,740
Don't judge me just because you haven't experienced anything.

571
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,480
I don't go to military.

572
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,840
I'm going to test the power of the paddles.

573
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,760
He's a man.

574
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,160
I will do my best.

575
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,920
Damn. I can't believe I'm going to get a chance to play with the super manba sword.

576
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,700
I understand. I'm sorry, Chief.

577
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,700
What the hell are you talking about?

578
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,740
Hey! If you don't do this...

579
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,600
Hey! Hey! Hey!

580
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,660
What are you doing?

581
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

582
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,040
Hoi! Hoi!

583
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
To the crossroads of yesterday morning!

584
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,120
It disappeared!

585
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,840
What should we do?

586
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,140
Koume, can't you call your grandpa?

587
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,040
I see. Grandpa!

588
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,200
It's a big problem! Come here right now!

589
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,460
What's wrong, Koume?

590
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,320
Grandpa!

591
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,060
No, it's just that I was enjoying the rest of the vacation.

592
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,880
It's a big problem, Grandpa! Actually...

593
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,400
What?

594
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,520
I told you that you wouldn't go back to the past, but that idiot...

595
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,600
I think it was yesterday.

596
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,560
I was going to go to the crossroads of yesterday.

597
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,900
I understand.

598
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,700
When you say crossroads, it's the time when the pachinko shop is disbanded.

599
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,560
I see.

600
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,720
I'm going to transfer the money that I was going to lose at the pachinko to the field.

601
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,960
All right! We'll follow you right away!

602
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,080
What?

603
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,740
What are you doing?

604
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,560
Hey, Ryo! Ryo, aren't you coming?

605
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,200
Who are you?

606
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,820
Koume!

607
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,680
Koume!

608
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,580
You'll be home tomorrow.

609
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,680
I don't know if you'll be home by tomorrow.

610
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,540
I see.

611
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,540
Ryo!

612
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:43,840
Hey, Ryo!

613
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,720
You're not coming tomorrow, are you?

614
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,460
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

615
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,300
Sorry to keep you waiting!

616
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:49,860
I'm back!

617
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,960
I'm going to make a lot of money today!

618
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,560
It seems like the senior isn't here at the moment.

619
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,640
What?

620
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,480
What's wrong?

621
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,860
Come to think of it...

622
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
Ryo, you were wrong about the spell.

623
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,840
What would you do if you got the wrong spell, Koume?

624
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,760
I'm sure Ryo went to a different era!

625
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,000
What?

626
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,200
What?

627
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,420
It's cold.

628
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,140
It's cold!

629
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,700
Who are you?

630
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,280
What are you?

631
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,460
Where are we?

632
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
A castle?

633
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,700
What? Nikko? Edomura?

634
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,520
No, it might be the movie village in Kyoto.

635
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,820
I was in a hurry, so I was looking for a magic spell.

636
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,000
I was in a hurry, so I was looking for a magic spell.

637
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,380
Hey!

638
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,300
What are you talking about?

639
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,640
Don't be so serious.

640
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,800
You're working part-time.

641
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,240
You're working part-time.

642
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,440
It looks like a real sword.

643
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,440
Lend me a little.

644
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,140
Shut up!

645
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,960
It's real!

646
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,080
What's going on?

647
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,700
Come on!

648
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,260
The bad guy is here!

649
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,620
It's the bad guy!

650
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,300
It's the bad guy!

651
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
We didn't find the bad guy yet!

652
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,820
By the time you get bigger, the boss will be caught, no matter what!

653
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,540
We didn't find the bad guy!

654
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,320
It's like we're in an extraordinary era.

655
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,040
Anyway, this is not good.

656
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,780
Let's dress up for the sake of it.

657
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,940
Let's dress up for the sake of it.

658
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,240
Let's dress up.

659
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,080
Let's dress up.

660
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,600
Let's dress up.

661
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,720
What's this?

662
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,180
Did I pronounce your spell wrong?

663
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,460
Let's see.

664
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,460
Let's see.

665
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,060
Let's see.

666
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,380
Oh, no!

667
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,600
I was wrong again.

668
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,860
I was wrong again.

669
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,920
What was it?

670
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,520
I was right!

671
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,820
I was wrong again.

672
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:54,020
I don't doubt this.

673
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,200
Hey, monkey.

674
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,020
Monkey?

675
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,660
Where's the monkey?

676
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,140
What are you talking about, monkey?

677
00:24:59,380 --> 00:24:59,780
It's about you.

678
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:00,840
Me?

679
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,360
What are you doing here?

680
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,680
Oh, no.

681
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,500
I was looking for it because it's hiding in the tree.

682
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,880
I see.

683
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,160
Anyway, monkey.

684
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,900
It's about time that Lord Nobunaga will rise.

685
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,840
Lord Nobunaga?

686
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:14,960
You can stay here.

687
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,860
Go back to Zori Tori.

688
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:16,940
Oh.

689
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,340
Nobunaga?

690
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,160
I've heard of him somewhere.

691
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,900
I'm in trouble.

692
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,080
I'm not good at history.

693
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,420
Hey, hurry up!

694
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,220
Yes, sir!

695
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,120
That's the way.

696
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,720
Watch out.

697
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,540
Look.

698
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:35,960
Huh?

699
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,340
What a race.

700
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,300
I can't see anything at all.

701
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,340
Honda, I'm glad you came.

702
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,340
Hey, what's wrong with that suit?

703
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,140
If you talk about it, it will be long, so I'll bite it.

704
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,540
Ah, Lord Nobunaga!

705
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,100
That's right.

706
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,180
We are living in the era where that Nobunaga lives.

707
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,540
Hey, you shouldn't be here, too.

708
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,640
You can't fool me.

709
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,720
I'm not lying. Take a look.

710
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,860
Isn't this a castle?

711
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,280
Is this Nikko Edomora or Kyoto's Eigamora?

712
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,180
Don't make the same reaction as me.

713
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,960
Anyway, you can definitely be cut with that outfit.

714
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,540
One Yamato, and Honda will be safe.

715
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,220
Honda will be safe, too!

716
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,660
This is Yoshito.

717
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,740
Wow, senpai. You're like a magician.

718
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,000
What's wrong?

719
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,740
If I talk about this, it'll take longer.

720
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,220
Oh, maybe this is a dream I'm having.

721
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,380
Dream?

722
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,220
Wait a minute.

723
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,940
If I keep it as a dream, it might be more convenient.

724
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,060
That's right. This is in your dream.

725
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,160
What? Then you should have said that first.

726
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,940
I thought it was strange.

727
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,400
By the way, you must have loved TV period dramas, right?

728
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,200
If it's about period dramas, leave it to me.

729
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,240
People are about me.

730
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:58,600
What?

731
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,460
I'll call you a period drama professor.

732
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,900
I'm counting on you!

733
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,200
So, Honda, who is Nobunaga?

734
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,860
Oda Nobunaga is famous for his military service in the war.

735
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,840
He tried to unify the country.

736
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,080
Oh.

737
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,960
But the one who actually unified the country was Hideyoshi Toyotomi.

738
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,200
Hey, I've heard of his name.

739
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,540
Yeah.

740
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,100
Someone's here.

741
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,220
Everyone's having a big fuss over a weirdo.

742
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,100
But he's not one of those old-timey guys.

743
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,800
Hey.

744
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,860
Oh.

745
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,540
Hey.

746
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,620
Oh.

747
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,340
Oh.

748
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:40,640
Oh.

749
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,520
Oh.

750
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,320
Oh.

751
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:42,800
Oh.

752
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,220
Oh.

753
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:43,340
Oh.

754
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:43,540
Oh.

755
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,620
Oh.

756
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,220
Oh.

757
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,240
Oh.

758
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,280
Oh.

759
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,360
Oh.

760
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,100
Oh.

761
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,320
Oh.

762
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:45,480
What?

763
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:45,800
Is it a mirror?

764
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,460
Don't be stupid!

765
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,080
It's not a mirror!

766
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,180
Who are you to say that?

767
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,980
Don't you mean a twin brother from the dead?

768
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,640
Nothing at all.

769
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,940
And who are you?

770
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,580
I'm Hiyoshi Maru, who has become totally stranding with Lord Nobunaga.

771
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,400
Hiyoshi Maru?

772
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:00,820
What?

773
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,360
Did you know him?

774
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,680
He's the name of Hideyoshi's childhood.

775
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,140
What?

776
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,680
So is yourka the one who is going to be Hideyoshi Toyotomi?

777
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,740
That's right.

778
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,480
Dream is like story.

779
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:09,520
It's cool.

780
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:09,880
It's a very interesting story.

781
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,440
By the way, the samurai I met earlier called me a monkey.

782
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm sure he mistook me for this person.

783
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,980
Monkey is Hideyoshi's nickname.

784
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,800
But, rather than a monkey, a gorilla suits you.

785
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
Stop talking nonsense!

786
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,100
Um, what are you talking about that I don't understand?

787
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,580
You're a man who can't stand it if you're a man who takes over the country.

788
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,560
That's right.

789
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,580
Are you really Hiyoshima-ru?

790
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,520
Y-Yes.

791
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,200
Kyo-chan, why don't you dig somewhere?

792
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,260
Maybe you'll find some hidden treasures of the Tokugawa and Toyotomi families.

793
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,340
Hmm...

794
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:43,820
Huh?

795
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,760
Honda!

796
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,280
Do you have a lot of money?

797
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,860
Well, I guess I had a lot of money because I was a man who took over the country.

798
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,600
I see.

799
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,260
A lot of money.

800
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,560
Oh...

801
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,920
I might be better off than you if I make a living in the field.

802
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,560
Kyo-chan!

803
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,180
Thank you for letting me be a maid.

804
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,020
Well, I'm going to go out of my way.

805
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,880
Anyway, we can't find you here.

806
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,140
No, we can't find you anywhere...

807
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,320
What is it this time?

808
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,440
The history hasn't changed so far.

809
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,740
-Because it's okay. -I don't get it!

810
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,720
It's too late that the history has changed.

811
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,920
Anyway, let's just scrape past each era and look for them!

812
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,740
Scheme 3 An explosion of an additional century.

813
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,180
Scheme 3 An explosion of an additional century.

814
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,580
-You mean, I'm going to be a

815
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,260
-Yes, that's right.

816
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,260
-Hey, hey, hey, just kidding. Just make it eyebrows.

817
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,100
-It's not a joke, huh, Honda?

818
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,040
-Yes. You will be called Hideo Toyotomi in the future and you will become a white-eyed.

819
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,240
-Hey, hey, why do you know that?

820
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,560
-Even if you ask me why, Senpai...

821
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,360
-Anyway, it will be.

822
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
-It's Lord Nobunaga!

823
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,640
-Do-sha!

824
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,860
-I know the way Lord Nobunaga is.

825
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,280
-Oh, what should we do?

826
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,800
-What are you talking about?

827
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,980
-Lord Nobunaga is a very short-lived person.

828
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,980
If I go on like this, I may be cut off.

829
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,920
What should I do?

830
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,600
My life ends up here.

831
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,960
-Okay, leave it to me.

832
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,480
You two are hiding.

833
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,780
-Hot-moth.

834
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,140
-Nobunaga.

835
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:36,940
-Good morning.

836
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,700
It seems that he was awake.

837
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,660
Oh, damn it!

838
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,880
That monkey was on my back!

839
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,240
Wait!

840
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,100
I'll beat you to death!

841
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:49,780
Wait!

842
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,220
That monkey was on my back, so it's not warm.

843
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,300
Then why is it warm?

844
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:02,860
It's because it's cold because of the snow, so I put the tent in its place to warm it up a little.

845
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,980
What?

846
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,200
Is that so?

847
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,700
Monkey!

848
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,280
You think you can do that for me?

849
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,260
Yes!

850
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,180
You're a loyal man.

851
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:11,840
Monkey, enough of this.

852
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,280
You're going to be my slave from today.

853
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,800
Thank you.

854
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:23,160
Mr. Ryotsu, thank you very much.

855
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,380
How can I thank you?

856
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,380
If you're going to thank me, you should give half of your property to me when you take over the country.

857
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,280
You're joking again.

858
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,300
I'm not joking!

859
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,160
Listen.

860
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,440
Help me to become a man.

861
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,480
I'm sure half of your property is cheap.

862
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,000
All right, I'll give it to you.

863
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,320
OK. I promised you.

864
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,640
Then I'll go.

865
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,500
Where?

866
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,820
Come on!

867
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,220
Hurry up.

868
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,280
OK.

869
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,360
I'm going, Mr. Ryotsu.

870
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,080
Go!

871
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,180
Bye!

872
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,960
Don't forget your promise.

873
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,420
Where are you going?

874
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,460
What's happening?

875
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:05,920
You'll see.

876
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,940
It's an era of the white man, Hideyoshi.

877
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,620
Then, I'll play the role of Hideyoshi!

878
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:09,900
OK.

879
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,240
Let's start!

880
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

881
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,840
Go to Osaka castle!

882
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,880
That's enough!

883
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,340
This is...

884
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,820
What's going on here?

885
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,180
Were you planning to come to Osaka castle?

886
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,120
That's weird.

887
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,640
I wasn't wrong.

888
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,640
Hey!

889
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,260
You!

890
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,540
What are you doing in my farm?

891
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,400
What are you doing in the middle of the night?!

892
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,240
Hey, I want to ask you something.

893
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,300
There should be a castle built by Hideyoshi Toyotomi around here, but I don't know.

894
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,800
Hideyoshi Toyotomi? Who is he?

895
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,780
He is Hideyoshi, who conquered the country.

896
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,160
What are you talking about?

897
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,100
Lord Yoshimoto Imaga is the one who conquered the country.

898
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,320
Yoshimoto Imaga?!

899
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,500
Who is he?

900
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,340
He is the great warlord who defeated Oda Nobunaga in the battle of Okehazama.

901
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,180
What are you talking about?

902
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,040
Oda Nobunaga is the one who lost in Okehazama.

903
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,480
That's not good.

904
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,100
Then, there's no way that Hiroshima, who hates Nobunaga, can conquer the country.

905
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,640
Honda! Let's go back to the battle of Okehazama!

906
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:16,820
Hey!

907
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,560
Help!

908
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,760
What are you doing?

909
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,960
Oh, Mr. Ryotsu. Mr. Honda.

910
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,540
You're going to fight the Imagawa army, aren't you?

911
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,220
What are you doing?

912
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,580
The Imagawa army has 40,000 soldiers, and I have 3,000.

913
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,580
I don't have any chance to win, so I thought I might as well run away.

914
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:37,940
Idiot!

915
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,260
You're so childish, so you can't follow the history!

916
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,060
No way!

917
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,680
Take off your armor.

918
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,680
I'll change my clothes again.

919
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,060
Hey!

920
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,040
What are you doing?

921
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,360
Huh?

922
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,820
What are you talking about?

923
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,320
Please don't run away.

924
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,340
You're a hundred percent right!

925
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:04,860
Hey there, nobunaga.

926
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,460
Get down.

927
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,880
What are you doing?

928
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,440
Stop.

929
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,560
What?

930
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,180
You're going back to the battle of Okehazama.

931
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:13,600
You're going back to the battle of Okehazama.

932
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,380
Stop.

933
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,880
What are you talking about?

934
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,800
You're physicallyント these墓 Onosaka.

935
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,620
What? What should I do? What should I do?

936
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,380
Please calm down, sir.

937
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,200
As far as I can see, there are 3,000 enemy soldiers.

938
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,680
This is a large army of 40,000.

939
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,620
It's not enough for us to be afraid.

940
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,340
Y- yes, sir.

941
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,660
I was in a hurry, so I did that.

942
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:10,640
I was in a hurry, so I did that.

943
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,520
Please calm down, sir.

944
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,940
Look at that, he's a Nokibe!

945
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,180
Now, it's the time to стали Mr. Miyo!

946
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,200
What is that?

947
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,640
It's Lord Nobunaga's vassal, Hiroshima!

948
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,580
Is that the one called Yoshimoto Imagawa?

949
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,280
There are two enemies!

950
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,700
Even if they die, we'll protect them!

951
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,160
Yeah!

952
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,960
It's time to taste the power of the Great Shogun's sword!

953
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,780
I'll show you!

954
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,460
Yahoo! Yoshimaru did it!

955
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,320
Hey! Hey!

956
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,580
Looking at the pathetic appearance of Yoshimoto,

957
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,660
the Koshinuke of the Imagawa have left the Kumonos.

958
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,480
Everyone,

959
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,540
you've done well!

960
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,520
Yes!

961
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,180
However,

962
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,320
the one who played the most important role in this war

963
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,540
is you, the monkey who stole Yoshimoto from the main camp!

964
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,080
Yes!

965
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,620
Therefore, from now on,

966
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,580
the monkey will serve as the kitchen of our castle!

967
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,200
From now on,

968
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,680
you will be called "Kinoshita Tokiro" again, Hiroshima!

969
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,420
Yes! Yes!

970
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,260
I'm so grateful!

971
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,920
Lord Ryotsu, thank you so much!

972
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,780
I can't thank you enough!

973
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,440
So, don't forget half of your property!

974
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,660
Yes, I know.

975
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:50,980
It's a promise!

976
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,800
Hmm...

977
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,580
Next is Osaka Castle, right?

978
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,340
Yes!

979
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,940
One mountain,

980
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,560
two parks,

981
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,080
three towns,

982
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,420
and then,

983
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,960
we're going to Osaka Castle!

984
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,520
What?

985
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,040
What is this place?

986
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,480
What is this place?

987
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,820
It's the same as the last time, right, Senpai?

988
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,780
It's strange...

989
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,760
It's the same as the last time, right, Senpai?

990
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:11,900
You guys again!

991
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,860
What are you doing?

992
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:13,840
Hey!

993
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,520
What happened to Hideyoshi at Osaka Castle?

994
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,520
I told you not to know about such a thing!

995
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,280
Huh?

996
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,340
Senpai, what's going on?

997
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,480
I can't help it.

998
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,320
It's time to go back.

999
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,280
Again?

1000
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,540
What should we do?

1001
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,020
Hey, what are you doing?

1002
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,100
Huh?

1003
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,820
Lord Ryotsu, Lord Honda!

1004
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,800
You're still here,

1005
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,300
so you can't go back to the old way.

1006
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,180
But, Lord Nobunaga

1007
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,860
is going to attack Mino,

1008
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,860
so he's telling me to build a castle

1009
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,240
in the middle of the night.

1010
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,580
It's impossible.

1011
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,720
It's not impossible.

1012
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,420
It's just a matter of history.

1013
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,340
I think he's going to use

1014
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,080
the Hachisuka Koroku

1015
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,800
and the Nobushi Corps of 2000

1016
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,360
as his childhood friends.

1017
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,080
I see.

1018
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,240
So that's what happened.

1019
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,540
I can't help it.

1020
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,920
We'll help you, too, so please do it.

1021
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,500
Really.

1022
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,560
Yes.

1023
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,180
Sorry for always.

1024
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,500
Mr. Honda has disappeared?

1025
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:08,740
Yeah.

1026
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,480
He's on his bike while he's training as a newbie.

1027
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,160
It must be Ryo-chan's doing.

1028
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,240
Oh, no!

1029
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
It's this!

1030
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,440
It's this!

1031
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,020
It's a textbook.

1032
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,460
I wonder what happened.

1033
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,460
Look.

1034
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,720
This page says,

1035
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,720
"The Battle of the Okahama"

1036
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,300
"The Battle of the Okahama"

1037
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,320
Look at the two in the middle.

1038
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,140
They're riding on the white horse.

1039
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,540
They're Ryo-chan and Mr. Honda.

1040
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,580
What?

1041
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,380
Senior!

1042
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,640
What do you mean?

1043
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,000
Ryo-chan is going to be Hideyoshi?

1044
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,600
If this continues,

1045
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,060
Japan's history will be messed up.

1046
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,460
I'm getting a headache.

1047
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,680
"The Battle of the Okahama"

1048
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,560
What's up with the 2,000-person Nobushi?

1049
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,500
What's up with the 2,000-person Nobushi?

1050
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,280
I used to have 2,000 people,

1051
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,780
but they got stuck in the river.

1052
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,360
Ryo-chan is such an idiot.

1053
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,780
It's gone.

1054
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,180
We must make more than this.

1055
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,160
No way.

1056
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,420
How can we make more than this?

1057
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,700
We'll use "Kakivari",

1058
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,920
"Kakivari"?

1059
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,200
Kakivari?

1060
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,840
Do they make the building or the soldiers

1061
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,680
in the movie?

1062
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,820
That's right.

1063
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,180
That's right.

1064
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,780
-Alright, let's start the operation! -Yeah!

1065
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:47,520
That's...

1066
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,860
That's Tokichiro Kinoshita, who's selling out in the Oda Army.

1067
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:08,500
This is bad! Mino's soldiers are attacking!

1068
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,140
-No way! -No way!

1069
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,300
Don't worry. I've already taken care of it.

1070
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,520
Stop!

1071
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,040
Stop!

1072
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,560
When a war breaks out on the land, one open pan will solve everything.

1073
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,860
One of the special police officers, Sanbagarasu, open pan Dekanosuke,

1074
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,880
is here to help!

1075
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,500
Let's have the moon energy be on our backs, and the stick of justice break through the darkness!

1076
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,000
We'll leave the war to the sky!

1077
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,640
The messenger from the moon, Dekko Dekanosuke!

1078
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,260
Just like that, Dekasaburo the Venus!

1079
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:58,920
I'm back!

1080
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,420
I love the ocean and protect justice. Who called you, Poseidon?

1081
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,320
Leave the water war to me, Dolphin Degaemon!

1082
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,260
I'm back!

1083
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,540
Here I come!

1084
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,500
From now on it won't take us a single step further!

1085
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,660
Everybody, start the attack!

1086
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,020
Stop being silly for a moment!

1087
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,100
That's not what I'm talking about!

1088
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,240
No♥

1089
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,460
We're poor, poor!

1090
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,480
There's so much loot in the city.

1091
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:45,780
Now!

1092
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,800
D- d- d- d- d- d- d- d-

1093
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,280
Fake!

1094
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,120
Ad膩の5人でか!

1095
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,580
I'll find it quickly!

1096
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,280
You would-on-dose give in!

1097
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,200
-Game over! -Gold!

1098
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,260
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

1099
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:01,360
Oh...

1100
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,740
W-waaah!

1101
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,560
W-waaah!

1102
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,300
This is it!

1103
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,000
A finishing blow!

1104
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,300
Go, go!

1105
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,660
Waaah!

1106
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,860
Okay, let's start!

1107
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:27,460
What?

1108
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,040
Tokishiro, you got a big gift!

1109
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,300
Yes!

1110
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,680
You'll be Oda's chief from today!

1111
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,020
From now on, you're called Hideyoshi, the god of the Chikuzentai!

1112
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:43,940
Yes, yes!

1113
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:44,920
Yes.

1114
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,240
You'll be Oda's chief from today!

1115
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,080
If this continues, Japan's history will be messed up.

1116
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,420
My head is starting to hurt.

1117
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:52,720
Look!

1118
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,880
This is...

1119
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,980
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1120
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,660
Aren't these people from the Special Police Department?

1121
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,740
They're the comrades of Hideyoshi, who made the Sunomata's night castle.

1122
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,800
Japan's history is going to be messed up!

1123
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,620
It's a big deal.

1124
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,160
Mr. Ryotsu, thank you so much.

1125
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,720
Thank you very much.

1126
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,520
How can I thank you?

1127
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,540
So, don't forget half of your wealth.

1128
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,740
Y-Yes, I know.

1129
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,100
It's a promise!

1130
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,460
So, next time, we're really going to Osaka Castle, right?

1131
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,000
Yeah!

1132
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,860
♪ One Yamako, a picture book, a picture book ♪

1133
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,160
♪ Let's go to Osaka Castle! ♪

1134
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,380
What is this place?

1135
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,360
It's the same as before, right, Senior?

1136
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,280
That's strange.

1137
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,800
It's you again!

1138
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:44,840
What are you doing?

1139
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,720
Hey, what happened to Hideyoshi in Osaka Castle?

1140
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,920
That's why I told you not to know about it.

1141
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,240
Why?

1142
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,480
I'm sure he took the throne this time.

1143
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,760
Huh?

1144
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,460
What are you talking about?

1145
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,440
Nobunaga Oda took the throne.

1146
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,000
What?

1147
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,420
Nobunaga was killed by Akechi Mitsuhide in Honnoji.

1148
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,220
Huh?

1149
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,680
That's not true.

1150
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,660
Nobunaga is still in high spirits and is a royal servant.

1151
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:11,980
Huh?

1152
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,600
What do you mean?

1153
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,960
What do you mean, that wasn't true?

1154
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,560
I-I know nothing bad about rice.

1155
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,720
No way.

1156
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,620
We're going to fight you again.

1157
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,860
Again...

1158
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,820
Funeral

1159
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,060
Funeral

1160
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,100
Uh, what should we do?

1161
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,500
It's time to make a vow.

1162
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,020
What are you doing here?

1163
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,120
If you keep talking about that...

1164
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,980
What can I do?

1165
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,440
I am sorry.

1166
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,760
Stop it.

1167
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,220
I am sorry.

1168
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:41,320
Stop it.

1169
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:41,600
Let's get rid of this enemy.

1170
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,620
Stop it.

1171
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,140
Oh, you said it already. Oh, you said it already. Oh, you said it already.

1172
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,340
If you don't cry, I'll kill you.

1173
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,140
Nobunaga!

1174
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,300
Hideyoshi! You're supposed to be going to take care of Takamatsu Castle.

1175
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,200
Why are you here?

1176
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,460
That's because...

1177
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,560
No questions asked!

1178
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,860
I can't do this!

1179
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,360
No! No! No!

1180
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,200
Let's get out of here!

1181
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:34,020
I-It's a fire!

1182
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,540
I'll attack. I won't attack.

1183
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,940
I'll attack. I'll attack.

1184
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,000
Mister! I have something!

1185
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:48,940
To be continued...

1186
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,480
I'm so lucky! A prize!

1187
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,540
Hey, hey! Let's say that this prize is ours!

1188
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,500
We'll name it "Honnojirohen".

1189
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,240
That's what we want!

1190
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,460
-Honnojirohen! -Honnojirohen!

1191
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,860
Huh? Where did you get "Nobunaga"?

1192
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,960
I don't know. We got it last year, so I don't know where it is.

1193
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,980
But now there are some traces of history.

1194
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,540
Well then, this time...

1195
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:09,860
Yeah!

1196
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:14,400
Let's go to Yama Chong E Honno-Daratte Pui Pui Osaka Jyo!

1197
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:30,760
I've done it, Mr. Ryotsugo.

1198
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,200
I'm a rich man now!

1199
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,880
I, Kanpakutai-ko, am ready to receive you!

1200
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,840
Ryotsugo...

1201
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,660
Mr. Yaguchi, Mr. Honda, please raise your heads.

1202
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,160
Hideyoshi, you've become much more handsome!

1203
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,740
No, it's all thanks to you.

1204
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,440
You didn't forget your promise, did you?

1205
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,820
I know.

1206
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,440
Big and small, they're all around!

1207
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,940
What's that?

1208
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,300
Ouch!

1209
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,180
That's all you've got to enjoy!

1210
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,600
Ryozu!

1211
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,600
Senpai!

1212
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,960
That's terrible, Ryo-san!

1213
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,880
Ryo-chan!

1214
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,280
You guys!

1215
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,360
Ryozu Kankichi!

1216
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,860
You're trying to change the past and make money!

1217
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,360
You're a total moron!

1218
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,460
You're not going to go to hell!

1219
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,580
Get lost!

1220
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:39,700
That's a nightmare!

1221
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,080
I'm going to the place that's more terrifying than hell!

1222
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,960
I'm going to the mountain!

1223
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,280
I'm going to Honda!

1224
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:56,500
Where is the place that's more terrifying than hell?

1225
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:04,560
I'm going to the mountain!

1226
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,200
Help! Help!

1227
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,820
You're in this age!

1228
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,240
Monkey, it's all your fault!

1229
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,400
It's all your fault!

1230
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,260
Isn't this too realistic for a dream?

1231
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,640
Damn it!

1232
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,440
I hate time travel!

I want to shoot you down

1253
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:22,220
For some reason love is so cowardly

1254
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,840
Don't hide everything that's too strong

1255
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:29,600
Don't hide everything that's too strong

1256
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:36,180
I want to be loved someday

1257
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:41,580
I want to show you that I'm a child who can't go out

1258
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:47,180
I want to hold you tight

1259
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,700
I want to shoot you down

1260
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:51,980

1270

I must give you a sad message today

1271
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:21,940
My name is Ryo

1272
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,940
That Ryōtsu!

1273
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,140
That Ryōtsu!

1274
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,600
He's going to star in a movie!

1275
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,640
This is the movie "2000 Year New Year's Anniversary" by Kazushikaku-Kameari Park.

1276
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,700
I'm not listening!
