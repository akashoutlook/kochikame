1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,520
"I love you too"

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,460
A

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:19,920
"A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A"

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,820
Come to me if you're broke.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,140
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,920
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

7
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,540
I'm sure it'll be alright.

8
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,480
Come to me if you're broke.

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,480
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,480
Look here, red clouds are burning.

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,220
I'm sure it'll be alright.

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,640
" Satan is living Bruno."

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,480
"You know?"

14
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,280
"You know, right?"

15
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,680
If you understand, then shut up and follow me!

16
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,220
Director, Ryo Tsutankichi

17
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,360
Episode 1: The

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,500
Everyone! I am the new official of the Kansai Prefectural Office, Ryo Tsutankichi!

19
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,340
You finally did it, Ryo-chan!

20
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,060
Senior, congratulations!

21
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,480
Ryo-tsu, I believed that this day would come!

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,020
I have nothing left to think about!

23
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,140
I don't care if I die anytime, Ryo-tsu!

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,820
Ryo-tsu! Ryo-tsu!

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,200
Ryo-tsu!

26
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,360
Ryo-tsu, wake up, you idiot! Ryo-tsu!

27
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,580
Ohara-kun...

28
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,200
Ohara-kun?

29
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,100
I don't know what to say.

30
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,720
I'm going to have a lunch with the Prime Minister...

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,880
Idiot! What are you doing?

32
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,140
Huh?

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,040
It seems like you were having a great dream.

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,920
That's also very convenient for me.

35
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,400
Huh? Dream?

36
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,680
This is reality.

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,300
Huh?

38
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,880
Open your eyes and look closely.

39
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,660
This is the report of your writing.

40
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,700
The number 1 looks like 7, and the 5 of 5 looks like a cow.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,840
It's true. And it's mostly in hiragana.

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,440
There are places that are faked in the picture.

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,140
That's a very detailed thing.

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,440
You can't think like that.

45
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,440
That's why you've always been a junior president.

46
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,920
Listen, Ryo-tsu. Listen carefully.

47
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,140
This is not the age for just a career.

48
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,200
It's not the age for just a career.

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,220
The features of the social structure of our country,

50
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,260
the year-end-distance-distance ratio, has collapsed.

51
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,020
That's the age where you're evaluated based on your own ability.

52
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,600
Do you understand?

53
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,340
S-surely.

54
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,540
Then, you don't think we should be trying to promote you with your ability?

55
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,180
Ahaha!

56
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,560
In my dreams, I was a general secretary.

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,560
You're not talking about your dreams!

58
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,720
Ugh...

59
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,600
No matter what I say, I'm getting a year-end-distance-distance ratio in my horse ears...

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:37,860
Oh!

61
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,060
Thank you!

62
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,000
Ryo-tsu!

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,820
Oh, Director!

64
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,060
Oh, Ohara-kun. Is Ryo-tsu here?

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,160
Director, is there anything that you need?

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
No, nothing.

67
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,820
Anyway, give me a glass of water.

68
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,020
O-okay!

69
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:53,840
...

70
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,860
So, what happened?

71
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,240
I-I still think it's a dream,

72
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,060
but it's my mistake.

73
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,120
Ohara-kun, please read it.

74
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,340
Please try it.

75
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,700
Ah, an example?

76
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,160
Um, I'll be appointed as the head of the Katsushika-cho transportation department...

77
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,260
Eh?

78
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,580
R-Ryotsu Kankichi!

79
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,560
R-Ryotsu is...

80
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,920
The head of the Katsushika-cho transportation department?

81
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,620
Y-You're the head?

82
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,040
The head?

83
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,020
I-I am?

84
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,480
The new supercomputer introduced by the head of the Katsushika-cho transportation department

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,080
has been analyzed and determined by analyzing all the data of the individuals.

86
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,200
I-Is that a computer error?

87
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,340
I've asked the head of the Katsushika-cho transportation department, but unfortunately...

88
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,980
There's no doubt about it.

89
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,440
It's not something that can't be!

90
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,640
As the head of the Katsushika-cho transportation department said,

91
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,560
it's not the time for just a career to come out!

92
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,300
Ryo-chan, when you're on your side, there's something reliable about you.

93
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,320
Huh?

94
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,500
Huh?

95
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,280
Hahaha!

96
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,380
The time has finally come for me!

97
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:05,780
...

98
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,700
So, what about the head of the Katsushika-cho transportation department?

99
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,340
He was transferred to the end of the world.

100
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,280
To the end of the world?

101
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,740
Poor thing...

102
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,060
What? Of course!

103
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,940
That head of the Katsushika-cho transportation department didn't rely on anyone.

104
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,060
It's natural that he couldn't survive in this age of capitalism.

105
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,660
B-But suddenly, the head of the Katsushika-cho transportation department...

106
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,240
Yeah...

107
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,440
The head of the Katsushika-cho transportation department seems to have a position of her own.

108
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,680
Chief!

109
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,580
That's the very basis of the main idea.

110
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,300
Isn't it good?

111
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,640
To proceed without any people.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,760
That's what we call "practice"!

113
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,080
The head of the Katsushika-cho transportation department also just said,

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,120
"It's time for young people to lose their enthusiasm and be evaluated for their real ability."

115
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,160
He just said that to me.

116
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,000
Uh...

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,220
But...

118
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,640
I don't have all the energy...

119
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,600
Huh?

120
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:56,620
What?

121
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,000
The head of the Katsushika-cho transportation department said,

122
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,520
What!?

123
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,800
What's wrong, Kei-chan?

124
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,380
The head of the police station contacted me.

125
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,440
He wants to send you to the police station.

126
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,340
What!?

127
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,880
Is that true, Nakagawa?

128
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,660
Yes.

129
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,740
It's strange for the head of the police station to be the head of the police station.

130
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,300
So, he wants to do something special.

131
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,300
I'm too shocked today.

132
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,780
The police station...

133
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:25,980
I don't know how to say it.

134
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,480
He fired the head of the police station.

135
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm so touched.

136
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,820
Ohara-kun.

137
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,580
Ohara-kun?

138
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,560
This is called ability.

139
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,620
The era when only the career was good is over.

140
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,060
Even if you were good at fighting, you could go up.

141
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,340
Ohara-kun.

142
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,860
What?

143
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,060
My shoes are dirty.

144
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,240
They're sandals, not shoes.

145
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,680
Please polish them.

146
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
What did you say, Ryotsu?

147
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,360
What?

148
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,080
It's not Ryotsu, it's the head of the police station.

149
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,080
Ryotsu... head of the police station...

150
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,120
Be careful how you talk.

151
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,080
You'll be scared if the police station gets angry.

152
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,240
The head of the police station...

153
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,880
Good morning, Mr. Ryotsu.

154
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,420
Mr. Ryotsu, good morning.

155
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,760
That's the desk of the chief.

156
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,160
It's so different from the desk at the police station.

157
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,100
Good morning, chief.

158
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,700
Why are you so in the mood?

159
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,800
Why are you so gloomy?

160
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,700
Komachi-kun, Naoko-kun.

161
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, the former captain.

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,860
No, Chief.

163
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you have any opinions?

164
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,280
Say anything you want.

165
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,760
It's important to listen to your subordinates' opinions.

166
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,400
I don't have any opinions.

167
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,420
No, you don't.

168
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,560
Oh, that's good.

169
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,280
No, I can't do this.

170
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,780
I knocked down the trash can.

171
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm sorry, but I'll clean it up, Komachi.

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,440
You knocked it down, didn't you?

173
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,840
You're not going to fight the chief?

174
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm dizzy.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,040
I knocked it down again.

176
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,260
Hey, you knocked it down on purpose.

177
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,420
My head hurts.

178
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,940
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

179
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,600
This is no good.

180
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,220
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

181
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,740
This is bad.

182
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm sorry, but please clean this up, too.

183
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,720
I suddenly have a headache.

184
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,260
Naoko,

185
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:49,940
let's go.

186
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,760
Yes, yes.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,040
Oh, my.

188
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,420
Why did you do this to him?

189
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,000
That's right.

190
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,320
To hide the taste.

191
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,980
I feel sorry for the trash can, so I'll wipe it with a cloth.

192
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,180
Here you are, Chief.

193
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,680
Thank you.

194
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sorry, I changed my mind.

195
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,760
I'll have coffee.

196
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,980
Coffee?

197
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,780
Bring it quickly.

198
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,380
It's coffee.

199
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:19,500
Coffee.

200
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,560
Yes, yes.

201
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,020
I'll make you pay for it this time.

202
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,340
Here you are.

203
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,780
Thank you.

204
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,960
Oh, it looks delicious.

205
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,740
Sorry.

206
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,840
I changed my mind again.

207
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,880
I want black tea.

208
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,440
Here's black tea.

209
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,500
Stop with the black tea.

210
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,280
I want juice.

211
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,060
Here's the juice.

212
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,020
Green tea.

213
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,240
Oolong tea.

214
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,020
Blue juice.

215
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,000
Miso soup.

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
Why are you talking about miso soup?

217
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,740
I see.

218
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,540
I see what you're going to do.

219
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,800
I'm going to get into trouble.

220
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,740
That stupid chief.

221
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,500
But you'd better not go against him.

222
00:09:59,420 --> 00:09:59,920
You just have to make him your chief.

223
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,800
Is that so?

224
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,280
That's right.

225
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,240
If you make him your chief, he'll climb the tree.

226
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,960
I see.

227
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,480
If you make him your chief, he'll be your chief.

228
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,220
That's right.

229
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,460
Good morning, everyone.

230
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,240
Good morning.

231
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,080
Good morning, Chief Ryochi.

232
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,920
Good morning.

233
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,960
I'm feeling a little excited today.

234
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,700
Chief Ryochi, your shoulders are dirty.

235
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,640
Really?

236
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,280
Chief Ryochi, your tie is bent.

237
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,540
Really?

238
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,220
Chief Ryochi, would you like some black tea?

239
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,040
Or would you like some coffee, black tea, oolong tea?

240
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,020
I've got them all ready.

241
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,560
Chief, you're so nice.

242
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,740
You're right.

243
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,540
He's always making a fuss, but it's good for him.

244
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,900
He's an example of a single cell.

245
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,800
Huh?

246
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,340
Who's parking their bike in a place like this?

247
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,120
What is this?

248
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,000
They can't pass through here.

249
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,100
Yeah.

250
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,200
Naoko.

251
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,940
Ryo-chan, it's your turn to do this.

252
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,100
Yeah.

253
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,460
A bike?

254
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,640
That's right. Do something with Ryo-chan's power.

255
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,300
I can do it.

256
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,260
Do your best for everyone.

257
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,420
I can do it.

258
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,140
If you say so.

259
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,700
Okay!

260
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,280
Leave it to Ryo-chan.

261
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,780
Wow!

262
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,660
That's amazing!

263
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,560
That's a manly man.

264
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:41,640
That's amazing!

265
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:43,920
Yay!

266
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,200
Hey! Don't stop there!

267
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,060
This is Katsushika-shokotsu-ka, Kachou Ryotsu Kankichi!

268
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,960
Stop your bike at the designated place.

269
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,660
Hey, don't run away!

270
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,700
Hey, I told you not to stop there!

271
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,220
The old lady there said no!

272
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,720
You!

273
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,180
You're not getting away!

274
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,500
Now I'm going to show you my real power!

275
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,080
All Katsushika-shokotsu-ka will remove the bad-ass bikes!

276
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,200
With this strong will of Katsushika-shokotsu-ka's Ryotsu Kachou,

277
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,500
the residents and the residents of the station have come to a decision.

278
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,300
Furthermore, the Furisode Kotsu-tai was born from the idea of the Ryotsu Kachou.

279
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,540
Stop that car there!

280
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,660
F-Ferrari?

281
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,700
F-Furisode?

282
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,220
The Furisode Kotsu-tai has arrived!

283
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,380
The traffic violation is...

284
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:56,860
No!

285
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,940
O-Okay, I'm sorry.

286
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,820
...has been approved.

287
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,940
In addition, the removal of the spare traffic light,

288
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,180
and the removal of the waste road construction will support the reform of the transportation system.

289
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,240
The citizens' voices are being heard by many people.

290
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,820
Ryo-chan, you're a good man when it comes to doing things.

291
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,540
Yeah!

292
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,080
Katsushika-san!

293
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,740
Katsushika-san!

294
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,140
I hate it!

295
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,600
I've got a feeling that something is coming out of him.

296
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,280
Yeah.

297
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Well, well, everyone at the exit before the park.

298
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,120
Isn't that a great achievement, Ryo-chan?

299
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,240
Of course.

300
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,220
Without reform, there would be no progress.

301
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,980
No fear of failure, no humiliation, no imprisonment.

302
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,260
We'll continue to push forward the reform of the transportation system.

303
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,540
That sounds like a line I've heard somewhere.

304
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:42,960
Yeah.

305
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,240
But I didn't think the government would change so much.

306
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,100
Oh my goodness!

307
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,500
Komachi-chan!

308
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,100
It's the Emperor's first letter!

309
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,100
W-What?

310
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,220
What happened?

311
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,580
I-I just got a call from the transportation department.

312
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,620
They said that President Ryo-tsu was attacked by the president of the Katsushika-shou.

313
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,420
What?

314
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,120
What?

315
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,060
Is it Ryo-chan?

316
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,520
It's me!

317
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,580
The president of the Katsushika-shou!

318
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,500
The President of the Katsushika-shou!

319
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,440
The President of the Katsushika-shou!

320
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,480
The Furisode Transportation Department is as popular as any idol, and it seems that the number of malicious criminals has decreased significantly.

321
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,540
It's a great success, Senpai!

322
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,680
No, President!

323
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,980
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

324
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,420
That's right, that's right.

325
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,740
But somehow the story is too good.

326
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,360
There is something wrong with this.

327
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,640
The 23rd district of Tokyo, the 8th district, the president of the Katsushika-shou.

328
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,720
It's here!

329
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,540
It's definitely me!

330
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,860
Huh?

331
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,340
This number.

332
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,360
I think my personal number is 410...

333
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,660
Oh!

334
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,920
It's not 410, it's 470!

335
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,540
Come to think of it...

336
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,740
The number 1 looks like 7.

337
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,080
I see.

338
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,760
When I entered the computer, the number 1 and 7 were wrong.

339
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,420
I'm the only one who knows this secret.

340
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,560
Okay!

341
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,880
Since I became the president, not only the transportation department but also the entire Katsushika-shou will be reformed.

342
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,740
What happened to the former President Tonda?

343
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,120
It seems that he was passed over to the vice-president.

344
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,060
Ohara-kun.

345
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:32,960
Yes!

346
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,060
The Katsushika-shou's catchphrase is...

347
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,520
What's the catchphrase?

348
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,440
Yes!

349
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,880
"Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be trapped."

350
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,300
Your voice is too small.

351
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,200
Ah!

352
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,920
"Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be trapped. From your grandparents..."

353
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,460
Louder!

354
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,720
"Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be trapped. From your grandparents, your grandparents, your grandchildren, everyone loves the Katsushika-shou!"

355
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,020
Okay.

356
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,260
In order for everyone to like the Katsushika-shou, the first Katsushika-shou reform I thought of was...

357
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,120
"Come as a popular talent or a beautiful actress as a one-day reception hall."

358
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,960
"Grandparents and grandmothers can make free baths and use them at ease."

359
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,580
"Use stuffed animals to make the Katsushika-shou familiar to children."

360
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,180
"We will continue to make various reforms."

361
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,120
"The construction is also going well."

362
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,640
"All right."

363
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,880
"Anyway..."

364
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,440
"I will receive a special bonus of 100 million yen."

365
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,640
"As you can see, the president and the secretary are very close to each other."

366
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,220
Amazing.

367
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,580
How can they make such a big statue?

368
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,880
It's like a special vehicle.

369
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,200
What?

370
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,900
What is it?

371
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,080
What is it?

372
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,840
Let's go.

373
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,320
Help.

374
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:23,960
Help!

375
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,180
Help!

376
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,240
Help!

377
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,740
Help!

378
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:28,900
Help!

379
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,480
Help!

380
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:29,720
Help!

381
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,320
Help!

382
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,240
"I entonces Iwagkara"

383
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,360
Even the chief chef is here.

384
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,740
He might escalate further.

385
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,860
He's guarding the computer room with all his might.

386
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,480
He's keeping everyone from entering.

387
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,400
That's suspicious, Ryo.

388
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,280
He's hiding something.

389
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,420
That's right.

390
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,400
Today's lunch is either lobster or abalone.

391
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,880
I'm already tired of the full course.

392
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,700
I understand.

393
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:57,780
I'm sorry.

394
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,520
Oh, and the wine is from Bordeaux.

395
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,240
Yes.

396
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,780
Ryo, you're drinking wine while working?

397
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,360
You're the chief, aren't you?

398
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,020
You're trying to give me some advice, aren't you?

399
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,660
Ohara!

400
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,200
N-no, it's nothing.

401
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,460
That's fine.

402
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,700
If you just listen to me quietly...

403
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,120
The situation has changed, but the old chief's room...

404
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,560
You're a coward!

405
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,480
Who do you think you are?

406
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,260
You'll be the chief of the Pyo-tsu Kankichi.

407
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,220
I'm sorry.

408
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:34,980
I'm sorry.

409
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,180
My head fell down.

410
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,300
Chief Tonda!

411
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,180
Ohara!

412
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,080
Chief!

413
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,940
Ohara!

414
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,500
You're both...

415
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,720
You're both in trouble.

416
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,840
No, you two over there.

417
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,640
I have something I'd like you to do.

418
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,820
Phew, it seems to have ended.

419
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,540
Oh, well, it took six hours to get from the head to here.

420
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,440
Really, you two did your best.

421
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,640
Is it over?

422
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,040
Hmm...

423
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,140
I don't think I can find anything.

424
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,820
I want something that'll teach me what I see.

425
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,580
Yes, there you go!

426
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,840
You're friends.

427
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,220
Look at the poor Matsuro, the unfortunate one without power.

428
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,580
Compare yourself with my good friends.

429
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,620
You should compare him to a statue.

430
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,960
A statue?

431
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,140
Ryotsu, no matter what you say...

432
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,740
Can I listen to you?

433
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,220
If you get fired, you'll have to work overtime.

434
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,520
I'm strict.

435
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,280
Yeah, yeah.

436
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,460
You look really pitiful.

437
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,600
Oh, that's good.

438
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,180
The chiefs will be very upset about that.

439
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,040
I wonder if we can do something about it.

440
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,440
Yeah.

441
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,240
Reiko.

442
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,500
Kei, did you find out anything?

443
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,000
That's strange.

444
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,660
The data on the Katsushika Library is blocked.

445
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,460
And it seems that we can't access it from the super computer in the capital.

446
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,500
I knew it.

447
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,180
There must be some secret to the Katsushika Library's computer.

448
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,940
To become the beloved Katsushika Library,

449
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,060
the services we've provided so far are too simple.

450
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
We have to do something.

451
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,060
I think it's best if we convert it into a major leisure-land and let everyone enjoy it.

452
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,680
No matter how hard we try.

453
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,820
We've gone too far.

454
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,140
Without reform, we're not moving forward.

455
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,640
We have to change the Japanese police from the Katsushika Library.

456
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,760
The Katsushika Library

457
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,040
The Katsushika Library

458
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,880
The Katsushika Library

459
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,860
The tunnel going up there continues to the computer room above.

460
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,120
Yeah.

461
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,140
It's going pretty far up there.

462
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:21,780
If we don't take care of it here,

463
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:21,800
But what'll we do with it?

464
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:21,820
What's up, Yuki?

465
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:21,840
The Katsushika Library

466
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,420
Katsushika Library

467
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,680
The Katsushika Library

468
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,460
The Katsushika Library

469
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:33,820
The Katsushika Library

470
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,340
*Aizawa waits for his turn*

471
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,540
Here?

472
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,720
Yes.

473
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,160
Hey, you're here!

474
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,660
R-Ryo!

475
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,700
Sheriff!

476
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,700
T-This is a form of a 3-dimensional image!

477
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,880
You're right.

478
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,720
I knew you guys could get this far a long time ago.

479
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,240
You did absorbed more data of the computer, did you not?

480
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,680
Unfortunately, you guys can't even get away from that matter.

481
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,420
If you press this switch, the floor where you guys are standing will disappear!

482
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,940
Sen-Senpai!

483
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,960
Ryo-chan!

484
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,100
In other words, you will return to the starting point!

485
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,180
That means you did well.

486
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,660
See you later!

487
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,660
Oh no! The arrow is above me, that means...

488
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,060
The boss!

489
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,160
Ah! I was the one who escaped!

490
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,280
Ryo-chan!

491
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,040
That's terrible! It's all over the place!

492
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,100
It's all Ryo-chan's fault, isn't it?

493
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,540
If we put this back, all the things that happened before will be gone!

494
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,280
Alright! This is okay!

495
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,100
You did it!

496
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,200
Ryo-chan!

497
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,640
Boss!

498
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,420
Ryo-chan!

499
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,440
This is not true!

500
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,900
This was all done by the super computer of the head office!

501
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,460
You are being very rude!

502
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,440
Prepare yourself!

503
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,480
No, the computer really is...

504
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,400
That computer gave you a new example.

505
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,040
Be happy! You can become the real boss!

506
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,980
Eh? The boss? Me?

507
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,960
Ryo-chan base!

508
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,840
The right one!

509
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,220
By today, I will appoint you as the head of the "Saihatesho Yojo-hanjima" paper!

510
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,340
Saihatesho Yojo-hanjima!

511
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,740
Congratulations, Ryo-chan!

512
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,400
Congratulations!

513
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,760
Th-thank you!

514
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,320
Hey, isn't this really the only place that's as big as Yojo-han?

515
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,020
This is the same as the island!

516
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,120
This is the same as the island!

517
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,480
I'm fine with the size, so please return me to Tokyo!

518
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,400
Why?

519
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,780
Why?

520
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,340
Why?

521
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:09,860
Why?

522
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,160
Why?

523
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,480
Good job!

524
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,200
Why?

525
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,620
Why?

526
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,400
Why?

527
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,900
Demon-chan is a kindergarten child, but she likes historical dramas. Why?

528
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,380
Why?

529
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,900
The little beard of the head office is slightly small. Why?

530
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,160
Why?

531
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,540
Why?

532
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,420
Oh, what?

533
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,480
Look at you!

534
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,360
Oh, what?

535
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,380
Did you change your course?

536
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,120
Oh, you've changed!

537
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,040
Oh, I'm dying!

538
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,320
Here's an episode!

539
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,880
Let me just move the bar!

540
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,400
Enjoy!

541
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,980
I don't know where I live, but I like it!

542
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,720
Now, let's go, Yoko-chan!

543
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:48,980
Now, let's go, Yoko-chan!

544
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,600
I don't lend money to Reiko-san, but...

545
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,700
I can easily lend money to tanks and fighters.

546
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,920
Why is that?

547
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:07,140
Reiko-san is a very rich person, but...

548
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,480
Why is she working at the sewage?

549
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,340
Why is that? Why is that?

Why is that? Why is that?

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:33,780
Why do I have to run with Ryo Tsukai and the other two?

Besides, my parents are going on a trip.

What should I do?

555
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,860
Next time,

00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,340
Ryo-tsu and Komachi are going on a trip?

557
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,260
So stop it, okay?
