7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,560
I wonder if I'm going back

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,120
He laughed and said he was still crying

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,480
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,660
Katsushika is a good place

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,840
The cityscape that never changes even if you have a sore throat

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,540
It's so kind

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,580
It's so kind

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,400
From the fountain of the Tungari-boshi

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,960
To Taishakuten

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,140
The sun is setting

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,460
Tomorrow will end like this

18
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,400
Katsushika and Shiba are happy again

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,880
I'm going to lose it

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,520
I'm going to lose it

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,100
I'm going to lose it

22
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,060
I'm going to lose it

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,800
Hato Pop!

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,760
The big city, Tokyo

25
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,920
People, people, people are overflowing

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,540
The peace and safety of this city

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,820
Day and night, there are hard men who keep protecting it

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,080
There is also a man who takes care of it

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,000
This is what voltage detective work

30
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,540
Super Policeman

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,780
It's Kajipan,还帕大侠

32
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,040
Kajipan is an elite detective

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,500
The King of the Land.

34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,760
The Moon Dekka and Venus Dekka.

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,960
They transform according to the circumstances, and fly through the moon with night-time fighters.

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,540
The King of the Sky.

37
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,500
The Dolphin Dekka, or the Sea Dosaemon.

38
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,360
He became a manga artist and a painter after becoming a teacher of the Dolphin Dekka.

39
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,220
The King of the Sea.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,500
And this man is the one who takes care of the special police officers.

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,280
It's the Chonbange Dekka!

42
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,180
Yeah!

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,700
I'm glad you came.

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,160
There's no one else who can do it.

45
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,800
I want to scout a new recruit for the special police officers.

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,640
That's why I want to have one person who will be considered as a person with experience.

47
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,800
A person who will be considered as a person...

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,180
A person who can endure a hard job as a special police officer...

49
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,940
There's only one person who can do it.

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,160
Who is it?

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,380
The King of the Sky.

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,200
The King of the Sky.

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,360
The King of the Sky.

54
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,520
What?

55
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,220
Why are you all going to the pervert police officers?

56
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,640
He's a special police officer!

57
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,380
I'll beat you to death!

58
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,540
The King of the Sky.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,060
I'll beat you to death!

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,100
Ouch!

61
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,680
Please stop!

62
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,160
I know, I know!

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,660
Please stop!

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
As long as you understand, it's fine.

65
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,620
Ouch!

66
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,040
Ouch!

67
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,420
Ouch!

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,080
But I don't have any special skills like you guys and I don't have any partners!

69
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,900
Don't worry.

70
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,360
I have something I got from the boss.

71
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,080
A... a pigeon?

72
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,140
Why are you calling me a pigeon?

73
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,660
It's not just a pigeon.

74
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,480
My special police officers have trained me with all their passion.

75
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,100
It's called the "Super Elite Bat".

76
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,180
It's a great thing!

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,540
But even though you're smart, you're not a pigeon.

78
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,220
You'll get a punishment again!

79
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,160
W... w... w... w... wait!

80
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,840
I've already done a lot of punishment!

81
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,840
You don't know anything!

82
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,000
Look at this.

83
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,300
What?

84
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,120
This time, there's a godly play.

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,140
I can't stand it.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,100
A godly play contains a water candy.

87
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,900
Eat it.

88
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,400
Even if you tell me to eat it, I've seen it clearly from there.

89
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,200
It was the First World War.

90
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,200
With the German army, the French army settled in the Verdun Fortress.

91
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,040
The radio was destroyed and the underground phone line was cut off due to the bombing.

92
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,920
The German army's circle of friends was getting smaller and smaller, and everyone was about to give up.

93
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,860
And at that moment,

94
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,620
Colonel Lunard sent the first wave of the military bat to the radio.

95
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,080
Soon, the French support team that received the message from the pigeon arrived.

96
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,260
The first wave of pigeons saved the stage.

97
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,720
It's an impressive story no matter how many times I hear it.

98
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,620
Oh, pigeons are great.

99
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,100
Indeed.

100
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,620
That's right.

101
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,360
Pigeons are great.

102
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,860
Go pirate.

103
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,140
But, they don't move.

104
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,400
No, they don't move.

105
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,700
I've made the first wave of pigeons.

106
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:11,780
What?

107
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,760
I lost.

108
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,420
Go, Ryotsu. From today, you'll be a Hato Poppo Deka.

109
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,380
H-Hato Poppo Deka?

110
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,980
No! I don't want that!

111
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
Ujou, do something about it!

112
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,380
You're so annoying!

113
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,820
You're giving up, Ryotsu?

114
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,380
You're so cold!

115
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,780
Are you abandoning your cute subordinates?

116
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,200
You're not cute.

117
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,280
You're a demon!

118
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,860
Oh, no, that's not it.

119
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,020
Please, please.

120
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,380
I don't care.

121
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,680
Hey, what are you doing?

122
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,800
Everyone, back off!

123
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,360
I'm not ready yet!

124
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,520
Ujou, I hate you! I curse you!

125
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,860
Don't say anything.

126
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,040
Now I have hope in the future!

127
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,760
No! Don't leave me!

128
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,720
Reiko, Sakagawa, do something!

129
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,180
I don't want to be part of the pervert!

130
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm so glad, Ryo-chan!

131
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,540
Senpai, do your best!

132
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,380
Damn it! Are you still friends?

133
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,100
I hate you!

134
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,720
I hate you!

135
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,260
I hate you!

136
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,620
This is a very honorable thing to do.

137
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,160
This is a very honorable thing to do.

138
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,840
And if you were to be assigned to a special police department,

139
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,940
your pay would double now.

140
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,840
No!

141
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,480
What are you talking about?

142
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,500
What? Is that true?

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,680
It's hard work, but you get special treatment.

144
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,880
It's hard work, but you get special treatment.

145
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,120
I can't even afford a costume.

146
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,700
I can't afford a costume.

147
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,040
We only need one costume.

148
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,320
When a pigeon is big,

149
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,580
you get food from pigeons.

150
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,240
A pigeon needs to consider itself younger.

151
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,780
A pigeon needs to consider itself younger.

152
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,980
I just want to go.

153
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,600
I haven't seen you in a while.

154
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:01,940
You seem to be tricked.

155
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,200
You haven't seen me in a while.

156
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,960
You haven't seen me in a fucking long time.

157
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,640
What's up?

158
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
How did you get here?

159
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,100
It might be nice to go on patrol, but this school will be a sight for everyone.

160
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,040
Ouch! What are you doing?

161
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,400
What the hell? What is it, a diet?

162
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,880
No! I haven't been granted one single yen, I'm a detective.

163
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,000
That's not the food I ever asked you for!

164
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,380
I'm not so sweet, I'm gonna leave my money alone and make enough for my own meals...

165
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,520
Hey, where are you going?

166
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,280
What is it?

167
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,660
A 100 yen coin?

168
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,000
I see. So they're training you to pick up and collect the dropped items.

169
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,720
Alright, pick up more!

170
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,420
If you do, I'll buy you some beans!

171
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,800
*Claps*

172
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,700
That's how rehabilitation became a human bond.

173
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,300
We used to be warm, friendly friends.

174
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,720
前輩が特殊刑事課に配属になって、もう1週間になりますね。

175
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,160
It sounds like его is getting better at being a darmon.

176
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,580
...It sounds like его is getting better at being a darmon.

177
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,180
Right, Ryo-chan?

178
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm really peaceful for the past week.

179
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,220
I can't believe it!

180
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,840
Come to think of it, Ryo-chan will be working hard after he's gone.

181
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,580
You're right.

182
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,500
Watch me.

183
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,480
If you think I'm going to stay quiet, you're wrong.

184
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,300
Then I'll go patrol.

185
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,160
Go, Dengemon!

186
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,060
Stay close to Chief and search for the secret.

187
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,660
It seems that the moon is back to me after the dead man disappeared.

188
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,700
Here's a $5 coin drop.

189
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,040
Good.

190
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,940
Hmm...

191
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,000
That's good.

192
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,460
Yes, this is Ohara.

193
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,720
I'm Ryozuka.

194
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,120
Ryozuka?

195
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,160
You're already sleeping?

196
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,760
I won't listen to your crying.

197
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,780
No, chief.

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,980
I won't let you disturb the chief's ears.

199
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,760
Then what? I'm busy.

200
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,320
Chief, I thought you delivered 500 yen to the factory.

201
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,820
What?

202
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,980
Did you get your pants sewn properly?

203
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,120
What are you talking about?

204
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,100
You can't fool me.

205
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,900
I know everything.

206
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,860
The chief is also worried about something.

207
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,600
I can't believe it.

208
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,240
Who is it?

209
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,360
This actress.

210
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,760
You have a photo book, right?

211
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,700
It's nude.

212
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,980
You bought it, right?

213
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,460
What if your wife sees it?

214
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:56,960
I'll buy it for you.

215
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,300
What will happen?

216
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,680
Ryozuka.

217
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,360
I got it.

218
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,300
What should I do?

219
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,720
Well, let's see a lot today.

220
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,240
But don't forget.

221
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,100
Wherever you go, my eyes are shining.

222
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,660
Ryozuka.

223
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,160
How did she do it?

224
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,540
Listen, I'll feed you more.

225
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,840
Then you guys go scout the pigeons there.

226
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Got it?

227
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,680
Look at this.

228
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
Reiko Nakagawa and Reiko who saw me becoming a special detective

229
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,860
are also here.

230
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll make an army of spies using the pigeons.

231
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,400
The End

232
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,060
The End

233
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,060
So, did you get a call from the head of the company?

234
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,920
Did you get a call from Ryozu?

235
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,020
Ryo, my client knows who you are.

236
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,600
He even knows about the project we're starting.

237
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,340
That's so weird.

238
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,280
You're the one who's the bad guy.

239
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,180
Oh, so you got a call from Dengemon.

240
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,860
The exit is a problem?

241
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,920
It seems he's complaining about me.

242
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,200
What's going on?

243
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,320
What's going on?

244
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,900
What's going on?

245
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,600
What's going on?

246
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,880
Yes, this is the exit.

247
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,480
It seems he's complaining about me.

248
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,040
Senpai!

249
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,700
What?

250
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,000
He's not nearby.

251
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,040
Even if he's far away, I can tell him everything.

252
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,340
Senpai!

253
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,620
Ryo, come out. Let's fight.

254
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:21,700
Let's fight?

255
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,840
No. We're going to show them the true nature of your lives.

256
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,660
Hey, Ryo.

257
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,480
Ryo!

258
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,200
Ryo...

259
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:44,780
What's going on?

260
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,260
Why are there so many pigeons?

261
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,600
It's so weird.

262
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,460
That's right. It seems that the original man, Ryotsu Kankichi, became the Hato Popo Dekka.

263
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,800
If that's true, he'll be a real nuisance to everyone!

264
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,020
What are you doing, you Sekuhara Hato?!

265
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,200
What is this flock of Hato?

266
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,640
It's Senpai's doing.

267
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,000
What?!

268
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,480
Then, is Ryotsu using Hato to spy on us?

269
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,600
That's what I think.

270
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,740
The subordinates are very familiar with their secret, and when I noticed, Hato was always with them.

271
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,480
Come to think of it, Hato used to follow my Ferrari.

272
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,620
That guy Ryotsu became the Hato Popo Dekka, that's a good thing!

273
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,140
Shhh!

274
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,740
Mr. Chief.

275
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,000
Yes?

276
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,100
If you're saying something bad about Ryo-chan,

277
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
you'll get your revenge soon.

278
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,880
It's increased a lot.

279
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,780
It's at least 40%.

280
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,200
What? You want more?

281
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,220
Don't be so generous.

282
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,360
You won't make a fool out of the food.

283
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,940
You're always making small profits, aren't you?

284
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,440
If you have any complaints, make them make more!

285
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,380
If you don't leave now, think about it.

286
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,560
If you go out there, you won't be able to buy my food.

287
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,080
That's why I'm here.

288
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:27,980
What?

289
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,980
You're being very generous.

290
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,300
Just because you're a fan of your brand doesn't mean you'll go to the supermarket.

291
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,500
You always say that.

292
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
By the way, what foods do you like?

293
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,560
I can have that.

294
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:43,600
Yes, it is.

295
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,980
I'm a fan of your porridge.

296
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,440
Do you have any information? Tell me!

297
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,400
I got it! Let's increase the amount of food!

298
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
I'll make Hokkaido's best beef beans!

299
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,480
What?

300
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,760
Yamada Nishiki is the best?

301
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Alright! Let's go with the third Yamada Nishiki!

302
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,920
Now, Yamada Nishiki has come from the outside!

303
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,880
King Ome-guro-san won't grow together!

304
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,740
Yamada Nishiki! Yamada Nishiki is coming!

305
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,760
Yamada Nishiki is the best!

306
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,680
I did it!

307
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,880
I got 300,000 yen!

308
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,660
I earned a million yen with just 3 days!

309
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,080
It's good to see it again and again!

310
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,460
This touch...

311
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,660
This feeling...

312
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,480
Hehehe...

313
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,420
I won't let this million yen be used for a big game!

314
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,380
Thief!

315
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,360
What?

316
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,240
Give it back!

317
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,380
What's wrong? What did you take?

318
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,840
There's a 100 million yen cash in that case!

319
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,360
What? 100 million yen?

320
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,400
Why did you have such a large amount of money?

321
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,100
I only trust cash transactions!

322
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,720
If you catch me, I'll pay you 10%!

323
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,440
Of course, cash!

324
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:11,920
I won't take it!

325
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,140
Thank you!

326
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,960
100 million yen!

327
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:16,740
I got it!

328
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,860
Leave it to me!

329
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,460
Go, Ten'emon!

330
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,020
We're going to chase him wherever he goes!

331
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,900
I don't think I'll be able to get away from this Hatsupoppoteka!

332
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
Oh, no!

333
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,440
He has become like that before I know it!

334
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,720
Ouch! Ouch! What... what...

335
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:40,960
Dammit!

336
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,680
You're one persistent bastard!

337
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,460
I won't let you get away with this!

338
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,020
Huh?

339
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Oh, come now!

340
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,120
Why are you following me?

341
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,240
Shit! They're afraid of me!

342
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,080
What are you doing?

343
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,040
Lady Hato Poppo

344
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,700
It seems to be ok

345
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,320
We're screwed!

346
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
Earth has an ocean

347
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,300
The sky is the moon

348
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,160
And the sea is protected by the Dolphin

349
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,660
Lady Hato Poppo

350
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,860
You protect the land and the air

351
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,100
Let's go!

352
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,660
Dengue Man! Hey, Dengue Man!

353
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,520
Gather your friends! It's urgent!

354
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:56,880
Hey, here, here!

355
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,960
I'll do anything for 100 million yen!

356
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,440
This is comfortable!

357
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,500
My 100 million! No, my stolen 100 million yen! Give it back!

358
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,820
Don't think you can get away with it!

359
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,080
What the hell is that?

360
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:28,990
Go!

361
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,980
Let's go!

362
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,880
Please be careful of Line 3. The express train will pass through.

363
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,260
Huh?

364
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,940
Wait!

365
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,480
You're so persistent!

366
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,120
Wait!

367
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,380
You bastard!

368
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,000
Hey, I thought you were going to die.

369
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,600
Wait, wait, wait!

370
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,740
How far are you going to chase me?

371
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,760
Give me back my 100 million yen!

372
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,480
Come closer!

373
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,720
Don't be so slow!

374
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,320
More, more!

375
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,040
I won't let you run away!

376
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,720
No matter how close you get, this is the top of the sky!

377
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,800
You can't do anything else!

378
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,780
Where are you going?

379
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,200
You're a man who doesn't care about the danger of using the line of money!

380
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,240
Don't touch me!

381
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,040
Get off! I'm on my own!

382
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:51,520
Stop!

383
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Hurry up and give me that bag!

384
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,480
Thief!

385
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,280
Who's the thief?

386
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,620
Hey!

387
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,560
My 100 million yen!

388
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,500
My 100 million yen!

389
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,120
My 100 million yen!

390
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,160
Take it!

391
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,240
I'll pay for your 100 million yen!

392
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,240
Give it back!

393
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,640
Daaymon!

394
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,400
Shit! My 100 million yen!

395
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,880
Daaymon!

396
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,540
Do something, Daaymon!

397
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,120
Good!

398
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,480
Give it back to me!

399
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,280
My 100 million yen!

400
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:54,900
Cut the crap!

401
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,620
If you find it, I'll make you a yakitori!

402
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,760
Remember that!

403
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,400
A pigeon that buys food.

404
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,760
The pigeon appears.

405
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,120
The money this pigeon is using is a million yen.

406
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,380
I can't believe I'm being watched by a pigeon.

407
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,480
Popo, my little pigeon.

408
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,600
Do you want some beans?

409
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,400
Let's go eat something good.

410
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,680
I failed this time.

411
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,380
I failed this time.

412
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:52,920
I had a good idea of a pigeon.

413
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,520
Let's hope for the next time.

414
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,500
Yes.

415
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,380
See you in the next special detective series.

416
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,980
Excuse me, excuse me.

417
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,940
You're so noisy.

418
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,760
Your name?

419
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,960
Is your name Sentaro Sumima?

420
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,960
That's the name.

421
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,740
You're just bothering people.

422
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,700
Next time, "Fear! God is a Long-Long Friend!"

423
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,300
See you.

424
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,140
Next time, "Fear! God is a Long-Long Friend!"

425
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,580
Next time, "I Don't Know Where He's Going!"

426
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,200
Next time, "I Don't Know Where He's Going!"

427
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,220
Next time, "I Don't Know Where He's Going!"

428
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,620
Next time, "I Don't Know Where He's Going!"

429
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,000
Next time, "I Don't Know Where He's Going!"

430
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,700
Next time, "I Don't Know Where He's Going!"

431
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,180
Next time, "I Don't Know Where He's Going!"

432
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,920
That's my name.

433
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,660
Good game.

434
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,380
