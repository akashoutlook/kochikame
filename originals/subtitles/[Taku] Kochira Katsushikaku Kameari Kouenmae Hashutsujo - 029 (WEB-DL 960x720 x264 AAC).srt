Awesome!

23
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,700
They're both amazing.

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,200
I'm not just telling you how fast they are.

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,780
Just look at it!

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,240
Can you see it?

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:47,820
What?!

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,060
Definitely best cornering.

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,420
Incredible!

30
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,320
Put on the disc brake.

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,380
Turn on the lights.

I modified it with a hundred thousand yen.

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,940
It's my best masterpiece.

36
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,940
My machine is amazing, but my operation technique is also amazing.

37
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,580
Awesome!

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,920
Ryo-san is good.

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,240
Cool.

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,440
What is it?

41
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,740
This time is even more amazing.

42
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,180
Go!

43
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,260
Super Jump!

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,200
Turn on the lights.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,220
It's the captain's fault.

46
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,100
He suddenly appeared in such a place.

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,960
How about the Bugatti?

48
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,160
It's not broken at all.

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
The frame is strengthened.

50
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,180
It won't break if it hits someone.

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,780
Gyoza.

52
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,780
Yes.

53
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,280
What is it, captain?

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,940
This is...

55
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,520
Where?

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,320
I don't like it, captain.

57
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,000
You're not old enough to be stupid.

58
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,140
It's in the exhaust.

59
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,040
Did you lose your memory because of the shock of the gold bullet?

60
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,900
It's me.

61
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,160
It's Ryo-tsu.

62
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,860
Do you understand?

63
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,940
Idiot!

64
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,480
Ryo-tsu.

65
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,280
What is the exhaust?

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,660
Is it a playground for children?

67
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,060
Is it a competition ground from the radio control?

68
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,920
No, it's not.

69
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,680
It's a place where we police officers apply for jobs.

70
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,720
Even if you don't yell at me in such a loud voice, I know what you want to say.

71
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,440
The captain is not losing his memory.

72
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,720
You know that, don't you?

73
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,120
I can't stand today anymore.

74
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,960
From now on, I will ban all private items related to work.

75
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,860
It's a ban on private items.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,680
What?

77
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,580
What a bad guy!

78
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,300
What a bad guy!

79
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,700
How could you carry so many private items?

80
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,780
There are still so many things left that I can't load all at once.

81
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,940
You need three more.

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,420
Listen.

83
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,760
Come back as soon as you leave it in your room.

84
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,580
I understand.

85
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,540
I understand.

86
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,740
It's not a good time to distinguish work and playground.

87
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,420
It's not a good time to distinguish work and playground.

88
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,520
Who is he?

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,260
It's him.

90
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,900
The one who hit me earlier.

91
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,940
I want to break him into pieces.

92
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,520
He said he'll pay 100,000 yen.

93
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,060
What?

94
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,420
He'll pay 100,000 yen for this toy?

95
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,300
I don't know how he can pay 100,000 yen for this.

96
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,280
What is this?

97
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,280
Is it a radio?

98
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,100
I can't hear.

99
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
I don't know the switch.

100
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,320
Is it true that 100,000 yen is 100,000 yen?

101
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,920
Yes, I think so.

102
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,460
It's the end.

103
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,780
I'm on the road.

104
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,160
If we don't stop it now, the car will come.

105
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,840
How do we stop it?

106
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,320
It's getting faster.

107
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,280
Please change the car.

108
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,480
I can't do that.

109
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,020
It's coming.

110
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,840
Oh, no.

111
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,980
Don't stop at such a place.

112
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,000
That was close.

113
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,700
It's coming from the opposite side.

114
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,820
It's not coming.

115
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,560
I'm going to die.

116
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,840
I think I know what it is.

117
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,060
I think my guilty conscience.

118
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,880
Oh, no, I've got lucky.

119
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,080
It's me.

120
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,020
I've got lucky.

121
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,860
I can't stop.

122
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,660
It's a rabbit.

123
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:02,760
It's not coming.

124
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:02,820
It doesn't make sense.

125
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,220
It's a rabbit.

126
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:05,940
Come on.

127
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,740
All right, come on.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,580
It's bringing me.

129
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes.

130
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,940
Yes.

131
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm leaving now.

132
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,820
No, it's okay.

133
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,460
It was fine to hit someone, but there was no one in front of the tire roller.

134
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,220
What are we going to do?

135
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,380
They'll get angry.

136
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,660
I was too fast.

137
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,280
You should have told me to come back soon.

138
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,720
You're the chief, right? There's still some left.

139
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,340
I guess so.

140
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,860
I can't forget things when I get older.

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,100
Where did the Bugatti go?

142
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,240
Chief, have you seen my Bugatti?

143
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,080
It's a radio control car that hit the chief.

144
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,460
I see.

145
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,260
I should have left it here.

146
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,800
By the way, the kids just borrowed it.

147
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,920
That's right.

148
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,260
Did you lend it to them?

149
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,460
What?

150
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,160
Yeah.

151
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,620
That's strange.

152
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,940
I met Junpei and the others here on the way back.

153
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,300
I think they were other kids.

154
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,280
You have a lot of acquaintances.

155
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,800
Chief, did you really lend it to the kids?

156
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,520
Of course.

157
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,180
I wouldn't lie.

158
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,360
You're right.

159
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,760
I'm not lying.

160
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm not lying.

161
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,520
Why are you looking away?

162
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,940
If you're not lying, you should be able to see me.

163
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,920
Of course I can see you.

164
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,280
Damn it.

165
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,720
I lost when I heard that.

166
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,880
You're hiding something, aren't you?

167
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,200
Let lost!

168
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,360
You're right.

169
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,340
I don't know why it's there.

170
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,260
I'm not going to lose anything.

171
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,360
You're right.

172
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:18,560
Don't leave this to your wife.

173
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,360
I'm scared.

174
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,240
I'm scared.

175
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,160
I don't know why you're here.

176
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,700
I really feel bad now.

177
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,020
Stop it.

178
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,840
Why is this story?

179
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:35,860
Tell me what it is.

180
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,040
You're not!

181
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,260
I'm a victim, too!

182
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,760
I was hit again!

183
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,660
So you're saying I can destroy my treasure?

184
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,400
I did something unwise about that.

185
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,180
In the end, I'm bad at what I do, so I'm going to get this result.

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,160
Migo, be careful!

187
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,820
What a bad habit!

188
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,520
I won't forgive you for crying while licking my feet!

189
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,320
If you're going to lick your feet, you have to forgive me!

190
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,760
Well, we're not adults, you know.

191
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,740
Shut up!

192
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,360
You're such a...

193
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,460
What's that?

194
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,860
You're such a...

195
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,640
You're such a...

196
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,240
You're such a...

197
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,660
You're such a...

198
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,260
You're such a...

199
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,740
You're such a...

200
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,100
You're such a...

201
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,920
You're such a...

202
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,680
You're such a...

203
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:27,940
You're such a...

204
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,580
You're such a...

205
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,480
You're such a...

206
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:29,680
You're such a...

207
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,960
You're such a...

208
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,600
You're such a...

209
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,000
You're such a...

210
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,520
You're such a...

211
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:35,920
You're such a...

212
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,860
You're such a...

213
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,880
You're such a...

214
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,700
This is the corner for the treasure.

215
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:39,940
What?

216
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,880
The treasure of Chief Ohara of the Kameyari Park Branch is a recently renovated Hinoki bath.

217
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,320
If you enter the Hinoki bath at the end of the day, you will be exhausted.

218
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,840
You will feel like you are in heaven.

219
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,420
Don't joke!

220
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,940
Make this treasure messy.

221
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,060
What is Hinoki bath?

222
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,520
Hey!

223
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,120
Don't get in my way.

224
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,060
I'm going to brag about the bath.

225
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,180
Wait a minute.

226
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,980
The bath is the treasure?

227
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,640
This is fine, isn't it?

228
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,480
The filling of the bath is...

229
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,300
Why did you buy this?

230
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,300
I'm giving it to the chief.

231
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,600
However...

232
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,280
I will change the contents.

233
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,820
Special...

234
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,380
I will put the ingredients in the bath and rub them with pepper, wasabi, and pepper.

235
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,820
This will improve the quality.

236
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,300
Honda, taste it.

237
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,200
Me?

238
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,320
Just a little.

239
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,540
Don't talk nonsense.

240
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,660
But...

241
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,180
Hey!

242
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,740
I'm shocked to put this in the bath.

243
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,680
It's a big deal.

244
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,020
It's a big deal.

245
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,400
This...

246
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,620
I'm really shocked.

247
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,400
I will put the powder milk and make it mild.

248
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,560
I will put this in the bath and put it in the bath.

249
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,860
I will put this in the bath and put it in the bath.

250
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,920
I did it!

251
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,720
The special bath is completed.

252
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,900
It's called the extremely spicy bath.

253
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,680
I'm sorry that the chief can't see me panic.

254
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,400
Hehehe.

255
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,840
Hehehe.

256
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,840
Next, the second step.

257
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,760
The powder of the mouse and the powder of the hornet.

258
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,880
In addition, the powder of the chicken and the powder of the goldfish are also mixed and completed.

259
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,320
Where did you get it?

260
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,040
The scent of the forest is renewed.

261
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,200
The scent of the voice pot.

262
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,360
It's intense.

263
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,680
Next is miso soup, tea, and consomme soup.

264
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,100
I think I can get a good soup stock from the chief.

265
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,640
What should I mix next?

266
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,480
That's right.

267
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,760
The extract of the carrot is more powerful.

268
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,100
It's fun to mix something.

269
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,260
I'm getting scared.

270
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,360
Finally, the ultimate special bath.

271
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,420
This is a special mix.

272
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,120
It hardens quickly.

273
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,280
When you notice it, it's very easy.

274
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,520
The chief's shoulder can be removed.

275
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,440
You can make a doll.

276
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,880
It's a wonderful gift.

277
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,460
I will deliver this.

278
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,720
I will send it to the chief's house.

279
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,180
Wait.

280
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,980
If it's my name, I will be careful.

281
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,100
I will send it to the chief's name.

282
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,760
It's a bad boy.

283
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,980
Please enjoy the chief a lot.

284
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,420
Special New York style hinoki bath.

285
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,380
I will ask him a favor.

286
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,480
I am listening.

287
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,080
Please look video.

288
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:19,440
This video should be published in a second.

289
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,460
I was

290
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:21,740
This is a problem.

291
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,000
Hey, I have a good idea.

292
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,120
What? You want to treat me to dinner?

293
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,500
You want Reiko and Nagawa to treat me?

294
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,940
Yes. I always thank you for your help.

295
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,740
I see, I see. What will you treat me to?

296
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,400
That's for after you get there.

297
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,420
Kei will come pick you up by car soon.

298
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,540
If that's what you want, take me anywhere.

299
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,440
I'm sure you'll get special drinks at the headmaster's house.

300
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,280
I hope you have a great day.

301
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,680
Ryo, I'm coming!

302
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,700
Sorry to keep you waiting.

303
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh, hello.

304
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,800
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you in person.

305
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,820
We have drinks, TV, and a karaoke.

306
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,820
Let's see.

307
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,760
Here.

308
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,500
I'm getting more and more excited to eat dinner.

309
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm here, senior.

310
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, what can I serve you?

311
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,320
A fancy restaurant with a perfect view.

312
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,540
Maybe this is...

313
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,580
That's the headmaster's house!

314
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,220
Chief Ohara, I've been trying to get along with Ryo-chan.

315
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,460
So...

316
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,260
Hey!

317
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,900
I'm going back to Nagawa.

318
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,520
Wait, Ryo-chan.

319
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,660
So what?

320
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,100
I'm getting more and more excited to eat with you today

321
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,240
and I'm ready to go.

322
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,480
I have delicious food to eat today,

323
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,820
so I hope you'll thank me.

324
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,640
I'm glad to hear that.

325
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,940
I can't wait for some sashimi or tonkatsu.

326
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,060
The job lines are too sluggish.

327
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,660
Ha!

328
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,520
pushes the trigger

329
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,380
Get the hell out of here.

330
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,600
I see.

331
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,000
What?

332
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:49,440
Ryo-san, I saw a smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart

333
00:15:51,220 --> 00:16:07,240
smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart... smart...

334
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,220
You put the one you bought at the supermarket three days ago in the fridge, didn't you?

335
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,120
And this tonkatsu is the cheap part of the meat.

336
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,000
All the other dishes are cheap ingredients.

337
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,300
Including the sake table, one person saw it as 850 yen.

338
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,580
What a sharp guy.

339
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,220
If you break 100,000 of them and make them for 850 yen, it's cheap, isn't it?

340
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:32,540
What are you talking about, boss?

341
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,140
I don't think this dish will replace the radio control car.

342
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,340
I plan to make a good compensation if I get a bonus.

343
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,700
What? Really?

344
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,020
Today, I called you to eat, in the sense of apology.

345
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,120
Then you should say that first, boss.

346
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,860
I'm a bad person.

347
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,420
Oh, it looks delicious.

348
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,240
Oh, my tonkatsu.

349
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,340
No, even if it's cheap ingredients, depending on the way you cook it, it will be so delicious.

350
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,460
Hey, eat yours, not mine.

351
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,960
It seems that they have reconciled.

352
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,860
Cheers!

353
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,260
By the way, boss, you changed the bath to a large bath, right?

354
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:28,980
Would you like to see it?

355
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,040
Oh, that's fine.

356
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,560
You can enter 24 hours at any time.

357
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,980
Reiko, you should come in, too.

358
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,660
Yes, thank you very much.

359
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Yes, yes, yes, boss.

360
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,300
Oh, sorry.

361
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,620
Is it a bath?

362
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,580
That's good.

363
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,360
Bath?

364
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,460
Oh, boss.

365
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,040
Do you use bath bombs at your home?

366
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,840
I usually use them, but unfortunately I cut them.

367
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,340
Oh, is that so?

368
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,040
That's too bad.

369
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,360
It seems that my special bath hasn't arrived yet.

370
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,860
You should come in later, too.

371
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,900
Yes, thank you very much.

372
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,560
It's a good feeling.

373
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,860
Oh, it's really fun tonight.

374
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,700
It's been a long time since I've been to a party like this.

375
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,880
Exactly.

376
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,740
Ryotsu, I think I really did something wrong to you.

377
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,200
Please forgive me.

378
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,860
Oh, I got it.

379
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,720
Let's go to the bath together and pour all the red and the red together into the hot water.

380
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,600
All right, I'll pour it on my back.

381
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,180
It was a really nice bath.

382
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,420
Really?

383
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,000
Then we'll go, too.

384
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,680
I'm looking forward to it.

385
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,260
Reiko, are you going to come in with us again?

386
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,840
I don't care.

387
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,580
Boss, you're rarely drunk.

388
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,800
Who's at this time?

389
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,640
Ryotsu, please come in first.

390
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,560
Yes, yes.

391
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,000
I'll open it now.

392
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,500
Oh, it's a good bath for a stubborn boss.

393
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,080
Oh, that's good.

394
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,960
Yes, Ryotsu.

395
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,760
The boss sent me a delivery of bath water.

396
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,940
My special bath water.

397
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,220
It was just right.

398
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,700
I'll use it right away.

399
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,360
Where are you going?

400
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,240
I thought about the pay.

401
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,540
There's about time to go to the bath.

402
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,100
Actually, I have a hot bath allergy.

403
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,300
That's a nice joke, Ryotsu.

404
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,720
Actually, because of my late father, I don't think I can go into the hot bath alone.

405
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,620
Your father is alive, isn't he?

406
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,460
Well, let's go in together.

407
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,020
No, no, no.

408
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:54,400
Wait, wait, wait.

409
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Do you have any problems?

410
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,620
Okay, let's use this one.

411
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,740
The scent of the forest.

412
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,740
The scent of the hot bath.

413
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,500
Mix it well.

414
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,960
Oh, that's hot.

415
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,260
Oh, that's a nice scent.

416
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,060
I didn't notice anything at all because I was drunk.

417
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,900
Ryotsu, after all, a beehive bath is good, right?

418
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,280
Yes, that's right.

419
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,540
After all, the bath is a beehive.

420
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,740
Ah, feels good.

421
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,160
I feel refreshed.

422
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,180
Now, let's go.

423
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,380
Hey, don't get in the bath!

424
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,880
Stop it, Chief!

425
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,200
Men can't be together!

426
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,900
I told you to go into the bath and put everything in the hot water.

427
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,620
I got it.

428
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,400
I just have to get in, right?

429
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,640
You have to get in to your shoulders.

430
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,320
Why are you looking at me like this?

431
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,500
I'll put more in.

432
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,680
Super hot sugar.

433
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,100
No, I can't do that.

434
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,980
I'll put it in!

435
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,060
You're getting tired of it!

436
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,320
What's wrong?

437
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,840
I have a cold.

438
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,700
I mean, I've been bleeding lately.

439
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,980
I thought I was going to be shocked.

440
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,740
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's cheap, you know.

442
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,520
I'll fill it up now.

443
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,100
Okay.

444
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,300
Next time, I'll do it.

445
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,880
I'll do it.

446
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,580
No, it's fine.

447
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,700
You're not going to let me do it?

448
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,640
I got it.

449
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,800
Please.

450
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,180
I see.

451
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
I'm good at washing.

452
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,780
Okay.

453
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,360
I can get any kind of dirt out of you.

454
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,700
Chief!

455
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,680
It's a wire!

456
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,760
Oh, no.

457
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,720
I made a mistake.

458
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,420
I'm so dense and I can't be warned.

459
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,540
Why would you make mistakes?

460
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,420
It's tight!

461
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,900
That's an alternator for tires.

462
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,040
I got it!

463
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,660
You.

464
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,720
You're not in there yet.

465
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,720
I told you not to cling to it, didn't I?

466
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,720
You're weak!

467
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,760
Then, let's go in there, Ryotsu!

468
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,720
Let's go out naked, men and women!

469
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,780
It's hell.

470
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,120
Chief, it's a waste to be in such a big bath.

471
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,100
Can we leave?

472
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,180
Yeah, right.

473
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,300
Which one? Do you want to add more bath?

474
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,580
That's not good!

475
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,780
Oh, no!

476
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,060
Oh, no!

477
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,920
We have to get out of here quickly!

478
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,140
You just got in.

479
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,860
You don't want to be in a bath with me?

480
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,140
No, it's not like that.

481
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,220
It's really bad if you don't get out of here quickly.

482
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,400
What's bad?

483
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,280
I just put in a plaster.

484
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,040
Why is the bath bomb a plaster?

485
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,060
I feel like my body is getting heavier.

486
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,620
The gyo-ko effect has begun.

487
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,380
So it's a plaster.

488
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,440
You know what I'm saying, right?

489
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,520
Let's get out of here quickly!

490
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,000
Wait a minute!

491
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,400
Why did you know this gyo-ko is a plaster?

492
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,080
You're planning something bad again.

493
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,700
Rather than that, let's get out of here quickly!

494
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,900
What was that voice?

495
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,760
It sounded like Ryo-chan's voice.

496
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,780
Somebody! Help me!

497
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,620
It's a bath!

498
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,740
Nagagawa, help me!

499
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,920
But I can't move.

500
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,700
What made you make this?

501
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,440
You idiot!

502
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,720
Speaking of the original, it's bad that the chief broke the radio.

503
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,540
You're still saying that?

504
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,580
It seems that we are back in the first place.

505
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,960
It can't be helped.

506
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,740
I can't do anything about it!

507
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,980
It's going to be fixed!

508
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,900
Are you the security guard of the Hina Festival?

509
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,920
Please forgive me, chief!

510
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,760
March 3 has been a good day since I was born!

511
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,600
It's a holiday!

512
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,220
I hate the Hina Festival and Tsukudani!

513
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,480
Next time, "Sanzan Hina Festival".

514
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,040
Thank you!

515
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,640
Even if I try to stop the clock

516
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,140
Time will pass

517
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,580
Don't look at me

518
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:46,940
Laugh and live

519
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:57,760
Even if it rains today

520
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,600
Tomorrow will be sunny

521
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,320
Bye bye

522
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,680
Let's wash our hands

523
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,680
Goodbye, unpleasant things

524
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,980
Let's live as we like

525
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,380
There is a good thing

526
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,300
Outside the door

527
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,820
The sun is calling

528
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,760
The sun finely shines

529
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,660
Don't you want to come out of the window?

530
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,000
Let me show you

531
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,000
