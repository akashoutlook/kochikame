"How to See the World Through a TV"

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,780
When you see a TV, make your room bright and stand out from the rest.

"How to See the World Through a TV"

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,280
Come to me, you poor people!

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,940
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,360
I'm sure it'll be all right.

8
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:58,240
Come to me, you jobless people!

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,460
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

10
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,340
Look at the burning red clouds.

11
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,980
I'm sure it'll be all right.

12
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,540
You know what to do, right?

13
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,120
You know what to do, right?

14
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,960
If you know what to do, come to me quietly.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,400
He is a big man, but he knows only how to act.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:59,880
Why don't you teach me how to do it?

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,520
*Gasps*

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,800
*Buzzing*

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:06,880
*Gasps*

23
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,220
*Gasps*

24
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,860
*Gasps*

25
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,800
Huh? The door is open?

26
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,220
I think I closed it before, but...

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,540
Uh... UwaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

28
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,580
*Gasps*

29
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,180
*Gasps*

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,720
He's completely ignoring us,

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,260
because he's aiming for a 5-minute-long

32
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,240
building from our station.

33
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,400
Oh, there it is.

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,080
Hello.

35
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,260
Ah, thank you for your hard work.

36
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,580
How's the fingerprint?

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,820
So far, there's no one other than the victim.

38
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,420
*Buzzing*

39
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,620
*Buzzing*

40
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,420
You're such a rude rascal.

41
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,220
How's the victim?

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,680
The cash is 50,000 yen,

43
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,700
and there are two bags from a famous luxury brand,

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,120
and a few accessories worth 500,000 yen.

45
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,340
And the victim?

46
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,760
He's been given a self-examination

47
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,280
during the inspection.

48
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,760
*Gasps*

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,620
There he is.

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,240
You locked the door properly, didn't you?

51
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,600
Yes, I locked it properly.

52
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,280
There was a safety lock on the window, too.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,580
Yes, I put it on all the windows.

54
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,980
Even the key to the entrance

55
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,160
was installed with the latest technology.

56
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,260
But...

57
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,660
But the key to the entrance was open.

58
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,460
That means...

59
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,320
It was the pickings.

60
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,220
Didn't you open it from the inside?

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,860
Huh? From where?

62
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,080
Ah.

63
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,720
From the side of the street.

64
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,200
I entered from there.

65
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,380
No way.

66
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,760
It's the sixth floor.

67
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,840
Ryotsu! Don't say such a thing!

68
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,120
It's impossible!

69
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,280
I can do it. Please watch.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,860
What are you doing?

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,780
What are you doing?

72
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,100
Amazing.

73
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,300
How did you get so high up?

74
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,060
How did you get so high up?

75
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,980
See? You can do it.

76
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,520
But it's easy to get to the sixth floor.

77
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,740
But it's easy to get to the sixth floor.

78
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,340
What are you doing?

79
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,700
What?

80
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,260
I'm going to climb up like this.

81
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,060
Amazing.

82
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,340
Amazing.

83
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,600
I really started climbing up.

84
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,540
That's amazing.

85
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,320
That's amazing.

86
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,280
Captain! We have arrived at the sixth floor.

87
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,840
We will enter the room from here.

88
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,800
What a guy.

89
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,960
There is a key on the window of the balcony.

90
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,260
There is a key on the window of the balcony.

91
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,480
There is a safety shield.

92
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,300
I think it's from the bathroom.

93
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,520
I think it's from the bathroom.

94
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,040
There is a trace of opening it.

95
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,420
Ouch.

96
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,960
I'm removing the window of the bathroom.

97
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,000
What?

98
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,880
I'll remove it like this.

99
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,540
He went in.

100
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,480
What's wrong with him?

101
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
He went in.

102
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,360
It's only been a minute since he climbed up.

103
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,640
It's very fast.

104
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,200
If you remove the glass, the window will remain closed.

105
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,480
If you remove the glass, the window will remain closed.

106
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,060
That's why...

107
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,300
The safety shield does not work.

108
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,840
It's a professional's trick.

109
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,240
See?

110
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,800
That's pretty good, isn't it?

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,060
He just opened the door.

112
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,740
Why are you here?

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,060
He went out of the room

114
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,560
and get off the plane,

115
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,040
and talk to the coldness of the door.

116
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,720
and talk to the coldness of the door.

117
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,840
and talk to the coldness of the door.

118
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,060
What?

119
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,560
Are you the one who is the criminal?

120
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,720
Don't be silly.

121
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,440
Shut up!

122
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:38,600
Stop it!

123
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,300
Why do you always have a multi-purpose driver?

124
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,540
That's a keychain.

125
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,980
Nakagawa, check if there's anything else.

126
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,060
Yes.

127
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,880
What?

128
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
Stop it! Let go!

129
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,240
Senior.

130
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,220
Excuse me.

131
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,200
Multi-purpose driver, mini light, wire, knife...

132
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,400
Aren't they all theft tools?

133
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,080
No, they're for survival.

134
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,080
Wait a minute.

135
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,980
Stop it! Let go!

136
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,180
Let go!

137
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,240
Chief!

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,380
If I were a thief, I wouldn't be aiming for a student's room like this!

139
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,680
I'd aim for Nakagawa and Reiko's house!

140
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,480
That's true.

141
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,340
If you're a thief, why do you have to eat rice balls at convenience stores for a month?

142
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,760
You're a student, too.

143
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,200
You don't live alone in a house like this.

144
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,980
Even if you say that, your parents are safe because it's an auto-locked apartment.

145
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,920
That's a dangerous thing to say.

146
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,900
It's as dangerous as an auto-lock.

147
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,020
Is that so?

148
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,780
It's an auto-locked apartment, so it's hard to get in.

149
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,940
Once you get in, you'll think everyone is residents and will not doubt it.

150
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,520
Once you get in, you can go to any floor in the elevator.

151
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,620
It's a high floor, so there's no room for worry.

152
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,060
It's a high floor, so there's no room for worry.

153
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,400
I tend to forget to close the lock.

154
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,420
I'm often targeted for a short time.

155
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,160
I steal it in just 2 minutes if I'm a professional.

156
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,960
You're too familiar.

157
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,000
You want me to come to the headquarters?

158
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,420
That's not it.

159
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,300
You're so familiar that you have practical skills.

160
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,320
It's natural to be suspected.

161
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,880
That's not it.

162
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,920
Anyway, the guy named Akishi is a friend of the residents.

163
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,220
He's right next to you.

164
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,320
You're familiar with that process.

165
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,980
His skill is great.

166
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,620
He can climb up here in a minute and enter.

167
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,960
It takes me 3 minutes.

168
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,620
You're aiming for an old man from the bank, aren't you?

169
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,380
That's easier.

170
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,060
I'm aiming for an old man from the bank.

171
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,660
Why?

172
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,220
I have a lot of money, and I can fool people easily.

173
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,180
It's a high success rate.

174
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,760
We have the same way of thinking.

175
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,980
I'm the one who's the human.

176
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,580
I don't make decisions like me.

177
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,280
What?

178
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,900
What is it?

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,580
You're a little unexpected.

180
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,480
You're not going to call the queen to this race.

181
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,080
This race is determined by three libre-based sharing machines.

182
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,000
É

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,400
Wearing a training suit.

184
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,200
OK.

185
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,440
If you get hit, bring something else for the next race.

186
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,880
See you.

187
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,640
Thanks.

188
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,800
What an officer.

189
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,280
It's so heartbreaking to be here.

190
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,500
I'm so sick of this.

191
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,360
Let's find another place.

192
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:44,060
The scene where the red Tenga 707 and the blue Tenga 745 were stolen.

193
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:51,380
It seems that the two gangs of criminals who were in the center of Adachi and Edogawa have come to the Katsushika district.

194
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,560
So, they started to increase patrol by increasing the number of patrol cars.

195
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,720
You can't do that kind of micro thing.

196
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,200
Ryo, Ryo-tsu.

197
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,640
There is a limit to patrol the Katsushika district without any problem if you increase the number of patrol cars.

198
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,380
That's true, but...

199
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,520
The criminals will be pressured and there is no other way to stop the damage.

200
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,440
There is. We have to be careful from the sky.

201
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,060
The sky? You mean using the helicopter?

202
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,700
The helicopter is too fast and the big Tenga is too small.

203
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,480
The sound of the propeller will make the criminals feel the opposite effect.

204
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,000
If the helicopter is not good, then it is the airplane.

205
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,740
Hmm...

206
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,980
There is a vehicle that can fly more slowly and have a sense of control over the criminals.

207
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,220
Anyway, leave it to me.

208
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,780
Okay, it's my chance.

209
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,380
Leave some cash.

210
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,340
Don't let the criminals know that it is empty.

211
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,040
Okay.

212
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,120
The residents will be back soon, so let's escape from the veranda.

213
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,300
Okay, there is no one.

214
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,160
Ahem.

215
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,020
Well, it's okay.

216
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:45,320
This doesn't have an audio sound from the ecologies and it can fly slowly, so we can monitor the ground.

217
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,980
I didn't expect this to be an airplane.

218
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,780
Indeed, the apartment seems to be seen one room at a time.

219
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,560
Hey, it's slow, so you can check it as much as possible.

220
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,400
What does it look for those two?

221
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,080
That's suspicious.

222
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,660
Get out of my way!

223
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,080
W-what the hell is that?!

224
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Huh?! It's coming!

225
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
Those guys are so boring!

226
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,240
Nakagawa, tell Sean!

227
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,120
Yes, sir!

228
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,820
Captain Katsushika!

229
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,840
Oh no! Run!

230
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,660
If you wait for the bus, you'll get away!

231
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,740
I'll catch you in person!

232
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Senpai!

233
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,720
Ryotsu!

234
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,420
Fly!

235
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,020
Huh?!

236
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,900
I-Idiot!

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,600
I did it!

238
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,560
All right!

239
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,740
W-what the?!

240
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,980
A-amazing!

241
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,840
Huh?!

242
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,920
You're the ones from before!

243
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,380
P-please forgive us!

244
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,000
All right! Pull them up!

245
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,380
W-what?

246
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,200
The 707th of the Shimei-tehai?

247
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,400
The 707th?

248
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,240
It's a big hit, sir!

249
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,780
I'm sending a picture of the culprit there.

250
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,420
This is the 707th's photo of the Shimei-tehai.

251
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,640
Yeah.

252
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,420
I'm sending it over my phone.

253
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,180
Oh, here it is!

254
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,740
Oh, it's true!

255
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,720
It's a treasure, Ohara-kun!

256
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,340
Thank you very much!

257
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,100
"The 707th of the Shimei-tehai"

258
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,440
"The 707th of the Shimei-tehai"

259
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,900
"The 707th of the Shimei-tehai"

260
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,840
Thank you very much!

261
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:30,940
That's great!

262
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,620
Thank you very much!

263
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,120
All right!

264
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,540
"The 707th of the Shimei-tehai"

265
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,420
"The 707th of the Shimei-tehai"

266
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,000
Thanks.

267
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,360
"The 707th of the Shimei-tehai"

268
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,420
A grand prize!

269
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,000
"The 707th of the Shimei-tehai"

270
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,160
I know, I've always been cheering on you, but...

271
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,500
Well, uh...

272
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,680
...I don't know what to say.

273
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,240
How about we play some Cross Maybelline?

274
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,020
Can we?

275
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,180
Hey, can you demonstrate?

276
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,040
You're so good at talking.

277
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,740
You brought my idea to a good place.

278
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Excuse me.

279
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,760
I have this.

280
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,300
Oh, you're a photographer.

281
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,900
This is actually your idea, right?

282
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,640
Yeah.

283
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,320
It's terrible for a boss to take a subordinate's work.

284
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,540
Right? You're a good guy.

285
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,860
Thank you.

286
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,780
I can put you on my magazine.

287
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,240
Let me take a picture of you.

288
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,620
I like you more and more.

289
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,740
Thank you.

290
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,920
I'd like to take a picture of you from the inside and above the airport.

291
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,160
Can I take a picture with you?

292
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,620
Sure. I'll fly every day, so come anytime.

293
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,740
Thank you.

294
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,200
Mr. Ryotsu, isn't Odaiba a tourist destination?

295
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,360
It's a special service.

296
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,780
The location is better than Katsushikaku, so it's worth it.

297
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,440
Yeah.

298
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,800
Oh!

299
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,940
What's wrong?

300
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,080
The rock singer Joe Miyake and actress Matsushita Momoko are on board that ship.

301
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,380
What?

302
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,240
It's a scoop. Please lower the code a little more.

303
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:16,820
Oh!

304
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,520
It's a big scoop. Thank you.

305
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,780
This is a small amount, but it's an interview fee.

306
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,160
Oh, I see. Then I'll give it to you.

307
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,100
Then, excuse me.

308
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,520
Interview fee.

309
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,580
Oh, this much?

310
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,660
This is...

311
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,860
We're almost there.

312
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,220
Okay, here we are.

313
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,600
I see.

314
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,920
Okay, here we are.

315
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,420
Oh...

316
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,080
This place is the biggest house for famous actors of film industry.

317
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,360
It's too big.

318
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,160
Huh?

319
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,500
The famous actor is already here...

320
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
in the afternoon.

321
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,920
All right.

322
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,700
Everyone, I'm ready to go.

323
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,900
Where are they?

324
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,760
What are they doing?

325
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,680
What?

326
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:21,860
What?

327
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,300
Where?

328
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,340
Where is it?

329
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,220
It's the house next to the mansion.

330
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,780
What?

331
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,300
That's...

332
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,400
Bulbo!

333
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,520
Bring me number 745's handbook!

334
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,820
Here it is.

335
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,700
It's number 745's handbook.

336
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
Oh, no doubt about it.

337
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,020
Bulbo, get close to that house!

338
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,840
We'll catch you!

339
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,840
Roger!

340
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,160
Thanks!

341
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:53,700
"Liangziang"

342
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:53,800
Ryo,

343
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,020
I just got a call and an e-mail from the Jyo Miyake's office.

344
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,640
It seems they had a photographer on the flight and got this picture taken!

345
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,020
I have no idea what they're talking about.

346
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,020
Don't lie!

347
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,840
They say this was the only place they could take pictures from this angle!

348
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,400
If it keeps going like this, Director Fuyuki will be dead by now!

349
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,660
Well, that's true.

350
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,920
Don't make a fool out of yourself.

351
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,240
Thanks to you, we were able to arrest number 745.

352
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,400
What?

353
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,060
Bring me the picture!

354
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,100
It's definitely number 745!

355
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,200
It's true!

356
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,540
And that's how we got the director and two other officers arrested,

357
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,120
including the person who couldn't be arrested by the head office.

358
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,180
The head office is behind him.

359
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,620
The head office is behind him, and so might the secretary of the head office.

360
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,480
S-s-så...

361
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:57,820
...

362
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,080
Now I see.

363
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,360
Then even the head office can be the chief of our department.

364
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,840
Chief?

365
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,280
Where's the chief?

366
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,360
*Girly laugh*

367
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,980
*Girly laugh*

368
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,940
*Girly laugh*

369
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,260
*Girly laugh*

370
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,440
*Girly laugh*

371
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,340
But still, what's your problem?

372
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,320
*Girly laugh*

373
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,460
Well, I'll deal with this one myself.

374
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,500
*Girly laugh*

375
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,980
Ryotsu, from now on, you'll be the captain of the Air Force.

376
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
*Girly laugh*

377
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:36,800
Yes!

378
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,740
*Girly laugh*

379
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:45,160
*Girly laugh*

380
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,720
I didn't think that just writing the logo would bring the laborious situation.

381
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,980
but it didn't just bring the laborious situation.

382
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,840
But won't it be bad if we could earn money in flight?

383
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,160
But won't it be bad if we could earn money in flight?

384
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,460
This is just a spin-off of patrol.

385
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,760
This is just a spin-off of patrol.

386
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,020
You can't complain about it because you could beat the criminals by flying and prevent a crime.

387
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,460
You can't complain about it because you could beat the criminals by flying and prevent a crime.

388
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,300
Well, it shouldn't be a thing.

389
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,140
Well, it shouldn't be a thing.

390
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,000
Alright, Ryotsu.

391
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:08,820
Eh?

392
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,460
Kaneganaru Denguo?

393
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,080
Eh?

394
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,520
Kaneganaru Denguo?

395
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,580
Your rival company.

396
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, I see. The budget is 5 million yen. Is that okay?

397
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Yes, I understand.

398
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,400
I'm happy! The advertising fee will be included again!

399
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,100
That's amazing.

400
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,320
Yes! Hey, old man car?

401
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,580
Oh, this is Toyoyama car.

402
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,180
I see. Is this Hikaru Hamasaki's new song campaign?

403
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,140
Senpai, isn't this a flying advertisement?

404
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,760
It's written on the paper.

405
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,600
It doesn't matter where it's written.

406
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,240
Besides, there are so many companies' names and advertisements.

407
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,520
It can be said that the Japanese economy is still doing well.

408
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,620
But the word "Katsushika" is nowhere to be seen.

409
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,280
Don't worry. It's still there.

410
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,420
Senpai, where are you?

411
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,080
To the left!

412
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,560
Where?

413
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,160
I'm sorry.

414
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,760
Oh, my God!

415
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,240
Senpai, this is too small.

416
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,220
It's not good unless it's as big as this Heart Bus Tour, right?

417
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,560
It's okay if it's written.

418
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,160
Hmm? Heart Bus Tour? Bus Tour?

419
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,900
Yes! There's a way to make more money!

420
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,460
There are no customers.

421
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,280
What do you mean?

422
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,180
Well...

423
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:51,980
I didn't know I could see Tokyo from the sky.

424
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,060
Besides, I can watch soccer matches for free.

425
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,280
I'm glad we canceled the bus tour.

426
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,340
Yeah.

427
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,820
I didn't expect to attract a lot of bus tour customers.

428
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,080
Really, you're a genius in business.

429
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,760
I don't think there are any restaurants that sell bento or juice.

430
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,060
Unfortunately, there are not many services like that.

431
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,320
Bento?

432
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,980
Here it is.

433
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,980
I came up with a way to make more money!

434
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,440
There's only one customer today.

435
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,960
We're just the same.

436
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,600
We've all been canceled lately.

437
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,940
What the hell are you doing?

438
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,700
Great!

439
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,680
That's awesome!

440
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,060
Thanks, everyone.

441
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,600
See you!

442
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,040
See you!

443
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,020
Thank you for waiting!

444
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,300
How about some "Flying Line" goods for the Chosun Festival?

445
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,260
"Flying Line Gold Gold"

446
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,480
"Flying Line Senbu"

447
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,820
"Flying Line Juice"

448
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,080
"Flying Line Manji"

449
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,140
And other things like "Eha-Kan" and T-shirts!

450
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,780
Senpai!

451
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,540
Number 3!

452
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,200
Three extra Yakitori!

453
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,380
Yes!

454
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,940
This is Number 7!

455
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,080
Serve it up!

456
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:05,900
Yes!

457
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,240
You've made a lot of money!

458
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,600
I didn't think I'd get this much!

459
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,560
Two million for one flight!

460
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,580
Three flights a day!

461
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,300
Six million!

462
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,160
One month!

463
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,540
That's...

464
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,540
One hundred and eighty million yen!

465
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,680
Even if you cut the cost of materials and maintenance,

466
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:23,960
you'll still get a hundred million.

467
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,280
You can make this your main business,

468
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,980
or make the police your sub-business!

469
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,620
When I went to the headquarters today,

470
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,040
I found the names of the 707th and 737th

471
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,080
and 745th prisoners in the police station.

472
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,200
I got a compliment from the general manager.

473
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,840
That's good.

474
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,060
Ohara,

475
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,640
the way we're doing right now

476
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,340
may not be a dream.

477
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,860
I agree!

478
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,140
Chief,

479
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,740
I want to invite you to a drink tonight.

480
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,880
Sounds good.

481
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,200
It's about time to get back from patrol.

482
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,500
I'll call you back.

483
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,360
Ouch!

484
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Oh, no!

485
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,160
Oh, no!

486
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,380
Get on the fire extinguisher!

487
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,140
Hurry up!

488
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,440
Oh, no!

489
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:15,940
Oh, no!

490
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,860
Oh, no!

491
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,520
It won't work!

492
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,380
Oh, no!

493
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,480
What?

494
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,000
No!

495
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,780
Oh, no!

496
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,200
It's okay!

497
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,840
It'll be all right!

498
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,000
I'll get rid of it!

499
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,240
Oh, no!

500
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,500
Oh, no!

501
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,020
Oh, no!

502
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,460
Please stop!

503
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,720
It is impossible!

504
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,420
The sunset is clearly red today.

505
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,080
Yes.

506
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,200
On the contrary,

507
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,140
the sunset is...

508
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,580
No, the CAS JOINS--

509
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,980
They're coming this way!

510
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,460
Is that...

511
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,260
A flying rocket?

512
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,480
What?

513
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,280
I'm back!

514
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,800
I...

515
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,980
I'm back!

516
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,660
This way!

517
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,860
-The money! -Ryo, run!

518
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,360
This is the last one. I can't see Ryo and the others.

519
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,400
-What? -Ryo!

520
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,940
-The money! -Run!

521
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,860
-Ryo! -The money!

522
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,620
-Let go of my money! -Ryo!

523
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,520
-The money! -S, S, Mr. President

524
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,000
The money and the money that I made made me rich!

525
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,380
S, Ryo!

526
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,780
You have to settle your expenses so you can get on the plane.

527
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,720
How can this be happening always?

528
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,380
"I'm a little kid, but I like historical dramas."

529
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,060
"Why?"

530
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,460
"Why? Why?"

531
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,360
"Good day, why?"

532
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,420
"Why?"

533
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,100
"Demon is a kindergarten boy, but he likes historical dramas."

534
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,220
"Why?"

535
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,580
"Why?"

536
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,420
"His little beard is slightly small."

537
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,520
"Why?"

538
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,640
"Why?"

539
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,000
"Why?"

540
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
"When he rides a motorcycle, his personality changes."

541
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,380
"Why?"

542
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,500
"Why?"

543
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,160
"He only sleeps once every four years."

544
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,280
"Why?"

545
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,880
"Why?"

546
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,240
"Nakagawa doesn't lend money to Ryosan."

547
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,900
"But he can easily borrow a tank and a fighter."

548
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,540
"Why?"

549
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,220
"Why?"

550
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:03,900
"Why?"

551
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,600
"Why?"

552
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,960
"I don't know."

553
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,520
"Why do you work at an exhaust's pump?"

554
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,720
"Why?"

555
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,660
"Why do you work at an exhaust's pump?"

556
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,400
"Why?"

557
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,020
"Why?"

558
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,760
"Why?"

559
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,480
"Why?"

560
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,760
Everyone, are you listening?

561
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,700
This radio program started today

562
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,820
Ryo-san's "2-3 hours tonight"

563
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,460
I am Ryo-chi Kankichi of personality

564
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,980
Life advice, requests, and the story of friends

565
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,100
I'm waiting for a postcard because I don't care

566
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,580
Next time, here is a Kameari broadcast song

567
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,440
Thank you

568
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,880
Kameari there

569
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,380
Kameari for sure
