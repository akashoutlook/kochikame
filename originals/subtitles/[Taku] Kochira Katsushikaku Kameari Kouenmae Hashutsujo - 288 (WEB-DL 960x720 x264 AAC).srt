00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:00,880
The

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,100
The

3
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:01,700
The

4
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,040
The

5
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,780
The

6
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,320
The

7
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,380
The

8
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,420
The

9
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:06,840
The

10
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:06,900
The

11
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,060
The

12
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,180
The

13
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,200
When you watch TV,

14
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,720
make the room bright and

15
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,000
try to see the world from afar!

16
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,680
Meow meow

17
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,880
Meow meow

18
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,080
Meow meow

19
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,900
Those who have no money,

20
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,720
come to me!

21
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,340
I'm not here,

22
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,900
but I'm worried

23
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,980
Look at the blue sky

24
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,920
and the white clouds

25
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,540
I wonder what will happen

26
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,060
in the meantime

27
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,960
You know, right?

28
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,500
You know, right?

29
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,820
If you know, then shut up and

30
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,100
follow me!

31
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,940
If you know, then follow me!

32
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,940
Reiko is the model Fushihara Noriko's best friend?

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,800
Reiko is the model Fushihara Noriko's best friend?

34
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:10,820
Is it the truth?

35
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,320
Is it the truth?

36
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,900
Yeah,

37
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,320
I often come to Reiko's

38
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
apartment to play

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,640
Ah!

40
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,100
What?

41
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,520
When a senior knows it,

42
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,820
he will force her to introduce you,

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,920
so I kept it a secret!

44
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh!

45
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,060
Damn it!

46
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,540
I envy Reiko!

47
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,280
You know!

48
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,860
In exchange,

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,340
If you want to be caught, I'd like to exchange my spirit with you!

50
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,080
Hello, hello, everybody-u!

51
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,020
This voice is...

52
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,740
It's been a long time, everyone at the exit!

53
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,200
I feel like you're coming quite often...

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,580
Along with some strange inventions!

55
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,860
So, what do you want today?

56
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,680
What a good question, Gorilla-kun!

57
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,660
Today, I brought the greatest invention of the century!

58
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,460
I knew it...

59
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,300
So, this is that invention?

60
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,700
That's right, Gorilla-kun!

61
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,760
This is the hope of mankind!

62
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,980
It's not a novel or a sweet dream!

63
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,240
It's the great invention of the era!

64
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,780
This is a machine for playing Puri-Kura!

65
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,800
No! That's not it!

66
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,100
Then what is it?

67
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,140
This is a machine that can exchange your appearance with the person you want to be!

68
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,640
I see.

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
This is a machine that can exchange your appearance with the person you want to be!

70
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
A machine for exchanging your appearance?

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,060
This is a machine for exchanging your appearance?

72
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,240
No matter where you look, you can only see it as a machine for Puri-Kura!

73
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,000
That's where the amateur Akasaka found it, and he went down the street for 5 minutes!

74
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,280
This is a very wonderful invention!

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,180
That's kind of suspicious...

76
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,400
Didn't you bring something similar before?

77
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,680
That's where it is, Gorilla-kun!

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,520
I'll use this machine for you!

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,940
You're lucky, aren't you?

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,780
I refuse.

81
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,140
Why?

82
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,440
This is the first chance to become a human using this historic invention!

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
No way!

84
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,960
What do you mean, "lucky"?

85
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,240
I mean, you're going to be a test subject!

86
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,920
I'm definitely not going to do it!

87
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,780
Don't say that, Gorilla-kun!

88
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,620
Don't say such a thing!

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,120
Shut up!

90
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,920
If you're going to be exchanging your appearance with someone, I can't do it by myself!

91
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,240
That's where it comes in!

92
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,340
You're cooperating with me, aren't you, Nakagawa-kun?

93
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,000
Even I don't want to!

94
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,480
No way!

95
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,160
No matter what, you can't do it!

96
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,600
No matter what, you can't do it!

97
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,440
No matter what, you can't do it!

98
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,420
No matter what, you can't do it!

99
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,040
No matter how much you ask, you can't do it!

100
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,720
No matter how much you ask, you can't do it!

101
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,580
No matter how much you ask, you can't do it!

102
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,340
No matter how much you ask, you can't do it!

103
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,520
No matter how much you ask, you can't do it!

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,500
No matter how much you ask, you can't do it!

105
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,400
That's not the way it works!

106
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,820
My teacher says that he has goodtatitats!

107
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,140
That's what you're supposed to do!

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,200
You're here, too?

109
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,460
What?

110
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,560
No, I'm not!

111
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:25,660
You're here, too?

112
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,880
But I'm glad nothing happened.

113
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,580
What? What are you talking about?

114
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,160
Nothing, nothing.

115
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,520
That's strange.

116
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,220
I'm Reiko.

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,740
I'm Ryo-chan.

118
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:25,160
I'm Ryo-chan.

119
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,460
Huh?

120
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,740
My face is...

121
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,220
What the hell is this?

122
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,380
Why? Why am I Ryo-chan?

123
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,580
Why?

124
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,000
Thank you very much.

125
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:55,820
Miss!

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,600
That's a man's voice.

127
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,200
What's that?

128
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,600
Who are you?

129
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,080
You are a suspicious person.

130
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,620
Protect Miss!

131
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,640
No!

132
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,360
I'm a...

133
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,720
Ouch!

134
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,320
Miss!

135
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
Miss Reiko!

136
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,420
What's wrong with Miss?

137
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,400
No!

138
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,500
I'm Reiko!

139
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,060
What nonsense are you talking about?

140
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:27,880
It's true!

141
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,060
Believe me, Mr. Hirayama!

142
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,500
Why my name?

143
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,620
I know.

144
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,140
You're Mr. Hirayama Shukichi.

145
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,160
This is a song I played at my father's birthday.

146
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,940
Certainly, this is a song that the lady is good at.

147
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,000
But if you practice, anyone can play it.

148
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,960
Please give me a chance.

149
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,940
It's a fruit cake specially made by Reiko.

150
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,560
Oh...

151
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,740
Delicious!

152
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,580
It's exactly the taste of the lady!

153
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,860
Right?

154
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,240
This recipe is unnecessary!

155
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,920
What are you doing?

156
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,460
He stole the recipe.

157
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,620
Hmm...

158
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,740
What's wrong, Hirayama?

159
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,320
What?

160
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:25,640
What's wrong?

161
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,720
Even if you say that...

162
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,220
You must have watched my dance a lot.

163
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,920
I was always being accompanied by ballet.

164
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,260
Why did you do that?

165
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,020
Hirayama's granddaughter's name is Aya-chan.

166
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,380
What?

167
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,400
She's a fifth grader this year.

168
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,960
Oh!

169
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,620
The pink land cell that my father gave me for Aya-chan's graduation celebration.

170
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,000
I chose that.

171
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,380
Oh!

172
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,800
Only Pinpinmaru-sama and Rei Kojo-sama know that.

173
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,100
What? Are you really Rei Kojo-sama?

174
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,540
Yes, I am.

175
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,540
Why are you dressed like that?

176
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,220
I don't know.

177
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,380
When I woke up this morning, I was like this.

178
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,580
Uh... Uh...

179
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,380
Hirayama...

180
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,040
I'm sorry, Rei Kojo-sama.

181
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,260
I see.

182
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,580
So you've been listening to Ezaki's Puri-kura for a while now.

183
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,080
But he's a tough guy.

184
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,400
He's more than half of his body.

185
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,380
And he's tall.

186
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,200
I'll take him to the dilution lab for now.

187
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,260
Senpai, I made you a stewed skate with fresh folks.

188
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,960
Oh, Honda!

189
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,220
Hey! Hey, Reiko!

190
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,640
Aya-chan, Aya-chan, Aya-chan!

191
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,980
Rei Kojo-sama?!

192
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,220
How come Rei Kojo-sama is in my room?

193
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,100
Oh, I see.

194
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,160
I was Rei Kojo-same now, right?

195
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,380
Oh, you found him and what?

196
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
That outfit is...

197
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,180
That's Senpai's shirt!

198
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,120
I just borrowed it.

199
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,780
You just borrowed it?

200
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,420
That's not...

201
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,600
That means Reiko-san and Senpai are...

202
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,280
Maybe that's the relationship?

203
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,800
Finally, she found out.

204
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,020
I found out.

205
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,900
I didn't expect Reiko-san to do this.

206
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,260
You don't like me and Reiko going out?

207
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,840
You're making me feel bad.

208
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,420
Hello, it's Ryo-tsu.

209
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,240
Ryo-chan!

210
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,240
What the hell is going on?

211
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,340
Did you really switch places with Senpai and Reiko-san?

212
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,180
I think so.

213
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,780
Then...

214
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,020
It's Reiko.

215
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,920
Really?

216
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,140
She said it's true.

217
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,760
Really, really, Reiko-san?

218
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,980
Really, really, Reiko-san.

219
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,340
I think Senpai said that we switched places,

220
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,020
and he did whatever he wanted.

221
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,340
And he said he wanted to switch places with Reiko-san yesterday.

222
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,780
Are you telling me I'm lying?

223
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,660
He's definitely Reiko-sama.

224
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,480
He only knew what she didn't know.

225
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,220
It was like that when I was there too.

226
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,820
But Senpai can't get away with that.

227
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,280
No.

228
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,620
No one can trust me while I'm with Ryo-chan.

229
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,060
Yes.

230
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,320
Reiko-san.

231
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,280
Ojou-sama.

232
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,060
It's me.

233
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,980
Wow, you've become a Japanese man.

234
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,420
Come on, Ryo-chan!

235
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,460
Don't play with me like that.

236
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,440
Can you say that to me?

237
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,000
Because...

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,320
You really have switched places.

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,760
Are you convinced?

240
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,240
No.

241
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,660
It's about Senpai.

242
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,660
It can't be that easy.

243
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,060
Come on, Ejeki!

244
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,040
It seems that the experiment was a great success.

245
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,020
Don't be so hard on yourself.

246
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,040
Put it back to normal.

247
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,880
I don't think that's possible.

248
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,060
Why?

249
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,680
You're going to use that machine again.

250
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,100
I'll use it again.

251
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,480
What?

252
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,420
I can put that machine back to normal.

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,600
What?

254
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,540
What?

255
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,220
Then I'm going to stay like this forever?

256
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,740
What?

257
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,340
If you do it for half a day, it will naturally go back to normal.

258
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,960
Really?

259
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,180
The words of the genius scientist Korosuke Ezaki are a lie.

260
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,680
That's a lie.

261
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,460
Maybe he was really switching places.

262
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,660
You finally believed in me.

263
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,240
No.

264
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,920
This is like a trick.

265
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,300
Thanks to you, I was able to obtain valuable research data.

266
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,640
I'll be in charge now.

267
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,760
He's still irresponsible.

268
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,820
Today, I have an important meeting with a customer.

269
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,960
I see.

270
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,620
What do you want?

271
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,700
No way in this form.

272
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,460
It's over.

273
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,120
It's fine to cancel now.

274
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,900
I'll go get you a meal.

275
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,380
Ryo-chan?

276
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,160
They're fine?

277
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,580
I wonder if it's okay.

278
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,260
If you do that, it's a special project this time.

279
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,300
But...

280
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,080
Leave it to me.

281
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,980
I'll make sure Reiko does it perfectly.

282
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,840
If you do that...

283
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,640
I've decided.

284
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,940
By the way, the price is...

285
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,540
Price?

286
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,560
That's right.

287
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,540
We're not doing a pre-treatment.

288
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,100
There's a funny thing coming out of it.

289
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,760
My lady.

290
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,780
I got it.

291
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
I'll pay you if you can do it.

292
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,220
As expected of Reiko.

293
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,180
You're quick to talk.

294
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,240
This is a contract.

295
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,040
Well, you're on a big boat.

296
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:37,960
Leave it to me.

297
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,960
Certainly.

298
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,120
It's been replaced.

299
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,860
Are you ready?

300
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,100
Okay.

301
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:47,960
Perfect.

302
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,340
The other person is a rich lady.

303
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,720
It's a woman officer.

304
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,520
Don't pull over.

305
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,720
Okay.

306
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,600
G.

307
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,000
Are you a foreigner?

308
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,540
I didn't hear you, Reiko.

309
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,360
I can't speak English at all.

310
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,880
It's okay.

311
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,580
Ryo.

312
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,900
Mr. Smith is in Japan 2 of Dai.

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,040
I'm not worried because my Japanese is fluent.

314
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,060
What are you talking about?

315
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,200
Anyway, I'm asking you not to be rude.

316
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,740
Leave it to me.

317
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,060
I'll do it perfectly.

318
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,120
I'm very worried.

319
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,460
Miss Reiko.

320
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,740
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

321
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,860
Hello, Mr. Smith.

322
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,100
Long time no see.

323
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,400
You're doing too much, Ryo.

324
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,740
I'm very happy to see you.

325
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,140
Me too, Miss Reiko.

326
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,960
Please take care of me today.

327
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,600
I know.

328
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,540
I'll do it.

329
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,800
Well, leave it to Reiko.

330
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,180
Yes, yes.

331
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,520
I'll do it.

332
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,800
Ryo.

333
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,240
Mr. Smith.

334
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,120
Yes, sir.

335
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:01,640
What?

336
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,060
Are you waiting for someone?

337
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,400
No, I'm not.

338
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,960
Sorry to bother you.

339
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,800
What are you doing?

340
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,660
Please come here.

341
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,980
Well, Mr. Smith.

342
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,180
Reiko is a friend of Noriko Ushibara.

343
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,900
Really?

344
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,800
Do you know Noriko Ushibara?

345
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,800
Well, yes.

346
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,660
Then, you know why she's a friend of Mr. Smith, right?

347
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,380
Yes, of course.

348
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,820
Then, how about America Zadigani?

349
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,780
Look, you're a very loud person.

350
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,820
Well, that's a little...

351
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,420
I see.

352
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,300
You have to do your best, America Zadigani.

353
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,480
I didn't expect you to be a policeman.

354
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,580
I'm very sorry.

355
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,720
I was very suspicious.

356
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,860
I'm sure.

357
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,480
Can I go now?

358
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,120
Yes.

359
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,240
Well, then.

360
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,440
I'm sorry.

361
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,260
Ryo, can you hear me?

362
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,880
We're almost there.

363
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,260
We have to go.

364
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,360
Mr. Smith?

365
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,980
Hey, Ryo!

366
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,940
What are you talking about, Mr. Smith?

367
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,700
Be quiet.

368
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,860
I'm fine.

369
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,980
What's wrong?

370
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,940
No problem.

371
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,120
Hey, Ryo!

372
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,360
Be quiet.

373
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,940
Mr. Smith, we're almost at the destination.

374
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,660
Yes.

375
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,200
Yes.

376
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,460
We have arrived at the destination.

377
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,480
Oh, beautiful.

378
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,340
Reiko-san, I really hate you.

379
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,960
Well, you're good at this, Su-san.

380
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,880
You're always saying that, right?

381
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:08,840
By the way, Ryo-chan, is the tea ceremony okay?

382
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,840
I don't think I know that.

383
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,860
Then what should we do?

384
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,440
Don't worry. The opponent is a foreigner.

385
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,060
He doesn't know the ceremony.

386
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,780
That might be true, but...

387
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,640
Leave it to me.

388
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:21,860
I don't want to hear it.

389
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,340
I don't want to hear it.

390
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

391
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,980
Uh, Reiko-san, is it just...?

392
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,080
What did you say?

393
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,320
I think you're running away from the way I know tea.

394
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,760
Mr. Smith may not know it, but...

395
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,220
Tea has various kinds of flavors, and mine is the all-purpose flavor.

396
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,360
All-purpose flavor?

397
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,260
I hope you understand.

398
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,240
Nice ice cream!

399
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,320
Here we go.

400
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

401
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,800
Here you go.

402
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,180
Thanks.

403
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,980
What's the matter, Mr. Smith?

404
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,660
Uh, uh, uh, I don't know how to make tea.

405
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,280
Oh, well, I'll make you some tea.

406
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,240
Here you go.

407
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,180
Here you go.

408
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,460
What's wrong, Ryo? What's with that scream?

409
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,120
Mr. Su is so happy to see the tea taste good.

410
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,700
Mr. Su, here you go.

411
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

412
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,860
Oh, my, oh, oh, oh, oh!

413
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,080
Don't hold back.

414
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,740
Oh, no, really!

415
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't hold back.

416
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,440
Here you go.

417
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,000
Oh, no, really!

418
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,780
Ryo, what's wrong? It's Ryo!

419
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,640
Shut up. It's okay.

420
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,820
Ryo! Hey, Ryo!

421
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,180
Here you go.

422
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,800
Don't hold back.

423
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,020
I'm not holding back!

424
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,240
Just take it.

425
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,300
Oh, I'm at my limit!

426
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,500
Don't hold back!

427
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:28,100
M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M

428
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,160
I can't!

429
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,940
I'm telling you, I'm at your limit!

430
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,580
You don't have the courage to take it!

431
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,940
Hello? Hello?

432
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,800
What is it?

433
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,060
There seems to be a problem at Room 901.

434
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,400
Oh...

435
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,280
Pardon me.

436
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,760
I'm sorry. Did something happen?

437
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,580
What happened?

438
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,420
Hurry and contact Miss Reiko!

439
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,580
What did you say?

440
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,040
That Mr. Smith is a fake?

441
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,780
He is trying to seduce Miss Reiko by calling me.

442
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,320
Seduce me?

443
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,780
No, no. Not you. Miss Reiko!

444
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,920
Yes, yes, I understand. I'll let you know right away.

445
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,020
Miss Reiko!

446
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,000
Mr. Hirayama!

447
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,680
Oh? What's wrong with Mr. Hirayama?

448
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,040
He said he had some urgent business, so he's coming back.

449
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,020
Oh, really?

450
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,900
If it's planned, he should be in Kabuki Kansho next, but isn't the route different?

451
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,280
The plan has also been changed.

452
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Oh, really?

453
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,700
The plan has also been changed.

454
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,300
I've set the goal. I'm going to Okutama and I'm running at 60km/h.

455
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,420
All right.

456
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,060
"Okuyama"

457
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:52,500

EAGLE

494
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,320
See you're back to normal, Reiko-san.

495
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,140
I didn't know that.

496
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,020
Then, Ryo-chan too?

497
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,360
Huh?

498
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,140
What is this?

499
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,000
Su-san, what are you doing?

500
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,960
You still don't get it?

501
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,660
You've been making me do all this.

502
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,460
Huh?

503
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,160
The another-world collected pomocano

504
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,180
. What's going on, Su-san?

505
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,680
. What's going on, Su-san?

506
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,080
. What's going on, Su-san?

507
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,120
It looks like Senpai's back.

508
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,240
Let's see.

509
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,400
Come on, your family's back!

510
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,420
What's going on?

511
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,020
.

512
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,320
new

513
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,340
Wait up!

514
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,440
Help!

515
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,380
Help!

516
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,360
Mr. Momowari?

517
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,140
Senator,

518
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,480
Senpai?

519
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,660
Huh? Reiko, did you go back to normal?

520
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,080
Ryo-chan said so!

521
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,700
Huh?

522
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,500
Ehh!

523
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,540
That's why Susan and the others were surprised.

524
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,760
That guy is a fake Mr. Smith.

525
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,500
He was a kidnapper who was after Reiko-san, senpai.

526
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,420
What?

527
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,820
Is that so?

528
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
But, it's a pity to kidnap a senpai.

529
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,560
What a pity to kidnap a senpai.

530
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,680
Right?

531
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,100
But, it was a good time.

532
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,260
I have to thank you, Professor Ezaki.

533
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,480
Oh, by the way, Reiko, what about my apology?

534
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,940
That's not good.

535
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,660
Mr. Smith was a fake.

536
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,600
The contract is invalid.

537
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,440
Ah, that's so...

538
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,800
It was a waste of money, senpai.

539
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,440
Damn!

540
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,060
This is all his fault!

541
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,740
Ezaki!

542
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,900
Well, this experiment was a success.

543
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,480
Why?

544
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,400
Why did Mr. Honda's personality change when he rode a motorbike?

545
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,100
Why?

546
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,240
Why?

547
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,380
Mr. Kigurashi and Mr. Neruo only get together once every four years.

548
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,420
Why?

549
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,620
Why?

550
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,680
Mr. Nakagawa never lent money to Ryo,

551
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,800
but he could easily borrow a tank or a fighter jet.

552
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,480
Why?

553
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,020
Why?

554
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,920
I wonder why?

555
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,880
Reiko is a very rich person, but

556
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,420
Why is she working at the power plant?

557
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,160
I wonder why?

558
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,980
How was it?

559
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,920
