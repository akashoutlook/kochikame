The

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,460
Hey, I've been wondering about this for a while.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,660
What is this stuffed animal hanging here?

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,800
Is it a raccoon?

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,780
Isn't it a Leather Panda?

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,020
Eh?

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,320
Doesn't it look like a raccoon?

10
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,560
What do you mean, "no"?

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,660
Isn't this Reiko's?

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,520
I always thought it was Reiko's.

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,300
No, it's not.

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,360
When I first came to this exit, it was already here.

15
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,680
Come to think of it, it looks like it's been here for a long time.

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,760
Oh...

17
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,200
Then what about you, Terai-san?

18
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,480
No, it's not.

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,360
I remember.

20
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,840
I've been here since I graduated.

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,220
Eh?

22
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,420
Then, could it be...

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,260
Chief Ohara's?

24
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,420
No way.

25
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,300
If that's the case, you're too mean.

26
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,800
Hmm...

27
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,620
Could it be that I've been living in this exit for a long time?

28
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,540
I'm the owner, after all.

29
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,260
No!

30
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,720
Ryo-chan, you're a...

31
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,320
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

The last competition!

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,400
Alright, it's done!

74
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,480
You're really good at this, senpai.

75
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,840
Well, if I make a minicar, it'll be the best in Japan.

76
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,600
What's the best in Japan?

77
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,860
It took three days to make this, isn't it terrible, chief?

78
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,720
You idiot!

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,900
You've been working for three days, haven't you?

80
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,100
No, I mean...

81
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,400
Go clean up and go patrol!

82
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,120
Damn you, chief.

83
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,920
I'll punch you in the ear and make your back hurt.

84
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,360
Hey!

85
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,460
Pull!

86
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,540
Pull!

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,380
Pull!

88
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,640
Pull!

89
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,500
I'll punch you in the ear!

90
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,080
Damn you!

91
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,020
What!? I have to pay a hundred million yen!?

92
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,080
To be precise, the cost of repairing the broken bike and truck,

93
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,220
as well as the damage to the goods,

94
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,480
is 9,999,980 yen in total!

95
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,500
What!?

96
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,800
Why do I have to pay for the bike that fell?

97
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,880
I'm a victim!

98
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,080
As a result of the investigation,

99
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,940
this mini car that you threw into the park

100
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,120
was the root cause of the accident!

101
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,780
No way!

102
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,300
Even if it's such a big accident,

103
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,960
he's a very lucky guy

104
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,620
to have not even a scratch.

105
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,860
Anyway, you have to pay with responsibility!

106
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,640
Nakagawa-chan, please!

107
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,600
I can't afford to pay a hundred million yen!

108
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,520
Let's make a wish together!

109
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,720
Just like this, give me a hundred million yen!

110
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,340
No matter how much you pay,

111
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,700
a hundred million yen is...

112
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,260
Nakagawa-chan, you have pocket money, right?

113
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,220
A hundred million yen is...

114
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,540
That's not true!

115
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,900
Ah, more importantly, Senpai,

116
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,640
there's a way to get a hundred million yen with your own money!

117
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,360
What!?

118
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,320
How can I get it?

119
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,640
This is it!

120
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,240
Huh?

121
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,120
A huge athletic field?

122
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,760
Nakagawa Group has put their all into it,

123
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,140
and made it into the Tokyo Bay's home,

124
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,760
and it's finally going to open next year!

125
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,600
To commemorate that,

126
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,640
they're going to hold a 100 million yen winning race!

127
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,460
And if we win, we can get 100 million yen?

128
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:48,680
Yes!

129
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,620
They've gathered all the participants from all over the country,

130
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,700
and there are over a million applications!

131
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,700
Out of them, 50 teams that have won will be participating,

132
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,160
but if you're Senpai, I'll let you participate by myself!

133
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,080
I see!

134
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,240
So what you should have is the support of the Nakagawa Group!

135
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,340
But we can't participate without the pair,

136
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,000
so we need to find someone with confidence in their physical strength.

137
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,380
Then please come out with us, Nakagawa!

138
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,720
I'm the organizer, so I can't!

139
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,320
I see, then...

140
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,320
What!?

141
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,160
You're going to join the pair!?

142
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,960
It's a hundred million yen prize money,

143
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,860
so it was worth it to spend the night and write a letter of application.

144
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,000
That's why.

145
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,840
I don't want to be a pair with you.

146
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,220
I don't want to be a pair with you.

147
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,760
Don't take it the wrong way.

148
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,440
Damn it!

149
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,620
I thought it would be one of them if I joined the pair,

150
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,120
but whatever.

151
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,720
If I can go out with anyone,

152
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,340
I'll manage it!

153
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Wh-Why do I have to participate in such a race?

154
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,920
Originally, the manager had broken my minicar that I made,

155
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,820
so it happened.

156
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:03,320
What?

157
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,980
Are you going to make something like that while you're working?

158
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,580
What?

159
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,300
I'm sorry, sir.

160
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,420
But I can't pay a hundred million yen with my cheap salary.

161
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,120
It's enough just to join the pair.

162
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,600
I'll manage it later, sir.

163
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
I refuse!

164
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,540
There's not a single time I was happy to join the pair with you.

165
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,300
Pass the test.

166
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,740
I understand.

167
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,480
Then there's no other way.

168
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,720
Huh?

169
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,680
Are you sure, Ryo-tsutsu?

170
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,820
I'm going to attack the bank and take a hundred million yen.

171
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,520
I'll take the money.

172
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,080
The manager is the former boss of the gang,

173
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
but it can't be helped.

174
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,800
The chief will see the picture of me and the former boss of the gang tomorrow.

175
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,860
Then...

176
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,100
W-Wait, Ryo-tsu!

177
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,600
Don't be in a hurry!

178
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,520
I've already decided.

179
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,580
But, Ryo-tsu...

180
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,140
There's no other way to get a hundred million yen.

181
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,140
Think again!

182
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,040
Ryo-tsu is the one who gave up his chance.

183
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,660
Ryo-tsu, please stop.

184
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,940
Oh, is it the end of the poor subordinate who can't be blessed by his boss?

185
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,700
All right!

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,400
I'll come out!

187
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,980
I'll come out, Ryo-tsu!

188
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,620
Are you sure, Ryo-tsu?

189
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,560
I thought you would do it.

190
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,900
It's wonderful to be blessed by your boss.

191
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,480
Ryo-tsu, I'll get a hundred million yen for sure.

192
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,380
Let's do it!

193
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,900
Welcome to the Nagagawa Giant Athletic Field Open Memorial Race.

194
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,260
All the athletics held today are on the third stage.

195
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,740
Each field has a game prepared with ingenuity.

196
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,340
As expected of the pair who have passed the hundred million yen challenge.

197
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,040
The pair who are proud of their physical strength.

198
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,240
But, the one who will compete with us is...

199
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,400
Volvo and Komachi who throw away women if they are paid.

200
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,320
Captain!

201
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,040
You are already dead.

202
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,900
What?

203
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,980
I forgot the morning and night.

204
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,440
Ouch!

205
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,160
Mr. Hon-daro!

206
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,960
Why are you here?

207
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm here to announce my world's strongest Honda-ra-ken to the world.

208
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,720
To build the division of South America with the prize.

209
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,360
What?

210
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,420
To do so, I made a postcard of 100,000 yen and made three teams participate.

211
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,200
The winner is ours!

212
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,100
Hmm... I hated the bad-ass subordinates.

213
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,380
Then, let's go to the first stage, the survival game field.

214
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,780
Let's go!

215
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,660
The survival game field.

216
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,560
What's this room?

217
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,380
In the dome, everything is made in giant.

218
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,460
This room has been made into a kitchen and living room for the survival game.

219
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,880
Giant athletics?

220
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,520
Is it about athletics in a huge thing?

221
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,260
Do you play with a gun in this room?

222
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,640
It seems to be so.

223
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:16,660
It seems to be so.

224
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,360
Then, please choose the air gun first.

225
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,240
What is this gun?

226
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,600
Are you going to make a fight with this gun?

227
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,820
This dome was made for athletics purposes.

228
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,220
It's not this big to be able to get physical strength.

229
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,720
Indeed, it takes a lot of physical strength to run with this.

230
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,860
Can you really shoot a bullet?

231
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,660
It's a special BB bullet.

232
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,120
There is paint inside the bullet,

233
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,120
so when it hits the body, the paint will be attached to the clothes.

234
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,480
So when the paint is on, it's out.

235
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,440
That's right.

236
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,260
If you can choose a gun, let's start the game.

237
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,940
Yes.

238
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,020
I'll announce the team.

239
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,660
Team A is from No. 1 to No. 25, and the host is the living room.

240
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,600
Team B is from No. 26 to No. 51, and the host is the dining kitchen.

241
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,740
Team A is from No. 26 to No. 51, and the host is the dining kitchen.

242
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,980
The team to be able to win the match loses.

243
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,940
There's Borbo with army experience.

244
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,080
He's pretty tough, isn't he?

245
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,480
Don't worry!

246
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,760
I and you are here.

247
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,560
This is the same team, so we're going to lose.

248
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,180
Then, spread to where I'm in charge!

249
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,340
Where's the survival game?

250
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,440
Boss, watch out!

251
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Damn it!

252
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,860
I can't stand it when they shoot at us like that!

253
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Morumome, is it a strategy that won't work because it's too heavy?

254
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,600
We have no choice but to go around and attack!

255
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,240
Wait, Ryotsu!

256
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,020
On top of the bookshelf!

257
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,880
That was close!

258
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,520
If we go out now, we're gonna be in trouble!

259
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,920
Ryotsu, there's a sniper on the left, so move!

260
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,300
I know! I'll crush him now!

261
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
That's heavy...

262
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,340
Boss, to the right!

263
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,520
Good, shoot!

264
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,900
Ryotsu, I've got one down!

265
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,680
What's wrong, Ryotsu?

266
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

267
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,320
I forgot to blow back this gun!

268
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,840
Tee hee!

269
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,320
Alright, second down!

270
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,580
My gun!

271
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,600
My gun!

272
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,160
Looks like the enemy team has stopped moving!

273
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,680
We're gonna break through the central zone, so leave the rest to us!

274
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,300
Alright!

275
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,180
What's next?

276
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,800
Not a single shot!

277
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,960
You bastards!

278
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,820
We're breaking the rules!

279
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,920
Damn it!

280
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,780
Damn it!

281
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,540
Damn it!

282
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,500
Damn it!

283
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,800
Damn it!

284
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,080
I won't lose to a man.

285
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,940
It's better to have a team with Mr. Volvo and Mr. Sakonji.

286
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,880
But if I get a prize money, I think I'll win no matter what dirty trick you use.

287
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,700
That's true.

288
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,480
The match is about to begin.

289
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,780
I will definitely get 100 million yen.

290
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,880
The match is about to begin.

291
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,880
That's enough!

292
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,840
It's spinning!

293
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,260
Break!

294
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,880
I did it!

295
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,180
Ryotsu, I'm tired. I can't move.

296
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,960
Chief, you can go and stop the bank at any time.

297
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,080
I-I can't do that.

298
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,620
Right?

299
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,740
Then...

300
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,320
If you beat them, you'll reach the empty ship.

301
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,620
Damn it! I can't stand there.

302
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,620
All right!

303
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,920
Oh, no! I'm in the bottom!

304
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,400
I'll make you pay for this!

305
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,240
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

306
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,380
Break!

307
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,540
Break!

308
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,640
Why did you use such a dirty trick?

309
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,520
But now's my chance!

310
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,140
Take this!

311
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,420
Damn it!

312
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,720
All right! Let's go!

313
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,780
What?

314
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,860
Let's go!

315
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,540
Alright! I got the empty ship!

316
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:24,620
What?

317
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,700
Oh, no! I hit the bullet!

318
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,680
What's wrong with you?

319
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,100
Are cockroaches as giant as you?

320
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,360
Yes.

321
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,340
It's a robot, but it has a proper input for fixing it.

322
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,320
Don't fly!

323
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,800
What's that?

324
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,240
Ryotsu, use this!

325
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,360
If it's a normal cockroach, I can beat it with this.

326
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,660
No, no.

327
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,520
It's a robot.

328
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,440
Ryotsu, I got it!

329
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,280
Team B wins!

330
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,020
I never thought we'd lose in the first battle.

331
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,380
I dreamt of buying a victory figure.

332
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,540
The second stage is a maze made of giant sushi.

333
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,400
Of course, sushi is a real thing that uses biotechnology.

334
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,580
Four groups who successfully passed the maze and quickly touched the center tower flag

335
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,260
enter the final field.

336
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,800
You guys know who made you stay here, don't you?

337
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,580
That has nothing to do with it.

338
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,080
Right. It's not a team battle from now on.

339
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:45,940
Team B!

340
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,660
You guys are so clueless.

341
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,140
One of them is a rice ball, but it's a real thing.

342
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,780
You use biotechnology to make something like this.

343
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,840
If you can overcome sushi, you'll be disqualified.

344
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,480
Get ready!

345
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,580
Go!

346
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,780
It's pretty complicated.

347
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,200
Damn, I don't get it at all.

348
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,080
Ryotsu, you've gone the wrong way again.

349
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,920
Chief! I can see the goal over there!

350
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,800
Go straight here?

351
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,780
Alright.

352
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,120
It's a hell with a castle on fire!

353
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,260
It's okay.

354
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
You're just eating it.

355
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,860
No, it's a great move.

356
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,220
I'm going with it.

357
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,060
Ryotsu!

358
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,800
You just have to climb over it!

359
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,020
To think that they think that they can eat sushi.

360
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,880
It's a real castle.

361
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,460
They're going to eat the whole thing.

362
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,380
They're already that close.

363
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,800
There are four levels.

364
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,020
Don't give up. You're too young.

365
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,200
Hurry up, you bastard!

366
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,580
I'm going to be the top!

367
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,560
Oh, my dear old man!

368
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,760
I won't let you!

369
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:19,780
Damn it!

370
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,120
I caught you!

371
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,680
Hey, let go!

372
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,040
I'm the top!

373
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,660
And the last one!

374
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,480
Damn it!

375
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,840
Get on, old man!

376
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,960
You go first, Mr. Kenshin!

377
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,640
The Hon-Dara sword is in first and second place!

378
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,060
Yay!

379
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,480
We're in third place!

380
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,880
We're in fourth place!

381
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,280
I can't do this. I can't make it.

382
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,540
I won't let anyone get the last chance!

383
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,940
Get out of my way!

384
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,480
Get out of my way!

385
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,280
Yay!

386
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,160
I'm in fourth place!

387
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,860
Be careful!

388
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,280
How can you be so cruel about this, when you have no one to listen to?

389
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,220
The final match starts now!

390
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,540
The four members will compete in a giant sports tournament!

391
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,480
The first match of the table tennis competition,

392
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,340
is going to be between the O-Hara pair and

393
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,720
the O-Seisho pair!

394
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,840
Please start the match!

395
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,060
Here I go!

396
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,920
Ready, steady, go!

397
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,720
All right!

398
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,640
I got it all!

399
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,300
All right!

400
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,800
Ouch!

401
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,300
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

402
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,140
Hehe! The enemy's combination is too bad!

403
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,800
Komachi! I'll have to play in this match!

404
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:38,780
Yeah!

405
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,100
Alright! You've got a match point now!

406
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,360
Ryosu, it's the end of the match.

407
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,800
I can't play anymore.

408
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,100
But even if I lost, the bank robbery would...

409
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,660
I'm not kidding!

410
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,580
It's not a sudden attack! I know how to use it, so I'll show you!

411
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,040
Y-You're still giving up?

412
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll definitely counterattack!

413
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,440
Strip!

414
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,520
Leave it to me!

415
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,540
I used a backspin!

416
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
When did you learn that technique?

417
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,000
Alright, counterattack!

418
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,600
Strip!

419
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,880
Alright, now it's sudden attack!

420
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,680
The one who gets one first wins!

421
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,060
What about the serve?

422
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,180
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

423
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,460
Rock, paper, scissors!

424
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,440
If this is the serve, I'll win for sure!

425
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,760
Naoko, be careful with the spin serve!

426
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,120
Okay.

427
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,440
You're not going to hit it that easily.

428
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,400
Kimutaku!

429
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,280
What?

430
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:50,840
Where?

431
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,940
Now!

432
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,660
Game set!

433
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,660
Ryotsu-Ohara pair wins!

434
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,720
How dirty!

435
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,700
The spin serve is a common thing in ping pong.

436
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,700
He's really dirty, even though he's an ally.

437
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,520
The final is a bowling match.

438
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,600
Now, please start with Team A.

439
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,300
Oh, there's a hole.

440
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,260
Okay.

441
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,080
Let's go!

442
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,400
William, let go of me.

443
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,180
.

444
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,800
He gets them easily on the strike.

445
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,340
I understand the approach.

446
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,200
I can do it!

447
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,260
I don't see any movement to the front, it's hard.

448
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,400
.

449
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,620
.

450
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,680
I'm not going to let you beat me!

451
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,140
Ryotsu! It's 9 points difference!

452
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,940
If you have more than a spare, you can win!

453
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,060
Hmph! I've never taken a spare before, but I can't!

454
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,320
Shut up! I'll finish you off with a strike!

455
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,640
Take this!

456
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,600
I'll finish you off with a strike!

457
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,900
It's a split! Even a professional can't take this!

458
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,700
I'm the winner!

459
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,260
I can give up 100 million yen by going all the way here, but...

460
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,620
If I end up like this...

461
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,620
Then you can't take a spare.

462
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,560
Is that it?

463
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,860
It's a match from here!

464
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,940
Here I go!

465
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,600
What the?!

466
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,880
What?!

467
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
A little more to the right!

468
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,100
I did it!

469
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,500
Looks like the last strategy was a waste.

470
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,200
I'll take the victory!

471
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,780
100 million yen!

472
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,740
I-I fell!

473
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,200
I did it!

474
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,420
I did it well, Ryotsu!

475
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,980
What a great year!

476
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,300
I lost.

477
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,720
I'm glad, Ryo-chan!

478
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,720
You won 100 million yen!

479
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,680
It was a wonderful match.

480
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,200
Thanks to you, my body is very stiff.

481
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,580
Okay, it's finished!

482
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,920
Eh?

483
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,640
B-Boss!

484
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,820
How many times do I have to tell you?

485
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,240
I'll take this!

486
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,940
No, Boss!

487
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,040
No!

488
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,420
Give it back!

489
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:44,980
Let go!

490
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,600
Give it back!

491
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,040
I won't!

492
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,240
Let go!

493
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,420
I'll take it!

494
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,960
I'll take it!

495
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,060
I'll take it!

496
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,720
I'll take it!

497
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:53,760
What?

498
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,820
Wait!

499
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,780
I can't believe I've lost 100 million yen!

500
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,340
What's wrong with my body?

501
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,160
100 million yen!

502
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,340
I made it!

503
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,880
100 million yen!

504
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,320
햇気!

505
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,920
country

506
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,800
Yes!

507
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,580
I walked through the crowd in black

508
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:52,740
Everyone was a child once, but they all forgot

509
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,900
A politician with a great face

510
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,680
A blue aunt on top of her eyes

511
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:06,020
Turn around and look at that corner

512
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,440
I can see everyone, everyone

513
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,600
Let's go!

514
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,460
There's a turtle over there

515
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,280
There's surely a turtle

516
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,420
Everyone, come to our town

517
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,520
Thank you!

518
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,560
Hey, hey, Ryotsu!

519
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,320
It's a festival, so don't be so excited!

520
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,960
Huh?

521
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,440
I caught a turtle once

522
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,320
You didn't wash your feet, did you?

523
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,260
What about the promise you made to me?

524
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,160
Next time on Matsuri Daiko

525
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,060
Thank you!

526
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,000
There's a turtle over there

527
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,720
There's surely a turtle

528
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,820
Everyone, come to our town

529
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,980
Thank you!
