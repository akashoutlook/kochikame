2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,580
I look at the sunset floating in the river

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,560
If I throw a stone, it will fly to my shoes

4
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:32,540
I wonder if I'll go to the gym that I used to go to

5
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:39,080
I was laughed at as it was

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,640
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,980
There is a Katsushika Kameari

8
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,460
The cityscape that doesn't change a single yawn

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,900
It's strangely gentle

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,380
From the waterfront of the Tungari-boshi

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,940
To the Taishakuten

12
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,100
The sunset falls

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,500
Tomorrow will end like this

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Katsushika Shiba

15
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,420
I realized that I lost my happiness

16
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm stupid

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,260
I'm broken

18
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,900
I'm naive

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:42,840
And I just don't say "No"

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,040
Please give me my "I lost my happiness"

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,560
"I lost my happiness"

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,080
"I lived in a battle with it"

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,480
"-----

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,760
"I lost it all"

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,480
"And now I'm sick of being sick!"

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,540
"And now I'm going to sleep with theia!"

27
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,640
It's dangerous, isn't it?

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,260
Now, let's get the

29
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,380
money.

30
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,880
Wow, that's great.

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,100
Yeah, yeah.

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,600
But why do you have to hand over the money at a place like this?

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,460
It's useless.

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,640
It's hard to get a woman.

35
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,160
I see, I see.

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,260
I'll show you something good.

38
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,140
Come on.

39
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,100
What?

40
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,960
What's good?

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,500
I'm not interested in this.

42
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,420
Are you not interested in women?

43
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,980
Maybe Nakagawa-kun.

44
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,620
I'm just working now.

45
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,780
How about looking at such things at the station?

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,800
It's suspicious to be ignorant.

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,060
It's suspicious.

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,640
It's not.

49
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,500
What are you doing?

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,040
Oh, Mr. Katsuta.

51
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
I'm going to the station again.

52
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,500
I'm going to the station.

53
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:54,980
I think they brought a lot of books and videos.

54
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,560
No, I just passed by.

55
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,700
Kei, if you get involved with those people, you won't be a good person.

56
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,640
Shut up!

57
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,000
Mr. Katsuta, let's talk about the future of Japanese politics.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,810
Ah, yeah.

59
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,460
Nakagawa, let me know if you have a chance.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,940
Yeah.

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,240
What the hell are you thinking?

62
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,340
Hey, thanks for your work.

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,260
Thank you for your hard work.

64
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,440
Hey, where's Ryotsu?

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,080
Huh?

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,160
He wasn't absent today, was he?

67
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,360
Ryotsu is watching something suspicious from the back.

68
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,800
What?

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,060
He's a nice guy with a nice body.

70
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,660
I'm blonde.

71
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,400
You're so annoying.

72
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,060
Hey!

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,940
Chief! You're here!

74
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:48,940
You idiot!

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,760
Ryotsu, show me what you've hidden behind you.

76
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,180
Ah! It's nothing big.

77
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,900
Huh?

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,560
Yeah.

79
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,140
You said you were a nice guy with a nice body.

80
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,820
It's a picture of a sumo wrestler.

81
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,980
It's not interesting.

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,880
Oh, a sumo wrestler.

83
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,640
I'd like to see it.

84
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,460
You idiot.

85
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,020
Chief is a big sumo fan.

86
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,960
It's not something you can show to the chief because you're so poor.

87
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,520
Just show me.

88
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:18,900
Here.

89
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,600
Like this.

90
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:21,940
Come on.

91
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,020
Show me.

92
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,660
Come on.

93
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,460
Come on.

94
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,400
Come on.

95
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,960
Come on.

96
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,700
Hey, show me.

97
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,180
Show me.

98
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,040
There's no proof.

99
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,680
You idiot!

100
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,440
If you find it in the bookshelf, you'll be fired.

101
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,440
So you better stay there.

102
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,100
Yes, sir.

103
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,860
Yes, sir.

104
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,240
Yes, sir.

105
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,120
Yes, sir.

106
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,500
I've put all the money I have into those precious pictures!

107
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,280
Damn it!

108
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,040
How could you spend money on such a thing?

109
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,940
You idiot!

110
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,300
Shut up!

111
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,480
Hey, give me the other picture.

112
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,660
No.

113
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,860
I don't have any money.

114
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,860
That one's already been used.

115
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,880
Somehow.

116
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,580
That's right.

117
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,520
I beg you.

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,200
That's right.

119
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,380
You can split it up if you want.

120
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,660
Really?

121
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,060
See you.

122
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,220
See you.

123
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,340
See you.

124
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,640
See you.

125
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,060
Hey, if you're going to do that, it's a cheap job!

126
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,760
Ryo, Ryo.

127
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,360
I've put those pictures in there today.

128
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,700
I'm so glad.

129
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,500
It's a perfect camouflage.

130
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
This one's amazing.

131
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,400
It's a picture of a super ugly girl.

132
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,760
I can't wait to see it.

133
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,680
Then, I promise you...

134
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,260
I know.

135
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,500
Here.

136
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:43,920
Oh.

137
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,420
This is a picture of last summer when we went to the beach together.

138
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,120
I just bought a underwater camera, so I took a lot of pictures in the sea and the bath.

139
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,380
It's a nice picture.

140
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,160
It's going to be a hit by the fans.

141
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,280
It's a little unnecessary, but...

142
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,140
But, is there really anyone who wants a picture like this?

143
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,540
There is.

144
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,600
The people who are in charge of it.

145
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,280
I don't know.

146
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,620
Damn it.

147
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,900
It's a waste to bring such a cheap picture to the workplace.

148
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,860
Give it back.

149
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,800
That's not it.

150
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:17,980
What?

151
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,980
What is this?

152
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,860
What is this picture?

153
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,280
No, a little...

154
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
Ryo had such a hobby.

155
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,360
Senior.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,480
No, I'm...

157
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,260
As always, he's a noisy man.

158
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,140
Oh, chief.

159
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,080
What's wrong?

160
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,960
You're on duty.

161
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm going to Nagoya to see my senior who retired from his job.

162
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,380
I'm going to Nagoya to see my senior who retired from his job.

163
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,360
I forgot something and I went to get it.

164
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,520
I forgot something and I went to get it.

165
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,120
Ah, I found it.

166
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,120
By the way, you seem to be having a fight.

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,180
No, I'm not having a fight.

168
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,780
What?

169
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,200
What?

170
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,880
You're bringing something you don't like to the station, aren't you?

171
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,060
It's ridiculous.

172
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,980
By the way, is the train time okay?

173
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,660
No, the bullet train is just at 12 o'clock.

174
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,920
I'll be back.

175
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,500
I'll be back.

176
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,580
Have a safe trip.

177
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,460
Have a safe trip.

178
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,160
Have a safe trip.

179
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,900
He's so cool.

180
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,580
I'll be back.

181
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,240
Have a safe trip.

182
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,980
Have a safe trip.

183
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,220
I'll be back.

184
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,360
I'll be back.

185
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,900
I'll be back.

186
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,080
Oh, I forgot something.

187
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,920
This is all that's in there.

188
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,560
Where did you put my picture?

189
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,580
Huh?

190
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,120
That's strange.

191
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,560
I think it was in here.

192
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,040
Mr. Kuro.

193
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,640
I don't remember putting a picture of Edge on this paper.

194
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,680
What?

195
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,080
What?

196
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,240
What?

197
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,500
What's this?

198
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,740
What's going on?

199
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,880
By the way, Mr. Chief, I have the same paper bag as this.

200
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,000
What?

201
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,340
Mr. Chief, you have your luggage here.

202
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,680
You took my luggage by mistake!

203
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,440
Damn it!

204
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,660
It's time to get on the train to the station.

205
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,440
Nakagawa, get your car out of here!

206
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,000
Why do I have to go?

207
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,440
Can you let the chief see that picture?

208
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,060
The other day, a stupid policeman who posted a nude photo on the women's weekly magazine was there.

209
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,880
I think he was fired.

210
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,660
What?

211
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,500
The police?

212
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,540
Fired?

213
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,100
Get the chief!

214
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,900
We'll catch him at Tokyo Station!

215
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,620
Go!

216
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,100
Senpai, it's dangerous. Please sit down.

217
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,940
Get on the train!

218
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,800
It's okay. We'll be able to get around at this pace.

219
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,100
Ah!

220
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,160
What is it?

221
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,160
Shall we go?

222
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,940
Yeah.

223
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,720
Thank you!

224
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,580
No, you don't need to go.

225
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:17,820
You don't need to go.

226
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,060
That's insane.

227
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,740
What is he going to tell us?

228
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,580
I'll give you a tip.

229
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,660
Are you sure?

230
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,700
Sorry.

231
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,320
I didn't mean to talk to Inoko when she was calling.

232
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:30,920
She an idea, I suppose.

233
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,000
Alright?

234
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,420
Does she know?

235
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,280
YEAH!!!

236
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,460
Soon to 9:00 alarm button 707 Hakata-yuki will fire.

237
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,620
707, where are you? 707!

238
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,500
You're so amatou, it must be happy for him.

239
00:09:59,500 --> 00:09:59,740
I'm sure you'll be able to see it.

240
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,760
Where are you?

241
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,000
This is the home.

242
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,560
This is the home.

243
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,400
The door is closing.

244
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,120
Oh, my God.

245
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,760
Where is the captain?

246
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
I'm going to the next station.

247
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,340
It's straight to Nagoya.

248
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,060
What?

249
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,400
And even if it's a cobra,

250
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,500
it's impossible to go to Nagoya in two hours.

251
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,660
What should I do?

252
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,980
If you see the contents of the paper bag,

253
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm completely dead.

254
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,160
I can't do anything.

255
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm dead.

256
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,020
You're running at 200km/h.

257
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,720
Senior, there's still a way.

258
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,620
Stop being so calm.

259
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,140
Even if it's a cobra,

260
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,460
how can we catch up to the captain?

261
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,620
It's a jet helicopter.

262
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,480
What?

263
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,520
Hey, are you still coming?

264
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,800
That's strange.

265
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,400
It's already time to arrive.

266
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,300
Here it comes.

267
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,440
Wow.

268
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,540
What's that?

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,640
What's that?

270
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:36,960
;

271
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,800
What is that armored helicopter?

272
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,340
It's a former Soviet army

273
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,240
military-� profound helicopter

274
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,440
.

275
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,600
What in the world?

282
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,720
A big idiot!

283
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,440
It's a machine to track down the soldiers' helicopters!

284
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,720
It's so striking, isn't it?

285
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,380
The jet helicopters are all in use.

286
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,080
This is the only machine that can come within 30 minutes.

287
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,720
This is the only machine that can come within 30 minutes.

288
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,360
At least let them disengage their armaments!

289
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,680
They won't know even if they're shot.

290
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,500
There's no time for that.

291
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,700
Can they just go to Nagoya like that?

292
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,820
That's not good.

293
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,700
Well, whatever.

294
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,840
I saw the new ship.

295
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,300
What?

296
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,900
Nakazato, open the door.

297
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:31,680
Yes, sir!

298
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,600
Is that the Hikari 707?

299
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,780
Bring the jet closer!

300
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,040
What's that shit?

301
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,640
It came from so close.

302
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,260
Try to get close.

303
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,840
What's that?

304
00:12:59,840 --> 00:12:59,920
Where's Ujiho?

305
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,320
Where's Ujiho?

306
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,960
Hikari!

307
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,300
I found Ujiho!

308
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,280
Ujiho!

309
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,520
Ujiho!

310
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:10,580
Ujiho!

311
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,000
Ujiho!

312
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,020
Hikari!

313
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,060
Ujiho!

314
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,140
Confidential 4

315
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,680
Okay! All set.

316
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,400
Here I go!

317
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,600
What?

318
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,560
Now?

319
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,340
There's still a ton of tunnels around here.

320
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:23,780
That's dangerous!

321
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,000
If we keep bugging ourselves,

322
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,600
we'll end up back in Nagoya!

323
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,880
Let's go�g a match with the pilot!

324
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,900
Get ready!

325
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:31,980
Oh!

326
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,660
What are you thinking?

327
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,260
We're going to jump from the left wing for the job.

328
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,080
Lower the altitude to 15 meters above the ground!

329
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,520
Please be careful of the high-altitude lines!

330
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,620
Listen up!

331
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,260
Get the timing right, and jump between the high and low!

332
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,300
Yes sir!

333
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,540
We're on our way! Please hurry!

334
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,440
Are you ready?

335
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,140
Yes sir!

336
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,540
Alright! Let's go!

337
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,620
No time to waste!

338
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Ready, set...

339
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,980
We're almost there!

340
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,180
Yes sir!

341
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,360
How's that? Did we make it?

342
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,500
Yes sir! We managed to jump safely!

343
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,860
Are you alright, Seba?

344
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,320
That was a great jump!

345
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,100
You're so annoying!

346
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,340
Uh-oh!

347
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,260
We made it!

348
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:53,340
We've worked so hard to cover the National Public Highway 7!

349
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,640
We've worked so hard to cover the National Public Highway 7!

350
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,120
But you made it impossible toader landing!

351
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,520
You've made it impossible to cover the National Public Highway 7!

352
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:00,920
You've made it impossible to header landing!

353
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,520
You've made it impossible to header landing!

354
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,680
FACTORY

355
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,980
There they are.

356
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,820
They're sleeping. It's our chance.

357
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,440
I'll go check.

358
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,580
Yes! There she is...

359
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,620
You don't mind if you take a nap.

360
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:28,700
Please don't do that.

361
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,260
I need to go home.

362
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,920
He's asleep.

363
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,160
What's wrong?

364
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,300
Nothing.

365
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,980
I'm sorry.

366
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,880
That was close.

367
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,380
If he sees me, he'll get mad.

368
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,160
Shizuoka.

369
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,800
You were sleeping a lot.

370
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,080
Let's go to the bathroom.

371
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,160
I'm up.

372
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,280
It's my chance.

373
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,660
Right.

374
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,060
Call your senior.

375
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,060
Call him.

376
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,320
I got it.

377
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,920
Right.

378
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,880
I should take my wallet.

379
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,720
Mr. Kondaka.

380
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,380
Right.

381
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,880
Well, whatever.

382
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,740
No, no.

383
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,620
I should take my souvenir.

384
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,060
Are you sure you're alright?

385
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,460
I'm fine.

386
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,680
No, I'm not.

387
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,300
I'm dead tired.

388
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,660
You should leave for business.

389
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Oh, yeah?

390
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,660
I need this.

391
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,580
Here you go.

392
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,420
That's it.

393
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:07,480
Kondaka.

394
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,300
He's gone crazy, isn't he?

395
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,100
Yes, he is.

396
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,880
Kondaka.

397
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,160
We must find a way out

398
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,680
that's straight in at once.

399
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,080
Yes, sir.

400
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,520
That's...

401
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,780
Hey, wait a minute.

402
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,180
Yes?

403
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,040
I have a favor to ask you.

404
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,320
Can you hear me?

405
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,440
Yes!

406
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,480
Would you like some beer?

407
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,240
I can't see the newspaper.

408
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,020
I'll give you a chance.

409
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,900
I'll give you a chance.

410
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,640
You're a good drinker, sis.

411
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,040
What are you doing?

412
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,720
Grandpa, you can't go to the toilet.

413
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,800
I don't need to go to the toilet.

414
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,420
This is...

415
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,280
It's so dry.

416
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,880
Stop it!

417
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,220
What are you doing?

418
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,320
You're not good at violence, are you?

419
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,940
I've seen you somewhere.

420
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,900
It's just my imagination.

421
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,220
That's right.

422
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,880
I'm often said to be like the person on the right side of the pub.

423
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,760
No, someone I know...

424
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,180
Hey, how much is this?

425
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,200
Oh, no.

426
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,540
What's that voice?

427
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,500
No?

428
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,000
What do you mean?

429
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,780
It's here, so it's for sale, right?

430
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,140
Well, that's...

431
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,680
How about it?

432
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,600
How much is it for sale?

433
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:43,900
How much?

434
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,420
It's for sale.

435
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,060
100 yen.

436
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,160
What?

437
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,700
That's for sale?

438
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,700
I had no choice.

439
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,280
If I keep going, they'll find out.

440
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,200
Damn it.

441
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,140
That old man.

442
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,000
He's always in my way.

443
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,600
I guess women can't do it.

444
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,440
Okay, I'll go next.

445
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,120
It's a close call.

446
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,100
It's already Hamamatsu.

447
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,840
About 30 minutes left.

448
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,600
Excuse me.

449
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,220
The next seat is free.

450
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,100
Yes, please.

451
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,940
I'm Mr. Kato, a 10th-grade Japanese.

452
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,660
Nice to meet you.

453
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,620
What's the matter?

454
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,320
Have we met before?

455
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,720
Yeah, it's the first time.

456
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,220
Oh, it's you.

457
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh, Hamashiga, the Hamada monster.

458
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,280
What?

459
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,220
Oh, no, it's the giant eel.

460
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,800
I suddenly remembered the 4 o'clock.

461
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,680
You're very busy.

462
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,460
I'm sorry, but would you like to see the passenger ticket?

463
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
The passenger ticket?

464
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,360
Oh, there's a white bear.

465
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,580
That's the Hokkyoku ticket.

466
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,260
Oh, do you play Bakatono or Dafunda?

467
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,060
That's the Shimura ticket.

468
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,720
Oh, no, that's the Sui ticket.

469
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,180
Oh, no, that's the Tosa ticket.

470
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,840
It's completely different.

471
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,960
Oh, no, that's the Tosa ticket.

472
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,080
Hey, my luggage.

473
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,260
You did it, senior.

474
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:08,920
You idiot.

475
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,940
Run away now.

476
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:10,660
What?

477
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,220
Oh, no!

478
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,660
I'm sorry.

479
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,220
I...

480
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,140
Wait, wait, wait...

481
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,360
I...

482
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,960
And take it...

483
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,660
I'll take it one more time.

484
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,400
And take it one more time.

485
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,940
And take it one more time.

486
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,340
And take it one more time.

487
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,400
And take it one more time.

488
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,740
This time I'm going to give it to you for free.

489
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,580
You have to pay it.

490
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,100
Oh, no, no.

491
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,380
You have to pay it.

492
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,960
Oh, I'll pay it back.

493
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

494
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,660
My luggage!

495
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:30,900
I have to pay it.

496
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,800
Hey!

497
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,480
Wait!

498
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Are you arrested here?

499
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,120
Hey!

500
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,080
Stop it!

501
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,540
Excuse me, I'm not fat, are you?

502
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,300
What are you doing?

503
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,380
My souvenir!

504
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,540
What are you doing?

505
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,260
Excuse me!

506
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,440
My souvenir!

507
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,640
But it looks like someone.

508
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,300
Excuse me, I'm not fat, are you?

509
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,020
But it looks like someone.

510
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,060
But it looks like someone.

511
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,460
Now, you're free.

512
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,160
Hey!

513
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,600
Wait.

514
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:45,980
Hold this!

515
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,340
Yes.

516
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,020
I got it.

517
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,060
Yes, face them.

518
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,080
Bro, I'll go first.

519
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,540
We're done.

520
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,040
What are you doing?

521
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,220
The train is moving at the highest speed.

522
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,680
It's too dangerous.

523
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,940
If we stand still,

524
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,140
we're entering Toyohashi.

525
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,100
This is going to be a big mess.

526
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,820
Yamame, use my hand!

527
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,940
Roger that!

528
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,260
What are you going to do with my hand?

529
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,860
Well, you'll see.

530
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,060
It's going up!

531
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,840
What's that smoke?

532
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,240
Brake!

533
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,140
I see.

534
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,540
Here we are.

535
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,640
We've finally got the photo back!

536
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,220
Senior, this is dangerous!

537
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,440
Let's get back inside the helicopter!

538
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,820
Yeah!

539
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,640
That was close!

540
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,920
Hey!

541
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,780
You've got to be kidding me!

542
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,580
My photo!

543
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,560
The paper's going to fall.

544
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,220
What's going on?

545
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,580
What's going on?

546
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,060
This is a big mess.

547
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,260
A big offense.

548
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,620
I guess we did something bad.

549
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,580
The suspect used the papers.

550
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,080
This is what he did.

551
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,700
And he bet on Marisa!

552
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,620
You've got to be kidding me.

553
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,620
I don't think I didn't do it on purpose.

554
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,640
But you did, right?

555
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,940
Where'd it go?

556
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,000
Hey, do you know where I left my uniform?

557
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,780
You know what? I ate it!

558
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,940
Why did you eat it, chief?

559
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,160
That's my precious food!

560
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,380
I'll make sure you pay for it!

561
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,900
As a human!

562
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,400
Next time, I'll risk my life!

563
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,060
You can eat it all!

564
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,280
I'm counting on you!

565
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,620
I can't fall in love

566
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm a woman

567
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,300
I know people say I'm a woman

568
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,960
But I have so many things I want to do

569
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,420
I want to ride in a bike

570
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,000
In a vast desert

571
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:53,100
I want to be free

572
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,100
More than a bird

573
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,880
I want to be free

574
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,620
I want to be free

575
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,560
I want to be free

576
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,140
I want to be free

577
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,660
I want to be free

578
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,240
I want to be free

579
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,300
I want to be free

580
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,300
I want to be free

581
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,540
I want to be free

582
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,140
I want to be free

583
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,060
I want to be free

584
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,540
I want to be free

585
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,680
I want to be free

586
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,400
I want to be free

587
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,940
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.

588
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,060
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.

590
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,680
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.

591
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,720
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.

592
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:41,820

593
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,860
