00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,760
The Day of the Sandwich

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,760
Ryo-san, I think we'll be...

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,800
What? You're going to say "White Day" again on March 14th, right?

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,040
That's not what we're talking about!

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,420
No, it's not like that.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,100
March 13th is the day of the sandwich.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,560
The day of the sandwich?

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,100
You see, the letter "1" is sandwiched between the letters "3", right?

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,460
And then there's "3" and "1", "3" and "1", "3" and "1", and so on.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,900
How stupid! Stop saying "What day is it today?"

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,480
When you're watching TV, make the room bright and look away!

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,420
If you're broke, come to my place!

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:06,100
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,160
You'll be fine eventually.

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,120
If you don't have a job, come with me.

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,540
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,020
Look, even the red clouds are burning.

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,720
You'll be fine eventually.

20
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,620
You got it, huh?

21
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,520
You got it, you got it!

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,140
If you know, you're quiet!

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,440
You're full of thought.

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:55,740
Come with me!

25
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,840
To my beloved big brother!

26
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,180
Ryo-san!

27
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,920
Oh, Fujita-san!

28
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,540
Hello.

29
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:23,620
Hello.

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,920
Ryo-san, are you there?

31
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,640
I'm eating in the back.

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,280
Good.

33
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,240
It's getting warmer.

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,060
Ryo-san, open it for me.

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,640
What?

36
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,940
What do you mean, "people are eating"?

37
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,200
You're such a noisy guy.

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,740
Ryo-san, it's not the time to eat ramen.

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,320
I finally got it from America.

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,860
The picture of that beautiful woman with a gold medal.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,100
Is that true?

42
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,340
It's true.

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,060
And it's a real one.

44
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,480
Shut up!

45
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:53,660
It's huge.

46
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,940
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,240
All right. Show it to me.

48
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,560
What's this?

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,100
It's a jigsaw puzzle.

50
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,180
And it's 2000 pieces.

51
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,680
If you import it properly, it will be stopped by tax.

52
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,160
It's a jigsaw puzzle to break the law.

53
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,800
Anyway, let's assemble it quickly.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,780
I bought a panel.

55
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,640
You bought a table, didn't you?

56
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,460
I bought a table.

57
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,920
And a sitting desk.

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,000
Really?

59
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,200
Don't go there.

60
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,260
We don't want to be damaged when we're typing.

61
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,220
Hey, Ryo-san!

62
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,040
What are you doing?

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,400
Stop it.

64
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,860
We are busy, isn't it?

65
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,760
We are discussing the problem of the United States.

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,380
What are you talking about?

67
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,680
I need to make a phone call from my brother.

68
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:43,660
Your brother?

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,280
Yes.

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,120
Older brother.

71
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,620
Dad, Keiko's labor pain has started.

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,860
I'm trying to get her to come to the hospital, but she's not coming.

73
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,080
What is she doing at such an important time?

74
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,160
All right. I'll take her to the hospital. Don't worry.

75
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,560
See you.

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,760
What's wrong?

77
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,360
A baby is about to be born at Kinjirou's place.

78
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,140
Oh, is that so?

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,940
Then Ryo-chan will be an old man.

80
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,260
Well, I can finally have a baby or a baby.

81
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,020
My relatives were all old men and women.

82
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,580
It's good to be fresh.

83
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,860
A new life has been born.

84
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,060
Ryo-san, Ryo-san, hurry up.

85
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,000
What's wrong?

86
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,580
People are so impressed.

87
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,780
Hurry up.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,660
Look, Ryo-san.

89
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,280
The rest is almost done.

90
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,760
It's amazing, isn't it?

91
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,060
That's right.

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,280
It's empty to see this kind of figure objectively.

93
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,860
I feel like a human being.

94
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,940
What's wrong, Ryo-san?

95
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,340
No, no. I'll do it by myself.

96
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,900
As an old man, I don't want to show this kind of figure.

97
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,900
Oops. That's not the time to say that.

98
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,660
Loose?

99
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,280
But I can do the first edition.

100
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,300
What's that stupid woman doing?

101
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,580
Hey, I'm going to my parents' house.

102
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,060
I'll be back soon.

103
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,120
Wow, amazing.

104
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,180
It's done in one step.

105
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,240
What?

106
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,260
Which one?

107
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,480
This is...

108
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,860
Bang, bang, bang.

109
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,980
I'll help you.

110
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,960
I feel like I'm used to it.

111
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,080
What are you talking about?

112
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,120
Hurry up.

113
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,260
I see.

114
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,760
Then, the last two pieces.

115
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
It's done.

116
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,620
What?

117
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,960
Hey, you.

118
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,560
I knew it.

119
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,540
It's New Hampshire.

120
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,120
We're going to bring something special on this holy day.

121
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,860
It's like Loose.

122
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,040
Who's following him?

123
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,520
What are you doing, Kankichi?

124
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,200
What?

125
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,220
I came here to steal money.

126
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,620
Don't be stupid.

127
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,500
Where were you?

128
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,020
I was in the city.

129
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,840
You are a good husband.

130
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,340
What?

131
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,820
Why are you here?

132
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,460
I was wondering.

133
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,660
I heard that

134
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,280
a baby is about to be born in Kinjiro.

135
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,460
I want you to come.

136
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,640
What?

137
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:41,920
What?

138
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,900
It's hard.

139
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,660
I asked for your luggage.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,620
Are you going to the hospital?

141
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,820
I will send you to the hospital by car.

142
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,980
Oh!

143
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,140
You're so mean.

144
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,960
I'm not.

145
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,080
I'll be an old lady soon.

146
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,260
You don't want to be told, do you?

147
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,640
What?

148
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,780
I just said the truth.

149
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,380
Well, let's go.

150
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,940
Please get on the car.

151
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,420
I'll take you with me.

152
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,060
Do you have a labor pain already?

153
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,580
Yes.

154
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,760
You'll have labor pains a few more times.

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,660
The time period will be shorter and shorter.

156
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,720
Ah.

157
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,240
If you have labor pain again,

158
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,080
please call me.

159
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,420
Thank you.

160
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,240
Did you get a call from mom?

161
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,140
Yes, my brother called me

162
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,940
and told me she was coming.

163
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,720
That's good.

164
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,660
This.

165
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,600
Huh? An amulet?

166
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,160
It's an amulet that brought me happiness.

167
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,760
If you have it, you'll be able to give birth to a healthy baby.

168
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,720
Hey, what kind of happiness did you bring me?

169
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,800
It'll take you a long time to tell me.

170
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,160
Please, let me hear it.

171
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,540
Yeah, that was when I was in elementary school.

172
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,580
It's a tiger!

173
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,840
Go, go!

174
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,900
Did you get bullied?

175
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,940
Yes...

176
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,140
I'll help you, so stop crying.

177
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,980
You have to be stronger.

178
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,900
I'm weak at fighting, so I can't be bullied.

179
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,520
I can't be bullied.

180
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,300
I want to be stronger, but I'm weak.

181
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,900
You're against violence, aren't you?

182
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,400
Huh? But I'm telling you to be strong now.

183
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,920
Strength isn't just about power. It's about being strong enough to not be discouraged.

184
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,860
Animals win over strong creatures, but humans are different.

185
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,780
Humans can talk to each other, right?

186
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,380
Talking to each other is the most important thing.

187
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,540
What is your brother doing?

188
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,640
He's a lawyer.

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,520
A lawyer?

190
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,280
Yeah.

191
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,040
By talking to each other, he can help and protect people.

192
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,600
I see.

193
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,120
The person who appeared in the sunset had a very kind smile.

194
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,080
And that encounter decided my life.

195
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Here it comes!

196
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,200
Take this, you villains!

197
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,160
It's moving!

198
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,420
It's all over me!

199
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,220
I'm going to die!

200
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,460
It's a shootout!

201
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,920
You've turned into a stray dog with your 가장 rich personality!

202
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,640
That's enough!

203
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,280
Mom!

204
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,980
Can you come out and let me play some gunfire?

205
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:45,780
What?

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,640
The drug label has stepped into the enemy's hideout.

207
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,520
So it's an internal fight!

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,480
Mom!

209
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,840
Be careful!

210
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,660
Kinjiro hasn't been studying either, so we can't play together.

211
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,700
If you have been studying all this time, you're going to get a little sick.

212
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,900
That's right.

213
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,500
Idiot!

214
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,440
Then I'll go outside.

215
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,860
Hey, wait a minute.

216
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,500
Yes.

217
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,420
Put this orange box on the desk.

218
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,760
I have something to say.

219
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,920
It's a great environment.

220
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,540
I didn't know you were really studying outside.

221
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,760
Let's play together.

222
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,240
Play?

223
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,020
Eh? It's not a baby's thing.

224
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,320
Oh, I got it. I got it.

225
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm almost ready to eat.

226
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,680
Daddy, it's time for dinner.

227
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,520
Yes.

228
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,580
I feel a little uncomfortable.

229
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,560
Perfect.

230
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,040
Finally, you're a junior high school student.

231
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,700
You look shy.

232
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,300
You look a little like your brother.

233
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,100
Brother, when you become a junior high school student,

234
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,960
don't bully me anymore.

235
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,320
Of course. I'm already an adult.

236
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,640
That's good.

237
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,940
I'm glad.

238
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,160
I want to be a good brother.

239
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,480
So, your brother entered junior high school,

240
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,620
and what do you think happened to me?

241
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,640
As usual, Brother bullied me.

242
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,580
Ping pong!

243
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,500
What kindness of your brother.

244
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,960
Aah!

245
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,340
Are you sick?

246
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,000
Idiots are not sick.

247
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,160
What?

248
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,260
Not only that,

249
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,860
I wonder if this traffic jam will be solved.

250
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,620
Keiko-san, you must be feeling down.

251
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,640
I have no choice.

252
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,520
Nakagawa, let's do this.

253
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,840
Get in the alley there.

254
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,640
I can't do it in such a narrow place.

255
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,080
Leave it to me.

256
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,680
Senpai, it's dangerous.

257
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,760
Okay, I'll fly.

258
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,620
Senpai, please stop.

259
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,240
It's dangerous.

260
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,740
Nakagawa, let's go back.

261
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,540
What are you doing?

262
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,720
It's a shortcut.

263
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,460
You don't have to be so busy.

264
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,740
Stop it.

265
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,100
Wait.

266
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,620
My daughter is waiting for you.

267
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,820
I'm coming.

268
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,020
They are here.

269
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,800
What?

270
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,900
You want to attend the national junior high school?

271
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,320
I decided to attend the national junior high school.

272
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,280
I have a lot of knowledge about nationality.

273
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,980
I will become a lawyer in the future.

274
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,100
Are you stupid?

275
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,360
What will you do in the future?

276
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,480
You can't play only with the kids.

277
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,240
You can only think about playing.

278
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,960
It's fine. Anyone can work when they grow up.

279
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,360
I feel like you're playing even when you grow up.

280
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,260
What?

281
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,380
I can say that.

282
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,000
Thank you very much!

283
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,420
You're welcome, Kankichi.

284
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,400
But it'll cost transportation in the Bunkyoku area.

285
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,280
I'll be working part-time.

286
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,860
Hey!

287
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,680
Why don't you go to the same junior high school, Kinjirou?

288
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,620
Because...

289
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,560
You'll be in the same school as your brother!

290
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,640
That's the spirit of the brothers!

291
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,100
N-No way!

292
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,220
I can't!

293
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,820
Dad! Mom! Please!

294
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,780
Let me take the exam!

295
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,360
Please!

296
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,380
She's serious.

297
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,960
What are you going to do?

298
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,120
I don't know.

299
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,980
I think it's hard to get a national license.

300
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
But if you just take it...

301
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,380
Yay!

302
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,660
Thank you, Dad! Mom!

303
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,540
Well, compared to the stupid Kankichi,

304
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,460
Kinjirou is 100 times smarter.

305
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,020
Dad!

306
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,220
Try as hard as you can.

307
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,520
Sure!

308
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,260
You're so stubborn, Kinjirou.

309
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,420
I really wanted to be a lawyer.

310
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,780
Hey, do you know the Kappa's Tomin badge?

311
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,360
Yes.

312
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,300
I think if I show it,

313
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,320
on Tomin Day,

314
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,920
the public facilities and buses in Tokyo

315
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,960
will be able to use it for free.

316
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,900
Right.

317
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,220
Here it comes!

318
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,380
Here you go.

319
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,580
The Kappa's badge.

320
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,560
It's free.

321
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,680
I'm sorry, my country.

322
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,600
The Kappa's badge!

323
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:48,660
It's not fake like last year.

324
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,320
It's not fake like last year.

325
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,220
Do you remember?

326
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,120
Oh, no.

327
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,700
He's the same driver as last year.

328
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,520
It's so small in Tokyo.

329
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,060
But this year, it's real.

330
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,500
All right.

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,660
The Kappa's badge.

332
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,120
The Kappa's badge.

333
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,580
The Kappa's badge.

334
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,740
Now, let's get off at the 3rd station of Hongo

335
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,000
and switch to the 16th line.

336
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,980
We can play with this for a day.

337
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,320
The Kappa's badge.

338
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,700
Oh, what is it, Kankichi?

339
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,500
Is that the school of nationality?

340
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,800
Yes, it is.

341
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,160
So what about that?

342
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,720
Kinjiro will take the industrial school.

343
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,180
Oh!

344
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,300
Kinjiro take the school?

345
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,760
That's great!

346
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,020
He's really smart.

347
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,720
He can also do well in school.

348
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,500
But he's only taking the test

349
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,480
from 23 사람들 nicht becast eest Tokyo, right?

350
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,940
He'll fail, no doubt.

351
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,540
It's impossible.

352
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,020
Yeah, I don't think it works.

353
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,600
My brother keeps on getting in the way of my studies.

354
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,400
Finally, the day before the exam...

355
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,820
Kinjiro, are you still awake?

356
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm not in a state to sleep.

357
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,560
Stop it. You'll break my body.

358
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,780
Let go of me!

359
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,220
Ouch!

360
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,580
Tonight is the day before the exam!

361
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,960
You're worrying about your health!

362
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,900
Then leave me alone.

363
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,980
I'm in the way of my brother.

364
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,400
I understand.

365
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,960
Do as you please.

366
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,560
Where's my brother?

367
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,600
He went somewhere early in the morning.

368
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,140
He's hardly sleeping. Is he okay?

369
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,780
He's fine.

370
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,120
I'll be right back.

371
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,680
Okay.

372
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,500
You can do it.

373
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,260
Be careful.

374
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,180
Okay.

375
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,360
I've been studying hard, but I don't think I can do it.

376
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,780
You'll get a hangover with this.

377
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,940
Now, I'll sleep a little longer.

378
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,920
I'm nervous now.

379
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,940
An accident in the road.

380
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,840
What?

381
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,760
What?

382
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,360
It won't move.

383
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,460
It's a big deal.

384
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,040
It's a big deal.

385
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,600
It's a big deal.

386
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:22,640
It's a big deal.

387
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,140
It took a long time to get to the Ushima engine.

388
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,400
I hope I can catch up to the road.

389
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,020
What?

390
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,060
What?

391
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,620
What?

392
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,500
Kinjiro!

393
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,900
Brother!

394
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,840
The road was hit by an accident.

395
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,200
Get on the back!

396
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,300
What?

397
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,000
I don't know the way to school.

398
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,320
Okay, get on it.

399
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,260
Yeah.

400
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,980
I know the road to school.

401
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,660
What?

402
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,140
Why?

403
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,940
Hold on tight.

404
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,840
Go, get in!

405
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,580
What?

406
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,820
All right.

407
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,200
I'll be able to make it in time.

408
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,020
Good.

409
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,260
That's right.

410
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,440
"I have to check the exam report."

411
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:06,700
Did I get it?

412
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,300
The exam ticket!

413
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,880
Stop it, brother!

414
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,280
What?

415
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,740
The exam ticket flew away!

416
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,360
What?

417
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,660
It's in that place!

418
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,600
I can't take the exam without that.

419
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,040
I guess I have to wait until the end...

420
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,060
Brother!

421
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
Wait there, Kinjiro!

422
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,740
Brother!

423
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,900
He jumped in!

424
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,640
It's so cold, but he's a crazy junior high school student!

425
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Where is he?

426
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,560
He's not here!

427
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,440
Brother...

428
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,960
It's you, Matsu.

429
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,520
Brother...

430
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,660
Brother!

431
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,160
Brother...

432
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,240
Brother...!

433
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,460
Are you okay?

434
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,640
It was quite a kind of you!

435
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,500
Here, the exam ticket.

436
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,080
Don't lose it this time.

437
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,060
Okay...

438
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,920
Ca-thank you...

439
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,340
Ah...!

440
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:21,820
Brother!

441
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,860
Um...

442
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,820
Awicoped up the unpleasant plaques of yours?

443
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,960
Get on them now!

444
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,520
Yeah.

445
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,120
Oh, right.

446
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,280
Huh?

447
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,500
You're a little wet, aren't you?

448
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,080
The rites of the passing-method...

449
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,380
Kinjiro, be confident!

450
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,780
Nii-chan...

451
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,000
You'll get it for sure. I believe in you!

452
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,660
Nii-chan...

453
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,080
Idiot! You'll cry after you pass the test!

454
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,660
Okay!

455
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,980
Now, we're really going to be late. Get on!

456
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,900
Okay!

457
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,100
Thanks to you, I was able to pass the middle school test.

458
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,520
You're a good brother.

459
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,280
Yeah.

460
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,080
He was my brother who was always fighting, but he was the one who worried about me the most.

461
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,220
If you protect me with such a wonderful charm, I'm sure you'll be able to give birth to a healthy baby.

462
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm coming in!

463
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,020
Hey!

464
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,120
Oh, you're still here.

465
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:36,800
Nii-san.

466
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,500
I was just talking about Nii-san.

467
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,260
You were talking about my bad words again, weren't you?

468
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,160
Keiko-san, are you okay?

469
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,160
I'm sorry to have called you, Mother.

470
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,860
I was going on a trip, so I was late.

471
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,680
Well, I'm fine now that Mother is here.

472
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,560
Father, thank you very much.

473
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,020
Hmm?

474
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,960
What's that? Isn't that a charm for passing the exam?

475
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,420
A charm for passing the exam.

476
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,200
This is it.

477
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,420
Isn't this a charm for passing the exam?

478
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,440
You're like a

479
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,860
I'm fine, brother.

480
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,600
I'm going to give birth with both of them.

481
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,380
Is that so?

482
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,280
Thank you, brother.

483
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,440
I'm sorry.

484
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,400
I think it started again.

485
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,320
Kenjiro!

486
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:31,860
Yeah.

487
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,820
I'll call the teacher.

488
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,700
Keiko-san.

489
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,880
Be good, okay?

490
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,640
Yes.

491
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,700
Why are you late?

492
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,200
It is because they are lessons.

493
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,200
Mr. Kenjiro!

494
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,120
Oh, dear mother and father.

495
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,500
Sorry to bother you.

496
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,960
Mr. Kenjiro.

497
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,920
Is Keiko?

498
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,720
Yes.

499
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,760
I think it's about to be.

500
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,980
I haven't seen you for a long time.

501
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,080
I've beenstocking for you.

502
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,140
I'm here.

503
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,660
Oh, you're born!

504
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,580
I'm finally born.

505
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,080
That's good.

506
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,640
Gangop, are you a boy or a girl?

507
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,620
I'm a girl.

508
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,120
What? A girl?

509
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,580
What's wrong, Dad? You're fine, so it doesn't matter if you're a boy or a girl.

510
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,760
Well, you see, girls are like their fathers.

511
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,240
They're like their fathers.

512
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,940
Like their fathers.

513
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,060
What's wrong, Brother?

514
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,880
You're a cute baby to your mother.

515
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,240
Is that so?

516
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,920
I'm so glad, Kinjiro.

517
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,720
Hooray!

518
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:47,960
Hooray!

519
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,380
Hooray!

520
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,940
Hooray!

521
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,260
Hooray!

522
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,960
Kinjiro, I'm glad you're growing up well.

523
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,040
Kan-chan!

524
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,080
Hey, everyone in the town hall!

525
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,900
I heard from Gin that you're a girl!

526
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,240
Yeah!

527
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,840
You must be happy, too, right?

528
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,360
I brought you some alcohol, so you should come and celebrate here!

529
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,680
Oh, that's great!

530
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,440
Hooray!

531
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,420
Hooray!

532
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,560
Hooray!

533
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,040
Hooray!

534
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,280
Hooray!

535
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:32,800
Hooray!

536
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:32,880
Hooray!

537
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,020
Go for it!

538
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,620
She's happy!

539
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,080
He's still excited at the garden.

540
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,560
Oh, I can't believe there are so many blessings here.

541
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,580
This girl is really happy.

542
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,540
You're such a good character, aren't you, O-Mamori?

543
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,160
I am.

544
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,060
Yeah, that's right.

545
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,620
Yay! Yay! Yay!

546
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,540
Yay! Yay! Yay!

547
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,140
I want to be happy! I want to be happy!

548
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,720
I want to be happy!

549
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,860
I want to be happy!

550
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,500
I want to be happy!

551
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,720
I want to be happy!

552
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,060
I want to be happy!

553
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:44,000
I want to be happy!

554
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:58,100
Yay! Yay!

555
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,380
I want to be happy!

556
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,100
Look at that corner

557
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,060
You can meet everyone

558
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,960
There is a turtle

559
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,480
It must be a turtle
