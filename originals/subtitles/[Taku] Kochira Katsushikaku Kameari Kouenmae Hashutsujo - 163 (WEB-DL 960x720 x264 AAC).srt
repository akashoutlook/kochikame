Make money with anime

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,480
Oh, I'm excited!

30
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,440
My Robodeca is in the lead!

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,360
Senpai's manga is still being serialized?

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,220
Who reads this kind of thing?

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,900
Well, you can understand my manga's wonderfulness

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,840
Ryoji's husband is in trouble!

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,220
What?

36
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,980
The TV anime is decided?

37
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,380
Yes, Ryusei-san from the weekly survival magazine said

38
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,200
Oh, I did it!

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,540
Finally, this day has come!

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,760
Is the anime so great?

41
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,900
Of course!

42
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,180
I'm not a child!

43
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,000
The TV has 10% of viewers

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
About 10 million people

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,240
20% of viewers are 20 million people

46
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,280
The popularity is increasing by a lot

47
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,780
Then, of course, the original comic book will also be sold

48
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,700
Sold, sold, sold

49
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,940
Related products are also released one after another

50
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,280
And this will also be sold more and more

51
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,740
The popularity of the original author is also rising

52
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,580
The TV and the public will be pulled together!

53
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,680
With their pay and appearance fee,

54
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,920
I can get a lot of money!

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,700
Hello

56
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,040
Nana-chan

57
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,560
I just heard from Honda-san

58
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,840
Congratulations, Nana-chan

59
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,300
Congratulations

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,380
Yes, thank you

61
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
Hey, what's so happy?

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,220
Eh?

63
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,060
Because it will be animated, right?

64
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,120
Nana-chan's menu

65
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:11,760
Eh?

66
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,720
Isn't it my Robodeca monitor?

67
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,340
I don't like it, senpai

68
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,540
You didn't even say a word

69
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,360
The reason for the animation is

70
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,260
Nana-chan's pen name "Ai no Miko"

71
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,280
This menu

72
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,400
No way!

73
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,060
Makoto-kun, Ai-chan

74
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,980
Makoto-kun, Ai-chan

75
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,600
Makoto-kun, Ai-chan

76
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,320
Makoto-kun, Ai-chan

77
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,960
Makoto-kun, Ai-chan

78
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,840
This is a repetition

79
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,960
I don't know what's interesting

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,180
Senpai, I'm sorry to Nana-chan

81
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,360
That's right

82
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,920
It's terrible

83
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,840
It's not interesting if it's not interesting

84
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,920
I don't know how to make this into an animation

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,960
If I make it into an animation, I'll make this Robodeca monitor first

86
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,300
What are you saying?

87
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,040
Menuet is 100 million times more interesting than Ryo-chan's manga

88
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,560
What?

89
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,740
Where is this manga?

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,180
First of all, the picture is more beautiful than Ryo-chan's

91
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,440
Eh?

92
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,500
Besides, the story is interesting

93
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,340
No matter what you say, a girl's subtle psychological description is good, isn't it?

94
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,880
I don't need such a thing

95
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,740
But, what is necessary for an animated work is impact and power

96
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,900
And...

97
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,500
It's a man's romance

98
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,220
"Weekly Sapphire" is a magazine read by a girl

99
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,440
You don't need a man's romance

100
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,180
It's strange that Senpai's manga is serialized

101
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,160
It seems that it's going to be noisy if it's cut off

102
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,460
It seems that it's going to be noisy if it's cut off

103
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,040
Shut up! What do you know about the amateur?

104
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,100
Most readers are amateurs

105
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,240
My manga is a masterpiece that will remain in the future

106
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,120
It's not like a manga like Menuet

107
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,940
My manga was seen like that by men

108
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,000
That's not true

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,300
Even a man's me is very interesting

110
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,540
Nana-chan, this is the story of a manga artist that will never be animated, so don't worry

111
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,280
That's right, Nana-chan

112
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,860
Is that so?

113
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
Oh, no, I have to go now

114
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,500
Is it already that time?

115
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,460
What? Are you going somewhere?

116
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,520
I'm interviewing for a film

117
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,200
The first episode of the anime "Menuet" will be filmed today

118
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm going to have a special visit

119
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,740
What? Take me with you

120
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,520
As a colleague's writer, I have a duty to see what kind of anime it will be

121
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,860
"Menuet" is a signboard work of "Weekly Sapphire"

122
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,280
You were making a lot of trouble until a while ago

123
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,080
Oh, this is the recording studio

124
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,740
A recording studio, huh?

125
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,580
Huh?

126
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,800
What are these guys?

127
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,580
Good morning

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,120
Good morning

129
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,000
They are the fans of the voice actor

130
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,360
It's very popular to be chasing after them

131
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,480
Um, here is the "Weekly Sapphire" Ryu-senshi

132
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,880
Hi, Miko

133
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,080
Everyone, I'm Miko Ai, the original author of "Menuet"

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,120
Good morning

135
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,280
Good morning

136
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,540
Miko, come here

137
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,520
Excuse me

138
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,800
Excuse me

139
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,220
Hey, Ryu-senshi, I'm here

140
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,460
Ryo-san

141
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,660
Why are you here?

142
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,460
Hey, if "Menuet" is going to be made into an anime,

143
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,980
Of course, my "Robo-Deka" is going to be made into an anime

144
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,920
Of course, it is

145
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
Think about it

146
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,640
If not, you should go to sell it

147
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,200
Don't be so rude

148
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,580
Stop it, you should give up

149
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,220
Makoto-kun

150
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,160
What? What's with this voice?

151
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,340
Mika, wait a moment

152
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,900
Makoto-kun!

153
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,680
You are the famous voice actor, Hanazono Sachi-san, right?

154
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,240
Yes, I also imagined it, so I gave you one vote when I auditioned

155
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,800
It's perfect for the voice of love

156
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,300
I'm so happy

157
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,980
No way, you are not an anime otaku

158
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,160
The first half of the pre-recording is over, so let's go inside

159
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,400
Miko, let's take a picture with the voice actor

160
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,420
Yes

161
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,640
This is the "Weekly Sapphire" interview

162
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,720
Everyone, please take care of me

163
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,340
Thank you

164
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,160
I'm the voice of Hanazono, who plays the role of Ai, and Kanzaki, who plays the role of Makoto

165
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,240
Nice to meet you, I'm Miko, who plays the role of Ai

166
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,440
Wow, Kanzaki is a great actor

167
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,520
And also, I'm the voice of Megumi Kihara, who plays the role of Kobori, and Sasa Shigeru, who plays the role of Tange

168
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,180
I'm so happy

169
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,040
Finally, you are coming out, Honda

170
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,060
Miko, the director told me that you should try to say the line "To the girl"

171
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,120
What?

172
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,200
Your voice is very unique

173
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,100
If you can do that with the gravure, I'm sure the fans will be happy

174
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,560
Is that really okay?

175
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,020
Yes, please

176
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,560
I'm so happy

177
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,680
I've always admired you

178
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,140
No way, I can't believe you're joining us

179
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,180
I'm usually the voice of anime, so it's just like that

180
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,620
I'm so happy to be able to shoot a video with a DVD

181
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,420
You're always so happy

182
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:07,260
Makoto

183
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,980
Ai

184
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,120
Makoto

185
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,460
Ai

186
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,060
Makoto

187
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,620
Ai

188
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,020
Ai

189
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,720
They were two people who were swayed by the feeling of love

190
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
Wonderful

191
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,840
It's really a wonderful work

192
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,300
Thank you, director

193
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,200
I'll be in your care from now on

194
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,400
Thank you

195
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,640
That editor is so exaggerated

196
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,460
What?

197
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,300
What's wrong, Honda?

198
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,960
It's really good

199
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,620
The atmosphere of the original work is perfectly reproduced

200
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,660
It's the best masterpiece of the girl's anime

201
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,340
Really?

202
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,340
It's amazing

203
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,520
My manga became such a wonderful anime

204
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,820
You can travel to Europe with peace of mind

205
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,620
Yes

206
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,320
Europe?

207
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,740
The second part of Menuet will be set in Europe

208
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,980
It's a travel for that purpose

209
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,820
With the help of Ryusenshi and the assistants,

210
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,800
I'm planning to travel to Europe with the help of the assistants

211
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,560
I see

212
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,320
I haven't seen you in a while

213
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,260
It's been 5 years

214
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,960
Then let's get ready to go

215
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,660
Hmm?

216
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
I think they are

217
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,580
Do you know each other?

218
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,980
Yes, he is the father of the stone-stone toy that made my one-in-one figure

219
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,580
Hey

220
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,760
Mr. Ryotsu

221
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,720
What's wrong? You look so gloomy

222
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:37,840
Why?

223
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,100
That's because...

224
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,400
It's not in the show

225
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,760
What?

226
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,720
My toy isn't in the show

227
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,240
Not even one part of it

228
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,120
Oh, your company is also a sponsor of this show

229
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,440
Yes

230
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,320
So I asked them to make a character goods and put it on the show

231
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,060
They didn't listen to me at all

232
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,820
So what kind of toy did you make?

233
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,180
It's this

234
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,820
It's the transformation tambourine set of love

235
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,680
Hey, you!

236
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,420
Menuet is a pure love

237
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,540
and the main character, Kisaragi Ai, is a normal high school girl

238
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,960
Why do you have to transform?

239
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,800
Actually, I'm thinking of a transformation pose

240
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,820
You...

241
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,280
Yes

242
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,540
Tou!

243
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,640
Paranri Parenra!

244
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,900
Baterenren!

245
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,440
Kuru Kuru Miracle!

246
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,620
Lovely Change!

247
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,540
I wanted to use this for the main character, Kisaragi Ai

248
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,480
It can't be used!

249
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,900
But it's not in the show

250
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,560
Ryoichi, can you convince the staff to make it into an anime?

251
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,100
Don't be so rude

252
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,240
If you can do something, I'll give you a good reward

253
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,880
Reward?

254
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,440
Well, I'm a writer who has a series called "Weekly Sapphire"

255
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,560
I can talk to you

256
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,440
Really?

257
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,980
In return, I'll give you a 50% profit as a royalty

258
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,460
50%?

259
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,320
That's a fine

260
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,380
If you don't want it, it's fine

261
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm the only one who can convince Miko Ai and the staff

262
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,820
What should we do?

263
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,880
There's no other choice but to accept it

264
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,000
It's a necessary expense considering the cost of advertising

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,920
I understand, Ryoichi

266
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,780
Thank you for your cooperation

267
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,120
Leave everything to me

268
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,160
While Ryusenshi and Nana are in Europe

269
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,060
I think we can make a profit

270
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,740
Huh?

271
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,280
You're the agent for Ai?

272
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,460
Yes, I want to meet the staff of the anime

273
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,060
Thank you for waiting

274
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,320
I'm the director's wife

275
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,600
Actually...

276
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,560
I'm producer Matsuyama

277
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,120
I'm series director Yamagishi

278
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,140
I'm the director of the series

279
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,600
I'm the director of the games

280
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:04,660
I'm the manager of the family

281
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,020
It's Shibayama

282
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,480
I'm the director of the movies

283
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:07,900
I'm Kiyokawa

284
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,420
I'm the director of the film

285
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,240
I'm we're...

286
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,460
Hey!

287
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,700
Why are there so many directors?

288
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,340
Who's in charge?

289
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,780
Well, I'm the primary director

290
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,120
Then, other directors don't have names

291
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:31,140
In the case of anime, theaina is a dreamer

292
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,220
There are 47 people in charge of the main party.

293
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,920
Are you guys a middle school?

294
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,880
Leave the main party 5 or 6 people, and then you can go home.

295
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,060
Actually, today we came to tell you the hope of the original author.

296
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,660
You want me to put on that tambourine?

297
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,700
That's right!

298
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,760
With this tambourine, the main character Kisaragi Ai will transform.

299
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,040
You see, this is the transformation pose.

300
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,080
Transform? To what?

301
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,160
I've been told to do it as the original, but this is the first time I've received such a complaint from the original author.

302
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,760
The teacher hopes for originality as an anime.

303
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,600
However, if you put on something like that, the world view of the original will be destroyed.

304
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,500
That's not true.

305
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,420
It's the only way to show off your skills as an anime professional.

306
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,460
If you don't put it on, the anime will be canceled immediately.

307
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,040
Oh, that's a problem.

308
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,900
The production is already in progress.

309
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,620
From the second episode, Kisaragi Ai will transform with a transformation tambourine set.

310
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,460
This will be decided.

311
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,060
Good?

312
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,540
Oh, oh.

313
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,140
This tambourine... I know it!

314
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,760
I think it's like this...

315
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,960
Paranni, paranna, batteletti!

316
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,680
Zubuzubu, zubuzubu, dazzling change!

317
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,820
This is...

318
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:24,940
What is this...

319
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,240
Kisaragi Ai has transformed!

320
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,460
Into a beautiful warrior!

321
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,720
Oh, I just finished watching the second episode!

322
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,040
Thank you for your request.

323
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,060
Thank you very much.

324
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,560
Our teacher has decided to write the book which was decided by our teacher.

325
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,260
By Mr. Sheik, the teacher of the class.

326
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,020
Hmm, hmm...

327
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,980
So today.

328
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,520
I brought something like this today.

329
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,620
Hm?

330
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,340
It's a puffy toyoppy!

331
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,440
I thought I could use it in the program.

332
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,700
Oh.

333
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,760
The rules are as usual.

334
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,440
Hmm. Leave everything to me.

335
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,000
Thank you very much!

336
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,220
Um...

337
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,460
I heard that there is a representative of Aino-sensei here.

338
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,340
Me?

339
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,180
Are you Mr. Ryochi?

340
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,400
Nice to meet you, I'm something like this.

341
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,040
I thought that we could use our products in the menu.

342
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,000
In other words, you want to be a sponsor?

343
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,000
All right! I'll take care of it!

344
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,140
Ehh?

345
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,760
You want to get the mascot from the next number?

346
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,200
That's right!

347
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,940
The happy companions of Kisaragi Ai, Puppi and Yappi!

348
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,680
Even if it's the original teacher's wish...

349
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,000
The content has already been uploaded and we are working on the drawing.

350
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,540
It's okay.

351
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,320
Cut 282.

352
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,780
If you add 3 cuts from 32, it will be something.

353
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,500
No way!

354
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,080
Besides, there is no chance of it coming out.

355
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,320
Oh, that's right!

356
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,520
I forgot to say that.

357
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,180
Actually, there will be a new sponsor this time.

358
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,320
This is it!

359
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,180
Oh!

360
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,140
Ochazuke!

361
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,080
Ah!

362
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,260
Ugh!

363
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,580
No!

364
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,620
I can't win like this!

365
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,400
I'm not going!

366
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:19,960
It's over!

367
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,200
Puppi and Yappi!

368
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,760
I brought the Ochazuke of love!

369
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,940
Eat this and you'll be more powerful!

370
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,060
Yeah.

371
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,280
I got it!

372
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,800
Puppi and Yappi!

373
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,720
It's full of vitamin, mineral and calcium!

374
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,540
Eat Ochazuke and get more power!

375
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,320
Eat the Ochazuke of love and you'll be 3 times stronger!

376
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,320
Wow!

377
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,500
So good!

378
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,000
Senpai!

379
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,020
The mayonnaise in the anime is a bit weird.

380
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,000
The love suddenly changes...

381
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,480
There are no original characters in the original film.

382
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,060
I knew it.

383
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,500
It seems that my fear has finally come true.

384
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,500
Fear?

385
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,580
I use all means to increase the viewing rate of TV.

386
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,560
I don't think it's bad enough to make a character that is not in the original film.

387
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,840
What should I say to Nana-chan on a trip?

388
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,880
I'm the lawyer, Ryo-san.

389
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,040
It's me.

390
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,760
I'll talk about it.

391
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,180
Please be quiet.

392
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,700
He may be in shock and fall.

393
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,120
I'll tell you the story here.

394
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,880
No, no, no, no.

395
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,740
I have to make the product more effective.

396
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,920
I can't stand it anymore.

397
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,900
Subliminal.

398
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,540
But Menuet is a devil.

399
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,140
He's a lover.

400
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,260
I can't be in love with Makoto anymore.

401
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,600
That's right.

402
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,480
I have the same idea.

403
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,040
So, Makoto will be brainwashed by the enemy and will fight Ai.

404
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,100
With this giant robot.

405
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,140
What?

406
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,940
Editor-in-chief, I'm back.

407
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,040
Thank you.

408
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,720
Where is Miko Ai?

409
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,560
She will stay in Europe for a while.

410
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,800
I have a lot of fan letters for Miko.

411
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,220
What is this?

412
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,480
Editor-in-chief!

413
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,160
Have you seen the MENUET of the anime recently?

414
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,960
No. I was busy with something.

415
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,100
I wonder if something happened.

416
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,000
There are a lot of complaints.

417
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,400
What?

418
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,160
A white box has been sent for next week's broadcast.

419
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,820
Let's check it!

420
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,220
However, as long as you see episode 1, it's faithful to the original.

421
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,280
A result of a Sudden Death, Ai is killed.

422
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,420
Aoki Gahara is buried in blood.

423
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,920
What is this?

424
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,060
What's going on?

425
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,820
A.I. Kisaragi, this is the end.

426
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,380
Ryu-senshu, I think this is a different anime video.

427
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,700
But now, I think A.I. Kisaragi and...

428
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,420
Makoto-kun, why? Why?

429
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,260
After all, we were destined not to be connected.

430
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,100
Oh, what was that line?

431
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,580
It's the line from the original comic book, volume 4, page 22.

432
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,200
Then, this is Menuet after all!

433
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,140
Yes!

434
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,640
Sisters, how did you get here?

435
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,340
If there's a Menuet disaster on this Miyamura bicycle,

436
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,760
no matter how bad the road is, it'll be a disaster.

437
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,480
Tootie and Yankie are here too!

438
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,980
A.I. and Tootie too!

439
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,660
A.I. I've brought you the new sake of A.I.

440
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,240
A.I. I've brought you the new sake of A.I.

441
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,840
Only this is enough to give you 10x more power!

442
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,680
Thank you, Tootie, Yankie, Tootie!

443
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,620
The flavor of the sake is the best!

444
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,280
Now we're up to speed!

445
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,340
Yes, I'll transform into two!

446
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,360
Got it.

447
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,740
Channel K!

448
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,240
Transform into two!

449
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,960
Menuet Super RS!

450
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,040
Spark!

451
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,160
All five of us!

452
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,880
Super RS Challenge!

453
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,200
The new Spark version!

454
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,840
Our costumes are on sale at the department store children's clothing store!

455
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,100
Buy the figures too!

456
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,460
Menuet machine!

457
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,120
Let's go, everyone!

458
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,860
OK!

459
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,140
Excellent formation!

460
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,940
Jump! Jump!

461
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,000
Menuet Robo!

462
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,480
On sale now!

463
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,840
Price 10,980 yen!

464
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,620
My mecha will be on sale soon!

465
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,080
Makoto...

466
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,500
Even so...

467
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,580
Even so, I love you!

468
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,420
I'll always...

469
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,300
I'll always be waiting for you!

470
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,440
This is no longer Menuet!

471
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,860
Please, please...

472
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,080
I'll be right out!

473
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,480
Damn!

474
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,760
The editing team...

475
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,280
They killed the bullet!

476
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,340
What do you mean, Mr. Ryotsu?

477
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,160
We made it as you said!

478
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,740
Why are you doing this to me?

479
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,060
This time frame...

480
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,400
The next anime is not decided!

481
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,540
Shut up!

482
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,360
Don't worry!

483
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,080
I'll prepare the next work!

484
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,000
Just like Menuet...

485
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,420
It's a super popular manga serialized in the weekly Sapphire!

486
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,540
From next week...

487
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,840
We'll broadcast this!

488
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,180
That manga is...

489
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,000
Of course!

490
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,300
"Robo-Deka Bancho"!

491
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,380
"Robo-Deka Bancho"!

492
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:55,440
"Robo-Deka Bancho"!

493
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,760
"Robo-Deka Bancho"!

494
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,860
It's a great picture!

495
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,840
I animated my own touch.

496
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:03,820
"Robo-Deka Bancho"

497
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,320
"Robo-Deka Bancho"

498
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,660
Robo-Deka Banchi!

499
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,680
What's that voice?

500
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,680
Gahaha!

501
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,960
Surprised!

502
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,840
I'm singing the theme song!

503
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,340
By the way, I'm the voice of the lead.

504
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,520
Eh?

505
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,580
But...

506
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,460
I didn't expect your manga to be animated.

507
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,540
What happened to Menuet?

508
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,720
He was fired from the editorial department.

509
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,660
What?

510
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,580
It's okay, it's okay.

511
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,080
He's not the real Menuet.

512
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,780
Even though he said that, he bought related products.

513
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,780
It's a sad difference.

514
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,820
After all, an anime like Menuet is not unique.

515
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,640
It was destined to be fired.

516
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,620
Well, look at my unique "Robo-Deka Bancho"!

517
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,260
Go!

518
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:44,320
Go!

519
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,320
Robo-Deka!

520
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:45,840
Go!

521
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,680
Go!

522
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:49,780
Go!

523
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,800
It is indeed a unique anime.

524
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,800
Isn't it too unique?

525
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,980
That's right, that's right!

526
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,200
The center of the anime world this year is Robo-Deka Bancho!

527
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,020
It certainly became a hot topic.

528
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,580
The viewing rate is too low to measure.

529
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,340
It updated the shortest record in just a week.

530
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,500
Product sales: zero.

531
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,540
Popularity survey: zero.

532
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,820
All minimum records: updated.

533
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,340
Hey, Mr. Ryo.

534
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,000
What's wrong with you guys?

535
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,380
What's going on?

536
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,680
When Robo-Deka Bancho was starting,

537
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,180
you had a contract to give 50% of the profit, right?

538
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,240
Th-that's true.

539
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,120
Robo-Deka Bancho's product was a large amount of red paper.

540
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,940
We're here to collect 50% of the red paper.

541
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,440
You're all stupid!

542
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,520
That's what we were talking about!

543
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,020
If this is the case, you're also stupid!

544
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,120
You're not an idiot.

545
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,720
We're here to collect 50% of the red paper.

546
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,540
We're here to make you pay!

547
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:45,620
Come on!

548
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,380
Come on!

549
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,340
Come on!

550
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,360
Come on!
