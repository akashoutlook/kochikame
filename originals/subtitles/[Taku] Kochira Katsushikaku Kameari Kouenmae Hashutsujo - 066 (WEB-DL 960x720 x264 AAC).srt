1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,020
Baby Yumi

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:15,640
Lash on a nude that floats in the river

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:23,920
After kicking up a love stone, it goes up to the feet

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:32,520
I wonder if I should go to the gym that I used to do

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,040
I was laughed at as it was

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,500
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,900
Katsushika Kameari

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,740
The cityscape that doesn't change even one yawn

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,920
It's strangely gentle

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,400
From the water fountain of Tongari-boshi

11
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,120
The sunset falls to the Kaishakuten

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,420
Tomorrow will end like this

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,940
Katsushika and Shibamata

14
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,440
I'm happy again

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,460
I'm going to cry

16
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,480
I realized

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,420
Because I'm an idiot

18
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,100
I don't know how to end this

19
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,800
I was happy

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,320
But I can't get past it

21
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,740
I everyone watched me

22
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,580
Like a rager

23
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,440
My friends will have to come here

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,280
Hold me

25
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,560
Should I be an adultrains

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,900
I don't understand

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,260
I don't understand

28
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,920
That's why here is also I am running around

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,080
You said it was briskly, didn't you think you were already sober?

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,280
Oh, we're almost done this year.

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,120
Oh, shabu shabu shabu shabu.

32
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,520
Good work!

33
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,100
Ryo-sama, please go home.

34
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,060
That was perfect. Let's all eat Toshikoshi Soba.

35
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,320
Oh, I've been waiting.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Nakagawa, let's eat Toshikoshi Soba.

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,660
Yes.

38
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,340
Itadakimasu!

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
Oh, that old man is really good.

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,820
That's Tanaka-san.

41
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,860
I think I'll be able to get old this year, too.

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,100
Ryo-sama, what will you be doing this New Year?

43
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,360
Every year, the new year party is held at the chief's house.

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,820
I'm going to be there for a year.

45
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,480
The new year party is canceled.

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,960
What did you say?

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,700
The chief is going to the hot spring until the third day of the new year.

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,300
I went there yesterday.

49
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,440
Damn it! You ran away!

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,000
Next year, you won't be able to get a year's worth of nutrition.

51
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,160
You're going to keep it from me!

52
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,140
The New Year without Ryo-sama is the best!

53
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,320
The New Year without Ryo-sama is the best!

54
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,540
It's the best New Year with no Ryosu!

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,360
I'm going to be great!

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,880
Hey, chief!

57
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,960
Don't you think you're the only one who wants to have a good idea?

58
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,260
Don't you think you're the only one who wants to have a good idea?

59
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,160
Don't you think you're the only one who wants to have a good idea?

60
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,660
Where did he go to the hot spring?

61
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,380
I think he said Nikko.

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,300
Okay, I'm going to look for Nikko's inn to destroy it!

63
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,320
N...Nyu...

64
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,940
Senpai, don't imitate me!

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,320
Hey, get away, Nakagawa!

66
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,140
Our kintons and katsunoko have been turned into a travel item.

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,960
How can I forgive you?

68
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,220
If you act like that to your subordinates,

69
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,840
I'll let the chief know what will happen.

70
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,100
Let go!

71
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,720
Ryo!

72
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,860
If you don't mind, can you come to my house?

73
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,540
What? You have a new year party at Maria's house?

74
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,840
Yes.

75
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,700
It's a new year party for the new year,

76
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,320
which will be held at my father's dojo.

77
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,920
If you don't mind.

78
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,020
Really?

79
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,220
Yes.

80
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,780
My mother is a cooking researcher,

81
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,920
so I think you'll like it.

82
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,820
Oh, you're talking about Kyoko.

83
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,360
Would you like to join us?

84
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,480
Are we allowed to join?

85
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,320
Yes.

86
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,560
Can I join you?

87
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,560
I thought there was a new year party at the chief's house,

88
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,880
so I couldn't make plans for the New Year.

89
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,520
Oh, me too.

90
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,600
Okay, let's go.

91
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,600
Tomorrow's new year party will be at my father's dojo.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,720
Let's have a feast!

93
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,940
So, I'm getting ready to join you.

94
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,760
Okay.

95
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,080
Then, don't forget to invite me to a new year party.

96
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,640
which will be held at Kyoko's home.

97
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,220
I have a new year party plan?

98
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,240
Hyosuke, you'll be joining me.

99
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,120
Yes, I have a new year party.

100
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,900
I'm ready to join the new year party at vale of peoples.

101
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:10,920
I will soon join the new year party.

102
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,300
That's great!

103
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,360
You'll starve to death if you don't climb up there.

104
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,780
What's going on with these pillars?

105
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,040
There are 1,990.

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,860
Yes, I think you can train yourself with just climbing up.

107
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,600
It's pavement.

108
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,340
There's a barracks. It's really not safe.

109
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,840
Hey, hey!

110
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,160
Are you okay?

111
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,780
But it's...

112
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm thirsty.

113
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,800
They're all drunk and asleep.

114
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,640
What kind of camp are they in?

115
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,840
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,820
It's the Hondara Constitution.

117
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,620
Ush! Ush! Ush! Ush!

118
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,040
What?

119
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,480
They're all doing a good job.

120
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,580
Ush! Ush! Ush! Ush!

121
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,300
You're the iron coach!

122
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,060
You're back!

123
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,480
I'm the iron coach!

124
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,520
I'm the iron ripper!

125
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,260
You're always so persistent.

126
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,320
I'm not the iron coach!

127
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,020
I'm Ryo Tsukankichi!

128
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,080
What?

129
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,460
What do you mean?

130
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,220
Get ready!

131
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:36,860
Ouch!

132
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,280
Uwa!

133
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,620
Maria!

134
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,180
I won't forgive anyone who does violence to Ryo!

135
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,780
Yaw!

136
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,740
You're not doing it right!

137
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
Yaw!

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,680
Ush!

139
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,120
Ush!

140
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,880
Ouch!

141
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,520
Ouch!

142
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,720
Now, who's next?

143
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,900
Chief, this woman is quite good.

144
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,860
It doesn't matter.

145
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,120
We'll all get on the same side and get our asses kicked!

146
00:06:59,220 --> 00:06:59,920
Let's go!

147
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,420
Yeah!

148
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,220
Chief!

149
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,340
Chief!

150
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,060
No matter how many times you get on my back,

151
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,660
I'll get you!

152
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,940
I'm not the one who can win!

153
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm not the one who can win!

154
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,080
You're so bold, ero-gappa!

155
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,200
She's not a woman.

156
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,920
She's a woman.

157
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,580
She's a woman.

158
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,540
But she's the son of my daughter, Asato Ai!

159
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,060
She's the son of my daughter, Asato Ai!

160
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,460
What?!

161
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,760
This is the master's daughter, Ai?!

162
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,120
She became a woman in less than a year.

163
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,280
What a stupid woman.

164
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,320
What a stupid woman.

165
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,600
What a stupid woman.

166
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,240
Is that really Ai?

167
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,940
I can't believe it.

168
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,000
She's so beautiful.

169
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,740
Even if she's a stupid son,

170
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,820
I'm glad she's back to her father.

171
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,960
No, Chief.

172
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,860
I invited everyone to the New Year party.

173
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,880
What?

174
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,680
That's right, Ban-chan.

175
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,660
I'm here to eat some simple food.

176
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,460
You're here to eat some simple food?

177
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,840
You idiot!

178
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,580
I won't let you get away!

179
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,560
Chief!

180
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,340
Chief!

181
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,660
Are you okay?!

182
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,660
You guys!

183
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Leave Ai alone and go home!

184
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,640
This is not a party!

185
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,140
Please, Dad.

186
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,760
I came all the way here.

187
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,020
Please don't do anything bad.

188
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
I'm so sorry.

189
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,200
I'm so sorry.

190
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,800
Wait.

191
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
If you think about it,

192
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,260
you're my son, aren't you?

193
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,460
Please, Dad.

194
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,940
P-Papa?

195
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,100
You're so mean to me.

196
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,380
I'm so sorry.

197
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,480
Stop it!

198
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,340
I'll forgive you.

199
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,180
Really?

200
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:42,960
Dad?

201
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,960
Instead of making you come to the New Year party,

202
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,760
I'll treat you like other monks.

203
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,060
Okay?

204
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,140
What?!

205
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,680
Damn it!

206
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,780
Why do you wear this mask

207
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,160
to learn all these things?

208
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,480
I just want to eat your food!

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,160
It's like we're in a camp.

210
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,580
I wish we could have the New Year party at the Chief's house.

211
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,260
I should have changed.

212
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,040
You changed?

213
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,360
Let's start training right away.

214
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,020
First of all,

215
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,080
you will run up and down the platform 30 times.

216
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,880
What?

217
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,940
After that, you will jump up and down the platform one more time.

218
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,140
No way!

219
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,560
No problem!

220
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,940
Let's go!

221
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,940
It's impossible to run up and down the platform 30 times like this.

222
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,880
I can't do it anymore.

223
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,260
Senior, it's too hard to get to the table.

224
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,680
I feel like I was tricked by Maria.

225
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,680
Everyone, you don't have to go down.

226
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,700
What?

227
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,600
What do you mean?

228
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,020
That's fine.

229
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,660
20 times 28, 20 times 9, 30 times.

230
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,420
If you use the first step three times, you will be back.

231
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,960
Is that possible?

232
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,660
What do you mean?

233
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,040
It's the Hondara sword.

234
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,080
Then, what's the meaning of the rabbit jump?

235
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,160
You haven't trained at all.

236
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,140
It's the Hondara sword.

237
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,020
Ouch!

238
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,920
My leg is full of beans.

239
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,860
Damn it, Hondara.

240
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,860
You're imitating Ikkyu-san.

241
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,880
Did you call me?

242
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,040
I'm here.

243
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,220
Elgappa, you're a liar.

244
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,860
If you're frustrated, come on.

245
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,800
I'll beat you up.

246
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,280
Ryo.

247
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,140
You idiot, there's a hole.

248
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,120
And it's full of dog poop.

249
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,100
Now you're a dog.

250
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,420
Don't imitate me like a kid.

251
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,120
There's always a hole in our Hondara sword.

252
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,940
A hole?

253
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,120
Shugo!

254
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,640
Hondara sword muscle strengthening training.

255
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,000
Ready!

256
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,700
Yes.

257
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,100
There are two iron bars on each side.

258
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,360
Two?

259
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,760
You're not going to use that bar, are you?

260
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,180
That's right.

261
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,160
It's called the iron bar training.

262
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,280
Start!

263
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,080
Yes.

264
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,700
I used two iron bars.

265
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,560
So what are you going to do?

266
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,420
I'll use two iron bars.

267
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,360
Yes.

268
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,220
Then you'll have to dry the laundry.

269
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,580
It doesn't make sense to use iron bars.

270
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,460
It's a Hondara sword.

271
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,120
You're still too young to be surprised.

272
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,180
Next is the ultimate of the Hondara sword style,

273
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,180
Sorry if I die.

274
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,740
Hell's Kampu Training.

275
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,480
Start!

276
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:42,720
Yes!

277
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,840
Yes!

278
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,340
Yes!

279
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,780
Now you'll be naked in the flapping wind.

280
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,440
Yes!

281
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,960
Enter the hot spring.

282
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,600
Then...

283
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,780
Hey! Drink!

284
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,020
Where's hell? That's heaven!

285
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,080
There's always a way out.

286
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,040
Don't mess with me!

287
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,940
I don't need a way out!

288
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,240
You're the one who's here to play!

289
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,940
I'm dying...

290
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,280
Ouch!

291
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,820
What the hell are you doing?!

292
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,460
You idiot! You almost died!

293
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,820
It's a dead end!

294
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,160
It's a dead end!

295
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,000
Are you okay, Jyo-sama?

296
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,820
I'm...

297
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Asato Ai.

298
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
You're talking to me?

299
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,080
I'll give you a kick one day, I'm waiting for you, Daizaimon Kaze...

300
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,160
Daizaimon Kaze...

301
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,280
You know me, Ai?

302
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,240
Daizaimon Kaze... I heard it somewhere...

303
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,260
What's with this wind?

304
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,060
Daizaimon Kaze...

305
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,340
Let's go, Daizo...

306
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,360
Let's go?

307
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,340
Yes.

308
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,600
Urgh!

309
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,340
♪ ♪

310
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,080
T-this exaggerated wind backed me up!!

311
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:25,860
Aaaah!?

312
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,440
It w-when is it...

313
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,260
No wind with the fan!

314
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,400
Who are you!?

315
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,380
Am I a true warrior...

316
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,460
...Kaze!

317
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,040
Teizaimon!

318
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,240
What!?

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,180
You!?

320
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,740
Kaze!

321
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,320
Where is Asatoya!?

322
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,860
-The End-

323
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,840
-The End-

324
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,600
Where is Asato Ai?

325
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,000
Damn you! Are you trying to make a scene?

326
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,480
We are your opponents!

327
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,540
You useless bastards!

328
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,300
What?

329
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,280
What are you talking about?

330
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,460
I won't forgive you!

331
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,160
-The End-

332
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,460
How's that? Open the road!

333
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,800
You suddenly set off a fire...

334
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,320
W-wait! I can't let you go!

335
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,220
Hehehe...

336
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,880
It's dangerous if you get close to me.

337
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,120
Now, who is it?

338
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,820
Who wants to be a sun dweller?

339
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,960
Stop it!

Is he a human pop?

352
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,720
No!

353
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,400
-The End-

354
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,700
Don't be rude!

355
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,160
I am a self-dueling master!

356
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,760
Self-dueling?

357
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,180
-The End-

358
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,140
I see! I remember!

359
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,580
That face!

360
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,740
He's the man who fought Ai in the martial arts tournament!

361
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,660
That's right!

362
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,240
I won't forget.

363
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,820
It was at the finals of the world championship three years ago.

364
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,440
Asatomi Ure and I fought against the world's best fighter, Zao Kagu.

365
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,600
-The End-

366
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,040

-The End-

370
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,200
Ai! You're not the same level as you were before!

371
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,900
Use the Hon-Dara sword!

372
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,620
But...

373
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,020
Hmm?

374
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,820
What's going on?

375
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,640
-The End-

376
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,400
Shut up!

377
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,920
What are you doing?

378
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,040
Use the Monkey Slash!

379
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,540
-The End-

380
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,920
What?

381
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,320
The wall...

382
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,300
What?!

383
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,740
-The End-

384
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,780
-The End-

385
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,600
-The End-

386
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,400
-The End-

387
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,340
-The End-

388
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,260
-The End-

389
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,400
Knockout!

390
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,480
The winner is Ai Asato!

391
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,520
Alright!

392
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:23,940
Good job!

393
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,700
I still remember the humiliation of that time.

394
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,640
For three years, I've been practicing hard for my life.

395
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,960
And when I was about to fail,

396
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,760
I saw a photo of Asato, changed my position, and started training.

397
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,220
You know, you usually put a photo of your lover in a rocket.

398
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,680
Shut up! I'll show you the success!

399
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,020
I'll show you Asato's light upper blow!

400
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,420
Like this!

401
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,480
Oh, no!

402
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,640
You see? The secret of the Jiko-ryu!

403
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,400
The Shirasagi's Sword!

404
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,900
I'll give you a good technique.

405
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,500
The first Shuriken is not that weak, is it?

406
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,500
Shut up!

407
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,200
I don't have any means to defeat the strongest Asato.

408
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,920
Now, Asato! Where are you?

409
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,940
I'm here!

410
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,020
Move!

411
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,060
Where is Asato?

412
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,120
Wait!

413
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:52,960
Yes?

414
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,020
Where is Asato?

415
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,020
Asato!

416
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,020
I'm here.

417
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,120
What are you doing? Move!

418
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,920
Asato!

419
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,460
I said I'm here!

420
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,400
You're being persistent.

421
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,720
Asato! Asato!

422
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,820
Asato! Asato!

423
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:19,720
Huh?

424
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,320
Beautiful!

425
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,460
What is it, Agatha?

426
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes?

427
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,340
Is there anyone who comes in through the door?

428
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,400
What?

429
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,020
Oh, no! I'm going to faint!

430
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,380
Oh, no...

431
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,380
Hey, Kyoko!

432
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,340
Oh, Ryo-tsu!

433
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,660
Hello! Happy New Year!

434
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,460
Happy New Year!

435
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,040
Happy New Year!

436
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,780
I hope this year will be a good year for you.

437
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,340
Me too.

438
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,680
Hey, Daidaimon!

439
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,860
The Asato Ai you're looking for is this guy!

440
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,760
Don't mess with me!

441
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,720
This is...

442
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,020
a new sword!

443
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,320
What?

444
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,040
Don't do anything bad to Ryo-sama!

445
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,300
This wonderful sword...

446
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,240
No way!

447
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,720
Is that really Asato Ai?

448
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,440
No way!

449
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:15,820
No way!

450
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,880
No way!

451
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,660
No way!

452
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,960
Is that the real Asato?

453
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:22,940
Yes.

454
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,780
Asato Ai fell in love with a steel coach a year ago and became a woman.

455
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,940
Ouch!

456
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,300
Now...

457
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,520
You're in for a big hit!

458
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,440
No way!

459
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,540
How could this happen?

460
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,580
Is anything just fine?

461
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,020
...

462
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,060
Is three years of training a waste?

463
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,780
...

464
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,080
Ah!

465
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,080
This is too much harmonious for me.

466
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,160
I trained for three years in the mountains.

467
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,360
That's part of the game, isn't it?

468
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,320
So, where are you going?

469
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,680
Oh, you!

470
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:07,880
Everyone!

471
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,180
It was just the right timing.

472
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,240
We've prepared some food.

473
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,920
Oh, we've been waiting!

474
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,480
It's the Shishi-Nabe your mother made.

475
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,700
Senpai, we finally get to eat!

476
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,880
Yeah, we forgot about it thanks to that guy,

477
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,020
but we're here to eat some New Year's food.

478
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,800
Itadakimasu!

479
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:28,920
Itadakimasu!

480
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,820
This Shishi-Nabe contains wild chrysanthemums that were caught in this mountain.

481
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,240
It's fresh and delicious!

482
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,380
It's the taste of a food researcher.

483
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,920
There's a lot of them, so please eat more and more.

484
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,320
The meat is better than the chrysanthemum.

485
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,300
The meat is the best!

486
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,700
Hey, let go of my knife!

487
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,920
I love meat too!

488
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,000
Let go!

489
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,940
You old man, eat some vegetables!

490
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,240
What are you talking about?

491
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,840
This is the same situation as last year's New Year's party.

492
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,020
I have a bad feeling about this.

493
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,780
I told you to let go of me!

494
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,240
Ryo-sama, are you okay?

495
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,420
Father?

496
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,120
It's his fault.

497
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,620
He should know how to be a little more considerate.

498
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,120
Oh, my God!

499
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,980
I'm sorry for bringing you here, Banji.

500
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,900
Banji, you're really...

501
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,840
Hey, eat this!

502
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,240
What?

503
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,200
The chrysanthemum!

504
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,760
I'll see what you can do with this.

505
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,000
Give me back the hot pot!

506
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:42,900
What?

507
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,020
Wait!

508
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,380
Okay!

509
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,940
Wait, Banji!

510
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:47,960
Wait!

511
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,440
Oh, my God.

512
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,840
Oh, my God.

513
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:52,880
I knew it.

514
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,560
I'll have to wait.

515
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,560
Wait!

516
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,340
Why is he always like this?

517
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,820
I wonder if those two are crazy.

518
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,480
Asato!

519
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,620
W-what about you?

520
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,720
I've become a woman, too.

521
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,380
Let's fight fair and square, Asato.

522
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,100
No, that's disgusting.

523
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,760
I'm not going to let go of three years of training.

524
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Come on, get on with it!

525
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,080
You said the chrysanthemum wasn't good for you, didn't you?

526
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

527
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:26,860
I didn't know what to do.

528
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,080
What are you going to do?

529
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,280
If it gets dirty, clean it up.

530
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,160
Of course, right?

531
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,840
I got it.

532
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,360
Get out of here!

533
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,120
Get out of here!

534
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:39,820
Get out of here!

535
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,640
Banji!

536
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,560
Banji!

537
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,320
You wasted a pot.

538
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,140
Yes.

539
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,400
You can have another pot in the future.

540
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,740
Wait!

541
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,300
Wait!

542
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,420
I did it, too.

543
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,300
If it gets dirty, then clean it up.

544
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,540
Y-Yes...

545
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,280
I didn't forgive you.

546
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,680
How cruel.

547
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,280
Stop!

548
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,920
Wait!

549
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,880
Hey, you!

550
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,240
Stop it!

551
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,060
Ryo!

552
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,480
Maria!

553
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,480
Gorilla Eyebrow!

554
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,280
You can't run away!

555
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,820
Asato, it's a match!

556
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,780
You're persistent! Stop it!

557
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:23,860
Stop it!

558
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,360
I refuse!

559
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:26,880
What?

560
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
Ryo, you're in danger!

561
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,740
Oh, no!

562
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,800
It's dangerous!

563
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,320
It's going to collapse!

564
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,960
What's going on?

565
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,800
If we knock down the pillar,

566
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,700
the tower will collapse!

567
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,720
What's going on?

568
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,200
We made such a railing!

569
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,800
I don't need such a place!

570
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,000
The End

571
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,760
"My Love in the Sky"

572
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,220
There are rumors that I am a woman who can't fall in love.

573
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,480
But there are so many things I want to do.

574
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,260
I...

575
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:28,980
I want to run through the vast desert on a motorcycle

576
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,300
I want to be free like a bird

577
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:48,000
A lady's dream that changes at the speed of a telescope

578
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,020
Love heart, I'm sorry, wait

579
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:01,680
The future of the panorama is a dazzling light

580
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:08,880
You understand, right? I'm sorry, wait

581
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,160
I want to be free like a bird
