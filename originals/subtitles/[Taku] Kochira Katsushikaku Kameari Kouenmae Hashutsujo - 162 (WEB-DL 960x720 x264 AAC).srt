1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,340
"The End"

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,880
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,900
Make the room bright and try to get away

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:25,260
It's like someone's calling

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,180
After the rain

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,200
I turned around and walked

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,420
I reached out to my mom

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,580
I felt

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,500
A strange feeling

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,920
So I took a red-and-white tile

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,200
And walked only in black

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,320
Everyone was a child once

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,640
But everyone forgets

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,240
Politicians with a big face

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,580
And blue-eyed old ladies

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,540
Turn around and look

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,200
At that corner

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,800
You'll see everyone

19
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,320
There's a wall there

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,820
There is a turtle there

21
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,780
Come on everyone

22
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,500
To our town

23
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,700
Thank you!

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,940
"The End"

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,200
You read such a stupid manga

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,520
You're in a hurry!

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,260
You're noisy

28
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,300
Ryo-chan is not always

29
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,280
Unlike the most of the time Ryo-chan reads

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,900
Because he's always delicate

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:54,800
"The End"

32
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,880
I'll lend you one!

33
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,220
It's a happy ending after all!

34
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,260
What?

35
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,600
The first time you met a man and a woman?

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,780
Actually, the woman is single.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're suddenly kissing?

38
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,160
Is there such a convenient story?

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,700
I'm already married!

40
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,560
That's right.

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,660
B-Boss!

42
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,000
Ryotsu!

43
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,540
What are you going to do by reading comics while you're working?

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,240
No, this is that girl...

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,800
Don't blame people!

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,320
No, that's a misunderstanding, Boss!

47
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,480
I'm sure you read the book!

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,960
Mr. Ryotsu!

49
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,880
The president wants to see you!

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,880
The president?

51
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,120
The president wants to see you?

52
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,040
Don't tell me he's not going to fire you?

53
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,440
I don't know.

54
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,920
Anyway, let's go!

55
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,960
Hey, Ryotsu!

56
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,720
I'm waiting for the farewell party.

57
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,080
Thank you very much!

58
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's go, Boss!

59
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,680
Yeah!

60
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,340
I'll catch you!

61
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,200
I'll catch you!

62
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,160
Hey, you guys!

63
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,320
What's going on?

64
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,460
Ryotsu!

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,960
Kankichi!

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,980
What are you doing?

67
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,740
What are you doing?

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Mr. Ryotsu, you're being too cruel to me.

69
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,900
Yeah.

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,500
It's terrible to use Maria as a maid.

71
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,840
What do you mean?

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,620
What's the matter?

73
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,140
Oh, why are you here?

74
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,300
Ryotsu!

75
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,720
Oh, Sandy!

76
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,780
I missed you!

77
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,700
No way!

78
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,140
What's wrong with you, Gorilla Man?

79
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,580
A blonde woman like that?

80
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,560
Ryo-san, it's been a long time.

81
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,600
Senpai, are you okay?

82
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,500
What are you doing to Ryo-san?

83
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,900
What are you doing?

84
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,800
Kissing my Ryo-sama?

85
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,800
My Ryo-sama?

86
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,340
Ryo-san, is this person a girlfriend?

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,240
Maria-san is not a girlfriend, but a boyfriend.

88
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,620
Boyfriend?

89
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,420
This person is a man?

90
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,960
Everyone is surprised at the beginning.

91
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,080
Then, Ryo-san, did you have a hobby?

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,280
It's a misunderstanding. Maria is just falling in love with me.

93
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,660
That's terrible, Ryo-sama.

94
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,580
You lived together under the same roof.

95
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,300
I traveled together, Ryo-san.

96
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,100
Travel?

97
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,160
Why is Ryo Tsukankichi so popular?

98
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,640
I don't understand what foreigners and Japanese think.

99
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,800
I won't forgive you.

100
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,460
No way!

101
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,980
Maria-kun.

102
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,720
When Ryo-san went to America for her training trip,

103
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,000
Sandy was a police officer who took care of me.

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,660
What?

105
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,620
To give her back,

106
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,020
I invited her to Japan for her training at the Katushika school.

107
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,740
But...

108
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,000
What misunderstanding?

109
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,980
I drank with Sandy until morning,

110
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,320
and I even went to the court to arrest the boy who was a spy.

111
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,280
Is that so?

112
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,520
I was so wrong.

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,060
Sandy is Sandy, too.

114
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,420
I have to say it in a meaningful way.

115
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,560
Really?

116
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,400
Maria is too much.

117
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,700
I see.

118
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,040
It's impossible for such a beautiful blonde girl to follow me from Ryo Tsukankichi, New York.

119
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,700
So, I want you to take care of Sandy as the guide,

120
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,020
the head of the police, and the chief of the police,

121
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,880
the chief of the police.

122
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,700
Okay.

123
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:41,780
Okay.

124
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,840
Sandy,

125
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,520
do you want to visit Tokyo for free time today?

126
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,200
Yes.

127
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
Where do you want to visit?

128
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,560
Tokyo Disneyland?

129
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,960
Hodaiba?

130
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,800
I like the mood of downtown Tokyo.

131
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,180
For example, Asakusa?

132
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,700
Asakusa is my hometown.

133
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,860
I have a house there.

134
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,820
Really?

135
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,280
Yes.

136
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,560
You can stay at my house while you are staying here.

137
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,700
Senior.

138
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,820
Senior, that's not good.

139
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,140
What's not good?

140
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,240
Sandy.

141
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,660
But I have a hotel reservation.

142
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,520
Cancel.

143
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,980
Let's go to the hotel and have fun.

144
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,400
But that sounds more interesting.

145
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:27,860
Okay.

146
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,080
Okay.

147
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,440
I decided.

148
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,960
I'll go to Asakusa today.

149
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,840
Honda, pick up a taxi.

150
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,280
Okay.

151
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,320
See you later.

152
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,140
It's about 5:30 pm on Saturday.

153
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,540
See you later.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,460
You have to wear a mask.

155
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:54,960
Bye.

156
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,480
See you next time.

157
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,500
Good night.

158
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:55,540
Good night.

159
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,520
See you tomorrow.

160
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:58,660
Good night.

161
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,940
Good night.

162
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,780
Part 7 Time Lapse

163
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,520
Wow!

164
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,760
I wish I could live here yourself!

165
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,740
I'd rather not live in a doghouse.

166
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,800
Honda, well done. You can go home now.

167
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,740
No, I'll stay.

168
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,040
Why would you stay?

169
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,220
Maria asked me to.

170
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,260
To make sure there's no mistake between you and Sandy.

171
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,560
That's not true.

172
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,620
Go home already.

173
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,780
I can't.

174
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,860
I want to hear Sandy's story as a Japanese knight.

175
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,360
What are you talking about?

176
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,100
Nothing.

177
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,360
It can't be helped.

178
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,920
It's too small for me to sleep.

179
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,220
Hey, who's there?

180
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,020
It's Kankichi. What's wrong?

181
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,640
I brought a guest.

182
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,120
Sandy!

183
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,860
Hello.

184
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,900
I'm here.

185
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,040
Isn't that a foreigner?

186
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,280
He'll be in trouble in this house for a while.

187
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,180
Sandy, don't hold back.

188
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,580
Dad, this is bad!

189
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,620
Huh?

190
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,660
Kankichi brought a blonde.

191
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,560
Excuse me.

192
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,860
What?

193
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,780
What?

194
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,880
Nice to meet you.

195
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm Sandy, from New York.

196
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,180
Oh, I'm here.

197
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,280
What's going on?

198
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,660
Kankichi, what's going on?

199
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,580
You can't tell by looking at me.

200
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,960
It's a foreigner's dream.

201
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,640
Don't be a fool.

202
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,300
Sandy is...

203
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,940
I see.

204
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,180
You're the police officer who took care of me when I went to America.

205
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,780
You're a gentleman.

206
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,880
I'll leave you to it.

207
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,300
You speak Japanese very well.

208
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,520
You're good.

209
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,680
You're polite.

210
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,260
I teach Japanese and tea and flowers in America.

211
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,120
Sandy, relax.

212
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,580
It's a dirty place, but don't hold back.

213
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,660
I'll do more.

214
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,640
That's right.

215
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,480
It's a really dirty place, but don't hold back.

216
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,020
You don't have to say that.

217
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,740
Sandy, are you hungry?

218
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,200
That's right.

219
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,020
Okay.

220
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's have lunch.

221
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,940
Croquette and pork cutlet, please.

222
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,480
Okay, okay, that's fine.

223
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,520
You idiot.

224
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,260
You're a foreigner.

225
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,800
You have a different diet from Japanese.

226
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,920
Kankichi, what are foreigners eating?

227
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,740
You went to America, right?

228
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,700
That's right.

229
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,160
Is it okay to have hamburger, bread and coffee?

230
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,940
That's it, mom.

231
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,700
And I want a knife and fork, too.

232
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,720
That's not what we have.

233
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,640
Can't we use a knife and a hammer?

234
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,020
This is not a mountain pass.

235
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,900
Go buy it right away.

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,140
You'll be proud of Japan.

237
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,540
Really? Then I'll go.

238
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,580
Kankichi, you're back in America.

239
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,840
Well, I've lived here for two weeks.

240
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,540
I'm not different from Americans.

241
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,840
My father doesn't know about the world.

242
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,340
He doesn't know where America is.

243
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,160
He doesn't come from Tai Tohoku.

244
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,620
Listen, I'll explain with this croquette.

245
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,240
This is how Japan looks like.

246
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,860
This is Tokyo.

247
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,840
My father's house is around here.

248
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,740
America is just ahead of Hokkaido.

249
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,080
It's here.

250
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,580
It's pretty close.

251
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,120
I slept in the plane, so I don't know.

252
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,380
I arrived in about an hour.

253
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,840
It's probably around here.

254
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,860
Wow, that's a pretty big hamburger.

255
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,420
I don't know about the taste, but it looks good.

256
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,800
It's my first time cooking in a restaurant.

257
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,420
Then I'll enjoy it.

258
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,820
It's delicious, Mom.

259
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,820
I'm glad you like it.

260
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,300
Is there anything on my face?

261
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,100
No, no.

262
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,260
Foreigners have blue eyes and look like dolls.

263
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
I don't like this person.

264
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,240
He's a poor idiot without a degree.

265
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,500
Well, don't worry about it.

266
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,300
No.

267
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,440
Don't say that you're good at saying your stupid things.

268
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,680
You look good, Chichou.

269
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,080
No, you're a fool.

270
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,100
I'm here for you.

271
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,180
Don't try to beat me.

272
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm the best, come on.

273
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,160
That's my senior.

274
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,220
Head to your parents.

275
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,920
Turn around.

276
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,960
You're a fool.

277
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,460
You're a fool.

278
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,400
You're a fool.

279
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,080
You're a fool.

280
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,660
You're a fool.

281
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,000
You're a fool.

282
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,320
You're a fool.

283
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,520
I'm ready to fight!

284
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,880
I'm ready!

285
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,860
I don't want to bother Sandy!

286
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,820
You can't go.

287
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,600
No, no, it's okay.

288
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,760
My father and my brother are good at fighting.

289
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,620
They're really close.

290
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,480
I guess people in Japan and the U.S. don't change.

291
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,260
You and Kanki are too much!

292
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,460
I'm sorry.

293
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,820
Why are you running so fast?

294
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,700
What are you talking about?

295
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,480
You're too fast to keep your balance.

296
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,620
You need to keep your balance.

297
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,260
He's speeding up!

298
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,680
What a wild run.

299
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,580
I don't think she's a woman.

300
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,540
It's a floating turn!

301
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,360
You're doing great, Sandy!

302
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,540
I'm riding it lightly.

303
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,540
I'm not going to lose!

304
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,140
All right!

305
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,460
Oh!

306
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:27,980
It stopped just in time!

307
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,220
That's great!

308
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,600
Japanese bikes are very easy to ride!

309
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,480
Very good!

310
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,040
Sandy, would you like a shake?

311
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,520
I want your autograph.

312
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,180
Thank you.

313
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,840
Wait a minute!

314
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,560
A shake is 100 yen.

315
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,840
The autograph is 300 yen!

316
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,040
No, no!

317
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,440
It's okay.

318
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,420
This is the Japanese custom.

319
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,560
It's a collection.

320
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,140
A shake is 100 yen.

321
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,480
A sign is 300 yen.

322
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Two-shot photos are now 500 yen.

323
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,200
How about it?

324
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,160
I want to take a picture.

325
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,800
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

326
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,720
Don't push it, don't push it.

327
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,960
The person who paid for it is waiting over there.

328
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,280
You can get closer.

329
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,120
Is this the way?

330
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes, the next person.

331
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,840
Yes.

332
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,480
Yes, laugh more.

333
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,220
Senpai runs to make money soon.

334
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,060
But it's nice.

335
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,220
Ryozu and Sandy.

336
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,540
I see.

337
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,680
Hi, Ryo-san.

338
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,540
I want to take a picture with Ryo-san in two shots.

339
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,560
Oh, really?

340
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,820
Someone please push the shutter.

341
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,040
Yes.

342
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,400
Then I'll go.

343
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,040
Yes.

344
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,180
Wait a minute.

345
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,860
Please.

346
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,080
Isn't it nice?

347
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,220
Honda-san, why don't you do the cupid of love for two people?

348
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,000
That's no good.

349
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,140
It's bad for Maria-san.

350
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,260
No matter how much Maria-san likes Ryozu-san, he's a man.

351
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,740
Well, that's right.

352
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,360
Ryozu-san is our benefactor.

353
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,640
Next time, Honda-san will take care of the two of them.

354
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,560
That's right.

355
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,580
All right.

356
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,560
Well, Sandy-san.

357
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,920
Do you have someone you like?

358
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,920
Yes, well.

359
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,900
What kind of person?

360
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,100
That's right.

361
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,900
She has thick eyebrows and has a tough face like a gorilla.

362
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
That's like Senpai.

363
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,860
And she has a life-like life force like a cockroach.

364
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,360
Yes.

365
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,620
As expected, Senpai.

366
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:46,720
That's right.

367
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,120
She's got a lot of muscles.

368
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,680
What?

369
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,880
Is Kankichi the ideal type?

370
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,420
I think Senpai is the one who said she has a person she likes.

371
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,920
That's a mistake.

372
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,180
No.

373
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,840
Sandy's eyes that stare at Senpai are the eyes of a woman in love.

374
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,740
Dad, maybe this is a chance.

375
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,000
Well, if Sandy becomes Kankichi's wife and comes to our house.

376
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,460
She'll be able to do that and do this.

377
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,500
And she'll be able to help Tsukuda.

378
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,840
Dad, can I have a taste?

379
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,860
It's bad!

380
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,340
It's far from 300 years of taste.

381
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,700
It's still sweet.

382
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,000
I can't take it anymore.

383
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,840
Dad.

384
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,240
Don't cry, Sandy.

385
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,660
The road to Tsukuda is long and steep.

386
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,340
Let's go one step at a time.

387
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,880
Dad!

388
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,980
Good, good.

389
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,760
I can't stop.

390
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,200
What's wrong with you?

391
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,080
Well, that's...

392
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,800
Mom, you check Sandy's feelings.

393
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,620
I'll check Honda and Kankichi's feelings.

394
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,040
I got it.

395
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,480
Sandy, I'm asking you.

396
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,860
Do you like Kankichi?

397
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,540
Of course.

398
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,400
Of course.

399
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,240
Really?

400
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,120
There's not many men as wonderful as him.

401
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,780
I love that idiot.

402
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,760
Thank you.

403
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,100
Mom.

404
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,380
Mom.

405
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,120
I'm the ideal type?

406
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,780
Yes, Sandy has made it clear.

407
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,300
So, how do you feel?

408
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,280
Even if you say that, I hate him.

409
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,340
He's a foreigner.

410
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,080
Idiot.

411
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,120
There's no woman in the world who would give you to an ideal man.

412
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,120
Get married.

413
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,560
Get married?

414
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,400
Yes, I can.

415
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,660
I can definitely do it.

416
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,800
What if I propose to you?

417
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,240
What if I propose to you?

418
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,740
What if I propose to you?

419
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:13,940
You're a fool.

420
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,780
Sandy, I love Kankichi.

421
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,460
What?

422
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,720
I see.

423
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,520
Sandy, come here and show him your kimono.

424
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,320
What?

425
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,580
What?

426
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,320
What?

427
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,380
What?

428
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:32,640
What?

429
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,480
What?

430
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,340
What?

431
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,540
What?

432
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:41,640
What?

433
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:41,780
What?

434
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:41,860
What?

435
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,140
What?

436
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:44,980
Huh?

437
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,380
What?

438
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:45,520
What?

439
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:45,680
Oh, that was funny.

440
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,320
listener: We're in love.

441
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,980
listener: I need to go to the dojo with you.

442
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,880
What?

443
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,320
Do you want to go?

444
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,160
Yes, I will.

445
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Well, if you're really the ideal type, it's Masamune.

446
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,020
It's like a manga that you hate, Ryo-chan.

447
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,820
Well, that's what happens in the world.

448
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,760
Alright, I'll do the Nakodo.

449
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,780
Are you okay? I'll do the English speech.

450
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,080
Oh, I see. I understand.

451
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,920
I'll do my best to do it by the time the ceremony is over.

452
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,340
Senpai, congratulations.

453
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,520
Only Americans can understand a global man like me.

454
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,560
Hey, Ryo-chan, what did you say about the proposal?

455
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,620
What did you say about the proposal?

456
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,740
I haven't proposed yet.

457
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:36,940
What?

458
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,840
That's not good. You have to propose now.

459
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,340
That's right, Senpai. Let's go.

460
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,740
If it's Sandy, I'll take you to find the venue.

461
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
You went to find the venue?

462
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,260
I said it's too early, but you're too busy.

463
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,260
I can't help it.

464
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,460
Ryo-chan, let's go.

465
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,580
Okay.

466
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,720
You're going to find the venue.

467
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,100
Let's go.

468
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,280
Where is this place, Sandy?

469
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,540
What is it?

470
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,660
It's the wedding venue for Sandy and Kankichi.

471
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,520
Eh?

472
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,360
I don't like that, Daddy.

473
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,480
Is that a Japanese joke?

474
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,400
It's not a joke. I'm a serious man.

475
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,720
I found it, Senpai.

476
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,460
Please cancel the proposal.

477
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,580
Ah!

478
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,580
There's a Comiaki car in America!

479
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,060
But you said you like Kankichi.

480
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,060
I said that as a human being, not as a man.

481
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,720
What? No way!

482
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,600
Let's go.

483
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,620
I'm sorry. I was just in a hurry.

484
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,040
Don't be silly. I didn't intend to marry Patsukin from the start.

485
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,860
Let's go.

486
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,740
Senpai...

487
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,880
Honda, hurry up. We're going to drink today.

488
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
I'm sorry we only have a few souvenirs.

489
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,740
No problem.

490
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,140
Thank you all very much.

491
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,160
Thank you very much.

492
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,640
Please take care of the president.

493
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,880
Please come again.

494
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,840
Thank you.

495
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,980
I'm sorry I was late.

496
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,000
Ryotsu won't come, father.

497
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,920
We got so excited.

498
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,680
He's not the kind of person to lose.

499
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,940
But I'm his father, so I'm sure.

500
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,980
What? You're not going to Arita?

501
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,280
Just do as I say.

502
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,080
Roger that.

503
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:16,420
I just saw one of the husbands and I'm sorry.

504
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,640
I'm sorry.

505
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,520
I can't believe it.

506
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,540
I can't believe I'm about to be killed.

507
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,640
MOVE!

508
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:27,940
MOVE.

509
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,220
GO.

510
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,640
Cross the street.

511
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,400
Dispatch!

512
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,480
Get out of the way.

513
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,840
Move!

514
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,620
Shut up! I'll arrest you if you don't do as I say!

515
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,620
Y-yes sir!

516
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,580
Finally, we're done for.

517
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,460
Bye...

518
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,060
Ryo-tsu...

519
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,480
Ryo-san!

520
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,380
Thank you, Ryo-san.

521
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Goodbye...

522
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,780
Goodbye, Sandy.

523
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,780
Idiot!

524
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,600
You're a police officer, but you're the one who stopped a car on the highway!

525
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,880
I got you!

526
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,640
Ryo-san!

527
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,120
Ryo-san, it's terrible that you can marry someone who is like me!

528
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,780
W-wait! It's a misunderstanding!

529
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,920
I will not allow this!

530
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,280
Why me?!

531
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,860
Just run away!

532
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,460
Just wait!

533
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,360
Both of you are pregnant for three months!

534
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
What?!

535
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,500
Awaken, clock, kick it, little finger, a-ta-ta-ta

536
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:13,340
For now, if you draw your eyebrows, to the station, dash, dash, dash

537
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,280
Main train, one-eyed on my father's back

538
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,660
This week, the best of luck, the best of luck, the best of luck

539
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,540
Even though I'm holding the bucket in one hand

540
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,440
The hot soup and the cold soup

541
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,900
Even the annoyance of the continuous work

542
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,260
I'll get rid of it easily

543
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,100
Every day is no problem

544
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,240
If the hot train passes by

545
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,560
Every day is no problem

546
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,760
In the half-moon pillow

547
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,780
I'll recover my energy

548
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,260
Every day is no problem

549
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,940
I love myself like this

550
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,820
Every day is no problem

551
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,640
The heart is flying

552
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,180
On Monday

553
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,660
What?

554
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,440
The manga of Otohime is going to be animated?

555
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,800
Why am I not the leader of the Robodeca?

556
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,720
What?

557
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,380
The toy wants to release character goods

558
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,900
I want to ask the original author

559
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,100
Maybe this is a chance to make a profit

560
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,420
Next time, make money in the anime

561
