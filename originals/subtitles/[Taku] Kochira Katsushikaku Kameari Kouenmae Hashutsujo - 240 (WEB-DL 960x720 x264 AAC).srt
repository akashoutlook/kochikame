1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,860
When you watch TV, make your room bright and look away!

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:23,780
A man without money, come to my place!

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,940
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:35,900
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds!

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,700
It'll be okay!

6
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,060
A man without a job, come to my place!

7
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:57,920
A man without a job, come to my place!

8
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,380
A man without a job, come to my place!

9
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,860
A man without a job, come to my place!

10
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,480
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

11
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,140
Look at the red clouds burning!

12
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,260
It'll be okay!

13
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,320
Do you understand?

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you understand?

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,120
If you do, follow me quietly!

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,960
Follow me!

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,920
Follow me!

18
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,280
Follow me!

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,440
Follow me!

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,860
Follow me!

21
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,280
Follow me!

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,300
Follow me!

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,460
Follow me!

24
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,280
Follow me!

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,620
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

26
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:45,960
I don't care.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,480
I don't care.

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,120
I'm here!

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,080
That's it!

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,360
Don't go.

31
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,880
I don't want to serve you.

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,820
I don't like being here.

33
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,160
I don't like being here.

34
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,440
I can't believe I can drink so much beer while reading the text.

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,220
You have to link everything in this world.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,020
You can't eat rice crackers and fart while watching TV, can you?

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,400
It was stupid to talk to Kankichi about lemon.

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,820
Lemon was stupid.

39
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,060
What? Lemon and Kyoto?

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,620
Yes. Lemon is going to the restaurant of his son's depression who is cooking in Kyoto.

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,420
But the restaurant staff is busy this time and they don't have time.

42
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,880
So I have a problem.

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,980
Lemon is doing well but he is a kindergarten student.

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,940
Can you take him to the restaurant?

45
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,100
Yes. I can rest anytime.

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,900
Lemon's brother's depression is trained in a first-class restaurant.

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,000
If I take Lemon to the restaurant, I can cook delicious food.

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,160
I will arrive at Nagoya station in 5 minutes.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,020
I dropped my ticket.

50
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,940
Where should I go?

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,760
Here you are.

52
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,840
This is it.

53
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,520
Where are you going?

54
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,060
I'm going to Nagoya.

55
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,840
Then I'll go next.

56
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,840
Nagoya. Nagoya.

57
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,500
The stop time is 3 minutes.

58
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,820
Be careful of your feet.

59
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you, young lady.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,260
I'm in the train.

61
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,540
I wonder where the train goes.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:44,940
Ah.

63
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,940
Wait a minute.

64
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,060
The train.

65
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,880
Please tell me.

66
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,820
Yes.

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,780
Thank you for waiting.

68
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,120
I want to take the train to the station.

69
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,220
I got it.

70
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,260
This way, please.

71
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,900
Thank you for your work.

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,860
Be careful.

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,820
Ah.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,100
complaint

75
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,060
who was it?

76
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:27,620
did you fell asleep?

77
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,840
there was no lemon

78
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,080
do you go to the toilet?

79
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,320
ah, it's a topic

80
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,220
yes, hello?

81
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,020
What? We're at the station!

82
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,460
Did you get off?

83
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,100
You're at the Nagoya station's platform!

84
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,280
I got it! Don't move!

85
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,360
Wait!

86
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,780
Damn it!

87
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,080
Alright!

88
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:21,660
I feel like someone just passed by...

89
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,300
Hey, come on!

90
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,060
The train will soon arrive at Line 15.

91
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,400
I'm coming back from Kyoto...

92
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,760
It'll take an hour.

93
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,240
Sorry to keep you waiting!

94
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,960
Kankichi!

95
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,140
Sorry to leave you alone.

96
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,120
Yeah, but you were fast.

97
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,180
After I got your call, I got off the Shinkansen right away.

98
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,820
Thanks to you, I'm back.

99
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm sorry, Kankichi.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,600
It's alright.

101
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,760
Yeah.

102
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,240
Wait a minute.

103
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
What does that have to do with you?

104
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,680
Huh?

105
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,200
I'm talking about the kid who was at home, who was asking for help.

106
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,260
He's my relative!

107
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,700
He doesn't look like him at all.

108
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,820
He doesn't look like him at all.

109
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,360
He doesn't look like him at all.

110
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,480
He doesn't look like him at all.

111
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,060
I guess I'll ask him at the office.

112
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,400
Damn it! I'm a police officer!

113
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,640
You're a great liar!

114
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:31,980
I'm a police officer!

115
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,820
I'm a police officer!

116
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,580
Don't tell a lie.

117
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,940
Don't tell a lie.

118
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,160
Come back!

119
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,300
No, no, no!

120
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:37,840
It's true!

121
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,480
I'll find out if I contact the chief of the Katsushika office.

122
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,980
I'll find out if I contact the chief of the Katsushika office.

123
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,080
Yes, that's right.

124
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm sure of it.

125
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,600
I'm a relative of Ryo.

126
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,780
Thank you for the trouble.

127
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,640
Thank you for the trouble.

128
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,860
It seems he was mistaken for a kidnapper.

129
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,660
It can't be helped if it's Ryo and Lemon.

130
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,280
It can't be helped if it's Ryo and Lemon.

131
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,520
Kyoto! Kyoto!

132
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,280
Hurry up!

133
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,120
No, I just got a call.

134
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,180
If he's still like this, will he get caught again?

135
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,400
Could be.

136
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,320
I didn't think he was a cop.

137
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,120
I've been for your help!

138
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,920
No, thanks.

139
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,360
Don't worry.

140
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,680
See ya.

141
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,880
Bye-bye!

142
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,620
Bye-bye!

143
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,060
I'm not sure I can make it.

144
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Kanchi is not good at dressing,

145
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,060
and his clothes are not good.

146
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,960
That's why he gets it wrong.

147
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,120
Leave it alone!

148
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,880
I wonder if it's around here.

149
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,380
Kanchi, it's that shop.

150
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,940
Is this really the place?

151
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,880
It looks like a very high-class shop.

152
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,080
I've been here with my grandma last year, so I'm sure.

153
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's go, Kanchi.

154
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,100
Giboshi Yuutsu?

155
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,280
Isn't that about Yun-san?

156
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,180
Oh, that's right.

157
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,720
I'll go and call him now.

158
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,320
Don't wait inside.

159
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,180
Lemon!

160
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,740
Yuutsu!

161
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,020
You came here well.

162
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,900
I'm getting heavier.

163
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,400
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,320
It's true.

165
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,680
He looks like Matoe.

166
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,840
He's a good-looking man.

167
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,100
Could it be that you,

168
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,860
who was in his grandma's email,

169
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,520
are Ryotsu Bakakichi?

170
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,060
No, I'm Kanchi!

171
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,380
I knew it.

172
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,420
He has a bold name.

173
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,640
Damn you, Geppardo.

174
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,160
You really are a cute little sister.

175
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,040
You look exactly like Yun-san.

176
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,460
How old are you?

177
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,920
I'm five years old.

178
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,340
We're brothers, too.

179
00:08:59,340 --> 00:08:59,420
You're not his brother?

180
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,340
No.

181
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,200
I'm his relative from Asakusa.

182
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,740
That's right.

183
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,020
You look totally different.

184
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,320
Leave me alone, you idiot!

185
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,520
Cheers!

186
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:13,380
Cheers!

187
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,400
The sake I drink on my trip is delicious.

188
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,540
Kyoto's sake is delicious.

189
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,180
It's really delicious.

190
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,000
As expected of Matoe's older brother.

191
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,440
He's manly and has a good sense of humor.

192
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:29,600
No, no.

193
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,320
Matoe is really a woman.

194
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,020
What?

195
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,260
He wasn't that manly as he liked when he was a child.

196
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,980
His mother was a master of Japanese dance,

197
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,460
so Matoe had been learning to dance for a long time.

198
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,080
When he was in kindergarten,

199
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,940
Matoe had very big eyes and was a cute girl.

200
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,800
Hmm, that's hard to imagine.

201
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,180
Maybe he played baseball as a kid?

202
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,260
That's my influence.

203
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:55,940
Ah?

204
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,740
When I wanted to have a brother,

205
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,120
I wanted to be a sportsman, so I taught him baseball.

206
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,780
So you're good at baseball?

207
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,360
I was getting better and better because I was smart.

208
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,720
Thanks to that, he quit baseball and started playing softball.

209
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,000
If I didn't teach him baseball, my sister would be a woman.

210
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,020
What's wrong with you?

211
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,880
What a poor sister.

212
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,120
She's crying when she drinks.

213
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,860
Don't worry about it.

214
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,060
I'm not worried about you.

215
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,660
I knew it.

216
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,140
Don't cry.

217
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,700
The big guy is not a good guy.

218
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,080
The customers are watching.

219
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,720
It's okay.

220
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,720
I'll stop right away.

221
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,660
I feel better after crying.

222
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,300
What were we talking about?

223
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,900
What's wrong?

224
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,980
Lemon, you're a different character.

225
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,080
You are depressed and bright.

226
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,480
Get used to it.

227
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,480
Why are you so weird?

228
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,220
You are a fool.

229
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,280
I was a fool.

230
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,240
I was a fool.

231
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,820
I was a fool.

232
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,640
I was a fool.

233
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,860
I was a fool.

234
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,340
I was a fool.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,520
I was a fool.

236
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,740
I was a fool.

237
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,160
I was a fool.

238
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,540
I was a fool.

239
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,860
I was a fool.

240
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,660
I was a fool.

241
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,660
I was a fool.

242
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,040
I was a fool.

243
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,800
I was a fool.

244
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,660
You think I'm a fool.

245
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,640
I thought you were a fool with a face I thought you were a fool but I was wrong.

246
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,040
I'm a fool.

247
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,680
I have a mistake.

248
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,340
I'm afraid to tell you why I have to endure this.

249
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,060
I don't want to know about anything.

250
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,540
Thank you very much.

251
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,020
H will

252
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:23,080
I have a mild good stock

253
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,720
Sweet and bitter of the strong vegetables in this season

254
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,120
It is really good with the harmony with the paste

255
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:36,220
I feel a little nervous about the taste of the lemon

256
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,520
I'm sure you'll like it.

257
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,180
Yuu-tsu, you've mastered the taste of the restaurant.

258
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,180
Really?

259
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,360
As much as you can say a hundred years,

260
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,020
Gepard said he was a master of taste.

261
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,600
I got the sweet and sour sauce.

262
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,940
Be happy, Yuu-tsu.

263
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,420
Yes!

264
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,760
But there are less customers at our restaurant these days.

265
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,840
I think the customers are tired of this taste.

266
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,540
You're overthinking, Yuu-tsu.

267
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,580
Now the world is not a cake.

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,300
Every restaurant is the same.

269
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,080
That's right.

270
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,580
No, I'm a true chef because I make food that customers come to me no matter what.

271
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,820
There's a problem with the food I make.

272
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,240
You're really a person who changes.

273
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,540
Have more confidence in your own skills.

274
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,820
Yuu-tsu is serious.

275
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,480
Yuu-san, don't think about that.

276
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,700
That's right, my sister came to me.

277
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Today is a holiday, so go somewhere to change your mood.

278
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,280
That's right.

279
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,540
That's good.

280
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,940
That's right.

281
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,200
Lemon likes historical drama, so let's go to the historical drama village of Kyoto.

282
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,360
Let's go.

283
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,120
Lemon loves historical drama.

284
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,820
It's good to be able to meet your favorite mito and gomou.

285
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,220
Yes.

286
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,160
Thank you for waiting.

287
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,520
Hurry up.

288
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,720
Wow, amazing.

289
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,160
That's good.

290
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,740
There is a corner of the big special.

291
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,660
Let's go.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,080
Oh, how nostalgic.

293
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,400
Is this the 32nd year of Hōei this year?

294
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,980
Did you watch Kankichi?

295
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,580
I've been watching it since the beginning.

296
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,880
When did you watch Lemon?

297
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,560
From here.

298
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,340
A year ago.

299
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,000
If you think about it, I'm still a 5-year-old Enji.

300
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,780
But I've been watching the reboot, so I know the first and second generation of Komou-sama.

301
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,720
What?

302
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,600
I see.

303
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,180
Do you want to buy something?

304
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,320
I'll buy a picture of Komou-sama.

305
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,900
Kankichi.

306
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,340
Yes?

307
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:59,680
Which do you prefer, the

308
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,780
over-sized model or a large quarter of a model?

309
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,760
I put a Nagamikai for you.

310
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,020
Yes.

311
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,820
Ah, I want to buy another one.

312
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:11,860
Thank you.

313
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
I want to buy an illustration.

314
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,440
Do you?

315
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,860
It's a《Kungaku Hà?》

316
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,180
I guess I'm verdi.

317
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,520
I'm estimating it.

318
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,360
What?

319
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,640
I wonder if I can buy it.

320
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,120
Really?

321
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:28,500
I asked for it.

322
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:28,920
There are many rare ones,

323
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,660
and

324
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,220
It's true.

325
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,680
Wow! It's the same as the TV!

326
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,480
So this is the Edo period.

327
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,020
It's the best period drama open set in Japan.

328
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,020
Edo is gone.

329
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,520
It's here, isn't it?

330
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,780
No, it's not.

331
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,000
The people who appear on TV live here, right?

332
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,100
No, they don't.

333
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,680
But there's a house for the Zenigata Heiji.

334
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,100
Yeah. I built this for the shooting.

335
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,160
Why can you read kanji?

336
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,840
I learned it on TV.

337
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,680
Grandma has a video.

338
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,420
See? I know other characters.

339
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,860
Then write "lemon."

340
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,500
Well...

341
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,260
I wonder if it was like this.

342
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,660
Which country's character is it?

343
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,380
It's good. I'll write it one day.

344
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,080
Really?

345
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,280
First, remember your name.

346
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,260
One, two, two, four.

347
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,080
I did it!

348
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,120
I can't do it.

349
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,760
It's okay.

350
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,460
I'll write it.

351
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,540
Don't move.

352
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,120
I'll transfer it.

353
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,680
Cheese.

354
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,460
Good job.

355
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,300
You can take a walk in the Edo period drama village.

356
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,260
Oh, really?

357
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,580
Let's go to Lemon Princess.

358
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,780
It's not a bad place.

359
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,080
Tooyama Kinshiro.

360
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,220
Oh, cute!

361
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,300
Please take a picture with me.

362
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:06,980
Please.

363
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,360
Oh, okay.

364
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,560
Okay, pose.

365
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,000
I feel like I'm Mickey.

366
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,060
What?

367
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,660
What's wrong?

368
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,500
Who called an ambulance?

369
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,300
Hey, what's up?

370
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,600
A cooking person cut his hand while shooting.

371
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,760
I'm sorry.

372
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,460
I can't shoot now.

373
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,300
Then maybe he's good.

374
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,120
Eh, really?

375
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,200
Hey!

376
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,540
What ?

377
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,680
I can't be an actor.

378
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,440
Cooking is the type of thing.

379
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,520
I know it's a good thing.

380
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,400
You've done a good job.

381
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,420
Really?

382
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
Thank you for your hard work.

383
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes, I'm the real Heikichi Ajihawa.

384
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,040
Heikichi Ajihawa?

385
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,920
I'm Ajihawa, Ajihawa, the Ajihawa of Ajihei Torimonocho.

386
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,460
I'm sorry, but I'm looking forward to working with you.

387
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,760
Y-Yes.

388
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,780
Yuu-tsu, Ajihei has asked for this much.

389
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,860
If you don't help him, he'll kill you.

390
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,340
I-I understand.

391
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,260
Ready, start!

392
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,880
Cut!

393
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,460
You're the best!

394
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,580
Th-Thank you.

395
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,520
Next, we'll have Ajihei eat the Kamo-nape in the studio.

396
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,160
Please!

397
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,240
Ready, start!

398
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,480
Lord Ajihawa, it's done. Please eat.

399
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,340
Oh, I see.

400
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,960
Chuta, the Kamo-nape here is excellent.

401
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,100
Now, eat.

402
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,700
Yes, sir.

403
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,380
It's delicious!

404
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,740
I'm sure it is.

405
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,280
Amazing.

406
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,560
Ajihei is really happy to have eaten Yuu-tsu's cooking.

407
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,280
Kankichi, Yuu-tsu is really amazing.

408
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,080
Cut!

409
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,860
Perfect!

410
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,820
Thank you for your hard work.

411
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,220
Thank you.

412
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,220
I ate it.

413
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,280
That was really delicious Kamo-nape, Mr. Ghiboshi.

414
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,320
Thank you.

415
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,960
I'm sorry.

416
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,360
I can't be more impressed.

417
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
Ajihei is a very good cook.

418
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,080
He praised me for that.

419
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
He told me to be more happy.

420
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,740
Y-Yes.

421
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,960
Yuu-tsu is the happiest person in Japan.

422
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
I can be more confident in my cooking skills.

423
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,480
Y-Yes.

424
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,760
Wow!

425
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,160
I've gained confidence.

426
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,960
I want to go back to the restaurant and cook more.

427
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,580
Kankichi, I'm sorry but I'll leave it to you.

428
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,800
Hey, you're still wearing the costume.

429
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,240
Oh, he left.

430
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,440
He's really a strong guy.

431
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,140
I got an autograph from Ajihei.

432
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,440
But I'll keep it as a treasure for the rest of my life.

433
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,580
You really like historical dramas.

434
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:12,840
What do you like?

435
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,080
Oh, I'm shooting another one.

436
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,280
Let's go, Kankichi.

437
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,360
Okay.

438
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,200
What's wrong, Kankichi?

439
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,600
Oh!

440
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,480
They're here!

441
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,980
Why are you running away?

442
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,220
Oh, no!

443
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,940
I'm going to leave Lemon alone again.

444
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,420
I'm going to borrow this.

445
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,380
I'm going in!

446
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:38,600
Oh, no!

447
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:38,960
I don't know!

448
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,480
I'm so sorry.

449
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:42,660
Oh, no!

450
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:42,860
Why don't you leave?

451
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:43,940
Oh, no!

452
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,360
I'm leaving.

453
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:45,860
I'm sorry.

454
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,300
Bye.

455
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,880
Bye.

456
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:49,900
Bye.

457
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,140
Bye.

458
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:50,500
Bye.

459
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,700
Bye.

460
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,420
The filming of "Koumon-sama is going to America" is going smoothly.

461
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,560
Oh, are you Koumon Mito, chief?

462
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,900
Yeah, I'm doing the site report.

463
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,980
Senpai, you're also in Kyoto, right?

464
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,980
I'm sure you're playing around.

465
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,080
In other words, here, ah!

466
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,800
Kankichi! Koumon-sama is in danger!

467
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,040
I got it! Hold on tight!

468
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,660
pai! - Even Lemon

469
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:33,940
-chan! - Why is Ryozu on TV? - - - - K

470
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,320
ankichi

471
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,600
is here,

472
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:41,960
so it's okay. Thank you, Princess. You

473
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,340
're good at this,

474
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,700
you idiot!

475
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,480
Kankichi, send them to the

476
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,100
He's gone!

477
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,260
See, it's actually great.

478
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,400
Well, I'm totally paralyzed.

479
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,540
I can't lip-sync.

480
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,480
- It's all your fault! - - foi who?

481
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:20,120
- You can't lip-sync. It's all your fault! - You can't lip-sync. It's all your fault!

482
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,780
There was an unexpected thing during the filming.

483
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,260
It's a great happening!

484
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,900
Are you from Kyoto Prefecture?

485
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,560
No, I'm from Sakura.

486
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,300
I'm from Naku-Komodabaru.

487
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,020
I'm from Katsushika, and I'm from Ryo-tsu.

488
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
You're naked!

489
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,500
You even have a tattoo!

490
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,000
And you're the boss and I are the president!

491
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,860
What's with the tattoo?

492
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,560
You drew it earlier.

493
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,400
Our president and our chief.

494
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,740
You're looking so stupid!

495
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:55,360
Chief Ohara is a boss who can't help but get angry.

496
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,900
This is the limit!

497
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,180
Let me stop it!

498
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,580
That was a bad cut.

499
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,680
By the way, when is this report going to air?

500
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,740
It's live.

501
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,940
What?

502
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,560
Live?

503
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,960
Yes.

504
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,600
Boss, the president's head is steaming!

505
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,040
He just stood up!

506
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,720
Ryo-tsu, wait!

507
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,260
He ran out of nowhere!

508
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,120
That was just a joke!

509
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,220
I'm busy, so I'll take this!

510
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,060
Let's go, Raymond!

511
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:41,860
Wait!

512
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,200
Kankichi!

513
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,060
The head is steaming!

514
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
Raymond's happy!

515
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,460
Great!

516
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,040
Let's go home now!

517
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,260
Before the president comes!

518
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,560
Let me talk to him more!

519
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,880
I'm going to make you pay this time!

520
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,120
I'm going to make you pay this time!

521
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,740
I'm not giving up!

I don't want to be someone who fights for looks

If I go on a crooked road, the moon will run away

534
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,160
Because it's not everything now

535
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,080
Don't worry too much

Even if I lie and cheat a little

537
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,100
I'm helping someone sometimes

Baby, do you know me?

539
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,840
I have a nice breath heading for tomorrow

Don't get sick of it, I'll do what I have to do

541
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,200
A cute breath

542
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,140
What's hard to understand

543
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,060
I want to show you that

544
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,580
I'll show you

545
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,480
