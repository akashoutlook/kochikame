1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
Please turn on subtitles from the bottom-right corner.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,600
When you watch TV, please make the room bright and look away from it.

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,540
Come to me, you poor thing!

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,620
I'm not here, but I'm worried about you.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,960
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

6
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,120
You'll be fine eventually.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:58,300
Come to me, you jobless person!

8
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,980
Come to me, you jobless person!

9
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,380
I'm not here, but I'm worried about you.

10
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,500
Come to me, you jobless person!

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
I'm not here, but I'm worried about you.

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,960
Look at the red cloud burning.

13
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,680
You'll be fine eventually.

14
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,280
Do you understand?

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you understand?

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,460
If you understand, I'll be back!

17
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,320
The

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,380
A woman-public security officer

19
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,240
who houses a bank robbery

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,300
Indeed, Matoi-chan is amazing

21
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,140
At last, she is number one female that want to get married in fantasy novel

22
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,420
A presence that threatens with Reiko's name

23
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,720
Matoi-chan is young and cute

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,600
It's fine. It's a matter of time before I get fired.

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,800
As a senior who went to the wedding with Matoi-chan,

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,860
I think you have a complicated mind.

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,320
Hmph. It's such an old story. I forgot about it.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,740
Old? It's just a matter of time.

29
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,340
Well, it was a marriage with a financial purpose, so it's not impossible for Ryo-chan to forget.

30
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,780
Thanks to that, Matoi-chan's popularity has risen rapidly.

31
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,740
Senpai has made the number one position of men who don't want to get married 12 years in a row.

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,220
Shut up!

33
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,260
You should have asked me about that big woman from Jaja-uma!

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm sorry about that big woman from Jaja-uma.

35
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,060
M-Matoi!

36
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,540
Hey!

37
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,120
Good afternoon, Matoi-chan.

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,080
Hello.

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,400
A real Koban!

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,920
Matoi and I love each other.

41
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,320
If we get married, we can spend the rest of our lives together!

42
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,660
Nyahaha!

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,640
Huh?

44
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,100
You get it, right?

45
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,400
This is the true identity of Ryo-chan.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
N-No, Matoi!

47
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,220
I'm not lying!

48
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,060
But I'd like to give you a little...

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,420
Goodbye!

50
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:15,840
Ah!

51
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,280
That time...

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,200
That... What was it?

53
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,760
I'm already in a bad mood.

54
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,540
I don't mind at all.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Ehh!

56
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,680
Then you should mind it a little!

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
More importantly, Kankichi, there's something I want to ask you.

58
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,440
Huh? What is it?

59
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,920
Grandma wants you to...

60
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,220
...come to my house.

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,700
G-Geppalto?

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,100
I refuse!

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,200
Anyway, the guy with the amount is going to lecture me about how dirty money is, right?

64
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,000
No, it's not like that.

65
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,680
I'm in trouble because my computer is not working well.

66
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,220
It will affect business, too.

67
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,820
So, I'd like you to fix it quickly.

68
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,420
Huh?

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,400
If you want to make me eat a lot of sushi as a repair fee, you can consider it.

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,800
It started again.

71
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,780
It's Ryo-chan.

72
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,760
That's cheap.

73
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,600
Alright! I'll tell you tomorrow morning!

74
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm on a day off, so I'll pick you up by car until Ryo.

75
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,220
Yeah!

76
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,300
See you!

77
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,660
Hijiribashi! Hakusennagashi!

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,320
Next Morning

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,160
Oh, no...

80
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,460
Kankichi!

81
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,320
Ah, what's wrong?

82
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,500
Why have you looked at me that way?

83
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,440
I didn't mean to lecture you!

84
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,160
Anyway, could youping the computer out for me?

85
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,140
What's with you?

86
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,660
All of a sudden?

87
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,940
Get me a cup of tea!

88
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,380
Shut up!

89
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,780
*slurp*

90
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,160
*slurp*

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,720
Oh, looks like it's fixed.

92
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,320
Yeah, the capacity was too much.

93
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,260
I added a hard disk and memory, so it should be fine.

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,220
Look, Matoi.

95
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:06,680
What?

96
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,780
When Gepard came, he put a network all over the world to make sushi cheaply,

97
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,900
and he started a business on the Internet.

98
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,040
Thanks to that, our sushi became popular as the cheapest and best in Tokyo,

99
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,260
and sales doubled.

100
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,780
Yeah, it's true that it's a big deal to do this much in the first three months since I started using a computer.

101
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,940
But, you know, a computer with such a small capacity will be a big hit.

102
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,020
Besides, what is this?

103
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,320
What? What is this?

104
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:39,960
Grandma?

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,640
Such a bad taste.

106
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,120
He even explained the website.

107
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,900
There are 50,000 websites for young people, but there are no websites for old people, so I made it.

108
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,180
I thought it was good, but...

109
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,260
I'm making such a wasteful thing, so I'll freeze it.

110
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:00,820
Grandma.

111
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,080
Here you are.

112
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,180
You have a great appetite.

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,620
A man with a lot of food doesn't know what tolerance is.

114
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,220
Hello.

115
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,840
Oh, Mr. Nakagawa, Mr. Reiko.

116
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,720
Welcome.

117
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,140
Oh, you guys are here, too?

118
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,180
I came here for work, so I thought we might as well eat sushi.

119
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,960
Then today's my treat.

120
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,880
Order a lot.

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,660
But...

122
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,500
Matoi is always taking care of me.

123
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,360
Don't hesitate to eat.

124
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Here you are, senpai.

125
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,880
Oh, I ate a lot.

126
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,060
You even gave us a treat.

127
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,780
Thank you very much.

128
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,700
No, no.

130
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,780
Please come again.

131
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,180
Then, Gepard, call me again if there's anything on your computer.

132
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,160
If I ask you for everything, the store will collapse.

133
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
Of course.

134
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,700
Matoi, are you going somewhere?

135
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,760
I'm going to have some tea.

136
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,640
Then let's go together.

137
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,060
Right, Nakagawa?

138
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,320
Yes, please.

139
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,940
Oh, a meeting for the class meeting?

140
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,280
Yes.

141
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,760
It's been a year since I graduated, so we decided to gather together.

142
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
It's been a long time since we had a meeting.

143
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,480
Yes.

144
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,380
Huh?

145
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,140
Huh?

146
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,500
What are they doing?

147
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,780
They're playing the white line.

148
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,180
The white line?

149
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,100
Oh, I remember.

150
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,460
They were doing such a drama on TV.

151
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,620
They were wearing sailor suits on graduation day and playing it on the river.

152
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,080
Yes.

153
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,480
That's right.

154
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,500
Oh, I see.

155
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:45,760
They were wearing sailor suits.

156
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,220
It's a white line.

157
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,940
At the graduation ceremony in the United States, there was a ceremony.

158
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,800
One, two, three!

159
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,920
It's like a movie.

160
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,180
It's like a movie.

161
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,440
I know!

162
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:00,940
I know!

163
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,120
There was a ceremony.

164
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,460
I was given a thick dictionary at the graduation ceremony.

165
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,660
It's heavy and big, and it's hard to take home.

166
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,260
I know!

167
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,320
When there was a ceremony, I threw it in the stove.

168
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,540
Then it was passed down every year.

169
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:18,840
Well, this isn't a ceremony.

170
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,680
It's just a bad thing.

171
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,940
Hmm.

172
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,740
Oh, I'm right.

173
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,640
I got it right.

174
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,490
Really?

175
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,340
I did tell you so.

176
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,320
You didn't the button for the second button for the uniform to be given to girls?

177
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,380
Enoh, my head…

178
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,880
That's no such thing to do!

179
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,080
For the proof of the diploma, you are going to put sculpture on your desk.

180
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,240
Did you get that for your senior's warm welcome?

181
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,480
It's a nice message, isn't it?

182
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,520
It's too cruel.

183
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,300
It's just a scribble.

184
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,880
I'm an idiot because I've been doing that all the time without studying.

185
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,280
Shut up!

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,160
Um, are you Mr. Giboshi?

187
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,400
What?

188
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,280
It's Mr. Giboshi after all.

189
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,260
Mr. Giboshi!

190
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,300
We are his juniors.

191
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,060
I see. Today was the graduation ceremony.

192
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,820
Yes, I was a fan of you since high school.

193
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,580
I still remember the finals of the softball tournament.

194
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,840
It was the last round with one point lead.

195
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,260
The senior who was in the lead with two runs and two outs.

196
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,000
That reverse bye-bye homerun.

197
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,200
Even now, when I think about it, my chest is fluttering.

198
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,800
I'm so happy.

199
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,180
That home run is my treasure.

200
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,020
Matoi-chan was the 4th in the ace team.

201
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,300
That's why you're so strong.

202
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,160
Um, if you don't mind, can I shake your hand?

203
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,720
Sure.

204
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,100
I'm so happy.

205
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,360
Thank you very much.

206
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,680
I'm so happy.

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,440
Thank you very much.

208
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,840
Wow, you're so popular.

209
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,820
What should I do?

210
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,880
Thank you very much.

211
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,120
Thank you very much.

212
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,560
Senpai, please do your best at work.

213
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,820
Thank you.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,800
Excuse me.

215
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,340
Yay!

216
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,940
Yo, popular!

217
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,600
But how can you shake hands with girls?

218
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,880
I'm used to it.

219
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,480
My school is a girls' high school, so I often got Valentine's chocolate and love letters.

220
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,940
Matoi looks like a man.

221
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,880
That uniform is a part of Olin University, right?

222
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,300
Yes.

223
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,340
Wow.

224
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,400
What is it?

225
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,660
It's a high-level high school.

226
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,480
It's hard to get in.

227
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,080
See? You can see it from here.

228
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:48,800
Huh?

229
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,600
Behind Nikolai-doh.

230
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,140
There's a high school.

231
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,460
Unbelievable.

232
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,900
Ryo-chan is smart, but he's not.

233
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,500
What are you talking about?

234
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,760
Ryo-chan's brother is a lawyer, too.

235
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,760
Oh, I didn't know Kankichi had such a brother.

236
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,080
What's wrong with him?

237
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,020
He's a guy who only studies and has no brain.

238
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,300
But Kankichi is too stupid, isn't he?

239
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,880
Shut up!

240
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,560
I have too many other talents.

241
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,520
You went to such a good school, but why didn't you go to university?

242
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,200
That's right.

243
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,800
If you're Olin, you could have entered the school by escalator.

244
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,680
Well, think about it.

245
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,080
What if your life force is...

246
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,400
Hmm...

247
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,960
You've got me.

248
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,280
That caused a lot of troubles.

249
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,100
We hooked the X-men.

250
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:50,740
Now, you're in trouble.

251
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,200
I can't believe this.

252
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,820
You're so good at everything.

253
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,800
I never thought you'd come to this school.

254
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,680
What do you mean "strange"?

255
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,920
You're just known as a bit 'cute' debate.

256
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:06,740
Why are you such a student?

257
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,780
Police Officer of Fate"

258
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:09,920
A police officer of fate?

259
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,740
What is that?

260
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,820
That's me, Kou's winter.

261
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm really surprised.

262
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,580
And then, if you're a good boy, and then...

263
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,400
Ouch!

264
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,100
Ouch!

265
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,780
I'm sorry!

266
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,140
Big brother, are you okay?

267
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,560
Ah, no!

268
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,660
My shoulder bone is broken, and my motor...

269
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:28,920
Ouch!

270
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,180
Ouch!

271
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,900
I can't touch it!

272
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,540
I have to go to the hospital.

273
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,520
Hey, sis!

274
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,700
Can you get me out of the hospital?

275
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,540
I'm...

276
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:36,720
I'm...

277
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,120
No way!

278
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,380
Hey, guys, stop playing monkey games!

279
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,100
What did you say?

280
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,460
Show me a little.

281
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,160
Ah!

282
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:45,980
Ouch!

283
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:46,740
Hey!

284
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,680
What are you doing?

285
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,560
Haha!

286
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,820
Then your bones aren't broken.

287
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,580
Hey!

288
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,100
If you go out of the house, you're going to get hurt!

289
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:55,960
Hey!

290
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,100
Ouch!

291
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,620
Ouch!

292
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,160
Ouch!

293
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,340
You kid!

294
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,380
Ah!

295
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,080
Ah!

296
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:06,980
Huh?

297
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,340
W-what are you...?

298
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,860
I can tell by looking at you.

299
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,200
Or do you see the prince of the white horse?

300
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,840
Ah!

301
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,240
That...

302
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,700
Ouch!

303
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:23,740
Ouch!

304
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:24,920
Ah!

305
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,700
Ouch!

306
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,580
You bastard!

307
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,900
Ouch!

308
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,800
Ouch!

309
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,720
Ah!

310
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,040
Ouch!

311
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,660
Ah!

312
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,080
Ah!

313
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:34,800
Ouch!

314
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:34,820
Ouch!

315
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,600
Ouch!

316
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,560
Ouch!

317
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,280
Ouch!

318
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,600
Ouch!

319
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,720
Ouch!

320
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,020
Ouch!

321
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,380
Ouch!

322
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,500
Ouch!

323
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,060
Ouch!

324
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,860
Ouch!

325
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,240
Ouch!

326
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,220
Hey, hey, hey!

327
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,940
No, I'm just trying to make up for a certain incident.

328
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,940
That's why you're dressed like that.

329
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,620
Yeah.

330
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,700
See ya.

331
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,040
Oh, um, what's your name?

332
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,500
Hmph, I'm not that good of a name.

333
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,920
So cool.

334
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,280
Huh, it's like a movie or a drama.

335
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,440
It's like a drama.

336
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,240
The police were both so strong and strong,

337
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,780
I still remember them.

338
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,140
Could it be that Matoi-chan was the-

339
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,820
I fell in love with everyone.

340
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,580
Huh, don't be so casually Exodus.

341
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,520
The police handwriting you have is authentic, isn't it?

342
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,140
So, what happened?

343
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,800
What happened from there?

344
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah, I thought we'd meet again.

345
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,280
On a snowy day,

346
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,020
on a rainy day,

347
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,140
on a stormy day,

348
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,660
I looked for him on this bridge, but...

349
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,360
I couldn't meet him.

350
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,360
What? You met him?

351
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,820
On the graduation day?

352
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,760
How dramatic!

353
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,180
There is a destiny, you know.

354
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,640
Yeah, I know.

355
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,180
After the graduation ceremony,

356
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,300
we all gathered here

357
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,380
and tried to make a white line.

358
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,060
This is a farewell to high school life.

359
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,560
But we'll meet again at the university, right?

360
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,020
Actually, I'm not sure

361
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,380
if I should go to university.

362
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,020
What? No way!

363
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,580
Of course you're lying.

364
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,440
You already passed the entrance exam, right?

365
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,620
Yeah, right?

366
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,600
Don't scare me!

367
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,200
No, it's not that.

368
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,120
That girl is in danger.

369
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,820
She dropped the ball on the track!

370
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,320
The kid fell down!

371
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,760
What should we do?

372
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,280
Mr. Ekin!

373
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,840
Hold on to this!

374
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,160
Hold on to this!

375
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,280
Let go of me!

376
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,060
Let go of me!

377
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,240
Move!

378
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,840
Let go of me!

379
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,820
La-la-law!

380
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:34,780
The screen caught on fire in the middle of the day.

381
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,500
Bad's back!

382
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,260
Close the screen!

383
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,600
We're gonna make a headline.

384
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,700
"This is the game."

385
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,420
That's what you've been waiting for, right?

386
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,520
Zoom!

387
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,160
Zoom in on the next game!

388
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,940
*cough*

389
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,280
Now, hold on, kid.

390
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,560
You have to spit the water out!

391
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,920
*cough*

392
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,060
*cough*

393
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,140
Alright, you're safe now.

394
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,560
The police came right after that.

395
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,980
Thank you, Sis.

396
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,180
Mr. Kendo.

397
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,440
Yeah?

398
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,540
Thank you so much.

399
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,680
Take care.

400
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,340
Hey, don't be so reckless, even if you're a woman.

401
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,140
You're the one who always jumps into the river like that.

402
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,260
Really? I knew it.

403
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,440
Thank you so much for your help in rescuing me.

404
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,640
By the way, your address and name...

405
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,300
Huh?

406
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,520
Just say it. The police will be grateful.

407
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,600
See you.

408
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,020
Ah! Please wait!

409
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,260
I'm a police officer.

410
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,060
Huh?

411
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,480
A police officer?

412
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,900
Um, could you be the one who dressed like Santa Claus and jumped into the river last year?

413
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,080
I forgot about that long time ago.

414
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,360
That police officer is really cool.

415
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,000
You were looking at Kendo, weren't you?

416
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,720
What's so cool about him?

417
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,460
He's against violence!

418
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,100
Matoi, you didn't know who that police officer was after all?

419
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,420
No.

420
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,340
I just wanted to ask his name, but the mass media came.

421
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,620
I was surrounded and photographed.

422
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,180
There were a lot of interviews and interviews, and I was really surprised.

423
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,260
The next day, the police called me and gave me a thank-you letter.

424
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,740
I felt it was a good thing to help people.

425
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,680
So I decided to go out into the world and do something that would be good for people.

426
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,380
That's how you quit college and became a police officer.

427
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,740
Yeah.

428
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,180
I wanted to be a cool police officer like him.

429
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,300
That's what you're like, Matoi.

430
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,860
But who was the police officer of Kendo?

431
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,300
I don't know the name, but the police officer on the scene said that he was the person named Ryo from the Katsushika library.

432
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,780
What?

433
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,900
He was from the Katsushika library?

434
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,680
Yes.

435
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,240
So when I was assigned to the Katsushika library, I thought I might be able to meet that Ryo.

436
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,980
There's no such thing as Ryo in our library.

437
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,100
I wonder if there's a guy named Ryo.

438
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,560
There's no Ryo, but there's Ryoichi and Ryoji.

439
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,940
Hanamura Ryoichi and Nakata Ryoji, right?

440
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,740
But it wasn't those two.

441
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,180
What?

442
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,420
He's in our library!

443
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,200
Huh?

444
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,640
Who?

445
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,060
There! In front of us!

446
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,720
Huh?

447
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:36,680
Huh?

448
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,220
Hey, I'm not Ryo, I'm Kankichi!

449
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,300
Matoi, didn't the police officer on the scene say he was Ryo from the Katsushika library?

450
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,480
Yeah.

451
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,960
I'm Ryo.

452
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,640
I thought he was just a name, not a name.

453
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,840
But he's not Kankichi, is he?

454
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,260
There's no police officer who jumps into the river with a kendo mask on.

455
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,500
I remember!

456
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,200
Senpai!

457
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,240
Last spring, when we went to the kendo competition, there was a time when I couldn't take off my mask!

458
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,260
Oh, there was!

459
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,900
If you put in a memory bond so that the mask doesn't get loose, it won't go back to normal.

460
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,960
I won the competition, and the principal treated me to French cuisine, but I couldn't eat well because of the noodles.

461
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,760
So I ended up drinking a straw with a mixer.

462
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:35,120
Come to think of it, when I came back home, I saw the girls looking at the river below on the bridge.

463
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,800
So I looked down and saw that a boy was drowning in the river.

464
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,820
I jumped into the river in a reaction.

465
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,640
There was a high school girl who jumped into the river with me at that time.

466
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,980
That high school girl was Matoi!

467
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,900
Does that mean that Santa Claus is Ryo?

468
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,400
No, I don't think Santa Claus is me.

469
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,740
Oh, by the way!

470
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,140
When we were doing the bonus in winter the other day, I was stupid to Santa Claus to run away from the debtors.

471
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,100
I knew it.

472
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,780
Yeah.

473
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,980
I helped a high school girl who was involved in a yakuza while she was running away.

474
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,700
Is Santa Claus a police officer?

475
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,160
Well, yeah.

476
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,080
Damn it. Where did you run away?

477
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,540
Huh?

478
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,680
It's over there.

479
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:27,900
Oh?

480
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,780
It's over there.

481
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,320
It's over there.

482
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,880
So Santa Claus was running away from the debtors, not from the high school girls.

483
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,560
Well, yeah.

484
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,060
No way.

485
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,060
No way.

486
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,400
My precious memories...

487
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,460
Oh, it was a nightmare.

488
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,640
I can't believe I fell in love with such a guy twice.

489
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,420
Well, thanks to that, you became a police officer, so that's fine.

490
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,500
Nonsense!

491
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,420
Matoi!

492
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:10,980
Huh?

493
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,200
Oh, everyone!

494
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,360
You came late, so I came to look for you.

495
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,820
So you were here.

496
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,980
Everyone, how was college?

497
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,380
It was fun.

498
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,860
If only we didn't have a test.

499
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,940
Matoi, don't you regret not going to college?

500
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,480
Yeah.

501
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,200
Anyway, the graduation ceremony was halfway through.

502
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,180
Oh, right.

503
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,500
The kid fell into the river and it wasn't that bad.

504
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,640
Hey, why don't we continue the graduation ceremony now?

505
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:38,960
Why don't we start now?

506
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,160
Huh?

507
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,580
But we don't have any scarves.

508
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,240
How about we replace it with a handkerchief?

509
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,880
Oh!

510
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,280
That's a good idea for Kankichi.

511
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,020
Huh?

512
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,060
That's not necessary for Kankichi!

513
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,180
Oh, did Santa help you here in high school?

514
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,720
Huh?

515
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,760
You remember?

516
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,760
Yeah.

517
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,580
Thank you for that time.

518
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,580
Oh, no, it's nothing.

519
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,800
You seem to have been overshadowing your image.

520
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,660
It reminds me of high school.

521
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,960
The one a year ago.

522
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,780
It feels like I'm graduating safely.

523
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,500
It's a little short, but...

524
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,240
Okay, I'm ready.

525
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,660
Here we go.

526
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,660
One, two, three.

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,700

00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,460
Goodbye, my time as a student.

535
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,920
The End

536
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,200
It's like someone is calling me

537
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,700
After the rain

538
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,200
I walked while looking back

539
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,980
My mother held my hand

540
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,020
At that time I felt

541
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,140
A strange feeling

542
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,380
So

543
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,180
I took the Ake-do-gai

544
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,180
Tile

545
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,480
And walked

546
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,460
On the black road

547
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,020
Everyone was a child once

548
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,520
But everyone forgets

549
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,840
Politicians with a great face

550
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,220
And a blue-eyed lady

551
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,140
Turn around

552
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,320
And look

553
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:05,880
At the corner of the street

554
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,340
Everyone can meet everyone

555
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,580
Let's go!

556
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,940
There is a turtle

557
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,220
Ah, there must be a turtle

558
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,960
Everyone come to our town

559
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,440
Thank you!

560
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,980
Huh? A child is born at Kinjiro's place?

561
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,300
He's a child born at Kinjiro's place?

562
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,140
Oh, I'm a child born too

563
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,960
You mean, he's an old man

564
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,900
It's impressive

565
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,820
Wait for me

566
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,320
Mr. Kanchichi is going right now

567
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,860
Next episode

568
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,360
To a dear brother

569
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,580
I'm in your care

570
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,760
There is a turtle there

571
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,580
Ah, there must be a turtle

572
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,740
Everyone come to our town

573
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,800
Thank you!

574
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm not sure what to do.
