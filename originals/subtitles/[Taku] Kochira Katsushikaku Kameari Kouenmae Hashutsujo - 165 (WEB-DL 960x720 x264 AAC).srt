1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,600
When you're watching TV

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,300
Make sure to keep your room light and keep your distance

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:25,220
It's like someone's calling you

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,200
After the rain

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,040
You look back and walk

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,460
Hold your mother's hand

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,060
That's when I felt

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,500
A strange feeling

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,660
So

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,360
I walked on the dark side of the arcade

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,940
Just a bit

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,320
Everyone was a child once

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,340
But

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,400
Everyone has forgotten

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,240
The politicians with a big face

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,780
And the blue aunt above their eyes

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,460
Turn around and look

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,220
At that corner

19
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,800
You'll see everyone

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,540
There's a turtle over there

21
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,320
There's definitely a turtle

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,400
There's a turtle

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone come to our town

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,680
Thank you!

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,640
Hyper President's Family Service

26
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,300
Hello!

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,060
I lost again!

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,140
I'll call you when I get there

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,620
That's funny

30
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,840
That's right, Manchi-san was a good kid

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,280
That's right, that's right

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,100
You were a little different from when we were kids

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,340
You're not a bit of a仔

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,560
Didn't you have a turtle?

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,220
You have a turtle?

36
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,060
I do know you

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,460
I'm a little bit supposed to be a turtle

38
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,140
But with this turtle

39
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,760
It is

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,140
There's something I want to say

41
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,900
There's a turtle

42
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,120
Not a turtle

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,500
I want to be a turtle

44
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,860
I want to be a turtle

45
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,000
There's a turtle

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,220
A turtle

47
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,920
A turtle

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,620
That's a turtle

49
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,700
I want to have a turtle

50
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:25,940
Do you have any money?

51
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,600
I don't have any money.

52
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,300
I'll pay you with a taxi ticket.

53
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,160
Hey! Don't do something like a working man!

54
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,640
I don't have any cash.

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
I only have cards.

56
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,440
You're so cheeky!

57
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,080
Why do you have a credit card when you don't have any money?

58
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,080
No, I have money.

59
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,260
I have a bank account for the game software I'm thinking of.

60
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,300
I earned about 20 million yen last year.

61
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,780
20 million yen?

62
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,960
You're a kid, but you earn more than I do.

63
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,880
You're a cheeky kid.

64
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,420
Calm down.

65
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,460
His father is the president of a super electronic engineering company.

66
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,480
He's good at computers.

67
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,980
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,920
You're a kid, but you earn more than I do.

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,100
Excuse me.

70
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,800
It's me.

71
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,380
What?

72
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,780
I'm at my parents' house in Katsushika.

73
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,700
You talk like an adult.

74
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,180
Do you keep the test questions in your mail?

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,040
OK. I'll download it and send it to you.

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,660
A high-tech land cell is out.

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,440
It's much thinner than the land cell I saw before.

78
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,680
High-tech devices are evolving day by day.

79
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,900
What are you doing?

80
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,880
I'm connecting it to my cell phone and downloading data from my partner.

81
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,980
I'm downloading the data I saw earlier.

82
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,400
You're copying the data to the electronic notebook this time.

83
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,320
I hate elementary school students.

84
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,820
You're copying the data to the electronic notebook this time.

85
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,380
It's done.

86
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,020
But when you show the land cell, you'll go back to normal elementary school.

87
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,800
What?

88
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,000
What are you going to start next?

89
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,940
What are you doing this time?

90
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,500
I'm going to play a video game.

91
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,900
It seems to be navigating.

92
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:17,980
He seems to be doing a navigation.

93
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,620
Well then, I have a specification.

94
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,160
I'll excuse myself.

95
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,380
Hey! What's a specification?

96
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,380
Is that a job question?

97
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,260
You're a junior, but you use a professional term.

98
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,040
It will appear from the corner soon.

99
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,340
Sir, please hold this.

100
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,080
Flas, why are you here?

101
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,620
I got a message from my father.

102
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,840
My mother took the minus and left home.

103
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,040
He told me to stop him.

104
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,940
Well, if you come by yourself,

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,360
you can't let your son do that.

106
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,980
My mother won't go home.

107
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,400
It's useless for my mother to run away.

108
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,080
The car has a transmitter.

109
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,600
You can easily navigate the location.

110
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,600
Well, then I'll go here.

111
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,260
I have an idea.

112
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,520
Let's go, Minus.

113
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,780
Mother, it's useless.

114
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,240
Minus has a transmitter.

115
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:27,960
Why?

116
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,760
You're scary.

117
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,120
Calm down, mother.

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,760
Let's go to the station and talk calmly.

119
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,900
I can't stand it anymore.

120
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,340
Look at this.

121
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,200
What's this?

122
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,240
What's this?

123
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,560
It's like a kindergarten goods.

124
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,860
By the way...

125
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,920
A computer.

126
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,140
It's the age of information.

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,100
You have to have a kindergarten card.

128
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,100
Flas, keep your mouth shut.

129
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,060
Yes.

130
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,460
It has DVD player,

131
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,740
mobile phone and TV.

132
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,800
It has a lunch box and a mini microwave.

133
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,320
And it has a gas for safety.

134
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,660
It has a gas for safety.

135
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,560
It has a gas for safety.

136
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,100
It's a small version of the high-tech land cell.

137
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,160
Yes.

138
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,540
Like Plus, Minus is trying to use it as a monitor for a new product developed by the company.

139
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:30,920
I think I can understand why you want to stay home.

140
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,940
Right?

141
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,100
I don't want to be Minus like Plus, who is completely high-tech and has no emotions.

142
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,520
I don't want to be Minus.

143
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,360
The area of this platform is...

144
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,460
The area of this platform is...

145
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,140
Look, your mother and brother are trying to do it at home,

146
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,440
but you don't take classes online.

147
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:48,880
Look, your mother and brother are trying to do it at home,

148
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,300
but you don't take classes online.

149
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,800
Don't get too excited.

150
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,580
I'm the one who's bothering you in the couple fight.

151
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
I can't do anything about it.

152
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,580
I'll download the class content for my friends later.

153
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,300
Banji is like this.

154
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,260
She doesn't have any childish emotions.

155
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,620
She's been like this for a while...

156
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:12,900
Look, Plus.

157
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,500
Look at this.

158
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,340
This flower is beautiful.

159
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
Wait a minute.

160
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,900
The correct name is Campanula, Mom.

161
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,240
It's a herbivorous plant.

162
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,860
Plus has no normal feelings that are beautiful just by looking at the flowers.

163
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,720
All you have is information and knowledge.

164
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,860
R-right.

165
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,720
R-right.

166
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,140
Right?

167
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,380
Okay, I'll meet Chishuya and complain.

168
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,760
Really?

169
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,440
Yeah, I'll tell him.

170
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,000
Right now, I'll get back to work.

171
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,620
Yeah.

172
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,700
S-sorry.

173
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,460
Where are you going?

174
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,540
I have a job.

175
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,880
My wife is in town.

176
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,280
Let's go back.

177
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,040
Hello.

178
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,740
The store is closed.

179
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,300
Please give me a ride.

180
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,040
Thanks.

181
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,580
It'll be fine.

182
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,060
That's right, cheat code "Unlocked".

183
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,160
Oh, Mom! You're back!

184
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,560
Good work, Plus!

185
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,120
Honey, I haven't said anything about going home yet.

186
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Huh? Really, Plus?

187
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,040
Yes, Mr. Ryochi. I'll be in your care from now on.

188
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, Ryochi. Who's that?

189
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,880
It's Mr. Omari, who used to monitor the Super Electric GX 767.

190
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:46,200
Oh, Mr. Ryochi. Thanks to your monitor, the problem of the Super Electric GX 767 was solved.

191
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,280
I had a hard time back then.

192
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,840
Now, the Super GX 777, which has improved the problem and has been sold worldwide, is selling.

193
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,240
It's a hit product with a sales of over 2 million units.

194
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,500
Oh, it's thinner than before and cooler.

195
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,860
Mr. Ryochi, you're really smart.

196
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,160
Yeah.

197
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,200
Hey! I'm not here to hear that kind of bragging!

198
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,080
Stop using your own sons as monitors!

199
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,140
That's impossible! If you try it with money, the development will be exposed!

200
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm doing this to research better products, so I'm making my heart a demon.

201
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,120
You're a criminal, so you don't have the guts to complain!

202
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,880
Shut up! Is it okay for you to lose your elementary school-like emotions for that?

203
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,700
Ugh...

204
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,720
Plus, you're an 8-year-old elementary school student.

205
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,560
You can't laugh or cry at all!

206
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,280
And it's all thanks to you monitoring your own company's products!

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,220
At this rate, you'll grow into a human who has no blood or tears, and you might be kicked out of the company, and Plus will become the president!

208
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,920
Hmph. That's pretty good.

209
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,680
What?

210
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,940
The future of the high-tech industry is an era of downfall.

211
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
If Plus can be that strong...

212
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,100
I'm satisfied.

213
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,860
My wife, you can't do this. You should get a divorce.

214
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,500
Yes.

215
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,240
And you?

216
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,020
I'm going to go back to my parents' house.

217
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,340
Mom! You love her so much, but you can't do that!

218
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,060
Hmph.

219
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,220
R-Ryotsu, what should I do?

220
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,060
Just treat her like a normal father, and treat her as a plus.

221
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,860
Even if you say I'm a normal father...

222
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,720
For example, you can play catch ball on your break.

223
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,080
Catch ball?

224
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,800
You've played it a lot, haven't you, Plus?

225
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,620
Yes.

226
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,620
What? I've never seen it.

227
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,060
How fast can you go?

228
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,120
About 130 km/h.

229
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,140
Okay.

230
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,860
Here I go, Dad.

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,760
Nice ball!

232
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,760
Now it's your turn, Dad. Let's go, Plus!

233
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,760
You idiot!

234
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,900
What?

235
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,200
Is there anyone who can play catch ball virtually?

236
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,520
I'll go back to my parents' house.

237
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,620
M-Mom...

238
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,620
R-Ryotsu...

239
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,660
Is there any other way to interact with Plus?

240
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,480
That's right.

241
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,900
Tomorrow's Sunday.

242
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,180
How about forgetting about studying and work and playing in an amusement park?

243
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,160
Then the virtual amusement park software is here.

244
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:17,820
No!

245
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,220
It's not a game.

246
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,400
You actually play by touching each other's skins.

247
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,160
I see.

248
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,160
Then, Plus and I will go to Kazushika Wonderland.

249
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, that's fine.

250
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,120
That would be a problem.

251
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,960
President, Mr. Smith will come to visit tomorrow, so...

252
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,780
No!

253
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:34,660
No!

254
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,600
I'll go to the children's school tomorrow.

255
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,700
You finally understand.

256
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,160
Yeah, of course.

257
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,660
Okay.

258
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,480
I promise!

259
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,520
That's good, Plus.

260
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,540
Let's go back to the school.

261
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,100
Okay.

262
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,740
Thank you for your hard work.

263
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,760
President, we finally got an hour's time to talk to you.

264
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,380
I have to make a contract with you for tomorrow afternoon.

265
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,180
Yeah...

266
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,960
President, your father and I are really struggling.

267
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,780
That's right.

268
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,240
Contract!

269
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,600
*whisper*

270
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,440
I see...

271
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,280
That was good.

272
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,560
Yeah, but I think it's impossible for them to enjoy the amusement park like normal parents and children.

273
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,020
I agree.

274
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,420
Ryotsu-san, can you keep an eye on those two?

275
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,260
Eh?

276
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,260
I'll pay you back.

277
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,060
Thank you.

278
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,180
Thank you?

279
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,780
I got it! I'll leave this place to you, Kankichi!

280
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,460
According to the navigation, it's a traffic jam.

281
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,660
It's Sunday, so it can't be helped.

282
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,860
Dad, if we go at this pace, it'll take 72 minutes to get to Wonderland's parking lot.

283
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,840
Yeah, plus, that's a bit different.

284
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,040
Let me show you.

285
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,140
The capacity of this parking lot is 1,500 units.

286
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,440
According to the internet, 120 units will be filled.

287
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,420
If they're full, you can't enter.

288
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,820
If you're at this position, you have a 52.63% chance of entering.

289
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,360
I see. I forgot to enter the entry regulations in the data.

290
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,640
Yeah. I forgot to enter the entry regulations in the data.

291
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,120
I forgot to enter the entry regulations in the data.

292
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,620
You guys, cut it out! We're not here to calculate! We're here to play!

293
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,880
Poshu!

294
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,320
Sorry, I just got here this week.

295
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,360
Geez, what a parent.

296
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,360
Let's go, Plus.

297
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,120
Wait a minute!

298
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:38,660
Huh?

299
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,800
You don't need a land cell to go play, do you?

300
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,960
But my friends might e-mail me.

301
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,140
Plus, you're going to play a lot with me today, so leave that out of it.

302
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,100
Okay.

303
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,560
Nagagawa!

304
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,240
Let's go, Poshu.

305
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,760
Okay.

306
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,040
Well, I'll leave it in the car.

307
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,260
Okay.

308
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,020
Haha.

309
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,360
Let's play a lot, Plus.

310
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,020
Again!

311
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:02,920
Cool.

312
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
W-What is it?

313
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,100
I only have a video camera.

314
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,880
Why are you wearing a suit when you're playing?

315
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,460
N-No reason. I love suits.

316
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,420
Change into this.

317
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,980
Do I have to change?

318
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,360
That's right!

319
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,520
I can't help it.

320
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,160
I have to change.

321
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,180
I have to change.

322
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,420
What's that?

323
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,080
It's a hyper business suit developed by my company.

324
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,340
It's a revolutionary suit that includes all business tools in a suit.

325
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,240
T-This is amazing!

326
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,320
Don't say that!

327
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,040
It's also Poshu!

328
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,700
That's it.

329
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,240
I don't have any complaints.

330
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,800
I don't have anything else.

331
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,560
You're right.

332
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,500
Yeah.

333
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,880
Nakagawa Metal Detector.

334
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,160
Yes.

335
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,640
Nakagawa Metal Detector.

336
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:53,940
Hmm?

337
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,000
Huh?

338
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,440
There's something in the belt!

339
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,900
Y-You!

340
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,280
I think the metal detector is a foul play.

341
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,400
Tsk.

342
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,640
Oh, there's a Pokebell in the buckle.

343
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,120
What else?

344
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,280
A TV in the soles.

345
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,700
The clock is on the internet.

346
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,780
This Mamey-su is a radio.

347
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,940
You're James Bond!

348
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,420
Hahaha.

349
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,800
Are you talking something?

350
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,700
You can't be so serious.

351
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,280
Hey, hey.

352
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,200
What are you doing?

353
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,300
Are you playing along?

354
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,900
Don't touch me.

355
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,380
Oh, is it?

356
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,980
Anything?

357

358
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,640
It seems like you finally become like your father.

359
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,260
What do you think?

360
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,780
I can't get any closer.

361
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,540
You guys, listen up!

362
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,540
Let's make a line and shoot one by one!

363
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,940
Dad, the video is fine.

364
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,580
No, I'll do something. Just wait there.

365
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,140
I have to do something as your father.

366
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,560
Alright!

367
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,980
I brought Macky here!

368
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,540
Look, look!

369
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,260
Now, Plus!

370
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,380
You're with Macky.

371
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,100
It's fine. I don't really like Macky.

372
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,000
You're really happy to hear that, right?

373
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,420
Look, smile!

374
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,760
Where's your father?

375
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,720
Plus, what do you want to be with next?

376
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,940
Choose what you like.

377
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,380
Dad, it's fine.

378
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,600
Then, let's ride a ride next.

379
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:51,780
How about that?

380
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,020
Looks like your father has gradually become your father.

381
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,280
That's so normal!

382
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,000
A job is like nothing else!

383
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,640
The longer you play with your father, the richer you become!

384
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,400
It seems like he finally woke up.

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,540
Yeah.

386
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,540
Hm? No!

387
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,600
It's time to have a talk with Mr. Smith.

388
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,100
Ah, Plus!

389
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,480
What is it?

390
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,960
Let's take a video in front of the fire place.

391
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,680
Stand in front of it.

392
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,840
Understood.

393
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,640
Let's take a video in front of the fire place.

394
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:24,720
I'll do it.

395
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,760
Mr. Smith is negotiating.

396
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay, show me the supplies.

397
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,640
Yes.

398
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,220
This is the paper work of a paper that has solar cells.

399
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,520
How about 10 meters for $10,000?

400
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,200
Hm. It seems to be of good performance.

401
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,980
But $10,000 is expensive.

402
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,300
Hey, where are you taking it?

403
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,820
Plus is over here!

404
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,360
Oh, that's right!

405
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,820
Why is there an antenna on the video camera?

406
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,060
There is an antenna on the video camera.

407
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,740
This is better.

408
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,220
Hm?

409
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,700
Oh, this flower is really beautiful.

410
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,180
I want to put a flower cut on the camera.

411
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,220
Ryotsu seems to have noticed.

412
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,520
I'll contact you later.

413
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,440
What did you do by saying something to the video camera?

414
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,520
No, I recorded it with Hesse.

415
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,660
It's suspicious to hide.

416
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,940
Video is also confiscated!

417
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,900
Ah, that's all.

418
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,380
That's all?

419
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,240
Ah, no.

420
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,180
I wanted to take a lot of plus.

421
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,660
Don't just shoot videos.

422
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,900
Enjoy some attractions!

423
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,640
Yeah.

424
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,880
According to the information I saw on the Internet,

425
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,140
the jet coaster is relatively easy to ride at this time of day.

426
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,060
I see.

427
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,760
Then let's do it.

428
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,980
It's a mess.

429
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,520
I kept Smith waiting.

430
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,480
If this continues, the deal will be a par.

431
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,000
I can't help it.

432
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,480
I'll call you with a good response.

433
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,640
Hm?

434
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,400
Oh, here it comes.

435
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,860
It's my helicopter.

436
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,780
But how do I contact him?

437
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,600
Hm?

438
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,280
That's it.

439
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,580
Plus, let's play that game together.

440
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,520
Yes, that's fine.

441
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,000
Dad was beaten.

442
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,560
Dad, you're not good.

443
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,320
No, not yet.

444
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,620
Bang! Bang!

445
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,520
You finally became a normal dad.

446
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,260
It seems so.

447
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,800
Oh, Mr. Okuchi.

448
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,820
I was worried after all.

449
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,680
I guess I'll go for it.

450
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,020
I'll shoot down that helicopter.

451
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,720
Ba! Ba! Ba! Ba! Ba!

452
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,020
10,000 dollars is expensive.

453
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,400
8,000 dollars.

454
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,560
Tell me.

455
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,580
Keep your word.

456
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,660
Yes.

457
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,100
Yes!

458
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,920
Ah!

459
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,940
Ah!

460
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,020
Ah! Plus!

461
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,200
Got it!

462
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,780
Yes.

463
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:43,900
Hmm?

464
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,620
Hey, wait!

465
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,920
Ah!

466
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,600
*Screams*

467
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,940
*Screams*

468
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,720
*Screams*

469
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,500
*Screams*

470
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:56,820
Senpai!

471
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,860
*Screams*

472
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,640
Senpai, please hold on!

473
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,940
The culprit is...

474
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,200
Over there!

475
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,260
Damn it! I won't let you escape!

476
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,420
*Screams*

477
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,260
*Screams*

478
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,960
*Screams*

479
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,300
*Screams*

480
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,220
I'm coming!

481
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,180
*Screams*

482
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,140
*Screams*

483
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,600
*Screams*

484
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
*Screams*

485
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,280
*Screams*

486
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,480
*Screams*

487
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,200
*Screams*

488
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,520
Hey, you can't escape!

489
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,340
How about that?

490
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,560
*Screams*

491
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,360
*Laughs*

492
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,600
The helicopter is coming soon!

493
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,520
Stop it!

494
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,120
What are you doing?

495
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,080
What are you after?

496
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,920
I want all the data of the Hyper Learning Model

497
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,940
that your company is developing!

498
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,860
What?

499
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,400
If you want your son's life,

500
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,600
I'll send you the data!

501
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,440
I can't do it now!

502
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,600
The data is in the company!

503
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,460
Shut up!

504
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,560
I know you're carrying the important data in a disk!

505
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,460
What?

506
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,940
Are you serious?

507
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,360
Then give it to me!

508
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,360
Uncle, it's useless!

509
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,440
You're more important to the company than your family!

510
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,980
Don't ever get involved in any transactions!

511
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,140
Don't ever get involved in any transactions!

512
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,500
You idiot!

513
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,240
I'm sorry, but I want the disk from my Super Suit pocket!

514
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,440
I'm sorry, but I want the disk from my Super Suit pocket!

515
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,000
I understand!

516
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,580
You're the one who should be ashamed!

517
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,160
You're the one who should be ashamed!

518
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,980
Mr. Nakagawa, please wait!

519
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,060
What?

520
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,240
Please bring my land cell!

521
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,960
Hey, you!

522
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,280
Don't say unnecessary things!

523
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,780
Mr. Nakagawa, do you think your father will give you the secret?

524
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,760
Mr. Nakagawa, do you think your father will give you the secret?

525
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,420
What?

526
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,160
It could be a disk that contains nothing.

527
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,760
I'll check it out.

528
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,180
What did you read, Plus?

529
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,040
I'm not that cold-hearted!

530
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,200
Shut up!

531
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,040
You said something good!

532
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,340
Bring my land cell!

533
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,800
Bring my land cell!

534
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,980
Get out of the way!

535
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,420
The helicopter is coming!

536
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:11,580
The helicopter is coming!

537
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:17,500
The helicopter is coming!

538
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:17,740
The helicopter is coming!

539
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,080
Please wait.

540
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:18,940
Please wait.

541
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,360
It seems to be real!

542
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,020
I'm glad!

543
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:32,380
You're so clumsy!

544
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,440
The helicopter is coming!

545
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,040
Get out of the way!

546
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,260
Get out of the way!

547
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:45,820
Plus!

548
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,640
I'm glad you're safe!

549
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,680
Plus!

550
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,800
Dad.

551
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,560
It's so sweet to give you an important business secret like that!

552
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,300
It's so sweet to give you an important business secret like that!

553
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,840
Plus!

554
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,840
But I was very happy, father!

555
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,620
But I was very happy, father!

556
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,040
But Plus is over, Kazan!

557
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,380
But Plus is over, Kazan!

558
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:06,680
Plus!

559
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,160
Plus!

560
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,600
Hahahahaha!

561
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,100
You're a pretty good father, aren't you? I've seen you again.

562
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,540
That's right, senpai.

563
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,620
Plus-kun, you're a good father, that you're the president of a big company, and you forget to work and play all day.

564
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,460
You two are praising me too much.

565
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,480
Please look at the new product next time.

566
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,300
Wonderland Navigation?

567
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,460
If you put this software in your pocket computer and carry it around,

568
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,760
it will tell you what attractions are waiting for how many hours, and what is the target during the parade.

569
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,960
What? Did you get that information in there?

570
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,620
You really are a person who doesn't waste your time.

571
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,080
Hahahaha!

572
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,340
If you put this software in your pocket computer and carry it around,

573
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,860
it will tell you what attractions are waiting for you next time.

574
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,400
It is fall.

575
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,200
It's time to get ready for the parade.

576
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,540
It's time to get dressed up and set up.

577
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,220
Can't wait up to work.

578
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,780
Well, I'm going to bring Koko.

579
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,660
And with a lot of energy.

580
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:25,920
Well, Koko the captions, what is she saying?

581
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,520
She is angry, isn't she?

582
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,300
Hm!?

583
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,280
Oh, Koko!!

584
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,380
Let's get rid of the annoyance and cleanliness

585
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,600
No problem every day

586
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,300
If you go through the hot shower

587
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,240
No problem every day

588
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,180
Recover your health with a sleeping pillow

589
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,920
No problem every day

590
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,380
I love myself like this

591
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,340
I love myself like this

592
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,740
No problem every day

593
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,920
My heart is beating

594
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,140
Monday

595
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,320
Eh? The chief was fired?

596
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,300
And he said he couldn't do anything else in his 10-year police life?

597
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,620
It can't be helped, it's for the sake of my former boss

598
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,540
I'll find him a part-time job

599
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,540
Next time

600
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,440
I'll find him a part-time job

601
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,820
I'll find him a part-time job

602
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,840
There's a turtle over there

603
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,860
Ah, it must be a turtle

604
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,780
Everyone come to our town
