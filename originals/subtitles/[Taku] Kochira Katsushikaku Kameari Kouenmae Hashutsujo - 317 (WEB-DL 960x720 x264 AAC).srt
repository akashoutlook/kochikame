I have to drops my eyes all night.

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,680
Hm?

20
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,460
No good. Yep, I got the wrong room.

21
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,900
Oh! Ryo, where are you going?

22
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,980
Reiko?

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,880
Then this place is the exit before the park.

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,420
The Exit Full of Women

25
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,900
You're dressed up again.

26
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,900
There he is, the gorilla boy.

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,300
You don't have to come.

28
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,460
What?

29
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,200
You're late, Kankichi. You're completely late.

30
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,500
Sorry, Matoi.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,240
Why are you here?

32
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,680
What happened to the others?

33
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,720
The chief is on a business trip abroad.

34
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,160
I didn't hear that.

35
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,700
He suddenly went to work.

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,400
The monk fell off the stairs at home last night and was hospitalized.

37
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,840
So, Nakagawa-san said that the company was suddenly busy and he would take a break for a while.

38
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,840
Really?

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,680
Only Ryo-chan and I can't do anything.

40
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,920
So why are you here?

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,840
Well, let's go to the exit.

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,820
You're the ones who did this.

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,840
I came here on purpose.

44
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,400
It's natural to make it easier to work even a little.

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,040
What?

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,840
What?

47
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,960
Yes, yes. Let's start working with this.

48
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,260
Damn it.

49
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,740
What the hell?

50
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,380
What are you doing, Kankichi?

51
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,580
That's my line. That's my line. Don't use it without permission.

52
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,560
I see.

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:22,900
I see.

54
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,020
What happened?

55
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,280
I thought no one was using it because it was so dirty.

56
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,400
No way.

57
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,340
What was in the drawer?

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,460
It was just trash.

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,060
That's my collection.

60
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,740
Where did you put it?

61
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,440
I threw it away.

62
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,340
What?

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,500
That's the rare thing I've been collecting for tens of thousands of yen.

64
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,740
Well, on this occasion,

65
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,380
I'll give you a chance to work seriously.

66
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,460
You don't need a desk anyway, do you?

67
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,600
I use a desk, too.

68
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,880
It's only when you're writing a draft.

69
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,840
Right.

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,140
So,

71
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,360
your desk is enough.

72
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,640
Wow, what a great orange box.

73
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,320
Don't make fun of me.

74
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,560
I'm the best at this time without the director.

75
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,680
What are you doing?

76
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,440
Get out of here!

77
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,620
We've come to play.

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,840
Are you all right?

79
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,580
Let's have tea.

80
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,340
Some Sashi.

81
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,520
Thank you.

82
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,700
Huh?

83
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,340
Why is the floor here so mushy?

84
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,040
I don't know.

85
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,000
How... can I use it?

86
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,340
Help!

87
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,480
Watch out, kid!

88
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,720
You idiot!

89
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,780
Out of the way.

90
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:46,900
Ah!

91
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,480
Gah!

92
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:47,820
Gah!

93
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,240
Are you okay, Ryo?

94
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,920
Ugh!

95
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,080
I'm just fooling around in there!

96
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,300
That's right!

97
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,100
What?

98
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,860
I don't want to live in a place full of women!

99
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,720
Ryo, where are you going?

100
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,920
I'm going on a patrol!

101
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,060
You're not going to skip school, are you?

102
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,860
I'm sure you're going to a pachinko.

103
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,340
I said patrol, so I said patrol!

104
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,520
You're so suspicious of people.

105
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,760
It's not funny.

106
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,140
Let's change the mood.

107
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,740
Wasn't it a patrol?

108
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,060
Gah!

109
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,880
Matoi, when did you...

110
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,300
The director asked me to do it.

111
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
He said you'd skip school so don't look away.

112
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,760
Director?

113
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,840
You're such a nuisance.

114
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,280
Ah, Yumi Morioh is flying in the sky!

115
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,580
Eh? No way!

116
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,080
No way!

117
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,800
Ah!

118
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,280
Hey, Kankichi!

119
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,500
Ah, but I can't help being followed around in the middle of the night.

120
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,040
Ah!

121
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,200
That's...

122
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,240
Money!

123
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,780
Haha!

124
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,460
Yay!

125
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:07,600
Yay!

126
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,820
I'll take it back.

127
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,140
Matoi!

128
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,600
Oh, dear.

129
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,140
I didn't expect to get caught by such a simple hand.

130
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,180
Yes, patrol well.

131
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,520
This is a dog walk.

132
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,180
Oh, dear.

133
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,520
What a boring day.

134
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,780
Let's go back to my room and play a game.

135
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,040
Sakonji, let's play a game.

136
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,720
Sakonji, are you there?

137
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,560
Sakonji-san isn't here.

138
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:48,980
Huh?

139
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,900
He's supposed to be at the Judo training camp in Izu from today.

140
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,220
Ah, I see.

141
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,180
I guess I'll have to go with Honda.

142
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,920
Honda-san is going to Shirobai's Shido in Tohoku.

143
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,320
What's he going to do?

144
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,580
Huh?

145
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,340
I've met Hojo.

146
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,260
Hojo-san will stay at a hotel for a study session.

147
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,100
Uh, maybe someone else...

148
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,020
Today, there aren't many people either,

149
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,220
either on time or at night.

150
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,180
What?

151
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,220
"Occult Club"

152
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,880
"Occult Club"

153
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,400
"Occult Club"

154
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,920
"Occult Club"

155
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,240
Shut up, all of you!

156
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,000
It's in the way of business!

157
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,280
It's fine.

158
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,160
It's break time anyway, so...

159
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,480
You still have your rejoining.

160
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,340
I have to deliver the

161
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:39,640
check!

162
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,700
Huh?

163
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,820
Hmm...

164
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,960
Hmm...

165
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,460
Hmm...

166
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:44,780
Hmm...

167
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,680
Ah, I got the kanji wrong!

168
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,680
Eh?

169
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,560
I really can't believe it!

170
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,440
It's your fault we were distracted!

171
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,300
If you want a break, then let's take a break!

172
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,140
Hey, don't blame others!

173
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,560
Why do I have to be ordered by you?

174
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,600
Everyone, let's take a break to calm down!

175
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,480
Yes!

176
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,240
Reiko-san is right!

177
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,140
Let's all go!

178
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:11,720
Yes!

179
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,620
Hey, you!

180
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,340
I'm more important than Reiko!

181
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,540
They're so noisy!

182
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,920
It's like that when women gather.

183
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,240
It's the same abroad.

184
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,060
Women like to talk.

185
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,460
Women...

186
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,260
Hmm?

187
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,040
It suddenly became quiet.

188
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,860
Yeah, what's wrong?

189
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,220
Hmm...

190
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,200
If it's quiet, I don't care about it.

191
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,120
Is that so?

192
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,020
Isn't that wrong?

193
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,140
What are you doing?

194
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,000
Ah, it has nothing to do with you.

195
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,040
Shishi!

196
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,660
I don't care if you tell me what you're doing.

197
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,580
Hmm?

198
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
What are you making a bag?

199
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm making it with a hair tie.

200
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,700
I can't go ahead from here.

201
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,820
Hmm?

202
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,820
Let me see.

203
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,860
Ah!

204
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,740
I see.

205
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,720
Hey!

206
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,440
Shut up and look!

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,680
Here.

208
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:08,840
Here.

209
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,100
It's amazing.

210
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,700
I'm reducing the number of eyes like this.

211
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,980
And I remove one by one.

212
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
And I knit them.

213
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,040
Look, naturally, the end is curving, right?

214
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,880
Awesome!

215
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:23,980
It's elegant.

216
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,940
Wow...

217
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,380
Look.

218
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,880
Oh, thank you!

219
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,320
It's like a professional did it!

220
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,580
Hey, how do you make this?

221
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
It's not in the book.

222
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,000
Hmm?

223
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,700
Ah, is this a beeswax?

224
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:36,840
Mark?

225
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,220
It's easy with flowers.

226
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,300
You know how to do it?

227
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,840
Yeah.

228
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,920
You make a ring with the beads,

229
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,100
and then you wrap it around like this,

230
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,040
and then you do this.

231
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,080
And you have an aura!

232
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,820
Wow!

233
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,800
That's amazing!

234
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,720
You can make it with such a thick ring.

235
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,640
Ryo-chan is basically a master of craft.

236
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,180
Can you watch this too?

237
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:01,880
Sure.

238
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,480
I can't believe you could do something like that even though you're an angel.

239
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,520
I can't believe it.

240
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,280
It's about time for lunch.

241
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,200
Agreed!

242
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,400
So, what should we have for lunch today?

243
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,260
I brought lunch.

244
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,400
Let's eat lunch together.

245
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,720
Of course!

246
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,840
Okay.

247
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,760
Here we go again.

248
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,860
Ryo-chan,

249
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,800
here's some for you.

250
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,460
Huh?

251
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:34,620
Huh?

252
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,740
Huh?

253
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,060
Oh!

254
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:36,920
Oh!

255
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,120
Th-this much?

256
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,740
I got a lot of help yesterday.

257
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,320
Here's a thank you.

258
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,220
Oh, I didn't know this was...

259
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:47,900
Teacher!

260
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,660
This is for you!

261
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,600
Thank you for the lunch!

262
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,020
You're like a female teacher.

263
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,260
Then, thank you for the lunch!

264
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,960
It's good!

265
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,820
Really?

266
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Try this!

267
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,980
Thank you.

268
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,600
This is delicious.

269
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,180
How did you make this?

270
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,780
Do you like it, Ryo-chan?

271
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,460
Yeah!

272
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,900
I want you to tell me what happened yesterday.

273
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,740
Sure.

274
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,100
Yum!

275
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,240
Hey, Reiko.

276
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,880
I'm making dessert.

277
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,800
But you didn't decorate well like in the pictures.

278
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,180
I can't do it.

279
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,220
Oh, this is a little difficult.

280
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,700
Which one?

281
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,860
Oh, I've made this before.

282
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,940
I'll make it.

283
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,080
I wonder if it's like this.

284
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,700
Amazing! It looks delicious!

285
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,100
I can't believe it.

286
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,600
How can you make something like this?

287
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,940
I taught Ryo-chan how to make dessert before.

288
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,220
He mastered it in no time.

289
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,800
If you have materials, I'll make more.

290
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,900
What?

291
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,880
Well, you'll see.

292
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,460
Thank you for waiting.

293
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,220
Beautiful!

294
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,120
It's more beautiful than in Japan.

295
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,340
It's wonderful to cut fruits.

296
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,680
My grandmother, who rarely praises people, praised her for her knife skills.

297
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,480
She can do anything unexpectedly.

298
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,760
Except for work.

299
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,600
Useless!

300
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,140
Ü meng cek!

301
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Interestingly, she couldn't write it well even though it was in Japanese, but in Japanese she founded an empire of Japanese women.

302
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,340
Yui

303
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,960
Yu

304
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,340
I can't do it.

305
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,660
Beautiful!

306
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,680
Looking delicious!

307
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,780
I got an extra bowl of sushi and ingredients to share.

308
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,700
Can you exchange them?

309
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,580
Yes, I made a lot.

310
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:52,980
That's why I made it.

311
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,660
Me too.

312
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,180
Me too.

313
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,780
Come on, eat more.

314
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,160
Which one should I choose?

315
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,380
It's been melting in my mouth.

316
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,280
It's good.

317
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,040
Here, it's done.

318
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,460
It's beautiful.

319
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,520
Next, I'll do it.

320
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,560
Okay.

321
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,220
I did it.

322
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,080
It's done.

323
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,180
What?

324
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,340
Is it done already?

325
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,300
It's a handmade dress.

326
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,500
I thought it would be a little more difficult.

327
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,440
I'm glad you taught me.

328
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,400
Yes, I'm grateful to Kankichi.

329
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,240
Kankichi.

330
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,600
Until now, he didn't call me by my name.

331
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,100
Hey, hurry up and wear it.

332
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:48,200
Wait a minute, Komachi.

333
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,500
What?

334
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,260
It's not good.

335
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,180
Before I saw it.

336
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,560
No.

337
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,420
If you're there, say you're there.

338
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,280
I've been there since a while ago.

339
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,920
Come on, hurry up and wear it.

340
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:00,920
I understand.

341
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,400
It's a mess if Komachi says it.

342
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,460
If it was before, he would never have laughed.

343
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,000
That's right.

344
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,960
Something...

345
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,260
Something...

346
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,440
Komachi said.

347
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,460
If it was a woman, she would be a good wife.

348
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,160
What?

349
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,080
What?

350
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,080
What?

351
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:30,920
What?

352
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,060
Hey, what are you saying, Komachi?

353
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,300
That's right.

354
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,020
What are you thinking?

355
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,940
But you're good at cooking and you can sew and sew.

356
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,800
Besides, you're good at shopping.

357
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,820
I bought good things for cheap.

358
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,120
Right?

359
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,660
Even Matoi-chan.

360
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,540
You guys forgot the important thing.

361
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,160
I'm not good at cleaning and washing.

362
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,540
You've seen my room, right?

363
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,880
Oh, I see.

364
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,580
But recently, there are more and more women who can't clean and wash.

365
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,700
The garbage house on TV.

366
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,820
Kan-Kichi is not that bad.

367
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,160
Stupid.

368
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,640
I've been wondering about it for a while.

369
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,880
What are you making?

370
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,840
What?

371
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,920
Table cloth.

372
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,400
It's better to have it when we all have a meal.

373
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,780
Rather, what you're doing is what you're doing.

374
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,740
Hmm...

375
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,520
What?

376
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,200
The only problem is your appearance.

377
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:30,700
Huh?

378
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,700
Hmm...

379
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,940
Why don't you try makeup?

380
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,360
Huh?

381
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,800
Good job!

382
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,780
Hey, are you serious?

383
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,100
I'm serious!

384
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,340
It's okay. Leave it to me.

385
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,220
Hey, stop it!

386
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,580
Hmm...

387
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,420
Apply foundation well.

388
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,780
It's better to put in shadow.

389
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,540
Hmm...

390
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,460
No, stop it.

391
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,580
Is it this bad?

392
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,540
Hmm?

393
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,260
What? What's going on?

394
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,160
It's hot.

395
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,400
Ah, it's hot.

396
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:14,800
It's hot, isn't it?

397
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,760
Ah,

398
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,060
?

399
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,580
Huh?

400
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:17,980
What is this?

401
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,840
What?

402
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,200
I'm sorry.

403
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,880
The face of Kan-Kichi is thick,

404
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,900
so I thick up the make-up.

405
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,440
Please, let me do it again.

406
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,940
In the case of Ryōchi san,

407
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,060
this thick eyebrows are the neck.

408
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,140
And her eyes are also scary.

409
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,900
Let's make both eyes and make it gentle.

410
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:32,960
I think we should do it in the week.

411
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,740
Let's put on some beard.

412
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,200
It's gonna work out.

413
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,860
How about this?

414
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,240
Is this Ryotsu?

415
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,520
It's totally different from what I imagined!

416
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,660
It's much better than before.

417
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,400
This is...

418
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,740
Me?

419
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,540
I thought you were reading a book.

420
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,300
It's a fashion magazine.

421
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,840
I'm not sure about makeup.

422
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,800
I'm home!

423
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,520
Welcome back.

424
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,720
Welcome back.

425
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,200
I bought this.

426
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,280
The makeup you asked for.

427
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,280
Oh, thank you.

428
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,480
I got this at the shop.

429
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,460
I bought it today.

430
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,800
I heard there's a fashion magazine presentation.

431
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,820
Alright, let's go!

432
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,520
Let's hurry!

433
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,580
I'm totally into Kankichi.

434
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm a little worried.

435
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,900
I've been studying makeup for a few days.

436
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,600
I'd like you to see the results.

437
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,660
Ryo-chan, you're completely talking like a woman.

438
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,040
You're such a talker.

439
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,580
Why am I the one who's on the experiment table?

440
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,200
You don't usually put on makeup, do you?

441
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,780
Leave it to me.

442
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,380
Let's go.

443
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,240
Let's see.

444
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,680
I'll put on makeup.

445
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,640
I'll put on makeup.

446
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,520
I'll put on makeup.

447
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,120
I'll put on makeup.

448
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,280
I'll put on makeup.

449
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,380
I'll put on makeup.

450
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:21,820
I'll put on makeup.

451
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,200
Let's see.

452
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,420
Here it goes.

453
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,820
Wow, Matoi-chan.

454
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,040
A beauty like you!

455
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,560
It's like magic.

456
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,260
Is this really me?

457
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,020
Well.

458
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,620
Tell me next time!

459
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,580
I'll tell you soon.

460
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,700
Wait, I didn't study makeup for you two.

461
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,760
You have the first purpose?

462
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,060
Yes.

463
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,280
So I can be beautiful.

464
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,360
In Matoi's case, she's beautiful, so she doesn't have to suffer much.

465
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,820
But in my case, I can't do that, so it's hard.

466
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,940
It's okay. You can do it.

467
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We'll help you.

468
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,240
We'll help you, too.

469
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,820
Thank you, everyone.

470
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,120
I think I'm doing something wrong.

471
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,960
What? A gorilla?

472
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,800
Yes, a gorilla is running away and is in the room.

473
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,280
Okay, I'll do something about it.

474
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,640
It's his turn.

475
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,120
Are you two there?

476
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,740
Chief!

477
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,560
Kan-Kichi is in the back.

478
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,160
It's an incident. Go out right away.

479
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,620
Yes, but...

480
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,060
What are you doing?

481
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,960
Call me right away.

482
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,240
Yes, I will.

483
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,740
One, two, Kan-chan!

484
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,840
Kan-chan?

485
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
Yes, sorry to keep you waiting.

486
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,520
It's been a long time, Chief.

487
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,000
Are you Ryo-tsu?

488
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,420
Yes.

489
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,560
I can't do that.

490
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,400
Shut up!

491
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,680
I have to do something about it.

492
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,160
Come on!

493
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,860
Get the gorilla over there!

494
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,200
Am I alone?

495
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,620
Of course.

496
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,460
No way.

497
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,660
It's terrible.

498
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,860
Kan-chan is alone.

499
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,620
How can you make me look so dangerous?

500
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,940
You're a weak girl.

501
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,280
No, I'm a man.

502
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,340
Ryo-chan is now becoming a woman.

503
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,420
I don't think it's possible.

504
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,500
What should I do?

505
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,560
Help me, someone!

506
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,640
Someone, help me!

507
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,860
Boy?

508
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,940
Yes.

509
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,240
There's a 3-month-old baby in that room.

510
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,500
So we can't use the

511
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,900
"Sailugidan" .

512
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,480
Someone has to rush in and help.

513
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,660
He's sleeping now.

514
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,720
If he wakes up and starts crying...

515
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,980
Someone, help me!

516
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,580
I'll do it.

517
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,920
Will you do it, Ryo-tsu?

518
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,560
Yes!

519
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,800
You can't abandon the baby as a woman.

520
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,740
My maternal instinct is weak.

521
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,060
What?

522
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,640
I'll do it.

523
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,060
Komachi, Naoko, follow me!

524
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,460
Yes!

525
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,200
Alright!

526
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,380
Alright...

527
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,120
Good boy.

528
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,680
Oh no! He started crying!

529
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,280
No!

530
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,340
Alright, alright!

531
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,620
I have to run away!

532
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,140
Oh no!

533
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,440
What should I do?

534
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,280
Kan-chan, this way.

535
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,560
Komachi, hurry up!

536
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,600
I'm counting on you.

537
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,780
Got it!

538
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,640
Be careful!

539
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,860
Uh...

540
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,560
Ah!

541
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,560
Are you alright?

542
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm fine.

543
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,060
Kan-chan, hurry up and hold on to me!

544
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,120
No, I'm wearing a skirt!

545
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,120
It's not the time to be embarrassed!

546
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,800
But...

547
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,280
Huh?

548
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,120
Huh?

549
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,580
What?

550
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,120
What?

551
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:36,520
What?

552
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,120
What?

553
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,600
What?

554
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,100
Stop it!

555
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,960
You're not my hunter!

556
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,740
Surely not.

557
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,320
I'm your child.

558
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,300
Can you stay calm?

559
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,640
Get out of here!

560
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:55,900
Hey, you!

561
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,580
Stop!

562
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,200
What are you doing, Kanata?

563
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,220
Stop it!

564
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,380
Stop it!

565
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:01,420
Stop it!

566
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,620
What are you doing, Kanata?

567
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,100
What is this?

568
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,440
Stop!

569
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,460
Stop!

570
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:05,820
Stop!

571
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,500
Don't do this, Toko!

572
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:07,720
Good work.

573
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,260
We are going back to work.

574
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,560
Thank you for your concern.

575
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,200
Welcome home, everyone.

576
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,460
Welcome home.

577
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,160
What happened to Ryotsu?

578
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,380
I can't see him.

579
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,460
Where did he go?

580
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
Well...

581
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,400
He's become a good bride.

582
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,020
What?

583
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,100
What?

584
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,600
I don't want to live like this anymore.

585
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,660
Help me!

586
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,800
Thank you very much for your though.

587
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,560
I'm really sorry, but can I walk with you?

588
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,380
Could you stop me?

589
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,660
I had a vision when we met.

590
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,640
There's nothing like a dream.

591
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,420
I have never thought things would turn out like this.

592
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,900
I want to go home.

593
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,380
I saw it

594
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:28,480
Everyone was a child once

595
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,880
Everyone forgets

596
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,520
A politician with a great face

597
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,020
A blue aunt above his eyes

598
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,120
Look up

599
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,220
That corner

600
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,440
Everyone, everyone can see

601
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,960
We can see

602
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Let's go!

603
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,760
There's a wall over there

604
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,700
I'm sure there's a wall

605
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,760
Everyone come to our town

606
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,580
Let's go!

607
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,940
There's a wall over there

608
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,040
I'm sure there's a wall

609
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,880
Everyone come to our town

610
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:16,940
Thank you!

611
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,220
Let's go home!

612
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,460
You took the customers from the shopping street?

613
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,240
I'll take it back!

614
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,800
Leave the business stuff to the Ryotsu Saba

615
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,780
I'll give them crazy ideas!

616
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,780
Arai!

617
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,940
Come to Kameari Shopping Street.

618
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,900
I'm counting on you!

619
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,640
To our town

620
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,820
Thank you!
