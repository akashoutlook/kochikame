2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,920
When you're watching TV

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,540
Try to look in the room, and make it look like you're separated

4
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,640
So I walked around the Akegogai's dial only in black

5
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,380
Everyone was a child once, but everyone has forgotten

6
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:08,740
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above their eyes

7
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,140
Turn around and see that corner

8
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,800
You can meet everyone

9
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,540
There is a turtle, there must be a turtle

10
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,820
Come on everyone

11
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,520
Let's go to our town

12
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,660
Thank you!

13
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,800
Chase the turtle!

14
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,220
I'm sorry to make a fuss in the world this time

15
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,280
I'm not making a fuss

16
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,280
I am the person who will take responsibility for this injustice and resign

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
Let me do it

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,980
I will do it

19
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,800
But it's not a big deal

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,280
I will take the responsibility of the injustice caused by my subordinates and resign

21
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,360
If something happens, I have to take responsibility

22
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,900
Especially I am worried about one person

23
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,240
Drift car!

24
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,680
Bad bad! It's an accident!

25
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,480
Accident!

26
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,980
I'm worried about it

27
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,260
But I don't have to be so

28
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:35,440
Well, I am sorry

29
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,860
Please forgive me

30
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,580
You guys are so funny

31
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:37,660
You are at a loss

32
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,260
So he's a good doctor

33
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,640
You have to return this to me

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,060
No

35
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,980
It was just a turtle

36
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,300
I see

37
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,960
Hey, if you are in charge, stop then

38
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,460
Yes, recently my hair is getting thinner and my legs are getting swollen.

39
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,920
I'm not asking about your worries.

40
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,920
I'm asking about my subordinates' worries.

41
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,580
Ah, that's...

42
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,280
It's too late to cause a problem.

43
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,280
Also, people who cause problems are often in debt or are busy with money.

44
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,460
Debt?

45
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,140
Or they are obsessed with gambling.

46
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,080
Gambling?

47
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,140
You know, Ohara?

48
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,540
Hehehehehehe...

49
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,340
If your subordinates have such a mind,

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,520
then they will definitely start everything, no matter what.

51
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,760
You know that, Ohara?

52
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,360
Ah, yes.

53
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,600
General Ohara, I'll do whatever you want.

54
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,240
Your old school design is going to be a big hit.

55
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,980
Ah, yes!

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,800
Ah, good morning, director.

57
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,860
Good morning.

58
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,120
Good morning.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,040
Oh, isn't Ryo-tsu here?

60
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,060
Ryo-san is patrolling.

61
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,260
I see.

62
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,700
By the way, have you changed anything about Ryo-tsu recently?

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,920
Changed?

64
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,380
I don't know.

65
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,740
Anything is fine!

66
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,300
Any little thing is fine!

67
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,500
Just tell me!

68
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,180
Hmm, I see.

69
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,380
That's right.

70
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,420
If it's you, then...

71
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,960
What's wrong?

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,620
What happened?

73
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,020
They said I'm in debt.

74
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm in trouble with my money.

75
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,840
What about Ryo-chan?

76
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,640
Ah...

77
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,080
I was really frustrated to lose the game again.

78
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,700
A gamble?

79
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,820
Hmm, Ryo-san...

80
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,440
He was running around from the plastic shop with a cane.

81
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,100
Even the money...

82
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,500
Ah, no!

83
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,520
The police pattern that causes irreversible problems, as the director said, has already begun!

84
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,120
But that's the usual Ryo-chan.

85
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,080
That's right.

86
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,900
That's why I can't be at ease!

87
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,920
What's wrong, director?

88
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,720
You're in a lot of trouble today.

89
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,020
Shut up!

90
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,400
Do you understand how I feel?

91
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,400
Have you noticed anything else?

92
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,560
Anything else?

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,460
Ah!

94
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,320
What?

95
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,400
By the way, yesterday, Ryo-chan...

96
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,560
Ah!

97
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,680
Damn, my head hurts!

98
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,400
Sen...

99
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,300
Senpai's head hurts?

100
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,080
I've never heard of it.

101
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,400
Ryo-tsu's head hurts?

102
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,540
I've never heard of it in ten years.

103
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,760
I've never heard of it in ten years.

104
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,180
Yesterday, huh?

105
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,160
Come to think of it, he looked so depressed...

106
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,980
I told him, "Alright, I'll do it."

107
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,320
We have no choice but to do it.

108
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,560
I heard that, too.

109
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,800
Ah!

110
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,020
Ah, good morning, director.

111
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,400
Huh?

112
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,420
Ah...

113
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:51,480
Huh?

114
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,440
Ryo-chan, where's your bicycle?

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,780
Ah, it's broken, so I had to repair it.

116
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,320
Ah, it hurts, hurts, hurts.

117
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,480
Ah...

118
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,160
Ryo-tsu...

119
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Ah, it's true, director.

120
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,680
I didn't take it to Chia.

121
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,460
You're being so impulsive.

122
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,980
You're hiding something.

123
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,800
No, that's fine.

124
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,380
Anyway, Ryo-tsu...

125
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,060
Ryo-tsu?

126
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,440
Don't you have something to tell me?

127
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:18,920
You're not here, are you?

128
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,760
Huh?

129
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,460
I-I don't have anything.

130
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,520
I knew you had something.

131
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,060
But I'm not angry here...

132
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah, I have to go on patrol.

133
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,860
Then, I'll patrol a bit.

134
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,660
Hey, Nakagawa.

135
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,200
I'll be waiting for Ryo-tsu.

136
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,260
Y-Yes.

137
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,380
I'll...

139
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,140
I'll just go to the station...

140
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,360
And then you'll be waiting for Ryo-tsu?

141
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,300
Well, this is a difficult mission.

142
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,700
I'll be waiting for you.

143
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,800
Now I'm going to the station.

144
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,340
I'm going.

145
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,200
OK, I'm going.

146
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,760
Don't worry.

147
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:09,780
Stop.

148
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:09,920
Stop.

149
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:09,940
Stop.

150
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,440
"Is it anyone?"

151
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,860
Why does he change the engine at this point"

152
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
"He got in somewhere"

153
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,160
"He was loaded in a plate"

154
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,400
"He's about to borrow the money"

155
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,320
"He's out of the car!"

156
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,480
Huh?

157
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,660
I couldn't borrow it at that time

158
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,620
But now I know he's in trouble

159
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,940
Damn it

160
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,080
Oh no, hide in the back

161
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,580
Hide in the back

162
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,380
So that car is the Mazda R360

163
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,800
I miss it

164
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,120
It's the Countach

165
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,680
This is the tubular space structure

166
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,440
Amazing

167
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,980
It's a 12 cylinder DOHC 48 valve

168
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,860
You have a nice car

169
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,860
Thank you

170
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,320
Drive safely

171
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,640
Thank you

172
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,780
Why are they two men

173
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,400
in the car all naked

174
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,660
Don't get involved

175
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,360
Nakagawa, you're an idiot

176
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,560
You too, chief

177
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh no, I haven't paid the debt

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,560
I haven't paid it yet

179
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,280
It was like Ryo

180
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,640
They ran into the alley

181
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,360
Let's chase them

182
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,060
What?

183
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,140
They're chasing us in the Countach?

184
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,320
They're trying to lure us in

185
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,680
I see

186
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,880
I see

187
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,840
I see

188
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,300
I see

189
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,740
I see

190
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,240
I see

191
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,780
I see

192
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,000
I see

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,740
I see

194
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:31,920
I see

195
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,100
I see

196
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,360
I see

197
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,600
I see

198
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,900
I see

199
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,060
I see

200
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,900
I see

201
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,060
I see

202
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,520
I see

203
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,960
I see

204
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,920
I see

205
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,160
I see

206
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,520
I see

207
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:46,720
I see

208
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,360
I see

209
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,820
I see

210
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,500
I see

211
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:48,560
I see

212
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,360
Running

213
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:59,820
So fast

214
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,780
"Takoyaki"

215
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,080
Are you there?

216
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,820
Yes.

217
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,360
I found you.

218
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,660
If you go forward, you won't be found.

219
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,260
I'm fine.

220
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,700
I'm a guard.

221
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,280
That's true.

222
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,060
I'll tell Takoyaki's brother.

223
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,360
What the hell is this!

224
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,640
Oh my god!

225
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
What's wrong?

226
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,800
He's making money.

227
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,820
What a guy!

228
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,460
Don't tell me he's really that...

229
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:49,400
I can't hold my hands anymore.

230
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,500
I should have called him.

231
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,980
I feel sorry for him.

232
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,260
I can see his future.

233
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,860
I'll be back.

234
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,920
Hey!

235
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,160
What's that car?

236
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,120
Is it a car?

237
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,320
Are you throwing it away?

238
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,760
It's dirty.

239
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,960
You have to call the police station.

240
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,700
Chief, what's this building?

241
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,100
It's a junkyard with a problem.

242
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,500
I didn't know you were here.

243
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,160
What's that?

244
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,080
No.

245
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,140
There's a restaurant named "Ohara" over there.

246
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,780
It's a coincidence.

247
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,340
It's called "Ohara."

248
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,360
The restaurant is on the way.

249
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,720
I know.

250
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,760
There's a restaurant called "Ohara" over there too.

251
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:15,980
No.

252
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,520
I know it.

253
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:19,580
I know.

254
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,440
It's a place called "Ohara."

255
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:21,460
This place is called "Ohara."

256
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:21,760
This restaurant is called "Ohara."

257
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,020
It's "Ohara."

258
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,040
This place is called "Ohara."

259
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,200
I don't know.

260
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,580
The End

261
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,040
Ryozu!!

262
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,480
Chief!!

263
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,480
What's wrong in this place!?

264
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,400
Ryozu!!

265
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't tell me that you have something to tell me!?

266
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,380
What!?

267
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,960
Oh, dear.

268
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,160
I went to my previous manager's house and I broke the dining table,

269
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,500
And I got caught!

270
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,040
I-It's no big deal!

271
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,840
You're hiding something, after all.

272
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,960
But I can't get angry here.

273
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,520
Well, let's not talk about it here.

274
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,720
Let's go somewhere quiet.

275
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,680
You know, Ryotsu,

276
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,040
humans have something they can't tell others.

277
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,900
I knew it.

278
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,240
And if you're regretting your actions,

279
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,100
it's even worse.

280
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,920
Worse?

281
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,740
But no matter how well you try to fool me,

282
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,320
you'll find out eventually.

283
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,440
I see, I'm in trouble.

284
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,940
I knew it.

285
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,300
At first, you were just a little curious.

286
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,500
That's right.

287
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,080
I started to get curious,

288
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,960
and then I started to escalate...

289
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,720
It's too late when you thought you were done.

290
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,060
I thought I was done, too!

291
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,300
Why didn't you tell me?

292
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,960
I thought you'd get scolded by the chief.

293
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,000
Is that so?

294
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,000
Even if I did scold you,

295
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,980
I think about you,

296
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,840
and I'm scolding you with my heart.

297
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,860
Then you'll forgive me?

298
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,460
I won't forgive you,

299
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,580
because I'm responsible for what I did.

300
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,900
I'm glad.

301
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,780
I'm relieved if the chief says so.

302
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,440
In this situation,

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,800
it seems that you were able to stop yourself

304
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,960
from stepping into the path of evil.

305
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,980
All right,

306
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,480
let's go.

307
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,920
Let's think about it.

308
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:22,740
Huh?

309
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,560
Ryo-tsu.

310
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,320
Huh?

311
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,480
I've always been thinking about you.

312
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,200
Chief!

313
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,840
So let's talk a little more

314
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,460
about each other's future.

315
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,100
Future? Chief?

316
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,740
Ryo-tsu!

317
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,840
Wait a minute, chief.

318
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,060
What a beautiful sky, Ryo-tsu.

319
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,720
Huh?

320
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,720
Ryo-tsu.

321
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,660
I have a family.

322
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,580
What do you want to say?

323
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,840
I can't say that's enough,

324
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,020
but I'll do as much as I can.

325
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,720
I'm responsible for you being alone.

326
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,060
What?

327
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,200
If you think about it,

328
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,740
we're destined to be together for a long time.

329
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,100
It's a natural relationship between a married couple.

330
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,980
There's nothing to hide from now on.

331
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,640
Wait a minute.

332
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,480
We're not that kind of relationship.

333
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,400
No, I can tell from your eyes.

334
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,680
Even if you're silent,

335
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,280
your feelings will be conveyed to me.

336
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,060
Excuse me.

337
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,360
Ryo-tsu.

338
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,540
I'm not kidding.

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120
I didn't know the chief had such a hobby.

340
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,880
You can't throw away your car here.

341
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
I didn't throw it away.

342
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,080
It's parked.

343
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,420
I don't like Maria.

344
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,240
I don't like the chief.

345
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,940
Why do I always get attacked by men?

346
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,420
Why can't I be popular with women?

347
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,220
Even though he's such a good man.

348
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,720
You're such a bad man.

349
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,520
You can't be too hasty.

350
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,720
Ryo-tsu, listen to me.

351
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,840
I'm done talking to the chief.

352
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,520
Where are you going?

353
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,080
The bank.

354
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,980
The bank.

355
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,420
The bank.

356
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,280
The bank.

357
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,520
What does the bank have to do with it?

358
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,420
It's just a coin.

359
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,920
What else do you have?

360
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,500
The bank.

361
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,900
That's why I told you to stop.

362
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
I told you to consult with me about anything.

363
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,620
I'm an adult, too.

364
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,620
It seems that the relationship between adults and men is...

365
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,760
I can't keep up with the chief anymore.

366
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,660
Ryo-tsu.

367
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,260
Ryo-tsu.

368
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,700
Chief.

369
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,680
Hurry up.

370
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,140
Ryo-tsu is going to attack the bank.

371
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,780
Ryo-tsu.

372
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,880
If you don't hurry up, the bank will close.

373
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,060
Chief.

374
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,040
I'm begging you. Let me go, Chief.

375
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,460
Think about it, Ryo-tsu.

376
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,520
It's not your fault.

377
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,360
I was the one who couldn't go.

378
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,860
It has nothing to do with the chief.

379
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,280
You don't have to listen to me.

380
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,020
Of course.

381
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:19,740
I don't want to say no.

382
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,640
Okay.

383
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,580
Then I'm prepared.

384
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,360
If you have to, you have to defeat me.

385
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,320
Chief.

386
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,360
Ryo-tsu.

387
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,220
Chief.

388
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,260
Chief.

389
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,180
Jump into my chest.

390
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,060
Jump into my chest.

391
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,320
It was a close call.

392
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,060
Ryo-tsu.

393
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,240
Ryo-tsu.

394
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,440
Chief.

395
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,740
I'm sorry, chief.

396
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:58,940
I'm sorry.

397
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,820
It's a big deal.

398
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,320
I'm sorry.

399
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,480
I'm sorry.

400
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,440
I'm sorry.

401
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,480
I'm sorry.

403
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:07,660
I'm sorry.

404
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm sorry.

405
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,660
I'm sorry.

406
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:08,780
I'm sorry.

407
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,760
I'm sorry.

408
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm sorry.

409
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,420
I'm sorry.

410
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,320
I'm sorry.

411
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,620
Why are you so late.

412
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:38,760
I've been investigating the ground.

413
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,780
Please let me talk to him.

414
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Can you do that?

415
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes.

416
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,740
Ryo-tsu, can you hear me?

417
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,340
-I'm Ohara. -Nigiri.

418
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,420
It's the chief again. You're too persistent.

419
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,140
Ryo-tsu, do you remember when you first met me?

420
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,160
You were still in high school.

421
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,780
You just got out of the school.

422
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,960
When you became a police officer and your mother said hello to you,

423
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,160
I remember it clearly as if it was yesterday.

424
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,320
What is this?

425
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,500
You can still make it in time.

426
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,820
With the power of my love, I will make you a great man.

427
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,320
Your mother must be crying when she sees you now.

428
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,520
Mother made a hot pot and a glove.

429
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,840
Why?

430
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,980
Why did you sing your mother's song?

431
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,540
It's cold when the wind blows.

432
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,800
It's cold and cold.

433
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,420
The home's message is coming.

434
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,000
I can smell the scent of the fire.

435
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,140
Ryo-tsu, come back to me.

436
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,300
I don't know what's going on.

437
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,280
I don't know what's going on.

438
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,540
But I can't answer the chief's love.

439
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,880
It's over, Ohara.

440
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,120
I have no choice.

441
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,820
Let's get in.

442
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,200
What?

443
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,080
I've been arrested.

444
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,040
I've been robbed of 300,000 yen monthly.

445
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,600
No, that's mine.

446
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,760
Shut up, it's the bank.

447
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,760
The bank?

448
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,700
Ryo-tsu.

449
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,720
Ryo-chan.

450
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,480
I'm sorry, senior.

451
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,320
Ryo-san, I'll buy you a rice ball.

452
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,600
Hey, wait a minute.

453
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,760
What do I have to do?

454
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,080
Hey, let me go.

455
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,040
Ryo-san.

456
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,280
Thank you, Ryo-san.

457
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,820
Ryo-san talked to the real estate agent.

458
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,100
That child's playground has become what it is now.

459
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,120
Now we can play soccer again.

460
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,440
By the way, Ryo-san, what's wrong?

461
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,440
It's not like that.

462
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,360
He was robbed by the bank before he could understand.

463
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,600
What?

464
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,980
The child's playground?

465
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,220
He was about to be robbed?

466
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,380
Well, what does the Katsuage real estate company mean?

467
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,920
What's going on, Ohara-kun?

468
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,340
Well, he's not a bank robber.

469
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,260
That's why I'm telling you he's not.

470
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,620
I've checked the cash handling function record.

471
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,080
What's the problem?

472
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,460
I found that the 300,000 yen he had was the one that took out his salary.

473
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,440
Hey, look!

474
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,680
Ohara-kun...

475
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,020
That was yesterday.

476
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,080
As usual, he was taking a nap in the public bathhouse on the way to the patrol.

477
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,360
What's wrong?

478
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,480
It hurts.

479
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,920
That's why his head hurt.

480
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,400
Yeah.

481
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,240
What did you think it was?

482
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,680
Well, I heard the children would have no playground, so I was in trouble.

483
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,820
So I decided to get rid of it.

484
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,080
On the way, I got a part-time job from the takoyaki place where I did the show last time.

485
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,500
You got a part-time job?

486
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,560
What did you think?

487
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:13,920
No.

488
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,960
Then I took the shortcut and passed through the Sarakin building and went to the house of the landowner.

489
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,040
The shortcut?

490
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,120
Is that so?

491
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,980
And then I made a promise to the landowner to let the children go as usual.

492
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,280
No, he was a father who knew what he was talking about, so he was very kind to me.

493
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,060
Then I took the shortcut again,

494
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,000
and I went to the town to talk to him.

495
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,520
K-Kuroi Kousai...

496
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:44,600
What?

497
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,340
No...

498
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,020
Then it was easy.

499
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,020
I went to the bank in a light mood.

500
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,660
Well, the line is clear.

501
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,140
That's right.

502
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,320
Oh, Hanako, my apologies.

503
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,660
Well, well, well, well.

504
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,540
Everything was done quickly by the headmaster.

505
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,800
Nakagawa, you...

506
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,420
Hey, it's Sussi-sen!

507
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,820
Cheers, as usual, the three of you!

508
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,480
Hey, good work, good work!

509
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:08,980
You were in charge of the subject.

510
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,300
Good work!

511
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,220
Come on!

512
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,500
Experiment 1.5 million yen, violation!

513
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,160
With treatment!

514
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,740
I hate it if the criminal is mistaken, my heart is beating fast.

515
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:20,880
It's a problem.

516
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,880
I'm stuck on the table.

517
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
How can I heal this wound?

518
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,640
I got it.

519
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,460
I should pay for it.

520
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
But I think there's something wrong.

521
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,680
By the way, Ryotsu.

522
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,420
When I first called out,

523
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,620
why were you nervous?

524
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,380
Yes, this is the exit before the park.

525
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,620
Director, it's from your wife.

526
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,560
It's me.

527
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,360
What?

528
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,860
Imari's plate is broken.

529
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,420
After sticking it with adhesive.

530
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,680
By the way, last time, Ryotsu came to my house.

531
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,380
Ryotsu!

532
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,700
After all, it's your fault.

533
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm sorry.

534
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,120
It's because your usual behavior is bad.

535
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,120
Be more serious.

536
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,660
I'm sorry.

537
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,680
Awakening Watch

538
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,200
My little finger is a heart.

539
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,920
Drawing eyebrows for now.

540
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,840
Dash to the station.

541
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,720
Main train

542
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,460
One eye on my father's back.

543
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,360
This week as well.

544
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,440
Work hard.

545
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,880
Till the farewell.

546
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,020
I'm holding a racket in one hand.

00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,840
Stop it, right hand, left hand, both hands!

557
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,400
Welcome, where are you?

558
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,260
You pervert! Stop!

559
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,580
Stop calling me dad!

560
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,600
What are you saying?

561
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,060
Hayami!

562
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,600
What's that?

563
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,620
