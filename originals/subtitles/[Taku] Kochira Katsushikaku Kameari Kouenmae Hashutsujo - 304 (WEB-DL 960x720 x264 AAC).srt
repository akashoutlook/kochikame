1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,160
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:13,780
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,320
I looked up at the sunset floating on the river bank

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:29,980
And I jumped to the top of the pebble stone

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,460
I laughed and said "It's still as it was"

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,200
There are only the good things in the world

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,220
But the bad things are the only reason

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,840
The cityscape doesn't change

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,080
It's so kind

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,460
Because the crows are crying, the birds are singing

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,660
Are the yakitori and hobari here?

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,940
From the water tower of Tongari-boshi

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,620
To Taishakuten

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,820
The sunset falls

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,180
Tomorrow will end as well

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,580
But I'm happy again

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,360
I lost it and I realized

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,820
Because I'm a fool

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,080
"The Exhaustion of Two-Man-Botch"

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,840
I think I'll spin it

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:36,880
I'm so sorry

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,700
It's all just a dream

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,920
In the future, I hope

25
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:59,960
"Death of Fun"

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,080
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

28
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,040
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,420
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

30
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,540
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,860
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,100
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,420
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

36
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,160
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

37
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,500
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

38
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,620
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,560
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:54,540
I'm going to take a break for a bit.

42
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,580
*Titanic*

43
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,420
*Titanic*

44
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,280
*Titanic*

45
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,900
*Punch!*

46
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,180
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,780
Damn it...

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,920
I forgot to set it up myself...

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,580
Well, at least it was perfectly wake up...

50
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,600
This is because the boss...

51
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,200
You idiot! I'm so late that if I'm late tomorrow, I'll be fired!

52
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,900
I haven't taken a bath in a while, so I'll take a shower.

53
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,580
Reiko-san, good morning!

54
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,940
Good morning!

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,560
I just got a call. Mr. Terai said he's taking a break from the cold.

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Yeah, he was so lazy last night.

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,420
Oh, so today it's just you and Ryo-chan.

58
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,800
What?

59
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,880
What?

60
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,660
What about Mr. Ohara and Ms. Nakagawa?

61
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,820
Ms. Nakagawa said she was going to Europe for a break.

62
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,480
Oh, I see.

63
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,400
Mr. Ohara said he'd be at the wedding.

64
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,220
So he's always with that gorilla guy, right?

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,460
That's what it means.

66
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,940
It's dangerous.

67
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,060
It's dangerous to be with such a wild, erotic middle-aged gorilla.

68
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,760
That's right.

69
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,020
We're going to the station to cheer him up.

70
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,300
Don't worry about it.

71
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,440
Ryo-chan and I are friends who are more than just friends.

72
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,720
But...

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,800
It's really okay.

74
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,560
See you later.

75
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,160
Let's see.

76
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,520
Uh...

77
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,200
Um...

78
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,920
New underwear.

79
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

80
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,820
This shirt has the least dirt on it.

81
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,200
Oh, crap!

82
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,480
I'm going to be late again!

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,840
Hurry up!

84
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,700
Hurry up!

85
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,300
Eh?

86
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,980
Ryo, what are you doing?

87
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,620
Shh! The chief is in the back room.

88
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,960
Ryo, didn't you say yesterday that the chief was off at the wedding?

89
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:30,960
Really?

90
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,700
Geez, I'm not listening to people.

91
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm in a hurry. I'm going to go to bed.

92
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,080
No, Ryo. There are only two of us today.

93
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
There's Nakagawa and Terai.

94
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,280
Kei is in Europe, and Terai is off in the wind.

95
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,000
Huh? Then, there are only two of us today?

96
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,700
Huh?

97
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,120
Ryo and Reiko are alone?

98
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,380
Well, Reiko doesn't seem to care about that gorilla guy, so I don't think she's worried.

99
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,040
Reiko might be, but her opponent is Ryo Tsukan Kishi.

100
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,280
Oh, bon appétit.

101
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,520
Reiko's not good.

102
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,920
Maria!!

103
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,700
Ouch!

104
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,620
What's wrong, Reiko?

105
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,780
My eyelashes are stuck in her eyes.

106
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,700
Oh, well. Look. I'll take a look.

107
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,780
Okay, open your eyes.

108
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,260
Please be gentle.

109
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,060
Just like me.

110
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,180
Huh? Oh! That hurts!

111
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,400
I got it.

112
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,380
Ryo-chan, it hurts!

113
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,260
Sorry, sorry, Reiko.

114
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,060
Don't be so rough.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,680
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

116
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,920
Then, I'll do it again.

117
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,980
Ryo-sama!

118
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,500
I'm so sorry!

119
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,660
I didn't think you had eyelashes on you.

120
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,740
You're misunderstanding.

121
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,940
Why did you come to the station?

122
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,560
That's...

123
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,280
I got it.

124
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,640
Komachi-chan and the others must have been upset.

125
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,760
If Ryo-chan and I are alone, nothing will happen.

126
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,280
Right, Ryo-chan?

127
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,000
Of course.

128
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,280
Ryo-sama, don't be so suspicious.

129
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,260
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,140
I'm really sorry.

131
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,760
Ryo-sama, please forgive me.

132
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,100
I understand. Go home.

133
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,820
Ryo-sama, you hate me, don't you?

134
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,100
No, no, no.

135
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,560
You have your job, don't you?

136
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,840
Yes, but...

137
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,740
I'm sure you won't be able to work if you're with me.

138
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,460
That's right.

139
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,460
If Maria-chan is there, I can't help it.

140
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,720
I understand.

141
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,760
I believe in you, Ryo-chan.

142
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,300
It's not me.

143
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,580
Then I'm leaving.

144
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,420
All right.

145
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,420
All right, it's done.

146
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,520
I'll go patrol to kill time.

147
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,220
Oh, no!

148
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Ryo-chan, what's wrong?

149
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,400
The old man at the station

150
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:39,580
Oh, no, no, no.

151
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,240
I came to pay the debt.

152
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,320
Ryo-chan, please get me back.

153
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,960
Ryo-chan is in trouble.

154
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,180
Do something yourself.

155
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,640
It's a pinch until the payday.

156
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,200
I'm in trouble.

157
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,720
I'm in trouble.

158
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm in trouble.

159
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,680
I'm in trouble.

160
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:51,720
I'm in trouble.

161
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:51,900
I'm in trouble.

162
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,880
I'm in trouble.

163
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,720
Ryo-san, where is Ryo-san?

164
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:01,860
What?

165
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,480
Oh, oh, oh.

166
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,940
You can't hide it.

167
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,900
I heard from Komatsu-chan.

168
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,580
I heard that Ryo-san and Kimu are alone today.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,420
Komatsu-chan is unnecessary.

170
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,900
Ryo-chan didn't go to patrol just now.

171
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,400
You don't seem to be calm, Reiko-san.

172
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,500
It's not like that.

173
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,000
The locker is suspicious.

174
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,660
I don't think I can enter a place like that.

175
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,180
I don't think I can enter a place like that.

176
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,120
That's true.

177
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,100
I want to say that.

178
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,320
But if Ryo-san can be cornered, he can do anything.

179
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,260
It's strange.

180
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,860
I thought it was here.

181
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,480
The rest is in the back room.

182
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,300
Ryo-san, it's useless to hide.

183
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,280
Today, I'll pay for the accumulated money.

184
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,500
Damn it.

185
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,860
I'll pay for it.

186
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,480
Haha.

187
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,820
That's right.

188
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,360
I'll pay for the accumulated money.

189
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,420
I went out for patrol.

190
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,020
After Ryo-chan comes back,

191
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,740
I'll tell you that I'll pay.

192
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,140
I'll tell you that I'll pay.

193
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,400
You went home.

194
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,080
Go out.

195
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,220
I want to go out, but I can't.

196
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,020
I can't go out in this outfit.

197
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,540
I'll help you.

198
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,460
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,140
I'll take care of you, Ryo-chan.

200
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,880
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

201
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,420
You have to be patient.

202
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,240
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

203
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,120
Don't pull my face.

204
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,820
Ouch.

205
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,780
I'm out.

206
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,500
Thank you, Reiko.

207
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,240
What's with the outfit?

208
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,140
My body can't go back to normal.

209
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,940
But I can move.

210
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,460
See? See? See?

211
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,900
I can't even go to the toilet in this outfit.

212
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,200
The most troublesome thing is that I can't put my pants down even when I go to the bathroom.

213
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,860
What should I do, Reiko?

214
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,060
That's right.

215
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,220
We have to get it back somehow.

216
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,920
That's right.

217
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,540
What if we pour hot water?

218
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,420
Freeze-dry method!

219
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,540
You can move your feet, right?

220
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,260
Only the tip of my feet.

221
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,780
Did you hook your feet?

222
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,120
Yeah.

223
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,980
You can't let go.

224
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,680
Huh?

225
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,380
I got it.

226
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,360
I'm glad. I can grab your chin.

227
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,840
I tickled you.

228
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,360
What are you going to do, Reiko?

229
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,960
Be patient.

230
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,540
I'm dying.

231
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,500
It's okay, Ryo-chan.

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,300
I don't know what you mean.

233
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,440
Zangief.

234
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,260
Thanks to you, I'm back to normal.

235
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,920
Ryo-chan.

236
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:02,500
Huh?

237
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,040
Huh?

238
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,860
Ryo-chan, you're the best.

239
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,120
What are you doing to Reiko-san?

240
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,660
Huh?

241
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,440
This isn't right.

242
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,240
You're not doing it right.

243
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,260
You're not doing it right.

244
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,640
You're a pervert.

245
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,080
You're a pervert.

246
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,040
That's all we have for today.

247
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:28,840
That's all we have for today.

248
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:46,020
If I hadn't done it at the last moment, Ryo-chan wouldn't have been in this Everyone was

249
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,480
in my hands.

250
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,020
Everyone must have felt the same way you feel.

251
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,720
Come on.

252
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,360
That's okay.

253
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,660
You're a pervert.

254
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,400
I can't let you hook your feet.

255
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,880
Fat.

256
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,920
Fat.

257
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,420
Thanks to you guys, Maria will get a kick in the ass!

258
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,720
And the old man from the plastic shop will pay for the debt!

259
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,680
It's all a mess!

260
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,560
What? It's your fault, right?

261
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,560
That's right! You're doing too much bad things!

262
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,220
What did you say?!

263
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,920
Ryo-chan, hold it, hold it.

264
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,960
You two came here to eat together, right?

265
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,920
That's right!

266
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,800
Well then, let's eat!

267
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:22,940
Okay!

268
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,560
It's so good!

269
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,380
Ryo-chan, why don't you come over here and eat?

270
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,420
Hey, kid, a gorilla man is fine.

271
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,960
But your lunch is going to be bad!

272
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,260
Leave it alone! I'm just like you guys!

273
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,700
Ryo-san!

274
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,300
Huh?

275
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,420
Oh, Junpei!

276
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,540
Ryo-san, this is bad!

277
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,140
What's going on?

278
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,680
I said, this is bad! Come here!

279
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,240
Okay, I understand, I understand.

280
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,740
You two, go to your rooms.

281
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,240
What?!

282
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,600
I'll take care of it.

283
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,340
Ryo-chan, be careful!

284
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,500
Ryo-san!

285
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,900
Ryo-san, you too.

286
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,840
Be careful!

287
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,540
Hardest of the best, Ryo-san!

288
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,860
It's okay. It's all good.

289
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,040
If you pay the latest attention and put the Итак in comparison fast,

290
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,480
the problem will be solved right away.

291
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,560
Right, Ryo-tsukan Kichi?

292
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,500
You did it!

293
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,720
Yup, we did it!

294
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,720
I did it!

295
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,180
Ryo!

296
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:42,380
Ryo!

297
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,380
You did it!

298
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,560
Ryo!

299
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:48,980
You did it!

300
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,580
The airplane is safe!

301
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,200
You did it!

302
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,640
No, it won't move.

303
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,000
The engine is gone.

304
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,640
Junpei, get me a tool box.

305
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,600
Okay!

306
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,920
Alright! It's done!

307
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,720
That's it!

308
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,460
Yes!

309
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,660
The engine is safe!

310
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,680
Here, Junpei.

311
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,940
Thank you, Ryo!

312
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,380
The next day

313
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,200
Here, have some tea.

314
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,620
Thank you.

315
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,100
Junpei and the others were very happy.

316
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,180
It's good.

317
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,060
The tea after a job is delicious.

318
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,380
What's this?

319
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,560
Is there something on my face?

320
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,440
What's this?

321
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,940
Did I keep moving around with this?

322
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,260
Don't worry.

323
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,860
No one will laugh at you.

324
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,460
I won't forget the heart of a child forever.

325
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,460
No, I like Ryo, who is still a child forever.

326
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,560
Don't tease me.

327
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,000
What's this?

328
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,080
Could it be...

329
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,880
Who are you?

330
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,300
Hi! It's been a long time, super poor guy.

331
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,380
Hey, Junpei.

332
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,880
Who are you?

333
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,340
Hey, Junpei.

334
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,720
Hum, hum, hum.

335
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,100
I'm rude, me, me.

336
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,240
Even if you say that, do you know Reiko?

337
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,900
I can't remember that, either.

338
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,140
Miss Reiko, it's me.

339
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,840
I'm super rich shiratori, Reiji.

340
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,600
Oh!

341
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,560
I'm so glad you can remember me.

342
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,800
No, it's...

343
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,920
It's all over here.

344
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,780
What?

345
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,560
Hey, why would you do that?

346
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,040
You can't get me out, so you're completely forgotten!

347
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,360
Hey, hey, calm down! Who are you talking to, Shiratorina?

348
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,200
No, don't be mean, Super-poor-man, Reiko-san!

349
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,660
That's why I said call me Super!

350
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,960
It's been a while.

351
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,700
But you were moved by your father and became a super-poor-man, weren't you?

352
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,600
I was moved by my father and came back as a super-poor-man.

353
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,660
What a sweet father. So, what do you want today?

354
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,380
That's a good question, Super-poor-man.

355
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,860
I know, so don't point at me!

356
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Just a moment!

357
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,780
What's this flower?

358
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,560
It doesn't feel like the season. Did you pick it up in Porsche?

359
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,620
You're so detailed.

360
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,640
Don't worry about the small things.

361
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,580
Anyway, Reiko-san, since you came back as a super-poor-man, I'll have you as my wife.

362
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,560
I should have said no to that before.

363
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,820
That's not true!

364
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,400
I can see that you're not serious.

365
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,860
You'll be my wife. This is fate.

366
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,980
R-Ryo-chan...

367
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,460
Hey, Reiko, you don't like it, do you?

368
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,140
Besides, stop this!

369
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,700
It stinks and I can't stand it!

370
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,060
What? What are you talking about?

371
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,140
You're the biggest flower in the world!

372
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:30,600
Shiratori-san, I'm sorry to say this, but you're too late.

373
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,640
I know, it stinks too.

374
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,100
I'm engaged.

375
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,640
You're joking again!

376
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,560
I'm serious.

377
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,660
Then, who's the one you're engaged to?

378
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,440
That's...

379
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,460
That's me!

380
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,840
What?

381
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,240
Oh, no!

382
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,780
Well, that's how it is.

383
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,420
Shiratori-kun, you're really late.

384
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,220
We were just talking about where to go on our honeymoon.

385
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,920
Right, honey?

386
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,260
Yes, darling?

387
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,720
H-Honey?

388
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,280
D-Darling?

389
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,400
I guess Europe is better.

390
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,640
The whole world is the same.

391
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,720
I knew it.

392
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,360
Hmm...

393
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,840
No, it's definitely strange.

394
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,200
What?

395
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,200
What do you mean?

396
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,440
If you think about it, well, not necessarily.

397
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,460
Even if the world and heaven turn around,

398
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:38,220
Reiko-san won't fall for a super-villain, super-poor, super-short-and-super-long-term gorilla man like you.

399
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,160
I-I can't do that.

400
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,420
That's even more suspicious.

401
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,240
What?

402
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,880
Then, why don't you show me the proof?

403
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,420
Proof?

404
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,880
If you're engaged, why don't you give me a big kiss right here in front of me?

405
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,460
What?

406
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,620
Not a kiss on the cheek.

407
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
A mouth-to-mouth kiss.

408
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,160
Zzz...

409
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,940
You're always in front of me.

410
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,620
If you're engaged, you should be able to do it.

411
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,700
Now, I'll take a picture of the proof.

412
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,120
Why don't you do it?

413
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,840
Why don't you do it?

414
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,040
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

415
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,000
Yes!

416
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,840
I can do it.

417
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,280
I can do it.

418
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,200
Eh?

419
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,380
Re-Reiko...

420
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,380
Y-Yes, you can do it!

421
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,060
Look closely!

422
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,220
Look closely!

423
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,700
Sorry, Reiko.

424
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,240
Please bend over for a while.

425
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,720
Re-Reiko?

426
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,040
H-Hey, here I go.

427
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,420
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...

428
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,860
B-Bunny...

429
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,840
Oh, oh!

430
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

431
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:00,980
Ahh!

432
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,600
Hey, hey, Tamma!

433
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,940
Excuse me, I'm calling Papa.

434
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,500
Hello, it's Reiji.

435
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,420
Huh?

436
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,140
The company went bankrupt?

437
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:11,880
Huh?

438
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,100
That means the super rich will fall out again?

439
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,240
Ah, Shiratori-san, you shouldn't be in a place like this.

440
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,620
That's right, it's the most important thing in Shiratori-ken.

441
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,680
Uh, I understand, Papa, I'll go there right away.

442
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,720
That means I'll be rude.

443
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,740
Papa!

444
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,920
Hey, hey!

445
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,480
What are you going to do with this flower?

446
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:36,740
Huh?

447
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,320
What are you going to do with this flower?

448
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,920
Ah...

449
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,380
Ah, it stinks!

450
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,000
Huh?

451
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,300
Hey, Reiko.

452
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:50,920
Huh?

453
00:21:52,380 --> 00:22:02,060
If I hadn't been contacted by Shiratori's father, would you really have kissed him?

454
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,680
No, no!

455
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,820
Yeah, I know. It's a joke, right?

456
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,060
Yeah, I guess.

457
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,300
Ah, it's over.

458
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,540
There were so many things happening today.

459
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,460
Yeah, there were so many. I'm so tired.

460
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,520
That's right, Ryo. How about having a meal together sometime?

461
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,200
Oh, that's great. But me...

462
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,180
It's okay. It's my treat.

463
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,460
Yari, what's with the wind?

464
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,740
It's nothing.

465
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Well, it's okay. It's just a big welcome.

466
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,180
Mr. Ryo!

467
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,740
Oh, Honda. What's wrong?

468
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,740
Senpai!

469
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,180
Yeah, what's going on?

470
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,500
What's going on?

471
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,460
Nana-chan isn't answering my calls.

472
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,900
It seems like I'm being dumped.

473
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,540
Yeah, that's too much.

474
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,720
She doesn't even reply to my emails.

475
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,960
It's over.

476
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,420
Hey, you!

477
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,660
Sorry. I'm gonna hang out with Honda tonight.

478
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,940
Honda, I'll listen to your story.

479
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,520
Oh, Senpai.

480
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,300
Come on, hang in there.

481
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,140
There's your treat.

482
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,300
Here.

483
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,820
Wow, you're so pretty.

484
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,800
Why don't you also get some drinks with me?

485
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,160
That...

486
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,820
Hey!

487
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,920
What?

488
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,400
Why are you drinking too much?

489
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,440
I'll get you a drink.

490
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,200
Good.

491
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:57,820
Why are you drinking too much?

492
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,500
Hey, come on.

493
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:58,520
I found some.

494
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,760
I thought I wouldn't need it, but I found a weird takoyaki shop.

495
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,480
Next time, a fierce battle in front of the station.

496
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,200
Thank you.

497
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,640
There's a wall over there.

498
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,480
Oh, there must be a wall.

499
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,560
Everyone, come to our town.

500
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,700
Thank you!
