中川に浮かぶ春日を目かけ Bwinding along the river In the water of a summer

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:29,160
小石を蹴ったら靴まで飛んで If one kicks the tenоп wrote, possibly even a shoe

4
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,960
From the street to the taishakuten, the sun sets

5
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,420
Tomorrow will end like this

6
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,520
I lost the happiness of being a Katsushika Shiba

7
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,400
I realized, because I'm such an idiot

8
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,960
I'll give you a blow!

9
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,620
Damn it, it's burning!

10
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,800
That was close!

11
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,460
What's wrong Ryo-chan?

12
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:54,540
I'll make you a hot pot with hot tempura!

13
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,140
Ryo-chan, that's enough.

14
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,840
You really want to eat it?

15
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,140
You should stop eating it.

16
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,440
That's right, Ryo-san.

17
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,640
You're not going to lend me money, right?

18
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,780
But you're the one who ordered me to stop.

19
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,280
You're such a coward.

20
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,240
If you don't lend me money, you'll have to pay for what I do.

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,860
You're pretty good at this.

22
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,680
This guy is...

23
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,620
He's a tough guy.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't eat this!

25
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,100
B-Bujou!

26
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,280
Ryotsu!

27
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,500
Your working hours are over!

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,860
Stop doing stupid things and go back to the dorm!

29
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,020
This is...

30
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,460
Sukiyaki!

31
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,480
Who is it?

32
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,620
Who's this guy who is working hard before the holiday?

33
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,980
It's here!

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,060
It's my room.

35
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,620
Ryo-sama?

36
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,700
Welcome back!

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,440
It's Maria!

38
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,560
You said it was before the holiday!

39
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,620
What happened to this Sukiyaki?

40
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,880
I wanted to eat it with you.

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,640
Oh!

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,860
This is what it's like to be a Buddha in hell and Maria in hell!

43
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,860
Well, Indra!

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,240
Can you still see the meat?

45
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,080
I don't care if it's raw.

46
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,760
It's food!

47
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,660
Here!

48
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,860
Yum!

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,980
I ate it.

50
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,360
What happened all of a sudden?

51
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,520
Were you kicked out of the dorm?

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,280
No, it's...

53
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,280
It's my fault that I live in the dorm.

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,900
My father found out that I live in the dorm.

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,280
Your father?

56
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,840
Yes.

57
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,460
I told you I won't force you anymore.

58
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,120
Yes.

59
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,420
You have no choice but to follow the Hon-dara-kenpo.

60
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,860
I absolutely don't want to!

61
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,900
Before the treatment,

62
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,060
my father's students were waiting for me to go home.

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,880
My father was finally here.

64
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,100
Hey, hey, hey, honey.

65
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,260
There's a delicious fried rice restaurant in Odaiba.

66
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,720
Would you like to go with me?

67
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,660
Hey! Hey!

68
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,480
I thought you wouldn't look at me recently.

69
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,400
If I stay here, everyone will be in trouble.

70
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,720
I thought I'd hide away from you.

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,820
If Maria is here, the food will be better.

72
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,300
It can't be helped.

73
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,180
I understand.

74
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,040
You can live in this room for a while.

75
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,180
Really?

76
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,920
I'm so happy!

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,040
Hey, stop it.

78
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,640
Don't get close to me.

79
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,140
I'm so happy to live with you.

80
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,920
Stop it.

81
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,940
Hey, senpai.

82
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,980
Hey, everyone.

83
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,020
Good work.

84
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,720
Good evening, everyone.

85
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,480
What are you surprised about?

86
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,460
Maria is a man.

87
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,280
Even if you say so...

88
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,320
Look at this.

89
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,220
Hey!

90
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,220
No!

91
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,500
Senpai...

92
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,840
In the end, while Maria was in the bath,

93
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,920
Honda was completely exhausted and everyone climbed and lay down.

94
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,060
I can't help it.

95
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,960
Maria is an annoying person.

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,760
Ryo, hurry up and get married!

97
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,300
Don't say stupid things.

98
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,300
How can a man get married?

99
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,040
Episode 2

100
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,100
He's not here!

101
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,600
Where's he going?!

102
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,320
No!

103
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,820
As expected of Rin! You're the best!

104
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,400
Thank you. But you should stop, Rin.

105
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,520
I'm fine with Marilyn, Director.

106
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,480
Really? Marilyn, the next film of the Women's Spy No. 5 series is definitely the best!

107
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,180
I'm looking forward to it, Director.

108
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,680
Marilyn, good job.

109
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,220
Thank you.

110
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,020
By the way, Marilyn, it will take about two hours to prepare for the next scene.

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,920
Is that so bad?

112
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,900
What should we do? Should we take a break at the location bus? Or...

113
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,380
Yes, that's right. Which one would you like?

114
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,240
Oh, I'm going to call Marilyn. She's my father.

115
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,120
What?

116
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,680
Hello, Dad?

117
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,380
I saw you at the show. Why didn't you call me when you came back to Japan, Rin?

118
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,080
I'm so sad, Dad.

119
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,440
What's the matter? I'm in the middle of shooting.

120
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,500
That's right. You're the one who gave me the ultimate Hon-dara-kenpo, Rin.

121
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,600
What are you talking about? I'm a woman. You have love, don't you?

122
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,080
That's right.

123
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,100
I've become a woman.

124
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,060
What? You?

125
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,020
And I've become a criminal.

126
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,880
You're the only one I have.

127
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,360
I know you don't want to, but I don't like it.

128
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,920
Please, you're next.

129
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,300
I'm going to see Ai.

130
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,140
Ai? Oh, the twin brother?

131
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,020
Yes.

132
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,120
Please come back in two hours.

133
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,500
Okay.

134
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,220
Take this.

135
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,660
Thank you.

136
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,060
See you.

137
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,260
I'll make Ai responsible for being a boy.

138
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,740
Hello.

139
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,260
Ai said she's in the girls' dorm. Why did she go to the boys' dorm?

140
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,780
Welcome back, Ai.

141
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,580
What?

142
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,220
You're just in time. Go take a bath.

143
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,540
What?

144
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,480
No one's back yet.

145
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,120
Um...

146
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,000
Hurry up.

147
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,580
You don't want to be with them again, do you?

148
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,480
Oh, I see.

149
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,520
Ai made a mistake because you're dressed like this.

150
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,860
But it's okay.

151
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,200
I'll take a bath.

152
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,560
Maria, I'm back.

153
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,920
Huh?

154
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,800
You're not back yet?

155
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,780
Oh, Ryo, welcome back.

156
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,300
Ai wants a bath.

157
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,100
A bath?

158
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,980
Oh, really?

159
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,760
Ah, I'll take a bath before dinner.

160
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,120
Hey, Maria, I'm coming in, too.

161
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,200
What?

162
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,500
Ai!

163
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,120
What's wrong with you?

164
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,080
You!

165
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,920
You've completely turned into a woman!

166
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,820
Ouch!

167
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,520
Ouch!

168
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,560
Ouch!

169
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,440
Ouch!

170
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,120
Ouch!

171
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,280
Ouch!

172
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:18,680
Ouch!

173
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:18,760
Ouch!

174
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,060
Ouch!

175
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,160
Ouch!

176
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,200
Ouch!

177
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,420
Ouch!

178
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,900
Ouch!

179
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,620
Ouch! Ouch!

180
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,180
Bats!

181
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,440
Ouch!

182
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,540
Ouch!

183
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,340
Ouch!

184
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,040
Ouch!

185
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,060
Ouch!

186
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,480
Ouch!

187
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,800
It's okay, it's okay.

188
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,360
Just one bit, and you'll be ok.

189
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,960
What are you doing?

190
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,220
I'm taking a bath!

191
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,660
And more importantly, do you have a dryer?

192
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,180
Huh?

193
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,760
Hey, you're hungry.

194
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,100
If you're hungry, you can prepare dinner.

195
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,760
Why would I prepare dinner for you?

196
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,880
You're acting different than usual.

197
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,120
Hey, where's the bathroom?

198
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,240
It's on the right side of the corridor.

199
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,840
Oh, I see.

200
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,240
He should know about the bathroom.

201
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,400
Ryo, I'm sorry I'm late.

202
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,980
I'll prepare dinner for you right away.

203
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,840
Huh?

204
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,780
I said you're not going to do it!

205
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,500
I don't want to, Ryo.

206
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,720
I love cooking for you and washing dishes,

207
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,380
but why would I say that?

208
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,220
I don't want to, Ryo. I love cooking for you and washing dishes,

209
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,560
but why would I say that?

210
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,240
I don't like cooking for you and washing dishes,

211
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,320
Right...

212
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,940
Do you want some?

213
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,320
It is your chest.

214
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,200
Did something happen to my chest?

215
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,060
Um, well...

216
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,720
Please let me touch it.

217
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,460
What are you doing?

218
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,420
It's just a cheap lift.

219
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
The inside of the box is wishful thinking.

220
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,540
Please.

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,820
Well...

222
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,960
Hmm...

223
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,900
I can't do it.

224
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,220
Huh?

225
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,120
I forgot to buy soy sauce. I'll borrow some from Ryo's aunt.

226
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
If you say "here you go", it's hard to touch.

227
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,000
You're pretty fast. Bye.

228
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,220
What are you doing?!

229
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,720
Ouch! I told you to touch it!

230
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,160
Rin!

231
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,460
Rin!

232
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,920
Ai?!

233
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,820
Wh-wh-what?! Why is Maria with them?!

234
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,220
She looks just like me!

235
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,060
W-what's going on?!

236
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,000
Ryo, Rin is my twin sister.

237
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,440
She's an actress in Hong Kong.

238
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,680
Your twin sister?

239
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,280
I see. So that's why she has real boobs.

240
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,340
Rin, why are you here?

241
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,400
We're here for the movie shoot in Tokyo.

242
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,180
If I come to see you, she'll peek in the back and touch the bus.

243
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,480
I'm so pissed!

244
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,980
What? I-I can't help it. I didn't know.

245
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,700
But still, if we're together, we're like clone humans.

246
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,000
You're right.

247
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,940
I even copied her hairstyle.

248
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,260
Why did you become a woman?

249
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,400
Well...

250
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,500
My father called me.

251
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,180
What if I'm the leader of that disgusting Hong Kong gang?

252
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,020
I don't want to be a dancer like that.

253
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,660
You should become a singer.

254
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,660
I'm an actress.

255
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,420
You can do it while you're an actress.

256
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,380
You can do it while you're a police officer.

257
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,540
What? You're the eldest, right?

258
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,440
It doesn't matter!

259
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,780
Hey, hey! Stop fighting!

260
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,640
You're the one who seduced Ai, right?

261
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,300
You're the one who turned Ai into a woman.

262
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,180
No, I'm not!

263
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,100
Ryo, stop being so mean!

264
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,600
You did it!

265
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,860
Don't copy my voice!

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,240
Stop talking like that!

267
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,780
I can't fix it! I'm too late!

268
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,540
Wait, you two!

269
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,720
Don't fight with the same voice!

270
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:28,980
It's messy!

271
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,540
Maria, calm down!

272
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,540
I'm Rin, and Ai is over there.

273
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,160
Oh, I see.

274
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,060
I can't believe you're so determined.

275
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,660
Yes, this is Rin.

276
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,320
Oh, it's already that late?

277
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,380
Ai, I'll take care of this after the shoot.

278
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,780
Good!

279
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,240
I'll do what I want!

280
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,420
Honey, I made cookies.

281
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,960
Try them.

282
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,600
Oh? Isn't that Rin?

283
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,700
A Japanese star actress from Hong Kong,

284
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,160
Marilyn, and Rin Asato,

285
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,700
came to Japan for a movie shoot.

286
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,820
How is it?

287
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,960
It's been a while since you've been to Japan...

288
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,220
Oh, Dad!

289
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,120
I'm not going to go to the Hon-dara-kenpo!

290
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,160
Why, Rin?

291
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,480
Honey, I'm going to see Rin.

292
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,580
Darling!

293
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,580
Oh, my!

294
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,160
Oh, my!

295
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,840
You really are a man, aren't you?

296
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,080
Yes, but I'm a man.

297
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,100
I know that a sister like you

298
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,740
is a real nuisance to me,

299
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,160
but please be nice to me.

300
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,140
Oh, no, thanks.

301
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,100
Now, director, let's shoot.

302
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,060
Shoot.

303
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,360
Oh, yeah.

304
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,640
Ouch!

305
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,160
Come on, come on, come on.

306
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,100
I'm going to hit you from here,

307
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,020
so you have to dodge and kick.

308
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,160
Okay.

309
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,780
As expected from a popular actress,

310
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,260
the staff is also careful.

311
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,720
Rin is selfish, so...

312
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,380
Alright, let's take the test.

313
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,540
Ready...

314
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,580
Action!

315
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,440
Ouch!

316
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,920
Ouch...

317
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,320
What's wrong, Marilyn?

318
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,120
What?

319
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,160
You guys are so bad at dancing,

320
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,500
that your legs are broken, aren't they?

321
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
I'm sorry.

322
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,360
I can't do this anymore.

323
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:28,960
Kishima!

324
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,700
Yes?

325
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,560
Bring me a chair.

326
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,400
Yes.

327
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,820
She's also a popular actress,

328
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,340
even if she's selfish.

329
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,900
Once Rin starts to nag,

330
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,740
she won't listen to anything I say.

331
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,340
Hey, Marilyn,

332
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,220
can't you do anything?

333
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,660
My legs hurt, so I can't help it.

334
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,900
Then, take a break for a while.

335
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,020
What?

336
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,620
You're trying to force me,

337
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,680
I really can't believe it.

338
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,580
Oh, I can't do this.

339
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,800
I'm in trouble.

340
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,200
I'm in trouble.

341
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
What should I do?

342
00:15:59,500 --> 00:15:59,740
Oh,

343
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,140
I see.

344
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,420
Hey,

345
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,600
please play the role of Marilyn.

346
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,340
What?

347
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,040
It's okay, it's okay.

348
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,620
There's no line.

349
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,760
It's just an action.

350
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,700
I can't do that.

351
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,500
Ai,

352
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,960
if you play the role,

353
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,980
I can take over the role of the head of Hondara Prefecture.

354
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,640
Really?

355
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,080
Okay, I'll do it.

356
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:24,880
Really?

357
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,720
Will you do it?

358
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,140
I'll do my best.

359
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,560
Okay.

360
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,660
Then, let's start filming.

361
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,500
Let's go.

362
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,080
Hey,

363
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,760
you know the story.

364
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,700
No way.

365
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,020
Huh?

366
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,300
I'll do anything if you say so.

367
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,940
You're like a big actress, aren't you?

368
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,600
Ready,

369
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,240
action!

370
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,640
You have great power!

371
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:54,780
You have great power!

372
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,480
You have great power!

373
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:00,820
You have great power!

374
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,900
Got it.

375
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,920
Okay, fine.

376
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,700
Very good.

377
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,080
Director,

378
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,280
Uh?

379
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,220
Uh?

380
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:10,980
Oh,

381
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,800
By the way,

382
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,980
I can't use this anymore.

383
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,260
I can't use this anymore.

384
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,860
What can I do about this?

385
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
I took it too seriously.

386
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,340
Oh,

387
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:19,520
I'm sorry.

388
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,880
الب coils

389
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,020
It's over.

390
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,400
You!

391
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,000
You!

392
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Those three guys...

393
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,560
Father...

394
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,960
Rin, I'm begging you.

395
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,320
I'll have to get you to take care of this mess.

396
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,480
What's this?

397
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,800
I don't like it, Father.

398
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,020
It's a bad idea!

399
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:47,920
What?

400
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,640
What happened to that flimsy, flimsy F cup?

401
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,220
Father, you have to take care of that one.

402
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,040
I'm going to take care of this one.

403
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,740
I think I messed up because it's too similar.

404
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,960
My F cup is just like this.

405
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,880
Okay, fine, fine.

406
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,620
You're not going to let me touch it, are you?

407
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,520
You're just as stubborn as ever.

408
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,840
Ryo, what are you doing here?

409
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,400
You're not even bothering Rin, are you?

410
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,520
I'm just taking a look around the studio.

411
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,080
Then hurry up and get out of here!

412
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,840
Father, please forgive Ryo.

413
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,560
Shut up, you idiot son of a bitch.

414
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,160
You're being fooled by a pervert gorilla like this.

415
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,740
Shut up!

416
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,360
Didn't you hear what Uncle Kappa said?

417
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,600
Hmph.

418
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,380
Listen, Ryo.

419
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,400
Touch my successor just a little bit.

420
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,520
I won't forgive you for nothing.

421
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,480
Who's your successor?

422
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,380
You're the only one I have, not anyone else!

423
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,660
I'm not joking.

424
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
I definitely don't want to!

425
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,480
Then who's going to get the Hondara sword?

426
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,380
I'm going to get my father's love!

427
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,520
I'm going to be happy with Ryo, so I'm definitely going to say it!

428
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,160
What?

429
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,700
I'm going to be a global actress, so I'm definitely going to say it!

430
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,080
I'm definitely going to say it!

431
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,220
What?

432
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,480
I thought you were going to say this, but I'm going to say it clearly, Ai.

433
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,260
What?

434
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:17,920
What?

435
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,100
What?

436
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,560
You can't fall for a gorilla like this!

437
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,900
What did you say?

438
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,580
I can bear it if you want to have me, but I can't forgive you for all the insults you've made to Ryo!

439
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,140
Are you stupid?

440
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,740
You're a man.

441
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,800
No matter how much you love him, you can never marry him!

442
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,160
You should give up on your father and follow him!

443
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
I can't forgive you!

444
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,180
Hoooray!

445
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,080
The battle begins.

446
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,280
I did it!

447
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,040
It's a turn of events.

448
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,120
No, this is a good chance.

449
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,500
3, 5, Din, listen carefully.

450
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,140
The loser of this battle will be the successor of the Hondara Sword.

451
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,240
Huh? What did you say?

452
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,500
Hey, hey, don't you think it's better to win?

453
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,840
Shut up! That way, you won't be a burden!

454
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,980
I got it! Ai! I'm going for it!

455
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,400
I'm going for it!

456
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,660
Let's go!

457
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,240
Yeah!

458
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,560
Yeah!

459
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,440
That was amazing.

460
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,160
Hey! Turn the camera!

461
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,280
But we're still filming.

462
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,320
It's okay!

463
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,500
You can't win a battle this strong!

464
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,040
Yes, sir!

465
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,940
The next game of Spy #5 is...

466
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,160
Spy #5 vs. Clone Man!

467
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:46,780
Start!

468
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,740
Of course, the power of the man's love is at its highest!

469
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,020
For posterity, even!

470
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,640
Don't be coming here!

471
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,220
My every price is 1,000 yen!

472
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,700
This is for you.

473
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,800
This is for you, Sister.

474
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,260
No, this is for you, Brother.

475
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,240
It looks like he's talking about this holy battle!

476
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,520
Huh?

477
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,280
No way.

478
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,720
What the...?

479
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,040
You can take that!

480
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,140
Hey!

481
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,360
Hey!

482
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:12,940
Huh?

483
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
I owe you a million.

484
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,980
Don't bet on me!

485
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,560
Fine. I bet on you.

486
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,440
Ryo!

487
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,420
What?

488
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,420
Move a little.

489
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,320
I'll crush this guy's balls.

490
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
Dad, stop!

491
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,380
Rin, I'm sorry.

492
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,960
Take this chance.

493
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,780
You're so dirty!

494
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,180
Shut up!

495
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,920
Ai, I'm sorry, but I want to continue being an actress!

496
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm sorry.

497
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,780
Stop!

498
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,960
Darling, what are you doing?

499
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,580
What?

500
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,080
Let go of my hand!

501
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,800
Kyoko, you saved me.

502
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,060
Honey, don't be so mean.

503
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,620
Shut up.

504
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,680
I won't let you have your children fight for the sake of the successor.

505
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,680
But who's going to take care of the whole family?

506
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,920
If you want to have your own child, why don't you have another child?

507
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,700
Huh?

508
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,000
What?

509
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,340
You have that kind of a hand?

510
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:36,660
You have that kind of a hand?

511
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,320
Let's go, honey!

512
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,340
Ouch!

513
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,300
Stop!

514
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,500
Stop!

515
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,520
Stop!

516
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,000
Stop, you bastard!

517
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,320
If you let the child carry the Honda-raken, it will only bring misfortune to the child!

518
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,400
What did you say?

519
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
The world's most powerful Honda-raken...

520
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,680
Don't make fun of me!

521
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,140
Ouch!

522
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,040
Ouch!

523
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,220
Damn it!

524
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,680
You're so mean, you idiot!

525
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,480
What are you doing, you pervert gorilla?

526
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,680
What?

527
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,140
Ouch!

528
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,700
Oh, my!

529
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,100
Ryo, you're like a child's sword.

530
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,280
Ai, Rin, this Honda-raken is the first child's sword.

531
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,060
The only child's sword is the best!

532
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,100
Really?

533
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,600
As expected of Mother!

534
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,720
Then we don't have to fight.

535
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,420
Yes.

536
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,500
Ai, I'm sorry for saying the bad things.

537
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,240
No, I'm sorry.

538
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,900
It's been a long time, so let's have a meal together.

539
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,440
Yes, Mother.

540
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,020
Let's go! Let's go!

541
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,100
Ai, Rin!

542
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,640
Kota-raken, ear pulling!

543
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,280
Ear pulling!

544
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,200
Hitsuba's front!

545
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,440
Hitsuba's front!

546
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,580
Hitsuba's front!

547
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,080
Hitsuba's front!

548
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,160
Hitsuba's front!

549
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,880
That's terrible.

550
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,820
Director, what should we do?

551
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,960
The film is waiting.

552
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,820
Stop it.

553
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,100
I'm tired of this battle.

554
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,540
Let's retreat!

555
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,100
Aeogappa!

556
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,940
Sentai Gorilla!

557
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:58,640
Thank you!

558
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,120
What?

559
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,700
The chief is moving to the third address?

560
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,580
Great!

561
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,840
I'm so lucky!

562
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,360
I didn't have to see the eyes of the leader every day!

563
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,820
You're the leader.

564
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,240
Now, I made my choice.

565
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,080
It's time for the book.

566
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,920
Next time, the leader!

567
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,100
Take care!

568
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,260
Next time, the leader!

569
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:33,420
♪ I can't fall in love with you ♩

570
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,300
♪ You'm not my friend ♩

571
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,780
♪ But there are rumors ♩

572
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,040
I'm tired, but there's so much I want to do

573
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:50,980
I want to run through the wild desert on my bike

574
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,180
I want to be more free than a bird

575
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,960
I want to be more free than a bird

576
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:06,980
With the speed of a full moon, I change into a lady's dream

577
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:14,560
Love heart, I'm sorry, wait

578
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,280
I dive into the future of the panorama

579
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:24,160
I dive into the future of the panorama

580
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,640
You understand, right?

581
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,280
I'm sorry, wait
