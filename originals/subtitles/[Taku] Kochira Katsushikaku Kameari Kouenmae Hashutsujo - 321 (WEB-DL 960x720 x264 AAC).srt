44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,040
We did it! It's complete!

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,480
What do you think?

46
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,500
It's the most difficult manga to draw in Japan.

47
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,420
It's called "Manga Kanagase"

48
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,080
It's a model of 250th scale in the capital.

49
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,880
Wow, you've done a good job with the details.

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,560
The governor's office has the governor as well!

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,700
Senpai's modeling skills are already at the level of a master!

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,360
*pant*

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,200
Ryo-chan, we have a guest.

54
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
What? Me?

55
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
Cut! Cut!

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,580
Hey!

57
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,380
I didn't get any surprising reactions!

58
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,300
Ouch!

59
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,380
What are you doing all of a sudden?

60
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,340
Alright!

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Good, good.

62
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,920
That face, that reaction!

63
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,260
Okay, okay.

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,620

68
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,920
Hello, hello, hello!

69
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,140
Good afternoon, everyone!

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,020
I am something like this.

71
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,060
*pant*

72
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,900

Ooyama Bakuchi?

75
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,100
Hirouchi-yon!

76
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,720
*pant*

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,520
Are you Okura-pro?

78
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,260
I've never heard of you.

79
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,900
You're a famous producer among the fans!

80
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,000
I am.

81
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,420
And I have here with me

82
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,240
the world's most famous director,

83
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,240
Akira Kamerada, the great legend!

84
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,040
*pant*

85
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,460
Speaking of Akira Kamerada,

86
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,640
he's the one who hit the dance city and the dance intersection!

87
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,920
*pant*

88
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,620
He's the world's most famous director!

89
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,440
*pant*

90
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,020
I can't believe it!

91
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,180
Is that so?

92
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,120
The world's most famous director,

93
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:18,440
who is proud of Japan,

94
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,640
is saying that he wants to borrow your skills for modeling!

95
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,060
*pant*

96
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,300
*pant*

97
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,000
*pant*

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,420
Hey, hey, stop!

99
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,680
What do you mean?

100
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,320
You can make the next movie's director

101
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,580
to do it.

102
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,340
I told you to make him do it!

103
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:37,660
I'll do it!

104
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,580
I'll ask him!

105
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,600
Director Jo, please!

106
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,740
Director Kamerada's director,

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,960
is so popular,

108
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,380
that he'll be popular everywhere!

109
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,040
Popular?

110
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,420
He is so cool, isn't he, Ryo-chan?

111
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,460
And if it is the new work of Director Kamerada,

112
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,760
people all over the world will pay attention to it!

113
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,200
So, what kind of new work is this?

114
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,240
Yes, the dance city,

115
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,600
the dance intersection,

116
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,100
the dance craftsman,

117
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,540
the dance Monji-yaki,

118
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,940
and the dance series' conclusion!

119
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,220
Conclusion

120
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,320
"Dancing Big Kameari"!

121
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,360
"Dancing Big Kameari"?

122
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,700
You're really into dancing big, aren't you?

123
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,720
Yes!

124
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,400
The stage is near the future.

125
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,520
The Japanese capital has moved from Tokyo to Kameari just a little.

126
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,880
That Kameari has become a criminal city.

127
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,780
This is about the brave police officers who face the cruel crime.

128
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:37,740
It's a big action melodrama with love, friendship, tears, laughter, song, and a big chorus of "chan-chiki-oke-san"!

129
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,780
I don't know why, but it seems like you're going to do it.

130
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,780
Yes.

131
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,900
As you know, Director Kamerada is a thorough strategist.

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
He doesn't use CG at all.

133
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,460
So I'm going to show you the new Kameari city of the future.

134
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,680
I want you to imagine that.

135
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,040
Of course, the reward is perfect.

136
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,820
By the time it hits, the 1% of the revenue will be yours.

137
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,340
1%?

138
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,560
That means, if you earn 10 billion, 10 million, and 1 billion,

139
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,420
100 million?

140
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,660
That's not bad.

141
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,460
Then I'll do it.

142
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,160
Here, sign here.

143
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:23,920
Yeah.

144
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,760
The shooting is in a week.

145
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,160
Until then,

146
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,160
I will definitely,

147
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,720
definitely,

148
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:29,980
definitely,

149
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,880
have to make it in time.

150
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,160
Is this okay?

151
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,500
Then, take care.

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,580
It seems that the typhoon came and left in a blink of an eye.

153
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,440
Even so,

154
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,300
is it okay for a week, senpai?

155
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,180
What?

156
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,060
For 100 million!

157
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,960
I'll do it!

158
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,360
Senpai! I'll help, too!

159
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,820
Let's ask Sakonji-san and Borubo-san to help us!

160
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,580
Let's ask Sakonji-san and Borubo-san to help us!

161
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,260
Let's get it!

162
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,840
Let's get it!

163
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,400
Let's get it!

164
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,960
Finally, it's finished.

165
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,240
We did it, senpai.

166
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,740
I made it for a week in a hurry.

167
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,700
A millionth-in-a-lifetime future city Kamen Rider.

168
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,080
It's a party that's a new beginning.

169
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,000
This is a hard 100 million yen.

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,060
It's hard, isn't it?

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,100
That's right.

172
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,000
It's completed!

173
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,940
It's a wonderful weapon!

174
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,520
The image is coming up!

175
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,640
We're going to start shooting soon! Stand by!

176
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:00,760
Yes!

177
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,340
Stand by! Hurry up!

178
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,380
The image that came up is disappearing!

179
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,580
Oh, right, the assistant director is also doing it.

180
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,920
That's right! The assistant director is in the middle of work to be beaten up!

181
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,220
Don't drag me into unnecessary things!

182
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,500
Why are you so popular with girls?

183
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,360
Hurry up!

184
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,720
Ready!

185
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,680
Scene 13, take 1!

186
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,620
Start!

187
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,860
Cut! Yes, OK!

188
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,440
Hey, are you ready?

189
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,460
I'll cut it for a moment. That's my movie.

190
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,440
All right, the image is coming up!

191
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,800
Next is the scene of the big bang on the wall!

192
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:47,940
I'm going to shoot the scene!

193
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,360
What? The big bang?

194
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,740
There's still another scene to shoot!

195
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,700
This is the only way to translate this image into a film!

196
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,500
Break it down!

197
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,500
The future city that I made in a moment of time,

198
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,960
just a few seconds ago...

199
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,580
Cut!

200
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,860
Director Jo, prepare a dog!

201
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,400
Dog? That's not in the script!

202
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:15,640
It's not in the script!

203
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,340
The image is coming up!

204
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,940
Dog! This scene needs a dog no matter what!

205
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,160
What kind of image is this?

206
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,860
Hurry up! Dog! Dog!

207
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,360
Cut!

208
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,840
Scene 13, take 1!

209
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,520
Start!

210
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,920
Cut!

211
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,120
Director Jo, prepare a dog!

212
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,400
Cut!

213
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,200
Director Jo, prepare a dog!

214
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,280
Cut!

215
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,140
Can't you hear me?

216
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,640
No, director!

217
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,700
Director! Director!

218
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,520
What's wrong?

219
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,460
If you don't call me Kyosho, I won't move.

220
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,580
It's a hassle.

221
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,340
Kyosho, I've prepared a dog!

222
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,780
It's hard for Ryo-chan.

223
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,060
She has to be careful about how to call.

224
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,340
No.

225
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,540
No?

226
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:11,820
Oh, no?

227
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,740
They say the image is different.

228
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,400
Can someone find a different dog for me?

229
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,220
What?

230
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,700
No.

231
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,360
I don't want to.

232
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,340
No, no, no.

233
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,000
Isn't it amazing?

234
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,720
My image is still the same, is it?

235
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,120
Then which dog do you really like?

236
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,160
Oh, that.

237
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,880
Don't turn about with your greed.

238
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,000
It's so hot that it's gonna get on your face!

239
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,700
If you eat it, you'll get a bite of anything!

240
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,160
You're the one who's gonna die!

241
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,320
Me?

242
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,600
Why would you do this?

243
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
For 100 million yen, Ryotsu.

244
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,120
Yeah, Ryotsu. If you lose your temper here, it won't work.

245
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,920
Besides, you look good in it.

246
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,320
Here you go.

247
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,520
Thanks.

248
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,820
You guys are so easy-going!

249
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,220
Let's go!

250
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,540
Alright, here we go!

251
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,840
Action!

252
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,280
You're not even a dog from that far away.

253
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,960
What's the difference between you and other dogs?

254
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,040
Run at full speed!

255
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,380
Here we go!

256
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:38,980
That's it, Kuraitsu!

257
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,160
You're gonna get your revenge!

258
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,040
I won!

259
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,740
Alright, here we go!

260
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,320
The drowning person is coming!

261
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,080
The rescue dog jumps in!

262
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,160
Alright, action!

263
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,240
What?

264
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,160
What?

265
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,580
What?

266
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,620
What?

267
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,680
I'm getting all sweaty!

268
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,480
That was a close call!

269
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,080
Hey, hello there!

270
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,500
You're all right?

271
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:29,980
Hey, Ryo.

272
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,840
The stuntman isn't here!

273
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,680
What? An accident? Can't you come?

274
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,620
What should I do? The director might get angry and leave.

275
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,720
If the movie doesn't get finished, the promised amount will be zero.

276
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,520
Please do something, Ryo-chan.

277
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,600
I'll do it.

278
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,060
So I'm going to be the one to do it.

279
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,520
Listen, I'll shoot you flying and falling upside down.

280
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,400
I'll show you the expression of fear.

281
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,080
This is the camera art.

282
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,020
Ryo-chan, you can fly as far as you want.

283
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,380
Senpai, I don't need to worry because the mat is new.

284
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,260
What?

285
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,120
In a word,

286
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,740
I thought you were a good guy.

287
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,780
Are you ready, Ryo-tsu?

288
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,500
Oh, yeah.

289
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,980
All right, start shooting.

290
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,360
Action.

291
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,340
Here we go.

292
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,160
Fire!

293
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,500
All right, now.

294
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,120
Take off the mat.

295
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,920
What are you doing?

296
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,520
Camera, look at that face.

297
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,800
Let's do another take.

298
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,260
What the hell is this?

299
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:58,900
That- uh...

300
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:58,960
We lost the director?

301
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,620
We even coat that clown's hands?

302
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,780
My work at Hollywood became a priority.

303
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,340
It rubbed off my reputation with a fight in Japan.

304
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,720
What should I do?

305
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,160
What about the movie?

306
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,240
If it doesn't come out as planned, then it's all over.

307
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,100
Until the movie's over, I'll get my ass kicked.

308
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,300
What?

309
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,860
I've been through so much trouble, but I'm going to make it all pay off!

310
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,400
If the director isn't here, I'll be the director!

311
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,420
But the sponsor...

312
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,040
The camera director is gone, so everyone got off.

313
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,620
If the sponsor got off, then the fee is...

314
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,500
You can't pay for that!

315
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,460
Hey, what are you going to do, Ryotsu?

316
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,800
Ugh...

317
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,740
If this goes on, I'll find a sponsor myself!

318
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,840
A sponsor?

319
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,520
Look! I'll make it all pay off!

320
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,560
What?

321
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,260
A movie sponsor?

322
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,140
You mean me?

323
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,860
This Kameari Shopping Street is a movie sponsor, right?

324
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,140
That's right. Instead, the entire shop will appear and become a commercial.

325
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,920
Hmm...

326
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,020
It's not a bad story, but what kind of content is it?

327
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,500
That's...

328
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,180
This is a bit boring.

329
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,080
After all...

330
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,780
There's no need for a movie sponsor.

331
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,280
I want an action scene like a Hong Kong movie.

332
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,740
How about a car chase?

333
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,940
It looks good to promote our model.

334
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,700
I want more people to come and see it.

335
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:01,940
How about a musical?

336
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,260
Huh?

337
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,040
What?

338
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,280
What?

339
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:04,620
What?

340
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,380
What?

341
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:05,820
What?

342
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,000
What?

343
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,520
What?

344
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:06,680
What?

345
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:06,980
What?

346
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,240
What?

347
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,540
What?

348
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,080
What?

349
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,260
What?

350
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:31,980
контрligt

351
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,580
You idiot!

352
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,720
I'll make you look like a nude for the sake of art!

353
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,100
Yeah, I'll take it off too.

354
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,940
Who wants to see your nude?

355
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,280
The audience will be shocked!

356
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,880
You're really okay, Ryo-chan.

357
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,400
Leave it to me!

358
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,760
Listen, just take everything off, it doesn't matter what it is.

359
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,980
Everything?

360
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,740
Yes, just everything!

361
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Okay...

362
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,860
I understand.

363
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,160
Later, we'll make a video of Reiko's scene and then we'll go on the back route.

364
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,820
Alright, crank in!

365
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,300
Yeah!

366
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,100
Main stage, start, action!

367
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,020
This isn't happening in the meeting room!

368
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,380
It's happening in the candy shop in Kameari Shopping Street!

369
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,900
Thief! Wait!

370
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,120
2...

371
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,180
Cut!

372
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,880
Okay, next!

373
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,160

it has finally been completed, overcoming many difficulties.

512
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,880
Is it worth it?

The Kameyari Shopping Street's electricity is so cheap,

525
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,460
I bought it because it was cheap, but I was late.

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,200
What the hell is this?

565
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,840
Do you hate this?

566
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,080
Do you hate this?

567
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,540
I'm not kidding!

568
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,080
You're so crazy!

569
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,120
You're so crazy!

570
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,900
You're so crazy!

571
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,480
I have a dream of 3 billion yen!

572
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,200
I have a dream of 3 billion yen!

573
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,480
I have a dream of 3 billion yen!

574
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,140
It rained on a rainy afternoon

575
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,600
As if someone is calling me

576
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:02,200
Looking back I reached out

577
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,040
To walk with my mother

578
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,640
I felt

579
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,960
Some kind of strange feelings

580
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,720
I felt at the time

581
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,980
I walked on the black tile

582
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:31,460
Everyone was a child once, but everyone forgets

583
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,560
A politician with a great face

584
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,800
An old lady with blue eyes

585
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,520
Look up at that corner

586
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,760
You'll meet everyone

587
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,960
There's a turtle there

588
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,720
There must be a turtle

589
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,840
Come to our town

590
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,200
There's a turtle there

591
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,880
There must be a turtle

592
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,620
Come to our town

593
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,080
Thank you!

594
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,000
Honda was dumped and started to disband?

595
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,300
And then, you have a child and a student?

596
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,380
What's that?

597
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,660
I can read that too!

598
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,240
Alright, how about this?

599
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,220
"Honda was dumped and went on a great rampage"

600
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,980
Next time, "The Great Worm, Okuno Hosomichi"

601
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,760
See you!

602
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,800
"There's a turtle there"

603
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,640
"There must be a turtle"

604
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,940
"Come, everyone"

605
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,740
"Come to our town"

606
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,880
Thank you!

607
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,680
To Be Continued
