00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
The

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,240
The

3
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:01,720
The

4
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,540
The

5
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,100
The

6
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,200
The

7
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,640
The

8
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:06,860
The

9
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:06,880
The

10
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,240
The

11
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,260
The

12
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:07,320
The

13
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,240
When you watch TV,

14
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,760
make the room bright and

15
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,460
look away.

16
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,720
Meow meow

17
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,940
Meow meow

18
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,140
Meow meow

19
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,440
Come to me,

20
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,340
you poor guy!

21
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,400
I'm not here,

22
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,960
but I'm worried.

23
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
Look at the blue sky,

24
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,060
and the white clouds.

25
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,560
I wonder what will happen

26
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,020
in the meantime.

27
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,020
You get it, right?

28
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,920
You get it, you get it?

29
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,140
If you get it,

30
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,420
then quietly come to me!

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,080
If you get it,

32
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
then immediately come to me!

33
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,820
Meow meow

34
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,660
Meow meow

35
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,080
Meow meow

36
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,220
Meow meow

37
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,420
Meow meow

38
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,020
Meow meow

39
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,280
The worst escape ever!

40
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,720
What time is it?

41
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,220
It's dark.

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,720
I feel like my head's going to break.

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,860
It's so dark that I can't see anything.

44
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,300
Where am I?

45
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,860
Is it Volvo?

46
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,380
Ryotsu.

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,760
Don't make such a loud noise!

48
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,140
My head's going to break!

49
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,160
It's me, Honda.

50
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,400
Honda?

51
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,620
Thank goodness, Senpai.

52
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,780
It's so dark when I wake up.

53
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,140
I feel so...

54
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,580
What's wrong?

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,180
Someone's falling!

56
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,560
Wait. I'm coming.

57
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,760
Volvo!

58
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,380
Damn it.

59
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,080
I can't move if it's this dark.

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,320
Huh?

61
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,400
But why is there a lighter in my pocket?

62
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,160
Who's MH?

63
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,760
Mr. Sakonji!

64
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,240
Hey, Sakonji!

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,120
Saori!

66
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,120
Idiot, I'm not Saori!

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,440
What's this?

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,120
We don't know, either.

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,640
What is this?

70
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,860
Is this a cave?

71
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,900
No, it's not.

72
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,320
This wall is made of metal.

73
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,760
Huh.

74
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,580
The wall is 5-60cm thick.

75
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,380
The ceiling is 15, 6, 7, 8 meters.

76
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,140
Hey, we don't have a window or a door.

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,120
Where did we come in?

78
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,900
Maybe UFOs were sent by aliens!

79
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,080
No!

80
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,980
The antenna's not working!

81
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,660
I can't use the phone!

82
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,040
Let's save gas.

83
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,340
Let's turn off the light.

84
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,440
What's wrong?

85
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,360
I'm scared of the dark.

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
I'm so scared!

87
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,440
Apparently we were locked in a complete room.

88
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,400
Hmm.

89
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,440
What?

90
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,400
What?

91
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,140
What?

92
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,340
What?

93
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,100
What?

94
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,880
What?

95
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,100
What?

96
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,220
What?

97
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:46,460
What?

98
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,260
What?

99
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:47,760
What?

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,080
What?

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,440
What?

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,380
Is the power out?

103
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:53,960
The power's out?

104
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,020
The power's out?

105
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,260
It's not working.

106
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,240
Looks like Ryo turned it off.

107
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,280
It's probably in the room.

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,360
Wasn't it your birthday party yesterday?

109
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,320
Yeah.

110
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,240
It was a very manly guy's game.

111
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,900
Yay!

112
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,040
I'm glad I didn't have to go.

113
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,140
Pardon me, but we're going to the second floor.

114
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,520
We're going to the second floor.

115
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,020
But you're free to stay a few more days.

116
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,820
So you'll be free to stay for the next two days.

117
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,260
That's not the point.

118
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,000
Remember our foot steps from last night.

119
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,040
If you know where this is, you'll find the way out.

120
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,420
It doesn't matter how small it is, just remember what you said.

121
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,520
Last night, Sakonjiro and I gathered at the yakiniku shop on his birthday.

122
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,360
It's good so far.

123
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,940
The green onion and salt kalbi were delicious.

124
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,100
The stone-baked bibimbap and yukhoe were also delicious.

125
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,360
But the dessert, the shiratama kinako ice cream was amazing.

126
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,960
Enough talking about food.

127
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,080
Go ahead and finish up.

128
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,260
After leaving the yakiniku shop, I walked around the garbage shop several times.

129
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,180
I remember the third time, but...

130
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,800
It's Saori! The fourth time, it was a store called Saori!

131
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,840
Oh, but the store's mother is...

132
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,440
It's Saori!

133
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,340
I see.

134
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,140
Thanks to you, Sakonjiro is doing well.

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,720
It's a nightmare!

136
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,440
What are your memories from then?

137
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,540
Hmm...

138
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,020
In the end, there's no clue.

139
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,980
Hmm...

140
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,260
All right, let's think of a way to escape on our own.

141
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,320
Yeah, that's your specialty.

142
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,040
I'm counting on you, Bulbo.

143
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,860
All right.

144
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,000
Everyone, take out your belongings.

145
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,320
There may be something useful for escaping.

146
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,020
I'm going to take out my belongings.

147
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm going to take out my belongings.

148
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,420
Hmm...

149
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,880
How's that?

150
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,100
Can you pull it off?

151
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,120
I can't.

152
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:51,940
Huh?

153
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,360
Don't give up!

154
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,020
Use your ex-GreenBerry history.

155
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,520
It's a Hollywood movie, right?

156
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,340
Combine these junkies...

157
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,540
...and you'll come up with a weapon you haven't even considered.

158
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:05,940
Ouch!

159
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,300
No way.

160
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,760
Listen, Ryotsu.

161
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,320
In the case of movies, the junkie calculated in advance to be able to make weapons is available.

162
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,880
But...

163
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,320
This is a piece of junk, so it's impossible.

164
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,580
If you explain it to me, I'll get angry.

165
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,940
It's a professional to make delicious food with the excess in the refrigerator.

166
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,440
It's a professional who is particular about the material.

167
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,220
What?

168
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,760
This is the last way.

169
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,320
Open the wind hole on the wall with this ...

170
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,220
Hey, idiot! Stop!

171
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,340
If you blow this up in such a small place, we will all be blown away.

172
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,040
I can't.

173
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,580
I can't.

174
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,160
The face of Saori's mother is stuck in my head and I can't remember my beloved Saori's face.

175
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,080
Saori!

176
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,800
This is a dream.

177
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,220
It's not a dream! It's not a dream!

178
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes.

179
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,620
I'm sorry.

180
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,440
I'm sorry to forget the police notebook.

181
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,020
I started to get drunk and take it off.

182
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,760
Haven't you gone home?

183
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,120
Ryo hasn't been home since yesterday.

184
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,200
Honda and Sakonji?

185
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,380
Ryo and his wife haven't gone home?

186
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,980
Ryo and his wife?

187
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,260
All three of them are not in the room.

188
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,440
Are they?

189
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Then, Ryo and his wife left the store at 3:00 a.m.

190
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,860
All four of them were drunk, so I was a little worried.

191
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,520
I can't contact my wife.

192
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,720
Your wife doesn't contact you either.

193
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,480
Didn't you say you were going somewhere after that?

194
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,000
Well...

195
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,600
Oh, right.

196
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,900
Someone said they wanted to eat ramen.

197
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,380
I told him about a delicious ramen shop nearby.

198
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,360
If you use your useless power, you will lose your appetite.

199
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,920
Are you saying you have to wait for Mira to be quiet?

200
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,100
If you do this, someone may notice you.

201
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,560
You may be right.

202
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,540
Listen to me.

203
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,180
What?

204
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,520
Hey, what are you doing?

205
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,460
You heard the sound?

206
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,740
It's noisy there. Nobody can notice it.

207
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,620
Really?

208
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,260
But there are people out there.

209
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,560
Here it is.

210
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,000
Help me.

211
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,180
Help!

212
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,940
Help!

213
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,300
Damn it!

214
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,860
Are we going to die here?

215
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,540
Don't be stupid! Someone will come to save us!

216
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,480
Nobody knows we're here!

217
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,120
4 of the same name.

218
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,300
Hey, who is the marketing department of the Toyo Telecom?

219
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,060
Who is the marketing department of the Toyo Telecom?

220
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,540
Hm? Hatakeyama?

221
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
I don't know.

222
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,800
I don't know either, but...

223
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,300
What about Sakonji?

224
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,320
I don't know.

225
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,360
Hm? Hatakeyama Mamoru?

226
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,960
The initial is MH.

227
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,500
This lighter seems to belong to this Hatakeyama guy, but...

228
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,660
Who is this guy?

229
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,120
The lighter's fire!

230
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,040
That's why I told you to save gas!

231
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,940
The lighter's fire!

232
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,220
Hey, get a hold of yourself!

233
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
It's so hot.

234
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,560
Do you want to do something to get rid of your heat?

235
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,420
It's so hot.

236
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm so drunk.

237
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,020
I'm so drunk, Sakonji.

238
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,100
I...

239
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,120
I'm so drunk.

240
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,340
I'm so drunk.

241
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,880
I...

242
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,700
I...

243
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,200
I'm in hell.

244
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,020
I...

245
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,660
Shelt down.

246
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,900
We're out of luck.

247
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,580
I'm out of luck again.

248
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm out of luck...

249
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,780
Dang it!

250
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,620
Don't do that!

251
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,280
My badass leg...

252
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,120
It's decaying.

253
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,800
A hornet...

254
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,120
I've yearned for this...

255
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,300
L-Logoku...

256
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,020
Stop saying "Kuwabara, Kuwabara!"

257
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,220
This isn't a play!

258
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,560
Why are you all saying such mean things?

259
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,620
You're getting on my nerves!

260
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,320
Then, I'll go with "La" from Kuwabara, Sakonji.

261
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,540
You're going to continue?!

262
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,760
It's easier to get on my nerves when you're focused on something.

263
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,120
Alright, go with a bright mind!

264
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,000
You're going to get on my nerves when you're focused on something.

265
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,940
You're going to get on my nerves when you're focused on something.

266
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,320
"La" right?

267
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,440
Lionel Richie!

268
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,020
Who's there?!

269
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,000
Come here!

270
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,460
What was that voice?

271
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,980
There's one more person.

272
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,280
Listen up! Don't move until you know who the enemy is!

273
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,020
Enemy?

274
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,560
A long time ago, there were seven men.

275
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,100
A long time ago, there were seven men.

276
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,500
There are seven men, right?

277
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,040
That means that there are 25 enemies in total, right?

278
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,000
There are 28, right?

279
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,440
That's right.

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,720
That's right.

281
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,980
I knew it! It's an alien!

282
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,300
No, it's a salaryman.

283
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,160
Ah, hello!

284
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,320
Hello!

285
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:50,980
Ah...

286
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,820
Ah!

287
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,000
Ah!

288
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Hello...

289
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,540
Are you perhaps...

290
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:56,940
Are you perhaps...

291
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,460
Hatakeyama Mamoru?

292
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:58,900
Hatakeyama Mamoru?

293
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,020
I've been completely soaked.

294
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,360
I'm really bad at drinking.

295
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,980
I have to go to work every other day and the following day is the second day.

296
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,100
My head hurts...

297
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,680
Um, Hatakeyama-kun knows about us, right?

298
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,980
Ryo-san, Sakonji-san, Honda-san, Volvo-san.

299
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,140
Ryo-san, Sakonji-san, Honda-san, Volvo-san.

300
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,680
Right?

301
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,040
Well, I had fun yesterday.

302
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,820
That's right, that's right!

303
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,780
He was at the ramen shop we went to!

304
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,860
Hey!

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,660
Hey, Suni!

306
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,660
Hey, Dad!

307
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,200
Hey, Dad!

308
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,700
Let's go to the ramen shop!

309
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,380
Hey, Suni-chan!

310
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,560
Hey, Suni-chan!

311
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:35,820
How are you?

312
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,240
Saori!

313
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,040
Yes?

314
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,000
Saori!

315
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,120
At first, I thought they were a little scary, but when I talked to them, they were really funny.

316
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,160
Saori!

317
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,580
Saori!

318
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,060
Saori!

319
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,100
Saori!

320
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,500
Uh ... what are you doing, you?

321
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:51,940
Yes!

322
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,740
Saori!

323
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,060
Uh ... what 's this?

324
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,340
Saori!

325
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,300
Saori!

326
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,560
Saori!

327
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,920
I haven't played that much for a long time.

328
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,460
Do you remember where this is?

329
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,000
Here?

330
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,760
Mm ... yes...

331
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,960
Um ...

332
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,380
Um ...

333
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:15,600
Yeah ...

334
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,140
Yeah ...

335
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,320
Yes ...

336
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes ...

337
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,120
Yes ...

338
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,180
Where is this place?

339
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,040
I knew it.

340
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,920
I don't remember how we walked here, but I think I saw a mountain far away.

341
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,300
A mountain?

342
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,080
Did Kazushika see a mountain?

343
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,600
Maybe we came to a place far away.

344
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,620
But there's a limit to how far we can go with drunk blood.

345
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,820
I don't know why I'm getting more and more confused.

346
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,060
Hatakeyama, do you remember anything else?

347
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,100
Other than that...

348
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,100
Huh?

349
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,340
I think I had something important to do today.

350
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,260
Umm, umm...

351
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,460
What was it?

352
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,300
Oh!

353
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,400
Oh!

354
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,560
Excuse me, what time is it now?

355
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,240
The clock...

356
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,200
12:30.

357
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,180
Huh?

358
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,180
My phone is gone!

359
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,100
I'll borrow this phone!

360
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,880
Oh, dear.

361
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,420
Unfortunately,

362
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,820
I can't make a call here.

363
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,460
I'll use it later.

364
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,220
Oh, I have to go home.

365
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,200
I'm going home!

366
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,080
Huh?

367
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,580
Well, where's the exit?

368
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,380
That's what we've been looking for a long time, but it doesn't seem like it.

369
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,180
There isn't?

370
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,740
In other words, we won't be able to get out of here for the time being.

371
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,540
I'm in trouble.

372
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,860
I have to go to the head office at once.

373
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,520
Where?

374
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,960
There's a wedding.

375
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,880
A wedding?

376
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,240
Whose?

377
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:46,800
Who?

378
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,320
This guy?

379
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,160
Who?

380
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,220
I'm going home.

381
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,780
I'll go with you.

382
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,940
I'm going home!

383
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,040
I'm going home!

384
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,880
Well, that's a good news.

385
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,440
I don't know what's going on.

386
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,700
That's all I need.

387
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,720
My sister's getting married.

388
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,540
I'm going home.

389
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:14,900
I'm going home.

390
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,480
I'm going home.

391
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:15,680
I'm going home.

392
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,480
Hm? What's wrong with Ryotsu?

393
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,820
Are you going on patrol too?

394
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,060
Y-Yes...

395
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,840
You're going on patrol, aren't you?

396
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,920
U-Um... Y-Yes...

397
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,360
Hm.

398
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,060
Your good side is that you never tell a lie, right,

399
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,700
you old man?

400
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,940
That's right, I'm late for work yesterday.

401
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,960
I'm late for this, but

402
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,420
I was so annoyed by the screams of those mean men

403
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,320
that my cute Charis-chan woke up...

404
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,680
I was in a big trouble.

405
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,160
Really?

406
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
Were they your seniors?

407
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,240
Probably.

408
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,460
Ah, that's right.

409
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,800
Somehow, I heard the girl's name a lot.

410
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,020
I think...

411
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,460
Sa... Sa... Sa...

412
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,260
Saori!

413
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Yes, Saori!

414
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,600
As I thought.

415
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,800
I won't tell a lie!

416
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,800
I skipped my work because I was drunk,

417
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,840
and I worried about my friends,

418
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,980
and I was annoyed by people's hands!

419
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,700
What a bad guy!

420
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,200
Y-Yes...

421
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,260
Don't worry, Terai.

422
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,200
Tell Nakagawa and Reiko to return to their normal jobs.

423
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,420
But...

424
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,880
I have to go to a important ceremony from now on.

425
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,400
When he comes back,

426
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,300
I'll make sure to squeeze the oil out of him later!

427
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,880
Tell him that.

428
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,360
Y-Yes!

429
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,300
Hey!

430
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,480
Somebody help me!

431
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,640
No, no.

432
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,000
We've done a lot of things, but nobody noticed.

433
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,060
We're just hungry.

434
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,020
That's why we're just staying still!

435
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,340
I'm sorry, Yuriko!

436
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,960
This isn't for Hatakeyama-kun, is it?

437
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:03,980
What?

438
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,220
Ah...

439
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,460
If she gets this,

440
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:10,960
she'll be a writer.

441
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,860
I see...

442
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,680
We have a responsibility to get him involved, don't we?

443
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,980
Even if we didn't know,

444
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,220
we brought him here the night before the wedding.

445
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,700
No, I think we heard you.

446
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,520
What?

447
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,900
You're getting married tomorrow?

448
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,180
Yes!

449
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,240
It's a big deal!

450
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,740
So, if she gets this,

451
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,180
will she be a writer?

452
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,140
Yes!

453
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,900
It's included in my initials!

454
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,900
That being said,

455
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,460
I'm early tomorrow,

456
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,700
so I'll be going home now.

457
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,660
What are you doing?!

458
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,860
Getting married tomorrow

459
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,940
means tonight is the last night of my life!

460
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,600
But I'm going home soon!

461
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
If you get married,

462
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:50,920
you'll be left behind by God!

463
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,020
You'll be with me until the morning!

464
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,940
I'll take care of this writer until then!

465
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,800
No, please give it back!

466
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,320
Shut up!

467
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,200
Hey, hey!

468
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,420
Bye!

469
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,000
Shut up!

470
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,160
No, no, no!

471
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:07,540
What's wrong?

472
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,160
Then,

473
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,400
it's all our fault, isn't it?

474
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,120
Yeah.

475
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,360
I have to get him married somehow.

476
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,480
But what do we do?

477
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,100
Huh?

478
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,980
What the hell are you eating?

479
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,420
Huh?

480
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,560
Um, gum.

481
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,360
You ate it all, didn't you?

482
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,440
What?!

483
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,500
You ate the only food?!

484
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,420
I'll give it back to you!

485
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,000
Ouch!

486
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,540
What are you doing?

487
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,240
Huh?

488
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,700
Huh?

489
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,520

What's wrong?

498
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,060
I see.

499
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,920
What's wrong?

500
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,880
Reiko, isn't this the president's work?

501
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,020
What?

502
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,620
It's been 25 years, but it's changed a lot.

503
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,620
I went to see the work of Miyashita Jinko and Esumi Eimei's Kumashiro Tatsue,

504
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,700
but Kameyari Meikazawa isn't here anymore.

505
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,320
There have been many things in the past 25 years.

506
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,700
I'll give you some instructions.

507
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,300
I'll be old and remember the old days.

508
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:44,460
That was a great speech, sir.

509
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,480
I heard you could see the governor, but it seems you haven't seen him yet.

510
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,840
I see. I'm sorry.

511
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,560
I wanted you to hear my speech.

512
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,840
What?

513
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,680
I heard you could see the governor, but it seems you haven't seen him yet.

514
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,980
I heard you could see the governor, but it seems you haven't seen him yet.

515
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,720
There's the president, too.

516
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,000
Kei, what's that?

517
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:09,920
I wonder what it is.

518
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,980
I wonder what it is.

519
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,000
I wonder what it is.

520
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:20,660
Well,

521
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:20,960
I don't know.

522
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,720
Well,

523
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,200
let's begin the

524
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:40,980
Senior, hurry!

525
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,820
I'm in a hurry.

526
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,800
Senior, hurry!

527
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,680
What?

528
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,680
Let's start!

529
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,920
Ready, set, go!

530
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,460
Alright!

531
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,860
Go, Hatakeyama!

532
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,080
The monster is angry!

533
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,460
No way!

534
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:18,840
Why?

535
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,700
I have to calm it down!

536
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:33,180
I did it!

537
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,720
It's out! It's out!

538
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,340
What is this?

539
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,240
Is this...

540
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,060
...a...

541
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,580
...a...

542
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,360
...ghost?!

543
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,340
Why is it in this place?!

544
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,380
It's a mountain!

545
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,520
Ah!

546
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,320
Here, here!

547
00:21:59,460 --> 00:21:59,860
I got it!

548
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,460
Give it back to me!

549
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,800
It's my lighter!

550
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,380
What's wrong with you?

551
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,540
It's a mountain! Alright! Let's climb the mountain!

552
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,380
Oh, you're giving me the light back!

553
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,940
Here, take this!

554
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,040
Alright! Alright!

555
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,040
Good!

556
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,720
Alright! Alright!

557
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,020
Here I go!

558
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,880
Here I go!

559
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,520
What!!

560
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,860
Th, that's how it should be!

561
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,900
amorph~

562
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,640
Nj xu chal~

563
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,440
That's stupid!!

564
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,940
Hey, Hatakeyama! The wedding is--

565
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,620
It's coming, in no time.

566
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,120
Let's go, Hatakeyama-kun.

567
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,800
Yes. Everyone, thank you very much.

568
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,840
Please tell Ryotsu-san about this.

569
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,840
Yes.

570
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,300
Let's go.

571
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,560
Yes.

572
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,700
How is it going?

573
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,920
It seems it's better to pretend that nothing happened.

574
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,780
That's right.

575
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,640
Take this!

576
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,300
The ceremony will start in five minutes.

577
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,360
Five minutes is enough!

578
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,400
Hey!

579
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,660
You big idiot!

580
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,400
Even if you say that, I was locked up and I was about to become a Buddha.

581
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,520
It's your fault, you idiot!

582
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,360
You idiot!

583
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,340
I'm sorry!

584
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,280
I'm sorry for being so mean!

585
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,940
Shizuna Ooi

586
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,720
Shizuna Ooi

587
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,640
An old man who also played with his old muffler.

588
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,040
It seems to be back now!

589
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,440
Shizuna Ooi

590
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,920
Oni-chan, the зр.

591
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,340
Shizuna Ooi

592
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,300
It seems to be a little tricky…

593
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,920
Shizuna Ooi

594
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,500
It's a good feeling

595
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,040
So I walked on the black side of the Akegokai

596
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:47,900
I walked on the black side of the Akegokai

597
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,160
Everyone was a child at least once

598
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,880
But everyone forgets

599
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,360
Politicians with great-looking faces

600
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,640
And a blue aunt above their eyes

601
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,040
Turn around and look at that corner

602
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,820
You'll meet everyone

603
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,940
There is a wall

604
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,340
There must be a wall

605
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,300
Everyone come to our town

606
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,420
Thank you!

607
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,780
Please subscribe!

608
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,620
One hundred million yen!

609
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,260
Why is the bonus being paid one hundred million yen?

610
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,180
Wait, even if it's wrong

611
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,060
The one who entered my account once is mine

612
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,080
I'll withdraw all the money and pay back the debt I've earned so far

613
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,560
Next time, Bonus Battle Six

614
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,720
Thank you!

615
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,780
There is a wall there

616
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,900
There must be a wall

617
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,620
There must be a wall

618
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,440
There must be a wall

619
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,240
There must be a wall

620
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,600
There must be a wall

621
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,040
Thank you!

622
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,860
I'll use one more

623
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,380
Please subscribe!

624
