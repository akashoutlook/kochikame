00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,160
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:13,800
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,360
I look up at the sunset floating in the middle of the sea

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,600
and fly to the place where I left my love stone.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,200
I look up at the sunset floating in the middle of the sea

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,380
and fly to the place where I left my love stone.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,720
I was laughed at by the head of the gym who was jogging.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,420
I was laughed at by the head of the gym who was jogging.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,300
I'm so happy that I can't help but laugh at the sound of the sound.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:48,520
I'm so happy that I can't help but laugh at the sound of the sound.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,180
Hey, are you eating yakitori?

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,300
From a

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,460
stormy downpour in a club that's hot,

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,580
the sunset on the extent of the sun sets.

16
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,720
I'm also LEDs tomorrow and it will end.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,940
I'm also LEDs tomorrow and it will end.

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,540
I lost happiness at the last minute.

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,200
The silly me who fell into my own trap.

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,940
Hey~

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,080
♪♪♪

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,920
Ryou Chikan Kichi

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,780
Yay! It took a month to finish!

24
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,120
The ship Nagata's original hand made plastic model is a very nice product!

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,560
It's like a war.

26
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,720
I worked for three days to finish it.

27
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,800
I'm at my limit.

28
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,180
Master, please be strong.

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,540
The time has finally come.

30
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,040
I have a long life.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,220
One week left.

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,320
I have to decide who will be the successor of the Hondara sword.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,120
Originally, my eldest son, Asato Ai, should be the successor.

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,600
But Ai was so sad that he betrayed Ryozu Kankichi.

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,880
And he lost the desire to be the successor of the Hondara sword.

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,840
But when I saw him,

37
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,960
I thought,

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,880
Ryozu Kankichi is quite good.

39
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,680
He might be the successor of the Hiden no Shio of the Hondara sword.

40
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,540
I want to confirm it with my own eyes.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,880
Call back the Hondara Shitenno who is training.

42
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,900
Why Shitenno?

43
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,180
Is he the successor of the Hondara sword?

44
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,980
I will make Shitenno fight against Ryozu Kankichi.

45
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,380
But how?

46
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,360
I have a plan.

47
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,460
Listen to me.

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,880
What kind of...

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,320
Hondara sword?

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,340
Yes, sir.

51
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,440
Move.

52
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,440
I...

53
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,560
I have to hurry...

54
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,560
I have to hurry...

55
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,480
I have to hurry...

56
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,600
I have to hurry...

57
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,360
I have to hurry...

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,620
I have to hurry...

59
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,740
I have to hurry...

60
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,960
I have to hurry...

61
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,700
I have to hurry...

62
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,020
I have to hurry...

63
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,540
I just have to hurry...

64
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,540
Move!

65
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,420
Move!

66
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,960
Move!

67
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,940
Move!

68
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,060
What the...

69
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,400
I said...

70
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,120
What's this?

71
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,720
This is better than I thought.

72
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,700
22:25

73
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,920
Ryo-tsu Krankichi,

74
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,780
This Asato Ban willzeug your important life for the next plan.

75
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:25,280
If you want to return it, come to Hondarayama, my sacred land in Hondara prefecture, by 9:59 am.

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,360
His Excellency, the Emperor of the文在天кра, is there waiting to see you.

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,680
You may as well make your path!

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:59,600
Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! G

79
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:29,580
Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah!

80
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,240
I'll blow you up.

81
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,480
No!

82
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,580
Or I'll be modified in a strange way.

83
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:34,840
You idiot!

84
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,960
I won't let you do that!

85
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,540
Maria!

86
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,580
Lord Ryo!

87
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,420
Maria, help me!

88
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,200
Where?

89
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,500
Where's that mountain of Hon-daro?

90
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,720
Could it be that in Ryo-sama's innocent eyes, there's love for me?

91
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,320
Please, Maria!

92
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,340
Yes?

93
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,440
But why would you challenge the Four Heavenly Kings again?

94
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,600
I want to know!

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,480
Of course, it's a test.

96
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,560
A test?

97
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,080
What do you mean by a test?

98
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,700
My father is trying to challenge the Four Heavenly Kings to see if Lord Ryo is suitable for my husband.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,240
But Maria, you look like a woman, but in reality you're a man!

100
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,720
No, whether you're a man or a woman, love is not enough!

101
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,560
Ouch!

102
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,020
Ouch!

103
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,020
Lord Ryo, please win for Maria's sake!

104
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,480
Please!

105
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,140
But they're all Maria-class athletes, right?

106
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,200
No enemy can train them.

107
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,020
There's a place called "Hikou".

108
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,140
If you go there, you'll win.

109
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,300
Hikou?

110
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,760
Senior, if this happens, we won't be able to play anymore!

111
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,140
That's right!

112
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,740
If you're a man, you have to be able to deal with Maria's love!

113
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,980
He's a man too!

114
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,120
It's too much!

115
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,280
Lord Ryo, please, give me your life!

116
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,380
Ouch! Ouch!

117
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:02,940
Oh!

118
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,060
Lord Ryo!

119
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,000
You idiot!

120
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,960
I was about to throw my life out here!

121
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,520
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,600
It was too much.

123
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,820
Anyway, let's go, Maria!

124
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,960
Yes, Lord Ryo!

125
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,080
Now, it's a holy land!

126
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,820
Now, it's dangerous!!

127
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,980
Yes, Lord Ryo!

128
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,500
I won't be able to live here anymore!

129
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,200
I can't go down on my own!

130
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,200
Guess I'll stay here.

131
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,820
Well, what do you think I'm talking about?

132
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,340
You were already named Lord Ryo this day.

133
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,100
But you're really the one who is the Lord of the Arche 대통령s.

134
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,620
Lord Ryo, you're my Lord?

135
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,660
Yes, you're my Lord.

136
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,900
I'm one of the Honjirashi Emperor, Chaplin the Traitor!

137
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,840
Chaplin is the Traitor, you know!

138
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,100
Ryo-sama, I'm here to--

139
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,180
Shut up! Maria, you stay back!

140
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,540
You're the one who took my plum!

141
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,900
I'm happy to hear that, Ryo-sama!

142
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,320
You're going to stand in front of me in my place, aren't you?

143
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,420
Come on, Traitor!

144
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,980
Let's go, Ryuu-tsu!

145
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,860
Ah! Ah! Ah!

146
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
What was that?

147
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:19,920
What was that?

148
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,680
Is he really that strong?

149
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,960
Don't underestimate him. His special move is...

150
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,080
Here I go!

151
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,620
Goukyuu-ken!

152
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,820
Goukyuu-ken?

153
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,060
That was when I was in kindergarten.

154
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,740
I went out with the knot my mother held for me.

155
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,280
But... but that... that...

156
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,080
I...

157
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,260
I dropped it under my hand, like a knot.

158
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,640
That was when I was in elementary school.

159
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,360
I... I...

160
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,700
I stopped going to school because of the rain.

161
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,700
I left my backpack at school.

162
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,420
I spilled milk on my breakfast, and my mother made me a soda.

163
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,100
Sometimes, I wet my face with it.

164
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,160
I was in a dance school.

165
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,940
Sometimes, I didn't even have anyone hold my hand.

166
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,140
Sometimes, I even told people about what happened

167
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,980
when I heard the other person's phone number.

168
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,380
I... I...

169
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,460
What a sad thing I am.

170
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,620
I've been born to this unfortunate planet.

171
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,960
Amazing.

172
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,900
You were crying.

173
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,520
I wasn't crying!

174
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,320
I... I wasn't crying!

175
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,880
You're crying, aren't you?

176
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,540
Be careful, Ryo-sama! The Gou-Qun sword is coming!

177
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,840
My tears are on my face!

178
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,360
Let's go, Gou-Qun sword! The attack of the tears!

179
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,480
What a stone head!

180
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,820
If you take that one blow, even iron won't work!

181
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,340
I'm crying!

182
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,780
I'm scared!

183
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,640
Damn it! What should I do?

184
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,480
That's right! If you're going to cry and get stronger, you should make me laugh!

185
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,080
Gou-Qun sword, defeat!

186
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,760
Now, Ryo-sama! The Gou-Qun sword is coming!

187
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,600
Gou-Qun sword?

188
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,200
The Gou-Qun sword of the part that no human can train!

189
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,500
I see! That's it!

190
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,520
Impact! Gou-Qun sword!

191
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,200
What should I do?

192
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,380
This is my plan!

193
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,660
You did well, Ryo-sama!

194
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,500
I have to hurry! Otherwise, my Pramo will be...

195
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,440
My Pramo will be torn apart!

196
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,920
He's fighting for me, but he's hiding his shyness.

197
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,660
Pramo, Pramo, Pramo.

198
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,700
How cute, Ryo-sama!

199
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,120
The tragedy king has been defeated.

200
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,600
As expected of Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

201
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,580
I've been waiting for you, Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

202
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,380
What is this? It's like a special unit.

203
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,920
One of the Hon-Darashi Emperor, the King of the Sword, Kankichi!

204
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,720
There used to be a manga with such a name.

205
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,900
No, no!

206
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,700
Mine is "The Sword of the Fist!"

207
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,600
Even though I'm a swordsman, I'm not good at using a hammer, a candle, or any other weapon!

208
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,280
No, Ryo-sama.

209
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,740
That hammer and the candle are used for different purposes.

210
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,720
No way!

211
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,760
Ouch!

212
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,840
Not yet!

213
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,500
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

214
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
No problem!

215
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,660
It's dangerous to say that it's wrong!

216
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,960
By the way, what is his special move?

217
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,820
The sword of the sword is the skill of the sword of the sword.

218
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,460
After you hurt yourself and put up with it,

219
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,320
I'll explode your power at once.

220
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,560
It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!

221
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,120
It's coming!

222
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,900
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

223
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,180
It's coming! It's coming!

224
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,780
The power is overflowing!

225
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,440
See it! It's the Fist!

226
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,860
Oita Sword! A Sword of Love!

227
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,700
It's an amazing power!

228
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,860
That high-heel is made of metal, and weighs 100 km.

229
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,500
And if you increase the speed at which the waterfall falls,

230
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,060
any kind of metal will puncture the hole with one blow.

231
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,560
I can't believe this is happening.

232
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,440
Moreover, it has disappeared in the water of the waterfall.

233
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,160
I can't predict where it will come from.

234
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,400
It's so scary!

235
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,060
I think it's better to take it seriously.

236
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,700
I can't wait!

237
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,700
Ryo, now is the chance!

238
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,800
Make a飛行 that humans can never train!

239
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,200
Yeah!

240
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,520
Take this!

241
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,380
The captain's sword!

242
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,120
I'm trapped in the deepest part of the waterfall!

243
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,500
As expected of Ryo!

244
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,940
He read it all the way to the end!

245
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,580
If he wore a 100kg high heel,

246
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,060
he might never be able to come back up again!

247
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,360
The adventurer is also dead.

248
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,920
Yes.

249
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,080
The next morning.

250
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,960
The next morning.

251
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,140
If we get out of this grassland,

252
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,140
we'll only have to climb up the Ahondara Hill.

253
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,800
I've been waiting for you, Ryo Tsukankichi.

254
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,620
Don't be surprised to hear my name.

255
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,900
I'm pretty good at swords, though.

256
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,460
The one and only,

257
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,720
the third emperor, Dokaben!

258
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,580
As I thought!

259
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,020
Come on, come on!

260
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,280
My special move!

261
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,020
The baseball!

262
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,300
Let's try it!

263
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,760
Let's go, the thousand-sword sword!

264
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,160
You're pretty good.

265
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,260
But it's getting even worse!

266
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,600
Ryo-sama!

267
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,280
How is it?

268
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,300
Ryo-sama, stand up.

269
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,480
Please, stand up for Maria.

270
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,220
Damn you!

271
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,780
That was so good!

272
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,380
There isn't much left.

273
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,040
When it's over, that's when we win!

274
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,160
Damn you!

275
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,860
And there it is!

276
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,920
I won't forgive you for bullying Ryo anymore!

277
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,840
Ryo-sama, now is the time!

278
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,360
Don't make a habit of not being able to train humans!

279
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,380
I'm sorry, Maria!

280
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,020
Take this!

281
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,760
Emotion source!

282
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,720
Ai won again!

283
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,560
This is the true way to win!

284
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,200
We can become the ideal couple!

285
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,840
Let's hurry up, Maria!

286
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,140
At last, the last person remaining in the ground...

287
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,340
Promo! My Promo!

288
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,420
Ryo-sama, you've worked hard.

289
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,900
No, it's for Promo's sake!

290
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,240
You're hiding your shyness again and saying it's for Promo's sake.

291
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,200
Ryo-sama, I want to live in a house made of bricks with green grass when we get married.

292
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,160
Do you have any wishes, Ryo-sama?

293
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,620
If Promo and I are safe, anything is fine!

294
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,200
Of course, we'll prepare a room for you, Ryo-sama.

295
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,260
I'll be your good wife!

296
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,000
My Promo!

297
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,300
Maria!

298
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,060
I've been waiting for you, Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

299
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,920
I am the strongest of the Hondarashi Tensho!

300
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,700
The Hundred Beast King, Lion-maru!

301
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,540
This is the real thing!

302
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,840
That's right.

303
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,160
Maria, are you okay?

304
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,320
No, Maria has the power of Ryo-sama's love!

305
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,480
What's wrong, Ryo-tsu Kankichi? Come on!

306
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,720
Let's go, the Impact Tentacle!

307
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,940
What?

308
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,240
Huh? What's that?

309
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,120
Let's go, my Impact Killing Skill, Burning Serpent Sword!

310
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,720
W-W-W-What?

311
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,880
Oh, no!

312
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,160
Let's go!

313
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,740
Nooooooo-!

314
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,000
Lord Ryo!

315
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,560
Next is the last one, can you do what you want?

316
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,440
Ryan, the flight...

317
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,220
...that parts of human beings are not allowed to work can be a flight.

318
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,200
This will be the end, Ryotsu.

319
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,140
Impact!

320
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,620
"Roundeloo Sword"

321
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,700
"Zondara Sword láwardre"

322
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,680
"Shiriketsu Shiragatori"

323
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,580
I can't break out from that damsel blood wire!

324
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,780
Hmph.

325
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,160
Here I go.

326
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,780
"Burning ICS Sword"

327
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,040
- Master Ryo!

328
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,680
- Master Ryo!

329
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:57,820
Lord Ryoma!

330
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,020
Lord Ryoma!

331
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,060
Good one, Mario!

332
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,780
Imitation Blast!

333
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:26,080
I-I won.

334
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,360
I did it!

335
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,760
It's the power of love!

336
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,260
I'm glad you came all the way here, Ryotsu Kankichi.

337
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,560
The last opponent is me.

338
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,720
Hey, you're carrying a plastic bag behind you!

339
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,060
Father?

340
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,260
Hey, my plastic bag!

341
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,120
Wait, Ryotsu. I have a favor to ask you.

342
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,900
What is it?

343
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,740
I want you to give me the Hon-Dara sword.

344
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,500
No!

345
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,140
Don't worry about it.

346
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,640
What are you doing here?

347
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:11,260
Maria, my life is not long anymore.

348
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,020
What?

349
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
No way!

350
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,100
Don't be sad. This is fate.

351
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,320
Hey, give me the plastic bag!

352
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,080
I can't help it.

353
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,080
Alright, alright.

354
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:38,740
Ryotsu Kankichi, I acknowledge you as my Hon-Dara sword's true successor.

355
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,580
I'll give you this hidden sword.

356
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,200
Hey, give me the plastic bag!

357
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,880
What's wrong?

358
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,780
Ouch!

359
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,560
Ouch!

360
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,520
Father!

361
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,640
Ouch!

362
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,160
As expected of the man I've been waiting for.

363
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,880
I'll give you the Hon-Dara sword.

364
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,980
Father!

365
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,120
I will be happy with you!

366
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,780
Please watch over me in heaven!

367
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,420
What is this?

368
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,940
A needle?

369
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,040
What?

370
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,920
What?

371
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,240
What?

372
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:52,760
What?

373
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:52,840
Huh?

374
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,800
The pain which I felt while sawing

375
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,240
Oh, yeah.

376
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,500
I'm great!

377
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm super great!

378
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,040
What do you mean "great"?

379
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,600
No!

380
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
I'm premium...

381
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,140
No!

382
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,260
I'm Pramon!

383
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:27,920
You're fine!

384
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,760
With the power of our love, this is a happy ending!

385
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,940
I'm fine!

386
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,720
You're my Pramon!

387
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:52,800
Let's go!

388
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,160
You always wear sandals, always have scandals, don't worry about it!

389
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,440
Don't worry about it!

390
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,940
You play with your toenails, everyday!

391
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:08,660
Everyday!

392
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,060
You throw away your boredom in the cleaning room!

393
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,720
You have a round-out instinct, a round-out instinct, you're an idiot!

394
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,280
I'm an idiot!

395
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,860
You're innocent, you're poor, you're not good!

396
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,120
You're not?

397
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:28,760
I try to do what I want to do, and that's a good way!

398
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,680
The lightning of the leader of the catapults, smoke from the head!

399
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,300
When I run and run, there's asole!

400
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,780
If that's the case, I'm happy!

401
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,380
I have a flower port!

402
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,600
"Good job!"

403
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,900
Soililled medium土!

404
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,040
"Good luck!"

405
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,500
I can breathe freely!

406
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,040
I'm a F xiäl!

407
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,660
Juge! Juge!

408
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,900
Your mind is run out, just like the Atlas of the Sea!

409
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,980
Before the sea!

410
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,600
Lao Miao

411
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:57,760
Piglet

412
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,380
Damm

413
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,380
I got a tuna!

414
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,800
And it's a 1,500,000 yen tuna!

415
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,520
If you keep fishing like this, you can catch a lot of fish.

416
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,840
Come on, tuna.

417
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,140
Let's fight with the man of the sea, Ryo Tsukanrishi.

418
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,060
Next time, "The Police on the Tuna".

419
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,100
Thank you for watching.

420
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,720
There is a turtle there.

421
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,980
There must be a turtle there.

422
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,640
Everyone, come to our town.

423
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,740
Thank you.

424
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:48,860
Next time, "The Police on the Tuna".
