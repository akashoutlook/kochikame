00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,140
"When you watch TV, make the room bright and look away!"

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,680
"Come to me, you poor people!"

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,600
"I'm not here, but I'm worried."

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,840
"Look at the blue sky!"

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,420
"White clouds!"

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,900
"I'm sure it'll be all right!"

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,040
"You know that, right?"

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,960
"You know that, right?"

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,520
"If you know that, then shut up and follow me!"

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,320
"I'm not here, but I'm worried."

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,120
"Geez, this summer was so strange..."

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,680
"Aah, it's all..."

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,080
"Aah, it's all..." "Aah, it's all..."

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:28,580
"Aah, it's all..." "You're so bad, Big Brother!"

18
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,800
"Here, take this off! Here, take this off!"

19
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,020
"Sorry, please take off this!"

20
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,600
"Aah!"

21
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,620
"Alright, so you're up,"

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,760
"but I can't get off anymore, right?"

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,860
"Alright, so you're up,"

24
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,000
"Not going to be helped. I'm gonna go."

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,660
"Are you all right, little one?"

26
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,900
Huh?

27
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,260
You know what? I'll get off slowly one step at a time.

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,540
Ryosuke!

29
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,640
Get him!

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,320
Don't let him go!

31
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,760
What?

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,720
No!

33
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,280
I thought I was going to die.

34
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,160
That's my line!

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,680
It seems you climbed the roof of Kannon-do and Goju-no-to in Asakusa.

36
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:56,820
It seems so.

37
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,180
There are 14 in Taito-ku, Sumida-ku, and Katsushika-ku.

38
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,140
Plus the chimney of this Kame-no-yu.

39
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,820
And the Jyoshu-han.

40
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,060
Here you are.

41
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,600
Thank you.

42
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,100
If you like high places, there are many places where you can climb more safely and comfortably.

43
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,300
Safety?

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,100
There are many high-rise buildings all over Tokyo, including the tower and the department store.

45
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,100
There are many high-rise buildings all over Tokyo, including the tower and the department store.

46
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,180
I've never climbed the chimney of a bathhouse at that age.

47
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,800
What about the new place?

48
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,200
It doesn't matter whether it's new or old.

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,940
I'm telling you not to bother others.

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,780
Did you bother me?

51
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,600
I did.

52
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,320
I did it to the bathhouse, me, and the neighbors.

53
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,000
I see.

54
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,920
You did a bad thing.

55
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,020
That's all?

56
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,180
That's all.

57
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,460
I'll forgive you for today, Ryo-chan.

58
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,660
Listen, don't ever climb again.

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,600
I'll help you next time.

60
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,640
Thank you for everything.

61
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,440
That old man doesn't have a family or a family.

62
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,580
At that time, a warm wind blew.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,260
I'm happy.

64
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,180
олж

65
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,200
Stop, Ryo-san.

66
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,760
What?

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,800
Mr.miş

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,200
Why are you being so angry?

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm in trouble.

70
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,440
I'm afraid of ghosts.

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,420
I wasn't worried about you.

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,160
así

73
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,780

I'm an old man, isn't your 분

75
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,300
"Nyaaah!"

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,660
The police have finally arrived.

77
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,620
If only I could spread the rumor of the ghosts to the temple,

78
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,340
I thought it would be safe to stay away from people.

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,440
What are you doing there?!

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,280
Stop!

81
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,360
"Nyaaah!"

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,500
Be quiet!

83
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,560
Ryo-san!

84
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,120
Hm?

85
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,760
Terai!

86
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,540
Are you okay, Ryo-san?

87
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,280
Terai, please take care of this guy.

88
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,720
I'm sure there are some of his items in the temple.

89
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,200
There are still some in the temple.

90
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,480
I understand.

91
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,000
So, where's Ryo-san?

92
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm going to clean up after him.

93
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,420
"Nyaaah!"

94
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,840
"Nyaaah!"

95
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,040
"Nyaaah!"

96
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,680
Is that all?

97
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,400
It's a bad omen.

98
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,980
Don't take it the wrong way.

99
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,700
How many are there?

100
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,660
Okay.

101
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,940
Here's the address.

102
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
Please take a seat.

103
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,280
Ryo-san.

104
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,820
Do you want to listen to anything more?

105
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,200
What?

106
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,080
I want to talk to you.

107
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,200
Ryo-san.

108
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,920
Ryo-san!

109
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,240
I'm so surprised!

110
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,480
Nothing's changed.

111
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,660
Well, first, if you turn left along the shopping street, there's Kameari Station.

112
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,920
From there, go to Kitasenju on the upper line and then switch to Tobu-Isezaki Line, and then the end point is Asakusa.

113
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,760
Understood?

114
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,980
From Kameari Station to the upper line in Kitasenju...

115
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,100
From there, to the end point of Tobu-Isezaki Line...

116
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,960
Yes! Thank you very much!

117
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,320
Thank you.

118
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,120
What's that?

119
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,000
Mr. Shoukichi, it's dangerous to climb up there again!

120
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,780
Come down quickly!

121
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,880
I'm fine, I'm fine.

122
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,780
You can't! If you don't come down, we'll go this way!

123
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,420
What's wrong?

124
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,460
I don't know where the station is.

125
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,380
It'll take an hour from there. It's not a path you'll get lost on.

126
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,580
I understand. I understand. I'll send you to the station after you finish eating, so wait a bit.

127
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,460
Yes! I'll be waiting!

128
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,940
It's hard to eat when you look at me like that. Are you hungry?

129
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,940
What's your name?

130
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,340
Hanayo.

131
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,880
Hanayo, huh? How old are you?

132
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,700
17 years old.

133
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,280
Where did you come from?

134
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,840
Umm...

135
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,400
Over there.

136
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,680
Over there?

137
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,280
Over there.

138
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,500
Don't tease the police!

139
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,460
Good morning, Ryo.

140
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,520
Ah, Reiko. I'm glad you're here.

141
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,320
I'll send this girl to the station, so please take care of her.

142
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,720
Huh? This girl?

143
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,540
I'll be right back. Let's go.

144
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,200
Okay.

145
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,280
It's been a while, Asakusa.

146
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,340
It's rare to see a young girl like you in Asakusa.

147
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm not alone. I'm meeting a friend.

148
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,360
What? Then why don't you ask your friend to pick you up?

149
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,880
Does your friend have a cell phone?

150
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,080
Cell phone? I don't think so.

151
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,480
That's rare.

152
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,100
Well, I don't think all the students have one.

153
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,040
I think you're right.

154
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,660
Huh?

155
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,680
You're not a housewife, are you?

156
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,440
No, I'm not.

157
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,260
Really? Then where's your house?

158
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,400
You can't go over there or over here.

159
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,300
You need to go to your address.

160
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,400
Your address.

161
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,400
Huh? Here?

162
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,060
That means you're not a temple girl.

163
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,420
There's no temple headman here.

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,420
That means you're lying.

165
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,060
What?

166
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,360
What?

167
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,460
There's no temple headman.

168
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,560
Temple headman! I'll go home if you're joking!

169
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,500
Okay?

170
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,140
Ryo.

171
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,460
Yeah! When did you come?

172
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,280
Ryo, will you take me to Asakusa?

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,320
No, I can't help you lie.

174
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,000
Huh?

175
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,620
Huh?

176
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,140
Huh? I thought I returned everything yesterday.

177
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,800
Ryo, you left one thing behind.

178
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,400
Huh? Why?

179
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,320
If you tell me the truth, will you take me to Asakusa?

180
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,420
Susamu! Tell me the truth!

181
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,100
Where did I come from?

182
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,300
Huh? Huh?

183
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
What the hell are you talking about?

184
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,500
Huh?

185
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:40,600
Huh?

186
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,340
What is that?

187
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,700
It's like you appeared from under the grave I killed?

188
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,680
That look is too much to be realistic.

189
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:49,940
Huh?

190
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,100
Huh?

191
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,040
Oh, you're right.

192
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,900
I have one, two, three, four, five of those.

193
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,520
Ah, ugh!

194
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,740
Don't run away, Ryo.

195
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,080
Roger.

196
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
I'll wake him up right away.

197
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,920
Okay.

198
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,720
I woke him up.

199
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,940
Why won't it disappear?

200
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,580
I'm sorry for killing the grave. Please go back and rest in peace.

201
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,700
What are you going to do to me anymore?

202
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,620
I really want to go to Asakusa. Ryo-san, please take me there.

203
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,640
I want to go to Asakusa.

204
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,020
I can see the bear below my eyes.

205
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,220
I can see it.

206
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,220
I can not see it.

207
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,720
I can see it.

208
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,980
In other words, all I can see is you.

209
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,700
Ryo-san!

210
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,140
She seems to be in a bad mood, so I want to follow her.

211
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,080
We're here, Hana. This is Asakusa.

212
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,420
This is... Asakusa?

213
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,580
And this is the Asakusa Rock.

214
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,260
There's a lot of cinemas and theater here, so it used to be a bit more lively.

215
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,140
This is...?

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,580
I have a place I want to go, too.

217
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,640
Give me your amulets and your cards.

218
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,480
I have a lot of things, but...

219
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,580
I'll give you all of them!

220
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,580
No good?

221
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,080
Thanks to you, I'm so cool and I'm saved.

222
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,040
Oh, by the way, you said you were meeting someone earlier.

223
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,920
I promised to climb to the 12th floor with you.

224
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,580
12th floor? Which building is the 12th floor?

225
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,440
Asakusa's...

226
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,140
Even if you just look at it, there are more than 50,000 buildings in the 12th floor.

227
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,100
Are you going to make me climb from the edge?

228
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,200
Hmm...

229
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,840
Seriously?

230
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,940
I'm home!

231
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,260
Ryo!

232
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,880
What's wrong with your face?

233
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,740
What a mean face.

234
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,500
What happened?

235
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,960
Ryo said he was feeling strange.

236
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,000
Reiko was very worried about him.

237
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,680
Oh, I see.

238
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,000
I see, so let me rest a little.

239
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,480
I'm tired, too.

240
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,480
Ryo!

241
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,220
Who are you talking to, Ryo?

242
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,080
Can you see something?

243
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,260
Huh?

244
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
Oh, it's the night of the flowers.

245
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,720
Night of the flowers?

246
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,220
When I caught Akisu last night, I defeated the destruction stone of the temple.

247
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,640
It seems that it followed me at that time.

248
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,440
What?

249
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,100
You're joking, right?

250
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,580
That's a ghost?

251
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,260
Now, in front of you guys...

252
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,140
What?

253
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,500
Is it terrible to avoid it?

254
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,020
It can't be helped.

255
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,140
I can only see the flowers.

256
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,580
If you say you have something you can't see, everyone will be scared.

257
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,700
It seems that the girl's heart is hurt.

258
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,520
Is Hanayo a maiden?

259
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,320
She is 17 years old.

260
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,440
I see.

261
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,520
Oh, I'm sorry to run away.

262
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,340
I didn't mean to hurt you.

263
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,620
Just...

264
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,760
I'm not used to such a guest.

265
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,420
Hm?

266
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,100
Well, I understand.

267
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,640
Haa...

268
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,020
Ryo, are you okay?

269
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,280
Your face is pale.

270
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:55,820
Yeah.

271
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,120
As long as you don't let Hanayo's heart be hurt,

272
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,540
please stay away from me.

273
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,860
I see.

274
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,020
When I couldn't, Ryo was my soul mate.

275
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,500
I can't believe you feel the same.

276
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,620
Senpai, what was Hanayo's camellia?

277
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,140
When I realized you really want to climb to floor 12 at the ASAKUSA building,

278
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,640
I climbed to floor 12 as far as I could,

279
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,360
but it was the different fill...

280
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,360
Floor 12...

281
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,500
I promised to my boyfriend and his best friend,

282
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,420
and he was unable to do it.

283
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,080
That's the only thing that remains in his mind.

284
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,320
Hm?

285
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,500
Shoukichi?

286
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,640
Ryo-san, that old man who likes high places is also Shoukichi-san.

287
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,080
That Shoukichi-san also wants to climb to a high place like Hanayo-chan.

288
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,140
Oi oi, he's Hanayo's boyfriend.

289
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,960
There's probably too much age gap.

290
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,140
But he's too good for a coincidence.

291
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,220
Yes.

292
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,760
Hanayo, how old is Shoukichi?

293
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,600
Shoukichi's age is...

294
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,140
...two years older?

295
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,040
That means he's at least 19 or 20 years old.

296
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,720
Unfortunately, no matter how you think about it, it's not...

297
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,300
This is it!

298
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,100
Hm?

299
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,540
The 12th floor that Hanayo-san was talking about must be this!

300
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,520
Ryo-unkaku?

301
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,560
It's commonly known as Asakusa 12th floor.

302
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,360
At the beginning of the 23rd year, Ryo-unkaku, a brick-making tower 12th floor in Asakusa, opened.

303
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,740
The view from the observatory was amazing.

304
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,040
It's special and it's a place where you can see Fuji and Tsukuba in the clouds.

305
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,740
On sunny days, you can even see Hakone and Nikko on a telescope.

306
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,320
It's said that when it opened, the visitors who paid entrance fees and tried to climb there were very excited.

307
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,440
The Great Kanto Earthquake of September 1st, 12th year of Taisho, collapsed from the 8th floor.

308
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,460
It was destroyed on the same month, and the 12th floor disappeared from Asakusa.

309
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,020
That's right.

310
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,780
When I was born, there was no shadow or shape.

311
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,080
If we go back to Hanayo-san's age, it's around the time of Taisho's death.

312
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,120
Maybe Hanayo-san died during the earthquake.

313
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,180
Hanayo, give up on the 12th floor.

314
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,000
You can't climb on something that doesn't exist.

315
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,640
What is it? What's wrong?

316
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,440
What's wrong?

317
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:32,460
Head.

318
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,100
What are you doing, Hanayo?

319
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,380
Do you want to kill me?

320
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,080
I understand.

321
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,020
Genki, where is Shokichi-san?

322
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,120
That's right.

323
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,600
Shokichi-san is nowhere to be found.

324
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,580
What?

325
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,760
Please look for Shokichi-jisan.

326
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,280
Understood.

327
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,520
I'll ask Mr. Honda for help.

328
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,180
I'm going to look for a place that's high.

329
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:10,720
I've been careful this morning, so I don't think I can climb to a high place for a while.

330
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,580
Why is that?

331
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,100
I'm always the one who is kind to the elderly.

332
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,960
Because Ryo-san is going out.

333
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,020
Don't be so arrogant, Terai.

334
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,460
If you don't say it, that old man will repeat it over and over again.

335
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,540
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,800
I don't have the time.

337
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,800
If it's difficult to look for him, I have no choice but to lure him out.

338
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,600
What do you mean by lure him out?

339
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,000
Nagagawa.

340
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,600
Yes.

341
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,460
Use your power to build another Ryoukaku in Asakusa.

342
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,720
What?

343
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,480
What's going on?

344
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,800
It's no good. I can't find him anywhere.

345
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:01,920
I can't either.

346
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,980
But what does it mean that if you don't find Grandpa, Ryo-tsu's life will be in danger?

347
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,300
I don't know.

348
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,420
We're here, Ryo-san.

349
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,020
Yeah.

350
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:17,900
Boss!

351
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,520
What did you say?

352
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,640
Are you really Ryo-tsu?

353
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,260
We're now at Azumabachi Sanchomeijoku.

354
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,580
We're about to cross the Sumida River.

355
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,240
What is that?

356
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,440
Amazing! It's just like the real thing.

357
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,480
It's a model of a real object that was made by the Nakagawa Group's movie set company.

358
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,900
From now on, we're not going anywhere.

359
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,600
We're counting on your help!

360
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,100
Don't be ridiculous, you bastard!

361
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,120
If you don't want to be crushed, you should just wait.

362
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,240
What?

363
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,940
We have to block the road for 20 minutes.

364
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,460
20 minutes?

365
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:13,560
20 minutes?

366
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,900
20 minutes?

367
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,620
20 minutes?

368
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,040
20 minutes, 20 minutes?

369
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,340
This is what you wanted to see, showing from the 12th floor.

370
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:40,340
The scene must be very different now that it's been 80 years, but I can do this!

371
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,200
Where are you, Grandpa?

372
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,740
I'll be waiting for you, Hanayo.

373
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,100
Huh?

374
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,480
This is nostalgic!

375
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:03,860
Grandpa!

376
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,860
Huh? Who are you?

377
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,840
Don't worry about me. You know Hanayo, right?

378
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,640
Yeah, I think I know her.

379
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,840
Hanayo is here. Can't you see her?

380
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,180
What? Hanayo?

381
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,620
She's the Shokichi you wanted to see, Hanayo!

382
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,660
Why didn't you show yourself to me?

383
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,580
You don't know what it's like to be an old man, do you?

384
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:42,420
Mr. Shokichi.

385
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,180
Hanayo, where have you been all this time?

386
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,460
I'm glad you found me, Mr. Shokichi.

387
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,500
I've been waiting for you, Hanayo, since you left me.

388
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,780
I thought about what you did when you left me and died 12 times.

389
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,500
What did you do?

390
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,660
The 50 towers of Kannon-do were burned to ashes.

391
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,300
I thought maybe if I climbed them, I'd see you, Hanayo.

392
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,500
You climbed them?

393
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,820
Yeah. The shrine's torii, the cedar tree, the bathhouse chimney...

394
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,320
I climbed a lot of things.

395
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,020
I was waiting for you down there.

396
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,580
I was waiting for you down there, Mr. Shokichi.

397
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,060
I'm sorry, Hanayo.

398
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,040
No, it's fine.

399
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,360
We were able to go up to the 12th floor together, so there's nothing left for me to think about.

400
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,220
I'm going with you.

401
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,660
Huh?

402
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,420
I'll be waiting for you.

403
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,620
What?

404
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,560
I'll be waiting for you.

405
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,720
I'll be waiting for you.

406
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,520
I'll be waiting for you.

407
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,980
Oh, my.

408
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,420
I wonder what happened after all those people gathered here...

409
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,040
The spirits have been restored.

410
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,520
The spirits have been restored.

411
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,160
The spirits have been restored.

412
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,940
*Coffee*

413
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:16,640
Good.

414
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,620
Where did you meet Hanayo?

415
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,060
Hanayo was a assistant of Rock's Cafe.

416
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,240
It's rare for him to have never climbed the 12th floor of Asakusa.

417
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,620
Good. I'll take you there next time.

418
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,520
Hmph.

419
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,260
Hanayo was the cutest in Rock.

420
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:40,280
He was so cute.

421
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,800
Nanpaka, you're good, old man.

422
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,320
It took me a year to get rid of Hanayo.

423
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,280
Hmph.

424
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,240
I've kept you waiting for a long time for your first love.

425
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,580
Yono, Yono.

426
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,920
Yona, Yono, Yono.

427
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,140
Yono, Yono, Yono.

428
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,620
I will never forget.

429
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,180
I will always remain with you.

430
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,320
Please come back, Hanayo.

431
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,740
Thank you very much, Hanayo.

432
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,220
Well, time to go home, everyone.

433
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,180
Yono, Yono, Yono, Yono.

434
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,240
Have a good night.

435
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,480
I walked only the black part

436
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:53,220
Everyone was a child once, but everyone has forgotten

437
00:24:53,220 --> 00:25:00,680
A politician with a big face and a blue aunt above their eyes

438
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:06,040
Turn around and see that corner

439
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,640
I can see everyone

440
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,560
Let's go!

441
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,880
There is a wall

442
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,520
There must be a wall

443
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,320
Come to our town

444
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,420
Thank you!

445
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,460
Huge! Too big!

446
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,960
The huge athletic competition with a prize of one hundred million yen

447
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,600
It's huge!

448
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,720
It was an athletic competition in the world

449
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,940
But to pay back the money

450
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,300
I will win no matter what

451
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,540
Next time, a huge athletic competition with a prize of one hundred million yen

452
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,300
Thank you!

453
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,320
There is a wall

454
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,840
There must be a wall

455
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,720
Come to our town

456
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,780
Thank you!
