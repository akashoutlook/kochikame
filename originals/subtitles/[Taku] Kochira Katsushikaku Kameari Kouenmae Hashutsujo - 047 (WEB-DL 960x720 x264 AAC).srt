1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
下來

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,820
In the middle of the river,

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,520
I saw the sunrise

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,680
I dropped my love stone

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,080
Then I jumped to my shoe

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:32,280
I wonder if I'm going to be a tycoon who was a jokin

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:39,080
I was laughed at as it was

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,500
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,980
There is a Katsushika Kameari

10
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,380
There is no change in my yawn

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,520
The cityscape is so kind

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,380
From the fountain of the Tongari Boshi

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,960
To the Taishakuten

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,080
The sunset falls

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:15,420
I'll wake up tomorrow and finish it

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,040
Hey, Katsushika Shibamata

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,140
I've lost my happiness again

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,220
I've noticed it

19
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,360
Because I'm an idiot

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,980
What should I do?

21
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:48,980
What should I do?

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,280
Ryo-san

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,440
I'll give it to you

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,800
If I don't get it now, I won't get it again

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,260
Please put it on

26
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,940
No.

27
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,720
It's been accumulated for the last year

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,620
Only cash

29
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,780
If you are annoying, go home

30
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,100
There are people who want to get it

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,420
I looked at people's feet

32
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,680
If it becomes like this

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,880
Take the thief

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,000
Thief!

35
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,140
There you go!

36
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,820
Haha! I did it!

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:28,200
I should have just used half of it.

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,860
I spent all my money.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,060
I don't know how I'm going to get my payday.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,380
For now, I'm going to pass this time.

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,620
Hmm?

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,260
Iyan旅行, huh?

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,140
Alright!

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,940
What?

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,060
Senpai is going to do the kanji for the next Iyan旅行?

46
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,600
Are you serious, Ryo?

47
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,300
Yeah, I'm serious.

48
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,280
I've decided to take the volunteer spirit and do it for everyone.

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,700
As expected of you, Ryo-sama. You're great.

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,260
But...

51
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,980
You were so arrogant last year that you said you had a high budget.

52
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,240
That's right.

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,260
You said you could only drink half of the kanji.

54
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,500
Senpai, you're thinking of something that doesn't make sense.

55
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,460
I'm not.

56
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,380
No!

57
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,320
Remember last year's Iyan旅行!

58
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,840
The time when the chief did the kanji!

59
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,400
So you're going to the amusement park on a Sunday day?

60
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,920
After all, you got on the bus in the middle of the night.

61
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,220
There's no other option but the bus.

62
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,160
I suppose.

63
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,320
The time when you can't go to the amusement park and the bus stops and starts to run.

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,200
Yes, I got it.

65
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,640
Well, you seem to have forgotten the signs.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,500
Well, we'll go for a walk.

67
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:47,860
We won't.

68
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,460
As I expected.

69
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,660
Why aren't you here?

70
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,120
Well, it's kind of sad.

71
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,660
Pack everything you need.

72
00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:03,140
But why is Oto gonna be the only one who gets to go?

73
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,240
Remember.

74
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,480
I'm sure.

75
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,540
I'm sure he knew the kanji for "Mee Kanji"

76
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,020
just by shouting out loud.

77
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,240
Normally, he wouldn't know that.

78
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:11,800
Eh?

79
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,680
You're too sweet!

80
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,420
You're too sweet, Nakagawa!

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,880
You can say "Mee Kanji"

82
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,040
only if you think of all the situations.

83
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,440
Oh, I see.

84
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,120
The mistake is that you usually leave the kanji

85
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,780
to the leader.

86
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,260
Eating at an amusement park, karaoke?

87
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,500
The typical course is also a good place.

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,280
I can't feel any sense.

89
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,560
I don't think I can say kanji

90
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,680
to that stupid, honest stone head.

91
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,860
I can't even say kanji to him.

92
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,760
Well, I...

93
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,160
I...

94
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,360
Chief!

95
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,120
Now I know what you're trying to say.

96
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,360
You're saying you're the best

97
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,720
at this trip, right?

98
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,720
No, I'm not!

99
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm saying that I can speak kanji!

100
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,160
You think you can do it?

101
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,480
I can!

102
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,580
I'll show you how to enjoy

103
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,260
a trip that's 100 times more enjoyable

104
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:00,940
than the chief's trip with a budget of 5,000 yen per person!

105
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,520
You can do it!

106
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,180
You can do it!

107
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,920
You can do it!

108
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,120
You can do it!

109
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,880
You can do it!

110
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,480
You can do it!

111
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,060
You can do it!

112
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,940
Ryo, you can do it!

113
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,840
You can do it!

114
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,980
Ryo, you can do it!

115
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,600
If you can do it, try it!

116
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,180
If this is a trip that's a little boring,

117
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,220
you're going to pay for it!

118
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,980
Okay.

119
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,220
But, if you're good at it,

120
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,140
please keep my instruction manual for a while.

121
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,420
Oh.

122
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:32,820
Oh, oh.

123
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,440
Oh, that's fine.

124
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,580
This is the price of everyone's fame.

125
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,440
I got it.

126
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,020
Cruising with a cruiser?

127
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,680
Is that budget okay?

128
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,620
Leave it to me.

129
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,340
I have a good reputation in various places.

130
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,240
Well, that's just a sample.

131
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,520
Then I'll go get it right away.

132
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,980
If you give me 1,000 yen, it's 4,000 yen each.

133
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,460
That's my profit.

134
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,120
You're smart, Ryo.

135
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,980
You're eating while listening to a live band on a cruiser.

136
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,360
This year's trip is really cool.

137
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,920
It's true.

138
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,200
It's like a little beret.

139
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,460
I wanted to ride a cruiser once.

140
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,900
I don't want to get seasick.

141
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,080
It's okay.

142
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,280
I can't shake a cruiser.

143
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,380
Good morning.

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,300
Good morning.

145
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,000
Good morning, chief.

146
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,800
Good morning.

147
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,460
Good morning, Ohara.

148
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,820
Chief, thank you for your busy schedule.

149
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,600
Good morning.

150
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
No, no.

151
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,780
This trip is quite luxurious.

152
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,420
Isn't it a good plan for a 10,000-year-old Ryotsu?

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,060
Well, yeah.

154
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,180
But I'm sure you're really okay, Ohara.

155
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm fine.

156
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,580
Maybe.

157
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,380
But you're late, Ryotsu.

158
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,640
I can already see that.

159
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,520
I thought they said they're meeting at 10:00.

160
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,300
Yeah.

161
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,580
But I'm curious.

162
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,300
Can a cruiser make a live band with only a 5,000-yen budget?

163
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:10,700
Yeah.

164
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,420
Hi, guys.

165
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,880
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

166
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,840
Oh, you're finally here.

167
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,480
Wow!

168
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,600
Look, that's the ship!

169
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,340
Wow, that's great.

170
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,160
Awesome, senpai.

171
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,600
What a wonderful cruiser!

172
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,040
It's more than I imagined!

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,320
Wow!

174
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,700
Wow!

175
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,760
Wow!

176
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,180
Wow!

177
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,700
It went too far.

178
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,780
Hey! This way!

179
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,380
Everyone!

180
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,880
This is it!

181
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,440
This is it!

182
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,500
This is it!

183
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,420
This is it!

184
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,140
This is it!

185
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,140
What is that?

186
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,360
You can tell by looking at it.

187
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,500
It's a yacht.

188
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,280
Isn't that a cruiser?

189
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,260
That's right! That's right!

190
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,700
You're talking about the wrong thing!

191
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,920
This is a great Japanese cruiser.

192
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,340
Now, don't complain.

193
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,240
Get on!

194
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,860
How is it?

195
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,960
The Japanese is in full swing, right?

196
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,540
The roof is full of holes.

197
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,520
That's right!

198
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,280
That's why you can swim in the sun

199
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,240
and have a natural encounter.

200
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,580
The tatami mats are also very painful.

201
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,080
Hey, chief!

202
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,520
Don't put too much weight on it.

203
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,400
It's rotten.

204
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,480
What?

205
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,720
Well, well, don't look so scared.

206
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:40,920
Let's enjoy the trip.

207
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,180
Ryozu, this is 5,000 yen.

208
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,940
Chief, instead, the food is...

209
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,220
That's right, Ohara.

210
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,540
Even if the ship is shabby,

211
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,700
the food should be delicious.

212
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,220
Fresh fish can be eaten, right?

213
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,060
That's right!

214
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,860
Fresh fish are the best.

215
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,580
That's right.

216
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Well, then, please enjoy the fishing.

217
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,260
What are you doing?

218
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,460
What is this?

219
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,880
I told you.

220
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
We're going to have a grand fishing.

221
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
Oh, that's right.

222
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,780
The chief, Nakagawa, Honda,

223
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,960
Reiko and the girls

224
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,200
are going to the sea.

225
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Hey, Ryo.

226
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,060
We don't go fishing.

227
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,740
That's right!

228
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,940
Oh, I see.

229
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,360
I'm sorry.

230
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,000
What?

231
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,080
The fish we caught today

232
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,920
will be the main dish of the day.

233
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,360
Then you're not going to go.

234
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,160
What?

235
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,380
We don't go fishing.

236
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,780
We'll go fishing ourselves.

237
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,660
This is the new way of the Ian trip.

238
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,640
If we don't go fishing,

239
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,340
everyone will be eating fresh sashimi.

240
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,120
So we're going to try it.

241
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,600
It's okay.

242
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,360
We'll help you.

243
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,720
I'll help you.

244
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,260
Oh, thank you.

245
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,340
That's wonderful.

246
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,560
It's different from you.

247
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,440
What do you mean?

248
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,500
It feels good

249
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:04,680
just to be in the sea.

250
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
It's good to be in the sea.

251
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,740
Oh, it smells.

252
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,820
This is the chief's fish.

253
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,940
It smells.

254
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,220
Look, I did it.

255
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,600
As expected of the chief.

256
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,220
Ryo, I came here too.

257
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,240
Oh, me too.

258
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,120
Oh, it's a professional.

259
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,620
Don't do it, Mario.

260
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,900
I'll do it, too.

261
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,120
Okay.

262
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,780
Everyone, please enjoy.

263
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,000
Honda,

264
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,740
you're always fishing for sea bream.

265
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm fishing for this.

266
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,280
Well, it's okay.

267
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,500
Sea bream tempura is delicious.

268
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,900
What's wrong, chief?

269
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,520
You're not fishing at all.

270
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,420
Shut up.

271
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,620
It's just the beginning.

272
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,740
I'm fishing for sea bream and mini puffer fish.

273
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,700
When I become the chief,

274
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,860
I have to catch tuna or whale.

275
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,060
It hurts.

276
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
Don't say tuna or whale.

277
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,940
Anyway, Ryo,

278
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,280
you don't have to fish for yourself?

279
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,060
I'm a kanji.

280
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,160
I'll eat while everyone's fishing.

281
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,000
If I become a kanji,

282
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,260
I'll have a lot of trouble.

283
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,420
Ryo,

284
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,140
I'll do my best

285
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,560
to fish for you.

286
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,680
Yeah.

287
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,260
More importantly,

288
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,940
I don't have to do it for the chief if I don't have any fish.

289
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,260
You have to pay 5,000 yen

290
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,900
and fish for yourself.

291
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,980
Oh, here it comes again.

292
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,980
Ohara is really fun.

293
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,040
Here it comes.

294
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,800
This is a big one.

295
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,360
Ohara, you can do it.

296
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,360
You got this!

297
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,640
You can do it!

298
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,260
You can do it!

299
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:05,940
You do it!

300
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,040
You did it!

301
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,180
Help me.

302
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,820
You're awesome, chief.

303
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,740
You're doing well.

304
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,360
I'm not gonna let you get away!

305
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,120
Yes sir!

306
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,800
Bujo!

307
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,980
Ye-... Get away!

308
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,000
I-I-!

309
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,740
So, it's like the fire engine of a ship...

310
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,320
What are you doing, Bujo?

311
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,340
You should be fishing instead of the fire engine!

312
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,080
But Senpai,

313
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,900
doesn't that fire engine

314
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,200
belong to this boat?

315
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,180
Don't you dare touch it!

316
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,400
Please continue fishing!

317
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,700
I can't believe I'm fishing in this boat.

318
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,840
I should hide this one somewhere.

319
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,280
Oh no!

320
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,040
I can't laugh.

321
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,520
It was pretty fun.

322
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,320
Fishing is easy.

323
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,160
Everyone, good job.

324
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,040
Everyone sit down.

325
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,440
Sit down, sit down.

326
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,980
The chief is here.

327
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,700
Hey, I'm the chief.

328
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,580
I'm not going to sit down.

329
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,200
Don't say that.

330
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,700
Today is break day.

331
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,200
And the chief is a guest.

332
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,600
The chief is in charge of this trip.

333
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,120
But...

334
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,200
Ohara, you don't have to say no to me.

335
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,700
But something is wrong with the boat.

336
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,480
What?

337
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,140
Don't worry.

338
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:40,820
Don't worry.

339
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,540
Listen to me, chief.

340
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,600
No matter what happens,

341
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,740
you must not move.

342
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,780
Everyone, give the chief a round of applause!

343
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,840
It's delicious.

344
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,520
You can eat the tempura with your teeth.

345
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,320
You can eat the tempura with your teeth.

346
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,120
Hey, I really want to eat.

347
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,660
If you want, I can...

348
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,700
Everyone, give the chief a round of applause.

349
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,780
Hey, I can eat the tempura with my teeth.

350
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,400
Please, give him a round of applause.

351
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,780
I think there is a lot of alcohol.

352
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,320
Now, welcome to the Karaoke competition

353
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,440
by a fancy live band playing.

354
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,820
Karaoke competition by a fancy live band playing.

355
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,540
Karaoke competition by a fancy live band playing.

356
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,060
What is this?

357
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,840
Isn't it a war ship?

358
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,540
That's right.

359
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,360
Back then,

360
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,380
they used to do a comedy show on Asakusa Rock.

361
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,460
I know, but what's the boat like?

362
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,100
Don't worry.

363
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,560
It is a self-propelled ship.

364
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,680
Self-propelled?

365
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,640
Is this the latest equipment for this ship?

366
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,320
I'm a bit worried.

367
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,800
I'll go check it out.

368
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,660
Chief, you can't move.

369
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Get out of the way.

370
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,640
What's this?

371
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,500
Chief, you can't move.

372
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,300
I told you not to move.

373
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,800
Ryo!

374
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,400
Senpai!

375
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,260
Ryo again!

376
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,580
Senpai, you'll sink if you keep going.

377
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,740
What?

378
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,880
Ryo!

379
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,560
Get the key out of the package!

380
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,660
What do you mean?

381
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,740
Take this!

382
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,340
I can't do this.

383
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,660
Stop it.

384
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,780
If you keep going,

385
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,420
Ryo will hit you.

386
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,380
Make them happy!

387
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,820
Thank you very much.

388
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:07,140
You have my respect.

389
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,980
I am sorry.

390
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,400
The ship has come home.

391
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,760
The ship was such a soon dessert.

392
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,300
Its why we need a closest one for them.

393
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,140
This ship has a strong shaking.

394
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,060
Ame brought this for us.

395
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,900
I don't think this will change the fact that I'm outside.

396
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,240
What's going on, Ryozu?

397
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,260
Yes, yes. I've prepared a proper umbrella for this time.

398
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,260
Oh, don't get too excited.

399
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,280
However, it's a rental, so one person will get 200 yen.

400
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,100
What did you say?

401
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,360
I don't need that!

402
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,220
It's starting to rain.

403
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,120
I don't like this.

404
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,280
Seriously? I don't like this.

405
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,120
Senpai, you should go back to the ship.

406
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,960
Don't say unnecessary things.

407
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,720
It's natural for the ship to shake.

408
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,120
What's wrong?

409
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,260
I... I'm lost. I feel bad.

410
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,020
That's because you don't have enough to drink.

411
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,480
If you drink alcohol, you won't feel lost.

412
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,460
This is ridiculous.

413
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,460
Yes, it's karaoke.

414
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,300
The Karaoke Tournament of Forgetting Storms.

415
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,860
First, the first person to leave the boat is me.

416
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,440
I'm Yujirou Irihara.

417
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm Yujirou Irihara.

418
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,920
I'm Yuyabooishinbo.

419
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,220
That sounds amazing.

420
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,100
This is really bad, Ryo.

421
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,880
Huh? I'm coming too!

422
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,980
I've found a

423
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,160
Help me.

424
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,280
That's right.

425
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,700
Baloo, you're being a big hit.

426
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,860
You're such a big hit.

427
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,500
You idiot.

428
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,500
If Sendou gets drunk, who will be the winner?

429
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,820
It's okay.

430
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,580
Leave it to me.

431
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,000
This is when you get to use your hobbies.

432
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,500
Come on.

433
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,060
You idiot!

434
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,040
Ryo, you did something again.

435
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,360
I don't want to imagine it.

436
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,700
The boat is going up the river.

437
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,540
Sintell the boat.

438
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,640
The river shrank.

439
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,760
Oh, no!

440
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,420
It's gone from Sumida River to Kanda River.

441
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,980
What?

442
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,180
We're being pushed out like a Swan.

443
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,440
This boat is more serious than a regular boat.

444
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,580
Right?

445
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,560
The roof has been peeled off!

446
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,740
Sorry to you, but it's dangerous.

447
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,420
Let's call for help from Nakagawa Taibatsu.

448
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,240
Hello? It's me.

449
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,080
I can't do this anymore.

450
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,500
What's going to happen now? What will be our fate?

451
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,340
I don't want to!

452
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,820
It's not that you don't want to!

453
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,160
It's because you don't know what's going to happen!

454
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,460
This is the joy of traveling.

455
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,640
It's truly a new Iyan Trip!

456
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,140
If we keep going like this, we'll be in for a storm!

457
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,660
Get some water!

458
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,600
Get your balance!

459
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,520
Reiko, stay in the middle!

460
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,300
Nakagawa and the chief, to the left!

461
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,960
The others, split into two groups!

462
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,080
Get some water!

463
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,600
Hurry up! Hurry up!

464
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,340
It's strange that we don't have to do anything.

465
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,380
If we can get home alive, we'll remember this, Ryo.

466
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,920
I'm getting dizzy!

467
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,440
Watch out!

468
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,780
It can't be!

469
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,240
Do something, Ryo!

470
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,460
Mister, the signal's pretty good!

471
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,180
Do something, Ryo!

472
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:50,820
I understand!

473
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,400
That was aane.

474
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,780
How'd get this one done so fast?

475
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,840
That's impossible!

476
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,180
Take a look!

477
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,940
The shaft of the screw is broken.

478
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,680
The train is moving faster than before.

479
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,240
It seems to be sucked in.

480
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,880
What?

481
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,860
It's the entrance of the subway.

482
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:28,120
It's on the train!

483
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,760
Min-chan! Ryo-chan!

484
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,320
The train is coming!

485
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,100
Stop it!

486
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:53,380
I'm saved!

487
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,500
It's not that bad!

488
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,300
Good job!

489
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,860
What are you doing?

490
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,820
Don't be scared!

491
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,940
Enjoy it!

492
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,100
This is not fun!

493
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,940
It's not!

494
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,720
It's not fun!

495
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,460
You did it!

496
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,780
That's it!

497
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,620
It hurts!

498
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,420
It hurts!

499
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,220
It hurts!

500
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,260
Stop it!

501
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,760
They fight a lot in this situation.

502
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,160
They fight a lot in this situation.

503
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,740
They fight a lot in this situation.

504
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:34,800
It hurts!

505
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:35,780
It hurts!

506
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,920
There they are!

507
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,000
They went to the tea fountain!

508
00:22:42,720 --> 00:23:02,360
They went to the tea fountain!

509
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,480
To be continued.

510
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,680
Wh-what do you think, chief?

511
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,500
You didn't feel bored for a second, did you?

512
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,860
I-I'm an idiot.

513
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,160
Hey, Ryo. You're the only one with money.

514
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,420
One of you isn't worth a dime.

515
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,060
R-Ryo!

516
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,400
Senpai.

517
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,120
Ryo!

518
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,180
Y-you know what...

519
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,220
What's the matter?

520
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,080
Well, it's...

521
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,280
Well...

522
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,600
Ryosu!

523
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,440
I thought you were acting weird, but you were really just fooling around!

524
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
Wait a minute!

525
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,580
My money!

526
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Hey, Ryosu!

527
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,560
My money! My money!

528
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,920
You idiot!

529
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,860
I'll give you three minutes to cool your head!

530
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,680
Please stop, chief! My money!

531
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,800
To be continued

532
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,540
Hey, Eigo!

533
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,860
You finally got married after looking at the wedding photos and sighing?

534
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:10,900
What?

535
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,880
Do you want me to destroy this wedding?

536
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,700
If you go with your usual style, I'll refuse!

537
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,880
There's no doubt about it!

538
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,620
Next time, I'll show you the strategy to reverse the ball!

539
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,000
See you then!

540
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,820
There's a rumor that a woman who can't fall in love

541
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:40,000
has a lot of things she wants to do

542
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,420
I want to ride a bike through the vast desert

543
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,120
I want to be freer than a bird

544
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,840
A lady's dream that changes with the speed of a full moon

545
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,520
My love, I'm sorry, wait

546
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:21,660
The future of the panorama is a dazzling light

547
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,700
You know that, right?

548
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,500
I'm sorry, wait

549
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,020
It's the way I want to be

550
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,140
I still don't know what happened

551
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:38,860
To be continued

552
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,240
To be continued

553
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,000
It's not that I can't say anything
