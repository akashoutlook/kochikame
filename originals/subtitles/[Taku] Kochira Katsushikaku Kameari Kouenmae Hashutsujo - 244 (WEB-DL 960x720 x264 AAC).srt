1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,680
Fast and Furious

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,180
That eel looked delicious.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,800
How can I tell.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,920
The restaurant it's small, but cheap and really delicious.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,440
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,440
Even so, Seppai knows a lot of Ueno restaurants, doesn't he?

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,640
Since I was a kid, I used to come to Ueno often.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,600
Huh?

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,040
There's still some rice bowl left.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,100
Huh? What is it?

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,660
When I was a little kid,

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,980
It was a place that makes Bentendo round.

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,140
What?

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,120
We did a bicycle race in Shinobazu.

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,400
However, it crashed and we all jumped into the Shinobazu pond.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,260
It was hard to get out of the bike and the body of the horse.

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,020
In addition, it was cold in December.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,860
We set a fire on the side of Bentendo and dried it.

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,360
Then there was a coal mine nearby.

20
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,380
Did you set a fire?

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,700
That's right.

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,940
The fire suddenly burned up and burned down to Bentendo.

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,740
I was desperate to save the pond water with my shoes and extinguished it.

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,080
If you made a mistake, Bentendo was gone.

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,980
That's right.

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,520
Your old stories are dynamic and talkative.

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,760
That's right.

28
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,880
I came close.

29
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,480
Let's go to my house.

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,700
When you watch TV,

31
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,880
please make the room bright and look away.

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,300
Come to me, the poor guy.

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,180
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,900
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

35
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,120
See you one day.

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,480
I will be able to do it somehow.

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:14,560
I'm a poor guy.

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,640
Don't worry about me.

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,800
Come to me, the poor guy.

40
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,520
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,880
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

42
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Akane, who is burning with a fire

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,140
I wonder what will happen to her

44
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,660
You know that, right?

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,160
You know that, right?

46
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,740
If you know that, then shut up and follow me!

47
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,920
Akane's clamoring

48
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,680
Steve!

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,920
Mr. Kan!

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,380
You come back, again!

51
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,640
Shut up!

52
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,600
Why did you visit me all of a sudden?

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,980
Hello! Long time no see!

54
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,660
Oh, it's Nakagawa-san.

55
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,940
Ah!

56
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,340
Ah, stop it!

57
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,880
Hey, let go, Kankichi!

58
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,740
You!

59
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,460
Oh, Kankichi.

60
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,400
Oh, it's Nakagawa-san.

61
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:33,860
Hello.

62
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,200
Hello.

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,800
I heard the car stop, so I went out and it was them.

64
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,860
Don't lie to me!

65
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,260
Why did you bring the sales of the store when you were going out?

66
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,820
Was that so?

67
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,060
I can't forget things soon.

68
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,980
I can't go to the store again.

69
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,600
You were going to lose to Pachinko again, weren't you?

70
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,320
Now, give it back!

71
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,980
Hey, you're not like that.

72
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,240
You said it well, Kankichi.

73
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,800
That's why you're a stupid son.

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,500
Yeah, I want to cry.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,440
Idiot!

76
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,680
Idiot?

77
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,160
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

78
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,500
Kankichi, Nakagawa-san,

79
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,760
can you drink some tea?

80
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,740
No, I can't drink anything.

81
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,020
I don't have to worry about it.

82
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,720
Let's go in.

83
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,620
Oh, my God.

84
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,420
The profit has become a pair.

85
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,980
I often say that.

86
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,420
What's this prediction?

87
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,020
If you make such a big prediction,

88
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,320
you'll lose a lot of money.

89
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,260
A big prediction?

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,740
I'll kill you!

91
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,420
This idiot father is so annoying!

92
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,640
Hey, senpai!

93
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,380
I can't help it.

94
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,420
Nakagawa-san, hold this.

95
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,060
Yes.

96
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,840
I'll drink it.

97
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,520
Stop it!

98
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,940
That's it.

99
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,440
Just a little bit more.

100
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,300
That's not enough,

101
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,240
your parents are such a parent.

102
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,260
Yes.

103
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,180
You two're so old.

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
Don't talk like a child.

105
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,060
Nobody talks about it.

106
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,220
You know,

107
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,620
in such a house,

108
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,660
report an album

109
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,900
and..

110
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,940
It's all Kim's wife's.

111
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,820
Kim's wife.

112
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:21,000
I've been told that I want to see the pictures of you as a child, but I haven't found it for a long time.

113
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,800
You're a wound expert.

114
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,940
You say it well. I'm the one who got hurt.

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
Then, do you have a picture of your senior when you were a child?

116
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,240
Yeah.

117
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,120
This is when Kinjiro entered the national junior high school, I took it in a photo studio.

118
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,000
What?

119
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,200
Kinjiro is the main character, but he stands out.

120
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,980
He's been like this for a long time, Nakagawa.

121
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,460
You haven't changed at all.

122
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,140
You're saying something strange.

123
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,220
My father was drinking a lot at that time.

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,160
You have a big face.

125
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,140
That's right.

126
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,760
That's when I won the boy's baseball.

127
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,400
Did your father become a coach?

128
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,620
Well, at that time, I was a senior.

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,520
I won the game.

130
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,820
You say it well.

131
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,400
On the day of the final match, my team's coach collapsed due to high fever.

132
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,360
I had no choice but to do it in return for my father.

133
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,200
Is that so?

134
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,500
I'm sure he was drinking on the bench at that time, and the referee warned me.

135
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,700
This idiot father.

136
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,640
You don't have an idiot father for your parents.

137
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:31,820
What?

138
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you going to do it again?

139
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,820
This idiot father.

140
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,720
You two are telling me to stop.

141
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,920
You're a fool.

142
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,040
Hey, hey.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,300
Let's go home.

144
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,060
I envy you.

145
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,480
What?

146
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,000
What's wrong, Mr. Nakagawa?

147
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,980
I don't have a single picture I took with my father.

148
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,600
Not even one?

149
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,660
Yes.

150
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,420
I've only met my father about 10 times since he was born.

151
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,940
Nakagawa's father works 72 hours a day.

152
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,380
He's the busiest super businessman in the world.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,280
The male and female CEOs of the iron wagon team can vaguely see a bright future.

154
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,840
It's like a child's dream.

155
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,060
What?

156
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,660
What?

157
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,700
I haven't taken a day off for that.

158
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,220
Ask him.

159
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:35,680
Are you not tired?

160
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,100
You're yelping to me.

161
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,320
He said he wanted to give me something important.

162
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,640
That world's busiest father did it on purpose?

163
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,580
Yes.

164
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,360
Hmm, I wonder what that important thing is.

165
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,160
But now we can take a picture with my father.

166
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,160
Okay, I'll take it.

167
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,400
So where are you waiting for me?

168
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,920
That's a little far.

169
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,620
New York?

170
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,920
No, it's further away.

171
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,260
Then Brazil?

172
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,240
No, further.

173
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,680
Brazil is on the other side of Japan.

174
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,740
There are no other far countries.

175
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,240
It's not a country, it's a space.

176
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,120
What?

177
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,640
What did you say?

178
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,440
Hmm, a space?

179
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,180
Hey, only people from Tokyo know that place.

180
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,540
It's famous because there's a race track.

181
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,400
I don't know.

182
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,160
Where in space?

183
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,480
It's a space station.

184
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,160
What? A space station?

185
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,520
Is it a meeting place in front of the station?

186
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,880
So stop with the local stuff.

187
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,640
My father is building a space station to run space travel in 2003.

188
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,660
So he wants to meet at the bottom of the site.

189
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,360
In the past, it was manga and SF, but now it's reality.

190
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,760
That's right.

191
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,060
It's a space station for SF movies.

192
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,060
It's two years behind the 2001 space travel.

193
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,080
Oh, the joke of 2001 space travel in elementary school was a joke.

194
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,540
You're so quiet, Ryotsu.

195
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,120
So when are you going?

196
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,040
Tomorrow.

197
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,300
There's a launch base on the Naka-Gawa Space Development People's Island.

198
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,180
We're going to launch it with the friendship rocket there.

199
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,740
The Naka-Gawa Space Development People's Island

200
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,040
The Naka-Gawa Space Development People's Island

201
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,740
Since the airspace of the Naka-Gawa Space Development People's Island is the station,

202
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,320
we're going to dock the rocket and meet there.

203
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,720
Tomo!

204
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,920
Keiichi!

205
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,520
It's a meeting of big family.

206
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,340
It's going to cost us a lot of money.

207
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,480
I see...

208
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,840
Here's the phone.

209
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,360
What? The launch is cancelled?

210
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,680
What?

211
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,880
Yes, yes...

212
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,200
Wait a minute.

213
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,660
Reiko-san, excuse me, could you give me the world map?

214
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,320
Sure.

215
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,020
The north is...

216
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,300
The east is...

217
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,260
Here?

218
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,380
Oh, got it. Thank you very much.

219
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,880
What do you mean?

220
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,740
My dad said he had an emergency, so he's going to go to Earth with a capsule rocket.

221
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,620
So, the location written on that map is the landing point?

222
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,160
Yes, so we changed our plan to meet there.

223
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,260
That's a great change.

224
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,860
What is it?

225
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,820
I think it's a helicopter to pick you up.

226
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
Well then, Chief, please give me a ride from today.

227
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,540
Nakagawa, I'm going to take a two-shot with my dad.

228
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,360
Please.

229
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,600
Then I'll take it.

230
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,460
I'm also on a paid leave.

231
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,720
You're already used to it.

232
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,820
The rest of your pay will be deducted from your salary.

233
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,160
B-chan!

234
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,780
Senpai, hurry up!

235
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,760
Okay.

236
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,660
Kei-chan, I hope you can meet your dad safely.

237
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,220
Yeah.

238
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,900
It seems we made it in time.

239
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,660
Yeah.

240
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,140
The landing time is in 12 minutes and 18 seconds.

241
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,940
I didn't know it would rain from the sky.

242
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,420
I remembered.

243
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,820
When I was in elementary school, my dad and I once took a private jet.

244
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,780
We met a storm above Matterhorn.

245
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,940
Keiichi, don't make such a fuss.

246
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,260
Y-Yes, sir!

247
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,400
You can't trust your father, can you?

248
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,400
No, I don't.

249
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,720
You're a good boy, Keiichi.

250
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,820
You have something you want to give me in the 21st century.

251
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,720
What?

252
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,120
You'll get through the Thunder Lord!

253
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,540
Hold on tight!

254
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,260
Keiichi, hold on tight!

255
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,360
Hold on tight!

256
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,300
When we climbed the clouds, the storm didn't go away.

257
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,740
It was still peaceful.

258
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,720
Dad, what do you mean?

259
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,580
My father became silent and stopped talking again.

260
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,840
I suppose he must have said what his father wanted.

261
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,980
It doesn't matter.

262
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,920
It's fine, but Chichitoko is too dramatic.

263
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,240
Normally when Chichitoko talks like that,

264
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,560
it's either after the sunset or after the catch ball.

265
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,260
This is normal in my house.

266
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh! Keiichi-sama! It's a capsule!

267
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,660
Oh, Nagagawa! You can finally take a two-shot photo with your dad!

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,480
Yes!

269
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,280
Ah! It's burnt black!

270
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,140
What?

271
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,080
It looks like it took too much time in the pool.

272
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,940
It's dangerous!

273
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,060
Mr. Toto!

274
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:35,920
There's a possibility that the inside is also heated.

275
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,120
Open it carefully!

276
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,240
Roger that!

277
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,100
It's opened!

278
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,040
It's not here! No one is on board!

279
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,300
What did you say?

280
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,200
Where did you escape from?

281
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't know.

282
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,400
Oh!

283
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,500
Yes!

284
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,740
Huh?

285
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,780
You're going back to Earth by shuttle?

286
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,940
What did you say?

287
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,900
You're arriving at the Miami Space Center.

288
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,700
I got it!

289
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,900
Another change!

290
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,280
I'll call the helicopter immediately!

291
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,820
Oh, please do that!

292
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,180
What did you say?

293
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,120
About an hour ago,

294
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,400
I went home alone to pick up something I forgot.

295
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,320
What a busy father!

296
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,120
So, where is your home?

297
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,980
My home is in 72 places around the world, including New York and Tokyo.

298
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,200
72 places?

299
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,300
Anyway, where is the closest home?

300
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,940
Well, Florida?

301
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,240
Okay, let's go there for the time being!

302
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,080
What?

303
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Do you know where your home is?

304
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,260
Just now, I was contacted that I was heading to your home in New York.

305
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,920
Okay, hey!

306
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,780
It's New York!

307
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,880
Yes!

308
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
There's an airport and a golf course in the middle of New York?

309
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,600
What's wrong with your father?

310
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,660
So, where is your father?

311
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,780
He said that it would be private from now on,

312
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,820
and he didn't tell the company, me, or the destination,

313
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,580
so he ended up going out.

314
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,860
Oh my!

315
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,820
It's been a while!

316
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,100
No clue again!

317
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,420
Senpai, it's okay now.

318
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,540
I'm going to give up.

319
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,340
You idiot!

320
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,240
What are you going to do with that photo?

321
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,840
If you give up now,

322
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,400
you can never take a two-shot with your father again!

323
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,680
Senpai...

324
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,480
That's right!

325
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,800
Okay!

326
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,480
Let's give him some money!

327
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,200
What?!

328
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,920
He's been an individual who has lived on a daily basis for a long time,

329
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,460
I'll have to catch you if I don't do it.

330
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,160
I may never see you again.

331
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:45,980
You're right.

332
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,880
If you find the person,

333
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,520
I'll give you $20 million in cash.

334
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,280
Please put a full-page advertisement on the newspaper.

335
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,920
$20 million?

336
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,380
I understand.

337
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,040
One dollar is 120 yen.

338
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,780
That's...

339
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,240
24 billion yen!

340
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:03,820
Again!

341
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,600
I'll find you!

342
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,440
I'll get all the cash!

343
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,360
I'll get all the cash!

344
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,380
Okay?

345
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,600
What?

346
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,480
You'll give me $20 million?

347
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,980
I'm in!

348
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,760
Send me the picture of President Nakagawa

349
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,240
through e-mail.

350
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,980
Roger that.

351
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,080
Nakagawa, you have your father's picture, right?

352
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,400
Yes, this is it.

353
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,140
Wait a minute.

354
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,420
Okay.

355
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,080
Send me the picture of President Nakagawa

356
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,820
through e-mail.

357
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,860
I'll take this.

358
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:38,680
I understand.

359
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,460
Okay.

360
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,660
President Bakuryu is okay with this.

361
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,340
Nakagawa, you use your power

362
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,840
and find the whole of the United States

363
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,880
and the whole world!

364
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,880
Yes, sir!

365
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,740
Use all the land and sea

366
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,040
you can use to find him!

367
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,720
I'm Ryuden from President Bakuryu.

368
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,820
What?

369
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,360
I just secured a body in San Francisco.

370
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,120
All right!

371
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,400
You don't have to 이것.

372
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,940
The public will believe whatever you do

373
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,340
and as long as the public packed inside of Japan,

374
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,780
That's why...

375
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,940
The youths move on.

376
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,080
I want to carry this sword.

377
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,560
Why?

378
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,460
Because of you!

379
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,040
You can bring me the sword!

380
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,580
Well,

381
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,060
Dad!

382
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,940
I'm sorry I'm working!

383
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,840
This is the only way!

384
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,260
No!

385
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,740
It's not Dad!

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,660
What did you say?

387
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,900
You look like him, but you're a different person!

388
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,660
Look at the picture!

389
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,980
Even if you say that, I can only see your profile.

390
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,220
Ah!

391
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,080
It's me!

392
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,260
What? Did you find it?

393
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,360
Where is it?

394
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,880
It's the entertainment world.

395
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,220
I'll get closer to confirm it.

396
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,760
I'll take a picture and send it to you.

397
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,640
I can't see your face!

398
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,200
Make the picture more up!

399
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,000
Did you hear?

400
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,360
Give me an order right away!

401
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,080
There's no mistake!

402
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,120
Alright! It's the entertainment world!

403
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,780
I was preparing for it.

404
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,960
Make sure you shop through the internet!

405
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,840
Dad...

406
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,320
The color!

407
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,840
His face is completely different!

408
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,740
Wow, that's amazing.

409
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,040
Oh, Mentor...

410
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,760
I feel tired because I've been moving around,

411
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,920
so I can't go on.

412
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,660
ait's just the time, Mentor!

413
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,840
I found it again!

414
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,180
Me, too!

415
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,640
"Nagagawa"

416
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,180
Thank you for your hard work.

417
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,080
It costs 2.4 billion yen.

418
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,160
I need you to check it properly.

419
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,500
I've already arrested these 12 people.

420
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,980
Look at this, Nagagawa.

421
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,740
It's my father.

422
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,420
My father is full of them.

423
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,420
My father is...

424
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,920
My father is...

425
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,460
My father is full of them.

426
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,380
My father is full of them.

427
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,280
My father is full of them.

428
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,580
Get a hold of yourself, Nagagawa.

429
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,480
Let's go to all the scene.

430
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,480
Get your fighter planes ready.

431
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,940
I'll go buy the plane tickets.

432
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,300
How is it? Is it real?

433
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,560
I... I... I see differently.

434
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,820
How is Switzerland?

435
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,100
The... the... the beach is totally different.

436
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,840
It's Egypt!

437
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,340
My chin is too much cracked.

438
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,460
How is Brazil?

439
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,020
It's... it's so... it's so...

440
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,800
There's no bath!

441
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,200
How about China?

442
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,360
My head...

443
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,240
I have no hair...

444
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,060
I can't take it anymore...

445
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,360
Hey! Don't sleep! 2.4 billion!

446
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,560
Don't you want to see your father in the middle of the night?

447
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,020
My father must have become a star...

448
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,020
Look, over there...

449
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,620
What are you talking about?

450
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,920
Don't give up!

451
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,280
2.4 billion will be a star if you don't find it!

452
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,040
Oh, father!

453
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,380
What? Where?

454
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,740
When I close my eyes,

455
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,920
I see my father behind my eyelids.

456
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,080
That's your mother!

457
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,120
My father is laughing...

458
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,580
Hold on!

459
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,560
Nakagawa!

460
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,360
Well, do you think I'm ready?

461
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,920
Ryotsu! Nakagawa!

462
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,040
I couldn't find it even when I searched the whole earth!

463
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,420
I didn't find any clue!

464
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,740
Kei-chan is also broken.

465
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,200
I gave up on my money.

466
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,360
I'll do the public investigation.

467
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,240
It's Kei-chan's phone!

468
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,940
It's an email from your father!

469
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,460
What?

470
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,480
I heard he's in Japan.

471
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,660
No way!

472
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,120
He's not in Japan!

473
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,320
I didn't think he'd be in this place!

474
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,840
There he is!

475
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,600
I really didn't want to see him.

476
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,620
He's Nakagawa Oki's father!

477
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:16,920
What?

478
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,460
Father!

479
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,480
Father!

480
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,400
Oh, Keiichi!

481
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,920
Keiichi!

482
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,200
Father!

483
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,520
Father!

484
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,600
Father!

485
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,980
Thank you, Nakagawa.

486
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,240
Thank you, Senpai.

487
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,580
Keiichi, you don't have time.

488
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,400
Yes.

489
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,700
I have something for you.

490
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,220
Yes.

491
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,460
I was planning to give it to you last year,

492
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,240
but it's been a year.

493
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,500
Yes.

494
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,700
Yes.

495
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,560
That's it!

496
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,440
A toy bottle!

497
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,700
A toy bottle!

498
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,360
A toy bottle!

499
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,040
It's a toy bottle

500
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,680
that you can get

501
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,500
by collecting five gold or silver octopus

502
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,480
in an octopus ball.

503
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,620
When Keiichi went to elementary school,

504
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,900
I asked him what he wanted in the future,

505
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,880
and he said he wanted this.

506
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,920
So I applied and got it.

507
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,080
I kept it for a long time,

508
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,900
and I finally got it today.

509
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,720
President, it's time.

510
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,780
Yes.

511
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,580
Well then,

512
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,880
let's meet again in a few years!

513
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,580
Goodbye, Keiichi!

514
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,080
You're such a busy father!

515
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,880
Kei-chan!

516
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,900
Kei-chan!

517
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,880
Hang in there!

518
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,260
I'm tired.

519
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,720
But it was really good

520
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,980
to take a picture with my father.

521
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,080
The S蓮

522
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,100
#1

523
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,180
The S蓮

524
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,240
The S蓮

525
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,320
#1

526
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:11,960
The S蓮

527
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:23,440
The S蓮

528
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,420
#1

529
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,360
I don't want to be like that

530
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,780
If I go down the wrong way

531
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,680
The moon will run away

532
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,580
Because now is not everything

533
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,000
Don't worry too much

534
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,880
Even if I lie and cheat a little

535
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,160
I'm helping someone sometimes

536
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,540
Baby, do you know me?

537
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm heading to tomorrow

538
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,920
Nice breathing

539
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,260
Don't be rotten

540
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,820
I'll do what I have to do

541
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,640
Cute breathing

542
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,980
It's hard to understand

543
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,400
I want to show it

544
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,820
It's better than seeing it again

545
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,240
Na na na na

546
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,520
Na na na na

547
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,200
Na na na na

548
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,600
Ah, I'm hungry

549
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,660
I can't wait to have breakfast

550
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,360
I want to eat

551
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,860
Dog, grandma, dog

552
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,400
OV champion

553
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,320
Are you all in my way?

554
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,040
Let me eat

555
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,280
Next time, Ryo's long day

556
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,400
Thank you
