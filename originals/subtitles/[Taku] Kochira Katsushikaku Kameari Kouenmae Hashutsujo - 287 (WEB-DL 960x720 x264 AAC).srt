1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,140
Too bad for me

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,360
When you're watching TV, remember to keep your room bright.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,180
Keep your distance, too.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,440
If you're broke, come to my place!

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,600
I don't come to your place, but I'm worried about you.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,860
Look at the blue sky, the white clouds

7
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,640
I'm sure it'll be alright

8
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,920
You got it, right? You got it, you got it!

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,080
If you got it, then shut up and follow me!

10
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,840
The End

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,680
The Last Present

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,780
The Last Present

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,880
Y-Yes!

14
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,580
I'm the head of the police station, yes?

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,740
Yes, we at the police station highly evaluate your work.

16
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,380
Even if you say it's work, I just do my usual work as a police officer.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,460
I just do my usual work as a police officer.

18
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,640
Of course, it's important.

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,320
Come to the police station and show your skills.

20
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,860
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,440
I'll do my usual work.

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,980
Congratulations, Oharu. You're doing well.

23
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,220
It's all thanks to you.

24
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,180
You're doing your best.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,240
Then...

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,800
I think the official announcement will be next month.

27
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,240
Until then, I'll keep this a secret.

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Yes, sir.

29
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,040
I'll keep this a secret.

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,980
I'm the head of the police station!

31
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,640
I'm hungry.

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,220
I'm at my limit.

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,780
I'm hungry.

34
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,120
I'm hungry.

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,680
Please lend me a thousand yen.

36
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,300
Even if you say that, I don't have cash with me.

37
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,160
Even if you say that, I don't have cash with me.

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,840
That's what they say.

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,900
You can't keep it to yourself.

40
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,880
Such a long relationship.

41
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,520
If you say so.

42
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,140
Go to Ohara.

43
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,320
Damn it!

44
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,740
Chief!

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,100
Are you going to make me a slave?

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,040
You are devil!

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,260
You are devil!

48
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,800
You are a villain!

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,260
You must be a villain in your past life.

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,180
You are a villain in your past life.

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,540
You must be.

52
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,300
How can you make such a face?

53
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,400
Senior.

54
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,540
Ryo.

55
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,060
You don't care about my face.

56
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,980
What's wrong with you?

57
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,700
Oh, Chief!

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,460
Good morning, Chief.

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,520
Good morning.

60
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,320
Good morning. What were you talking about?

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,860
About how you didn't have money and haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

62
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,260
You must have done some stupid shopping.

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
You're so stupid.

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,760
It's easy to understand.

65
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,120
It's self-reward. You have to put up with it until the payday.

66
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,540
How many days do you think you have left?

67
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,240
If I become the head of the village, how many days will it take to be with him?

68
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,720
But if you don't eat, you'll have to work all your life.

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,220
I'll treat you today.

70
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,400
Follow me.

71
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,260
What's wrong? Don't you want to eat?

72
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,080
No, I'm happy to eat.

73
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,100
Chief Ohara treated Ryo-chan.

74
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,720
It's rare to eat like this.

75
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,140
It's bad for your health if you don't chew well.

76
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,240
What did you say?

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
Well, it's not like it's easy to break.

78
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,720
It's nothing.

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,820
Eat it.

80
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,140
Is that so?

81
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,400
Then...

82
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,800
How many years has it been since this place was rebuilt?

83
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,320
I think it's been about 15 years.

84
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,920
I see.

85
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,960
It's been that long.

86
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,700
I thought it was just recently.

87
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,040
As soon as he came to the depot,

88
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,440
I had a meal like this.

89
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,360
How many years has it been since then?

90
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,500
Thank you very much.

91
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,560
This shopping street has changed a lot.

92
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,640
What? Has it changed that much?

93
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,740
It has changed.

94
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,580
Try to remember the first time you and I were on patrol together.

95
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,680
It seems to change surprisingly.

96
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,920
Is that so?

97
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,520
Well, the city is changing more and more.

98
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,860
I can't remember how it used to be.

99
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,820
That's enough.

100
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,360
Hey, chief.

101
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,780
What's wrong, chief?

102
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,100
You have to eat it, don't you?

103
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,120
Ah, my wife made too many bentos again.

104
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,220
I'd like to make you eat them because it's a waste to throw them away.

105
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,060
Instead, do your job well.

106
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,580
Yes, sir!

107
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,640
Thank you very much!

108
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,520
Lucky, you can eat your lunch today.

109
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
Your wife is even more upset.

110
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,620
She made too many bentos in three straight days.

111
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,000
That's a lie.

112
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,520
Eh?

113
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:38,600
Eh?

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,620
I've been making it for you.

115
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,020
It's unnatural if you don't think so.

116
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,960
That's right, Ryo-san.

117
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,700
But it has never happened before.

118
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,560
Maybe he's planning something.

119
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,440
Or rather, isn't Director Ohara's condition strange lately?

120
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,880
It seems like he suddenly calmed down.

121
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,780
If you say so, it's quite unusual.

122
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,500
Senior, haven't you been scolded by the director lately?

123
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,500
Hmm, that's true.

124
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:03,680
That's right.

125
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,140
Oh, right. This happened yesterday.

126
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,540
Did you know that this place was made of wood?

127
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,000
When I first came, it was already a building.

128
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,220
I see.

129
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,440
This office has been here for a long time now.

130
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
You must have been attached to it.

131
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,320
Hmm?

132
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,720
It's as if he's saying goodbye to the office.

133
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,180
What?

134
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,640
Hey, Ryo-san's boss!

135
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,760
I heard that you have a business meeting with Director Ohara.

136
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,460
What?

137
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,460
Huh? Is that not true?

138
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,900
It's been a big rumor in the Katsushika office.

139
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,360
I confirmed it with my friend in the office.

140
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,520
It seems that Director Ohara's business meeting with the director is almost finalized.

141
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,640
An official case will be filed next week.

142
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,480
I see.

143
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,280
Director Ohara is also a bit of a water-sweater.

144
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,420
If that's the case, you should have told me.

145
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,800
Considering your personality, I'm sure you're going to keep quiet until an official case is filed.

146
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,240
The director's business meeting?

147
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,560
It's going to be lonely.

148
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,280
I'll teach you a lesson.

149
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:19,940
Ryo-chan!

150
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,340
Hey, why don't you give something to the business meeting?

151
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,360
Sounds good.

152
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,580
Yeah, let's do it.

153
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,040
I'll help you.

154
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,360
What about you?

155
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,580
I can't help it.

156
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,940
I'll help you.

157
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,160
I'll take care of you for a while.

158
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,360
So, what are you going to send me?

159
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,480
Japanese islands?

160
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,140
According to the director's wife, the director has recently been interested in Japanese islands.

161
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,800
But there are many kinds of Japanese islands.

162
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,100
Besides, the prices are also ...

163
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,820
The director will come to this department store to see Japanese islands when he has a day off.

164
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,880
Apparently, there is a favorite item.

165
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,820
Let's celebrate the shop with a Japanese island.

166
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,600
A Japanese island.

167
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,420
Is this a side dish?

168
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,500
It's a bit longer.

169
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,460
Senpai!

170
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,220
Is the price so high for this short thing?

171
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:23,980
Yes!

172
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,120
That's it!

173
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,440
Well ...

174
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,060
Wonderful.

175
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,400
I've seen it several times. It's a wonderful product.

176
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
I'm even really jealous.

177
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,360
Oh right.

178
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,860
The fact that you're purchasing it to comfort the head of the tradition...

179
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,340
No, no!

180
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,180
You're the official, so you can't pull anyashig.

181
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,360
You're wasting your time doing this.

182
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,160
The head of the tradition Galleristash this is about being my official.

183
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,040
I can't be patient.

184
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,360
Okay.

185
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,580
...

186
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,200
...

187
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,840
...

188
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,320
This is what the chief was looking at.

189
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,420
Eh!? A million yen!?

190
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,340
...

191
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,300
Senpai, are you really going to use this?

192
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,480
Certainly,

193
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,160
it's too expensive even for a ceremony.

194
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,340
Ryotsu, this is a celebration of your promotion.

195
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,100
...

196
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,720
From today, you are also the chief of the police.

197
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,460
You have to dress a little bit more stylish.

198
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,660
Amazing! This is really expensive clothing!

199
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,620
What do you mean, clothing?

200
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,560
If you give me a million yen,

201
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,820
I'll give you a plastic model.

202
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,080
You idiot!

203
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,280
How much do you think this is?

204
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,400
I bought you the best handkerchief

205
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,480
Seriously!

206
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,960
...

207
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,160
...

208
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,520
No, I'll use this Japanese-style.

209
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,540
Senpai...

210
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,920
If we all pay for it,

211
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:51,660
it'll be fine.

212
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,380
This is the chief's celebration.

213
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:53,680
It's a great gift.

214
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,620
I have to give it to him.

215
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,480
...

216
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,140
Here's the delivery!

217
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,320
Thank you for your hard work.

218
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,240
We finally received it.

219
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,140
To think that we could buy a Japanese-style

220
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,840
that would cost a million yen...

221
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,020
Most of the employees

222
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,480
paid for it.

223
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,080
It's the chief's merit.

224
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,160
It's going to be a lot of money.

225
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,660
I'm excited.

226
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,480
...

227
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,120
...

228
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:23,400
...

229
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,820
I'll take it off.

230
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,420
...

231
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,380
...

232
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,520
...

233
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,560
...

234
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,760
Good morning.

235
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,240
Good mo...

236
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,440
Good morning.

237
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,220
What is this?

238
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,100
Nothing, really.

239
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,820
Ryotsu, what were you thinking?

240
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,040
Nothing.

241
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,860
Chief, about the report yesterday, I was...

242
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,020
Then I'll go first.

243
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,840
No, I'll go first.

244
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,240
I'll go first.

245
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,120
I'll go first.

246
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,540
I'll go first.

247
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,520
I see.

248
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,800
I was thinking the same thing.

249
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,100
I helped you.

250
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,220
How about you, Terai?

251
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,260
I'm the same.

252
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,780
Well, I'll go back to the camp.

253
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,500
You're not doing anything wrong, but you're making me nervous.

254
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,720
Really.

255
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,580
I was surprised.

256
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,660
I'll go patrol.

257
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,700
I'll go too.

258
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,360
I'll go shopping.

259
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,460
Ryo-chan, take care of the house.

260
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:47,240
I was thinking the same thing.

261
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,700
Out of nowhere, Chief suddenly came out and we couldn't see a thing.

262
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,940
True, he's full of energy.

263
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,060
He shows his strength and is shining.

264
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,740
I know he wants you.

265
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,640
I used to keep him in my mind.

266
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,820
If I were fresh like he was in the Edo period, I may have been a good swordsman.

267
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,000
Wait.

268
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,120
Now that you know the secret of my group, you can't just give it back to me!

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,300
I'm just a bounty hunter, Ryotsu Fuyonosuke.

270
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:24,960
Don't you think I'm different?

271
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,860
No questions asked! Kill!

272
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,640
The dog immediately turned its fangs on me.

273
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,820
They're a bunch of troublemakers.

274
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,360
Get him!

275
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,180
You're strong...

276
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,160
I'm just clumsy.

277
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,960
I don't have any manly techniques.

278
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,200
Come at me with pleasure.

279
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:06,420
There's nothing more terrifying than a dog's fangs!

280
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,920
Just choose one!

281
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,660
Huh?

282
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,500
Huh?

283
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,620
I can't go! My tooth is stuck!

284
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,900
This is a little conspicuous.

285
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,920
What do I do? It's a present for the chief.

286
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,360
I have to think of a way to trick him.

287
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,560
Huh? Where are you going, Senior?

288
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,480
Nakagawa...

289
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,540
That's a present for the chief, right?

290
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,780
Where are you taking it?

291
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,800
If I leave it in the office, the chief may find it.

292
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,820
So I'm keeping it in my room.

293
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,280
I see. That's true.

294
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:56,980
Right?

295
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,320
But be careful.

296
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,320
If you get hurt, you won't get a present.

297
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,640
I know.

298
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,540
Well, then...

299
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,360
How much will it cost if I...

300
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,680
What?

301
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,120
How much will it cost if I get this sword sharpened?

302
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,420
Well, it depends on the class of the sword, but at least 100,000 yen.

303
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,620
That sword may cost about 300,000 yen.

304
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,520
300,000 yen?

305
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,420
I see.

306
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,000
Huh?

307
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,160
I'm not kidding.

308
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,220
I'm in debt to pay for the present.

309
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,420
How can I get 300,000 yen?

310
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,220
I have no choice but to do it myself.

311
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,060
It's still about 5 mm deep.

312
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,500
It's going to take a long time to sharpen 5 mm overall.

313
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,480
It's a little rough, so let's grind it with the grinder.

314
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,900
I'll make it look better.

315
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,760
The roughness is gone, but the overall condition has become distorted.

316
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,260
I have to sharpen it equally.

317
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,420
It's becoming even, but it's becoming a thinner sword.

318
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,600
I'm getting close to the fencing sword.

319
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,120
This is bad! I have to put it on right away!

320
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,540
It fits perfectly.

321
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,120
It bent! I have to do it again!

322
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,020
No, it's already stuck.

323
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,660
That's enough!

324
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,180
A gift is enough for a plastic sword.

325
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,420
You don't have to do the real thing.

326
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:45,900
You don't have to do the real thing.

327
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,160
But it's the captain's celebration.

328
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,820
It may be the last gift I send.

329
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,600
But I don't have any money.

330
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,720
Eh? Senior, you're not here?

331
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,860
He said he'd rest for a while.

332
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,520
He's having a cold.

333
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,740
He said he'd come out on the day the captain's celebration was announced.

334
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,100
He said he wanted to give a present by himself.

335
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,400
I see.

336
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:12,760
I see.

337
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,520
But he seemed to be fine when I saw him yesterday.

338
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,520
Senior, are you all right?

339
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,140
I bought something that looks nutritious.

340
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,620
Is he sleeping?

341
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,160
Senior!

342
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,460
What?

343
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,180
What on earth is he doing?

344
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,360
This is...

345
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,160
I saw it!

346
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,040
Senior, you were having a cold.

347
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,800
I guess I'm cold!

348
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,020
What?

349
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
You broke our President Ohara's gift!

350
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,260
That's a loud voice.

351
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,800
The members of the office are paying for it.

352
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,100
What are you going to do?

353
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,220
It can't be helped, so I decided to make it myself.

354
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,680
Make it yourself?

355
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,860
What's a Japanese tower?

356
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,160
I also prepared tools.

357
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,020
I borrowed books from the library.

358
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,400
Is that all you can do?

359
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,760
I can.

360
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,100
I made one yesterday.

361
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,440
Next time, I'll make something that fits the original size.

362
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,400
I just make things that are fun to play with.

363
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,880
Now that I know him, I'll ask you to help me!

364
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,180
I knew it.

365
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,740
Let's go!

366
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,820
Yes, come on!

367
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,160
That's right!

368
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:23,760
I'm sorry!

369
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,040
Come on, get it together!

370
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,540
Come on!

371
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,000
Done!

372
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,820
Done!

373
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,260
Done!

374
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,500
You did it, senpai!

375
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,500
It's just right size!

376
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,800
It's a piece of cake.

377
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,920
What's wrong, senpai?

378
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,440
This sword is more dull than before.

379
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,320
Is that so?

380
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,880
And if you look closely, the color is a little different.

381
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,980
I'm not sure.

382
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,220
I don't know.

383
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,640
No!

384
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,940
This is a failure!

385
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,480
Wait, senpai!

386
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,860
This is the last present for the chief.

387
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,160
Can you give me something good?

388
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,620
Senpai...

389
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,440
I'll make it again!

390
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,540
Yes!

391
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,820
All right!

392
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,080
Come on!

393
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,120
Come on!

394
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,420
Come on!

395
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,260
Come on!

396
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,360
Come on!

397
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,700
Let's break up!

398
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,640
Hey...

399
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,500
Look!

400
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,260
Here, take this!

401
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,560
Take this!

402
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,680
Here, take this!

403
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,560
Take this!

404
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,560
Take this!

405
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,060
You two go back to your usual jobs.

406
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,980
We must go back to our homes.

407
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,240
It seems like he's having a bad time.

408
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,480
I told you he would come out tomorrow even if I had to.

409
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,940
Because tomorrow is the Chief's...

410
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,200
Tewai-san...

411
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,900
I wanted to spend the last time with him here.

412
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,540
Tomorrow, we have a big announcement for everyone.

413
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,220
Come to the library.

414
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,260
Yes!

415
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,200
It's finally time.

416
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,020
Chief Ohara is gone.

417
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,660
I'm going to be lonely.

418
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,880
It's done!

419
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,720
This is it! This color! This glow! It's the real thing!

420
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,700
I made more than 20 of them until I got to this one.

421
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,440
I made more than 20 of them until I got to this one.

422
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,560
I thought it was a good thing I did it myself.

423
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,760
No one would think that I am a fake.

424
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,760
No, it's already so late.

425
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,800
Wake up, Honda!

426
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,400
Wake up!

427
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,360
I'll beat these two!

428
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,260
Are they going to make it?

429
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,840
We have a good news for you.

430
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,860
Ohara will be heading to the main city.

431
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,200
You're late, Ryota.

432
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,440
He's in a bad shape.

433
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,680
I'm sorry.

434
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,780
Maybe it would have been better to go get a present.

435
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,060
Ohara, please say hello.

436
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,860
As the president just told us, we will be moving to the capital.

437
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,240
We thank you for your support.

438
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,380
I'm the one who should be thanking you!

439
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,080
Huh?

440
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,400
Bun-chan!

441
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,200
Ryo-chan.

442
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,460
Ryo-chan!

443
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,560
Ryo-san.

444
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,840
Thank goodness, we made it!

445
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,700
Thank goodness, we made it!

446
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,740
We made it!

447
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,060
Ryo-chan.

448
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,120
I'm a sign of gratitude to all the members of the office.

449
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,540
M-my, I see.

450
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,580
We all put in our money and won it!

451
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,320
This is the Japanese island the president wanted!

452
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,300
B-but you guys.

453
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,380
Ohara, you can use it.

454
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,100
"Sepai"

455
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,400
I can't accept this!

456
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:31,980
Right?

457
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,180
Oh no.

458
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,260
What will you do if you get caught?

459
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,520
I wonder what's wrong.

460
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,280
You don't like it?

461
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,500
I don't like it or anything.

462
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,320
Ujo!

463
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,680
Excuse me!

464
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,960
Ryotsu.

465
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,800
Th-That's a fake sword I made!

466
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,740
Actually...

467
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,760
Sepai broke the original sword and made it himself!

468
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:52,960
I don't know!

469
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,880
Is that true, Ryotsu?

470
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,160
I'm sorry.

471
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,020
What are you doing, Rin?

472
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,420
What are you doing?

473
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,540
You...

474
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,020
Wonderful.

475
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,920
This is the first time I've ever seen such a wonderful Japanese sword.

476
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,320
If you look closely, you'll probably get 10 million.

477
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,360
I thought it was too expensive to accept it.

478
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,740
You made such a great sword?

479
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,220
I made a sword that's more amazing than anything I've ever bought.

480
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,140
That's not all.

481
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,740
I'm sure I wanted to give you something good.

482
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,960
I was just surprised by you until the end.

483
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,260
Captain!

484
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,860
To celebrate the last time, please show me the sword of the swordman you're good at!

485
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,820
All right.

486
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,940
I will.

487
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,580
I'm sorry.

488
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,780
I'm sorry.

489
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,460
I'm sorry.

490
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,280
I'm sorry.

491
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,360
I'm sorry.

492
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,420
I'm sorry.

493
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,220
I'm sorry.

494
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,900
I'm sorry.

495
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,080
I'm sorry.

496
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,140
I'm sorry.

497
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,160
I'm sorry.

498
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:02,960
I'm sorry.

499
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,360
I'm sorry.

500
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,820
I'm sorry.

501
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,480
I'm sorry.

502
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,280
I'm sorry.

503
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm sorry.

504
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,940
This is my last chance.

505
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,380
I'm sorry.

506
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,260
This is my last chance.

507
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,680
I'm sorry.

508
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,160
I'm sorry.

509
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,640
- - Oh

510
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,360
ara-kun! My

511
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,840
... face...! What

512
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,940
's this, Ohara-kun?! I

513
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,260
brought an example for you! Seems

514
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,780
like you don't need it. We

515
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,440
'll let you assume that nothing happened on this one. W

516
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,680
-W-Wait!

517
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:46,740
Hey!

518
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,500
Chief!

519
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,220
As I thought, you're my god of medicine!

520
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,220
Chief, watch out!

521
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,260
If you swing that sword...

522
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,860
Oh, watch out!

523
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,300
It's not my fault!

524
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,760
-As I thought... -Go on, go on.

525
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,700
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why...

526
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,120
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why...

527
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,520
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why...

528
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,340
Even though Lemon-chan is a kindergarten kid...

529
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,740
Why does he like historical dramas?

530
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,280
Why, why, why, why, why, why...

531
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,620
His little mustache is slightly small...

532
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,540
Why, why, why, why, why...

533
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,840
When he rides a Honda-san motorcycle...

534
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,420
His personality changes...

535
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,260
Why, why, why, why, why, why...

536
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,280
His daily life is only once every four years...

537
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,100
Why, why, why, why, why...

538
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,140
Why, why, why, why, why...

539
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,640
Nakagawa-san doesn't lend money to the mass-production company...

540
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,240
But he can easily lend money to a tank or a fighter...

541
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Why, why, why, why, why...

542
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,740
Reiko-san is a very rich person...

543
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,540
But he works at a gas station...

544
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,600
Why, why, why, why...

545
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:30,220
Why was Reiko a student teacher?

546
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,000
What's going on?

547
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,540
It seems Reiko and not Reiko...

548
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,340
Reiko and not Reiko...

549
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,700
They get along quite well...

550
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:42,500
Reiko and not Reiko...

551
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,580
Reiko and not Reiko...

552
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,540
Next time on "I'm Reiko and..."

553
