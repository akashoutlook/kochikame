1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,100
"Let's Go Home"

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,400
When you watch TV, make your room bright and keep your distance.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,960
Come to my house if you have no money.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,920
I don't have money, but I'm worried.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,960
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,660
I'll get through this somehow.

7
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:57,560
Come to my house if you have no work.

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,480
Come to my house if you have no work.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
I don't have money, but I'm worried.

10
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,960
Look at the red clouds that are burning.

11
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,200
I'll get through this somehow.

12
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,220
Come to my house if you have no work.

13
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,400
I know. I know. I know.

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,240
Come to my house if you have no work.

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,100
Come to my house if you have no work.

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,920
Yeah, I'm going to pay you.

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,300
Oh, I see.

18
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,180
Now?

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,480
Yes, right now.

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,820
Good.

21
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:57,760
Good.

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,200
That's...

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,960
Where are you going, Ryo?

24
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,720
No, no, recently my body is so tired that I thought I'd do some exercise.

25
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,780
You're the next-ditch, so you're looking too sweetly.

26
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,440
You'll get something in the end, Ryo.

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,220
That's why I said I wouldn't pay, right?

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,720
Maybe it's around the next bonus.

29
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,080
Can you trust me like that?

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,640
Let's go to the bank right now. Pay it right now!

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,760
No, right now...

32
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,140
Now!

33
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,280
I got it. I'll pay.

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,640
That's a horse-drawn horse.

35
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,900
It's a horse-drawn horse.

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,780
The 9th and 10th most popular horses I bought by chance

37
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,660
were a miracle 1, 2, and a win-win.

38
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,600
It's a super big one, a 30,000 yen horse-drawn horse.

39
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,800
What? 30,000 yen?

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,700
So how much did you buy it for?

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,440
10,000 yen.

42
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,040
10,000 yen?

43
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,980
10,000 yen x 300 times...

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,180
30,000 yen!

45
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:01,480
30,000 yen!

46
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,240
That's right.

47
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,380
When you change this to cash,

48
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,960
you'll get a lot of money even if you pay it back.

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,380
Well, be careful of your boat trip.

50
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,100
Wait with the intention of going on a treasure boat.

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,900
Okay.

52
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,120
Then, change it to cash right away.

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,560
But the cash register is off today.

54
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,780
Um, Mr. Oomari.

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,440
Yes?

56
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,880
I have a little discussion.

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,800
What? Discussion?

58
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,420
What is it?

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,260
Well, actually...

60
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, that's bad.

61
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,400
Well, then, I have a mission in this ship, so I'm sorry for this.

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,760
Let's go. Let's go.

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,180
Kameyari and Narita were tricked.

64
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,900
Kazumi Haruyama, 25 years old.

65
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,100
A few days ago, I was at Kameyari Station

66
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,740
and lent a transportation fee to a troubled person.

67
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,340
So, how much did I lend?

68
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,860
It's 3,000 yen.

69
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,980
He said he would definitely pay it back, so I told him my contact information.

70
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,200
So?

71
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,020
Even if it's today, I don't have a contact,

72
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,600
so if I call the number I asked him...

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,480
You didn't get through.

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,060
Yes.

75
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,460
It's a typical fraud.

76
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,180
Fraud?

77
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,200
You're caught in such a hand.

78
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,520
Then, this money can go around the world.

79
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,680
Be strong.

80
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:20,940
Yes.

81
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,580
The bad thing is not Mr. Haruyama.

82
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,160
It's worse to abuse the good of others.

83
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,420
Here.

84
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,600
Thank you.

85
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,560
Actually, when I was young,

86
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,360
I was often deceived by others.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,700
Is that so?

88
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,840
But I didn't have any money,

89
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,860
so I didn't lend it.

90
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,720
Then, the good people are combined,

91
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,280
so the temple can be changed.

92
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,840
I have to study horseback riding.

93
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,140
Only horseback riding.

94
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,260
I understand.

95
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,440
Actually, I'm going to Winning

96
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,180
where the world's violinists are gathered.

97
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,200
A contest in Winning?

98
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,260
Yes.

99
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,260
Hey, Ryo, did you hear?

100
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,160
This is the final race.

101
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,000
Did you say something?

102
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,080
I think it's on the newspaper.

103
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,220
Really?

104
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,200
Ryo, please make it a newspaper.

105
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,720
What are you doing?

106
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,800
I can't help it.

107
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,860
Leave the competition discussion.

108
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,680
Well,

109
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,340
I found it.

110
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:20,700
It's there.

111
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,780
The new violinist,

112
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,580
Toriumon.

113
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,160
The international violin competition

114
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,600
will be held in Winning the day after tomorrow.

115
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,260
The winner is expected to be

116
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,440
Haruyama Kazumi,

117
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,380
who is 25 years old.

118
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,740
Haruyama Kazumi?

119
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,520
It's the same person.

120
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,040
I met a famous person, Ryo.

121
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,540
Please give me a hand.

122
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,080
Well, you're famous.

123
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,340
I'm still a beginner.

124
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,300
Which one?

125
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,900
By the way,

126
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,400
the prize money for the competition is 10 million yen.

127
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,840
10 million yen?

128
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,500
Really?

129
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,740
Yes.

130
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,800
Wow.

131
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,820
You're talented.

132
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,000
Hey, it's a phone call.

133
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,880
Yes.

134
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,360
In short,

135
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,760
you're expected to win.

136
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,780
Yes.

137
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,360
It seems that the previous reputation is high.

138
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,220
Some people say that the winner is certain.

139
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,780
The winner is certain means...

140
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,260
Is it the real place of Nijumaru?

141
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,120
The real place of Nijumaru?

142
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,640
The real place?

143
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,380
If you are the horse of the competition,

144
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,640
you can bet all your fortune right now.

145
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,300
Yes, I understand.

146
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,080
Hey, Ryo.

147
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,020
The third time,

148
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,920
the old lady dropped her wallet

149
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,100
in the drain.

150
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,620
I'll go there for a while.

151
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,120
Yes, go ahead.

152
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,900
Leave 10 million yen to me.

153
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,840
10 million yen?

154
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,700
Well then,

155
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,320
please do your best.

156
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,460
Yes.

157
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,140
Then, I'll go.

158
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,080
Well,

159
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,760
I have to go now.

160
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,180
Are you going already?

161
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,120
Yes.

162
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,600
Thank you very much.

163
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,800
But,

164
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,460
I have to talk about 10 million yen.

165
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,520
Huh?

166
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,660
What?

167
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,600
What's up?

168
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,220
I don't have my wallet.

169
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,240
What?

170
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,560
Look for it more carefully.

171
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,100
You must have left it somewhere.

172
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,000
In my wallet,

173
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,800
I have my all assets and

174
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,940
the flight ticket to Wien.

175
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,700
What?

176
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,160
Lend it to me.

177
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,500
What's the meaning of this?

178
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,120
If you don't have that,

179
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,320
please lend me

180
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,560
the money

181
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,260
and the money

182
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,420
to Wien.

183
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,700
What?

184
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,220
If you win the competition,

185
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,400
I'll double the prize money

186
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,860
and,

187
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,820
no,

188
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,600
I'll pay you back three times.

189
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,460
But,

190
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,320
I can't bring it with me.

191
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,440
You don't have the cash,

192
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,980
but you have the ticket.

193
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,560
The ticket?

194
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,680
Why?

195
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,360
I got it.

196
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,540
I'm sorry for the trouble.

197
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,860
Is your house near here?

198
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,700
What if you borrow money from your family?

199
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,720
I haven't seen my parents for years.

200
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,140
My father is an entrepreneur who runs a few companies,

201
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,600
but he was impressed by the fact that I started playing the violin.

202
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,500
Besides,

203
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,940
I was always busy practicing the violin,

204
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,420
so I don't have any friends,

205
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,080
and I have no choice but to give up.

206
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,820
What?

207
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,880
The competition.

208
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,700
What?

209
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,060
Are you giving up?

210
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,780
It's the real chance of winning.

211
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,660
You can get 10 million yen.

212
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,040
Because I have to have money.

213
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,900
In that case,

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,940
what will happen to the prize money of 10 million yen?

215
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,760
That's for sure

216
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,640
someone else's hand.

217
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,600
What a thing.

218
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,720
It's 10 million yen.

219
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,920
10 million yen.

220
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,880
It's right there.

221
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,480
The winner knows it.

222
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,960
Where are the stupid idiots of the race?

223
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,740
Well,

224
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Leave it to me.

225
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,260
I'll lend you theちゃうじき.

226
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,480
I finally found a wallet.

227
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,400
I'm home.

228
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,080
Mr. Tegai,

229
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,180
Welcome home.

230
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,080
New clearance?

231
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,160
Yes.

232
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,760
Oh,

233
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Huh? I think I saw it somewhere...

234
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:12,800
Whoa!

235
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,840
You're sure it's Hariyama, right?

236
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,100
Yes. I'm sorry for letting you go.

237
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,820
It's too late to go around the

238
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,160
The dispatch office is too late to go around the

239
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,340
It's too late to go around the

240
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,700
It's a bad habit to tell the real person.

241
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,820
But what does it mean that Ryotsu disappeared with Hariyama?

242
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,180
What does it mean that Ryotsu disappeared with Hariyama?

243
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,760
Did you know he was a fraud and was being arrested?

244
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,500
I don't think so.

245
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,740
Is Ryo-chan a fraud target?

246
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,560
No, no.

247
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,740
That's right.

248
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,220
Even if there is a debt, there is no savings.

249
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,060
Is there any?

250
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,520
This is for the shopping street.

251
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,340
Ryotsu is a loser, but what is that?

252
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,080
No, no.

253
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,800
No, no.

254
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,960
I said I made a loan of 3 million yen all in this competition, so...

255
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,760
I said I made a loan of 3 million yen all in this competition, so...

256
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
I said I made a loan of 3 million yen all in this competition, so...

257
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,800
Ryotsu, did Ryotsu make a loan of 3 million yen in a Hearing?

258
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,120
Yeah, but if you're not there

259
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,260
Could it be that you don't dive?

260
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,140
Ah, hello

261
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,260
3 million yen?

262
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,340
I didn't say a word that I made a loan of 3 million yen in a tomorrow game

263
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,160
I didn't say a word that I made a loan of 3 million yen in a tomorrow game

264
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,480
What's going on?

265
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,820
Someone explain

266
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,920
Doctor!

267
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,180
That means that Hariyama, who was looking for a turtle...

268
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,400
Yay! I got 10,000 yen for 3 million yen!

269
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,340
...was able to find a senior who had happened to have won 3 million yen at a racing race in the city.

270
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,820
That's not bad, is it?

271
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,920
Yeah.

272
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,520
But will that senior be fooled by the scammer?

273
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,080
No, no.

274
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,900
Um, where are you going?

275
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,220
To buy 10,000 yen!

276
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,460
What? What did you say?

277
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,800
You're going to buy 10,000 yen for money, right?

278
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,260
Wh-wh-what did you say?

279
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,180
I said...

280
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,960
I see.

281
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,260
I guess a high-priced turtle can only be caught at a racing track.

282
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,660
So you're heading to Nakayama Racing Park, right?

283
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,660
...

284
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,300
Huh?

285
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,100
Ah! Over there! The racing track is over there!

286
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,940
Don't worry! I'll take you to Narita Airport!

287
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,880
...

288
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,460
I'll take you there!

289
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,520
...

290
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,420
Why, why Narita?!

291
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,220
...

292
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,780
...

293
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,740
...

294
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,140
...

295
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,360
Stop it!

296
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,100
I don't know how long it will take to get to Narita by bicycle!

297
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,620
Don't make such a pathetic voice!

298
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,800
If you do that from now on, you won't be able to win the competition!

299
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,440
This is a joke to me, but I want to go to Hitchi-san, but I'll lose to you in a big way, so I'll just take 10% of the prize money.

300
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,100
So don't forget about that!

301
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,100
Why are you doing that?

302
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,780
Something is wrong.

303
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,600
If this happens, we'll change the strategy!

304
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,620
I'll take advantage of the opportunity and steal 10,000 yen!

305
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,500
All right...

306
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,640
Ah, it hurts! It hurts! What's wrong?

307
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,740
I haven't eaten anything since morning.

308
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,080
My stomach hurts too much.

309
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,700
Please!

310
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,000
Please let me eat something rich at the high-class restaurant!

311
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,420
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

312
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,460
I don't have time! I can't wait!

313
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,780
I can't! I'm about to die!

314
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,200
Ah, you're exaggerating! You're eating a whole meal!

315
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,240
...

316
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,440
I can't do it anymore...

317
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,440
Hey, Haruyama! Get a hold of yourself!

318
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:43,920
...

319
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,260
Ah, I can't help it anymore!

320
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760
Okay...

321
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,460
Wait a minute!

322
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,420
...

323
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:50,820
...

324
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,200
...

325
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:53,900
What?

326
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,520
Um...

327
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,040
What are you doing?

328
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,300
There are some grass that can be eaten in places like this.

329
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:00,980
...

330
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,240
...

331
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,860
Now, eat it!

332
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,600
...

333
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,580
There's no way you can eat that!

334
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,760
Hey, don't hold back!

335
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
I will hold back!

336
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:09,760
...

337
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,020
Please stop!

338
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,760
Don't say that! Try it! It's delicious!

339
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,580
Hey!

340
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,720
Please stop! It's not delicious!

341
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,840
...

342
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,560
What if you eat that and break your stomach?

343
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,420
...

344
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,380
Oh, I see!

345
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:29,520
If you break your stomach and can't participate in the race, the prize money for 10 million yen will be zero.

346
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,840
Ah, that's dangerous!

347
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,520
...

348
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,920
Did you eat it?

349
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,300
If you win this competition...

350
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,640
First of all, the prize money of 10 million yen, plus a solo concert and a commercial.

351
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,680
...

352
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:45,900
...

353
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,200
...

354
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,360
...

355
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,040
む

356
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,640
...

357
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,440
...

358
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,000
...

359
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,260
...

360
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,460
...

361
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,600
...

362
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:53,820
...

363
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,300
...

364
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,320
...

365
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,620
...

366
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,880
...

367
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:07,900
...

368
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,480
...

369
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,500
...

370
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,520
...

371
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,220
...

372
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,260
...

373
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,340
...

374
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,820
Damn it, I'm so busy trying to get that Manba sword.

375
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,760
Please take care of that for me.

376
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,580
Alright, I'll feed you.

377
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,760
Here, eat slowly.

378
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,860
Thank you.

379
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,860
You're giving me rice, but you only have one onigiri?

380
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,020
One, two, three, four.

381
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,400
Hey, do you know how to roll seaweed?

382
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,480
The one you pull out from the bottom.

383
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,320
Oh.

384
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,060
Alright, now all you have to do is pull the vinyl here and you'll get a rice ball.

385
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,040
I knew you were a kid.

386
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,520
As expected of a world-famous artist, a winner is certain.

387
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,840
Don't hold back.

388
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,540
Here, eat.

389
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,140
Even though I've waited for three million, how clever are you, old man?

390
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,980
This is what it's like to catch a fish with a shrimp.

391
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,060
And it's super thick.

392
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,500
If this happens, I'll be able to do it.

393
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,600
I won't wait for the opponent to give me the Manba sword.

394
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,640
If you wait, you'll be the sun of the sky.

395
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,860
Huh, that's dirty.

396
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,060
What?

397
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,120
No, it's the Y-shirt.

398
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:33,840
What?

399
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,560
Where?

400
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,040
Then take off your shirt.

401
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,300
I'll wash it in the water in the convenience store.

402
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,760
Oh, I see.

403
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,100
Sorry.

404
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,400
I was about to wash it.

405
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,800
I've only worn it for about two months.

406
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,560
With this container, your Y-shirt will dry out quickly.

407
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Then please.

408
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,400
Yes.

409
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,820
Oh, by the way, I'll wipe the dirt off your jacket.

410
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,880
Oh, sorry.

411
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,480
No, no.

412
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,380
Easy.

413
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,560
Easy.

414
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,880
Well, I'm going.

415
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,620
Oh, what's this? A sword?

416
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,380
When did you...

417
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,760
Oh, I don't have time if you don't hurry.

418
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,320
Oh, yes.

419
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,360
Damn it.

420
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,260
I don't have a sword.

421
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,740
Here.

422
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,920
Here.

423
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,120
Yahoo!

424
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,840
Thanks to you, the shirt is cold and feels good, Haruyama.

425
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,620
That's welcome.

426
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,480
Oh, damn it.

427
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,940
I ate the grass and my nose got smaller.

428
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,760
How good it is!

429
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:37,980
Not at all.

430
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,280
You'd better be better.

431
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,380
What's wrong?

432
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,620
Oh, nothing.

433
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,060
Okay.

434
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,980
I'll try again.

435
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,120
Huh?

436
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,280
There was a hell here.

437
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,220
It was before.

438
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,120
Hey!

439
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,220
Hey!

440
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,200
What are you doing?

441
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,360
Stop it!

442
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,300
I didn't do anything.

443
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,180
Hey!

444
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,200
Hey!

445
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,820
Hey!

446
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,220
Hey!

447
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,560
Hey!

448
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:06,780
Hey!

449
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,540
Hey!

450
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:08,600
Ouch!

451
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,320
Ouch!

452
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:10,520
Ouch!

453
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,700
Ouch!

454
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,480
Are you hurt?

455
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,200
Ouch!

456
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,960
What a scratch.

457
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,020
If you wear a cane, you'll get better soon.

458
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,540
Right?

459
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,860
What are you doing?

460
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,880
See, you can run.

461
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,880
You don't seem to be injured.

462
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,660
Hey, is the important business tool safe?

463
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,180
Business tool?

464
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,080
Ouch!

465
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,060
It's okay.

466
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,440
I see.

467
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,340
You're seriously injured.

468
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,800
Hm...

469
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,400
Huh?

470
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,220
Ouch!

471
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:44,820
Ouch!

472
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,620
What?

473
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,780
Ouch!

474
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,400
I don't want to do it anymore.

475
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,000
Alright.

476
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,740
I can run now.

477
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,840
Let's go.

478
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,140
I can't do it anymore.

479
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,620
It's useless to go.

480
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,980
Let's go home.

481
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,000
Huh?

482
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,840
Wait.

483
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,940
Just leave me alone!

484
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,700
Huh?

485
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,220
What's wrong with you, Haruyama?

486
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Haruyama?

487
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,660
I'm not Haruyama.

488
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,180
What?

489
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,720
I'm not a violinist, a pianist, or an exorcist.

490
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,440
So, I'm going back to Tokyo.

491
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,260
to Tokyo.

492
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,740
Haruyama.

493
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,660
I told you I'm not Haruyama!

494
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:25,600
I told you.

495
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,460
Hey, what are you doing?

496
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,340
What's wrong?

497
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:29,920
What's wrong?

498
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,900
I give up.

499
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,560
I'm sorry.

500
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,320
I'm sorry.

501
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,420
I won't do it anymore.

502
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:34,900
I'm sorry.

503
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,740
Ouch!

504
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,780
You idiot!

505
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:39,920
What?

506
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,040
Liar!

507
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,540
Liar!

508
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,660
What's wrong?

509
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,760
Calm down.

510
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,840
Take a deep breath.

511
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,720
Take a deep breath.

512
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,660
Do you have a stomachache?

513
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,420
I'm sorry.

514
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,460
*sigh*

515
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,400
I can't do anything about it anymore.

516
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,100
I've become a weird old man.

517
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,240
Huh?

518
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,760
I don't care anymore.

519
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,980
I'm pissed off, damn it!

520
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,420
*cough*

521
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,500
*cough*

522
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,220
*cough*

523
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,540
Don't worry.

524
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:19,400
*cough*

525
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,420
I'm with you.

526
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:21,860
Huh?

527
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,300
*cough*

528
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,100
*cough*

529
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,340
Don't worry. You can do it if you try.

530
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,760
*cough*

531
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,120
Take it easy.

532
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,860
And use the powers of the heavens to do your best, Haruyama.

533
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,040
*cough*

534
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,420
*cough*

535
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,040
Once you've decided to do it,

536
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,240
throw it out.

537
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,540
Don't lose it!

538
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,540
Okay?

539
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,020
Got it?

540
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,860
Y-Yes.

541
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,720
Alright.

542
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,440
*cough*

543
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,560
I'll definitely,

544
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,380
definitely,

545
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,660
take the Manbaken away from him!

546
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:10,760
*pant*

547
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,360
*pant*

548
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,980
*pant*

549
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,140
*pant*

550
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,380
Watch out!

551
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,380
*pant*

552
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,360
*pant*

553
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,300
*pant*

554
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,000
Where's the Wingy?

555
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,520
Where's the Wingy?

556
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,380
*pant*

557
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,680
*pant*

558
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,640
*pant*

559
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,120
*pant*

560
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,240
*pant*

561
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,960
Where is he?

562
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,580
Where is he?

563
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,020
Eh, uh...

564
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,120
Over here...

565
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,340
No, not here.

566
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:27,720
*pant*

567
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,860
Don't you dare to think this is a real Wingy.

568
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,520
Look through the data in your own devices.

569
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,520
The name of the reservation is Haruyama.

570
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,260
*pant*

571
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,120
I'm not letting a Wingy go!

572
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,460
*pant*

573
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,380
*pant*

574
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:49,380
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E

575
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,180
N-No way!

576
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,000
Haruyama-san!

577
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,980
Haruyama Kazumi-san, please tell us what you think about what you just said!

578
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,380
I'm very nervous.

579
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,540
Haruyama Kazumi-san, you have the confidence to win the competition.

580
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,620
You just have to do your best.

581
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,960
Haruyama?

582
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,180
You...

583
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,060
Ah, wait!

584
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,760
Hey, who are you?

585
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,460
I'm the scum of Manba Prefecture!

586
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,340
What?

587
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:17,580
What?

588
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,920
I'm Kobuhei Hayashiya from Rakugo!

589
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,080
Where's Kobuhei?

590
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,120
He went that way.

591
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,000
Kobuhei, look!

592
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,600
There he is!

593
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,340
Sorry, I'll take this sword!

594
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,080
Ryoma-san, are you okay?

595
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,260
Damn it! Wait!

596
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,300
What?

597
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,840
Are you running away?

598
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,940
I just...

599
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,720
Wait!

600
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,580
Wait!

601
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,020
Wait!

602
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,500
Wait!

603
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,980
You fool!

604
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,460
What?

605
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,260
You've been tricked by me!

606
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,040
Damn it!

607
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,240
I've been tricked a lot!

608
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Ryo-san, are you okay?

609
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,340
I'll return your sword here to you.

610
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,380
Ryo-san, are you okay?

611
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,040
I'll return your sword here to you.

612
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,340
I'll return your sword here to you.

613
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,860
I'll return your sword here to you.

614
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll return your sword here to you.

615
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,420
I'll return your sword here to you.

616
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,080
I'll return your sword here to you.

617
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,280
No!

618
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,800
No!

619
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:06,880
No!

620
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,760
No!

621
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,120
Then return it!

622
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,820
None sincerely honest.

623
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:09,400
None sincerely honest.

624
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,540
Humans to know.

625
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,180
People are sometimes not honest, aren't they?

626
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,520
Hmm.

627
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,060
Hmm.

628
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,620
I see, I see. Ryo-san finally became a little more like a man.

629
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,380
I bet he's really right.

630
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
He's got a lot of tricks up his sleeve.

631
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,080
No way!

632
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,060
The Takarazuka anniversary?

633
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,040
The Takarazuka anniversary? That's more than 4 months ago!

634
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,960
The Sagi-Shi is quiet.

635
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,800
The Takarazuka anniversary in June?

636
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,640
The 60th anniversary of the anniversary?

637
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,500
Yeah! Then it's the Hasureba sword!

638
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,840
You tricked me!

639
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,840
I didn't!

640
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,540
It so happens that the Hasureba sword was in your pocket!

641
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,620
No, it's not that...

642
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,060
Well, that's just how it is...

643
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:10,360
Get all the guards at the entrance!

644
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,120
Hurry!

645
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,080
Yes, sir!

646
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:16,860
The Takarazuka anniversary has begun!

647
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,680
Ah! Here he is!

648
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,240
Li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-lii-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li

649
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,580
The Sagi-Shi is not a normal police officer!

650
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,200
I knew it, Ryo!

651
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,680
You're trying to trick the criminal.

652
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,520
But then again...

653
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,620
Things are getting weird.

654
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,820
He escaped!

655
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,620
Why would Ryo run away?

656
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,680
Ryo-san!

657
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,000
Good-bye!

658
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,460
You little moron!

659
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,940
-Sage! -It's Hariyama!

660
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,120
What? Shit!

661
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,540
Wait, you bastard!

662
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,260
You should pay 120 yen for buying rice balls!

663
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,660
Pay the money!

664
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,800
I'll pay the next bonus!

665
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,860
You bastard!

666
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,920
The End

667
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,600
as if someone was calling me

668
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,140
I walked while looking back

669
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,020
My mom was holding my hand

670
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:33,480
I felt something strange at that time

671
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,080
So I took the arcade tile

672
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,200
and put it in a black place

673
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,320
I walked

674
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,920
Everyone was a child at one time

675
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,640
but everyone forgot

676
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,060
A politician with a great face

677
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,640
and a blue aunt above their eyes

678
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,940
Look up

679
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,060
at that corner

680
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,620
You'll see everyone

681
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,220
Everyone

682
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:12,560
Let's go!

683
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,380
There's a turtle over there

684
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,200
There must be a turtle

685
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,360
Everyone come to our town

686
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,420
Thank you!

687
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,560
11/11 is the battery day?

688
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,580
If you write it in kanji, it looks like + and - The

689
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,180
show is held on the day of the battery I

690
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,660
don't know what it is, but

691
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,480
I'll always work hard for luxury goods

692
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,980
Next time

693
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,860
The final battle

694
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,580
I'll look forward to it!

695
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,900
There's a turtle over there

696
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,740
There must be a turtle

697
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,760
Everyone come to our town

698
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,820
Thank you!
