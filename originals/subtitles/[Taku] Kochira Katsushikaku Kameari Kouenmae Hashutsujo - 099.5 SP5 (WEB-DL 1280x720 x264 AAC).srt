Is that you, Chief Special Investigation Officer Chonmage Deka?

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,260
I have no grudge against you, but could you look at me for a while?

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,700
W-What!

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,080
So much in there, huh?

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,600
We can't do nothing about it, scent-mailer Tiger Dekasan.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,180
Who are you?

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,920
Whaaa!

14
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,620
What're you doing?!

15
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,440
Hope!

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,700
prepare yourself!

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,260
Roquette Kingdom!

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,760
This time they're all out of the way!

20
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,280
Stand up, you special detective.

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,360
I will avenge you.

Daihard 2: The Lowest Battle on the Land

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:52,440
You are so talented.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,960
You are so talented.

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,020
You should grow up soon.

26
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,540
Chief.

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,780
Good morning.

28
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,380
Good morning.

29
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,080
Oh, it's a cactus.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,200
Did you start growing cactus?

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,960
I got it from Hiromi on my birthday.

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,040
Is it a gift from your daughter?

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,240
I guess so.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,420
What is this smell?

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,380
As expected of you, Chief.

36
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,640
It smells good.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,340
Oh, this is a pine mushroom.

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,580
This is a crab.

39
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,620
What?

40
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,560
Oh, it's amazing.

41
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,260
It's a crab and pine mushroom.

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,740
What happened to so many?

43
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,560
Dad sent me.

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,500
But I can't eat them all by myself.

45
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,360
So I give them to you.

46
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,100
These are my gifts.

47
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,680
I thought it would be better to eat them together.

48
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,260
You guys are really good people.

49
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,860
I'm so happy to have good friends.

50
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,440
Don't cry.

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,240
I haven't eaten anything here before the holiday.

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,140
When you finish your work, let's eat together.

53
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,060
Then let's have a hot pot.

54
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,260
Hot pot?

55
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,220
It's luxurious to have a hot pot with a pine mushroom and a crab.

56
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,820
Let's invite Honda and Maria and have a hot pot party.

57
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,460
Sounds good.

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,020
If it's decided, I'll go and tell them.

59
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,780
Hey, Ryo.

60
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,140
I'm so excited for this kind of time.

61
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,360
I wonder if pine mushrooms and crabs are okay like this.

62
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,740
Yeah.

63
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,500
That's a lot.

64
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,280
I'll eat and eat and eat tonight.

65
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,580
I bought Chinese cabbage and green onion.

66
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,720
I bought tofu and shirataki.

67
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,820
I bought konbu and chicken.

68
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,080
I borrowed a pot, a chicken dish and ponzu from Ryo.

69
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,020
You borrowed it?

70
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
You're like a thief.

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,420
I'm sorry. It's a day off.

72
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,220
It can't be helped.

73
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,720
Then boil the hot pot and take the soup with the konbu.

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,080
Okay.

75
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,260
By the way, Ryo.

76
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,860
What did you prepare?

77
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,360
I didn't prepare anything.

78
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,300
Idiot!

79
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,320
Why are you saying that to Honda?

80
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,100
I'm a human being in this depot.

81
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,100
I won't let anyone who doesn't give anything to the pot.

82
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,680
Don't be so mean.

83
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,420
I was looking forward to lunch.

84
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,980
If you want to eat, bring the ingredients.

85
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,300
Okay.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,620
I'll bring them.

87
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,200
Okay.

88
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,400
It's very good.

89
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,940
Please take에

90
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,880
I don't have money.

91
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,920
No?

92
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,160
I don't have money.

93
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,220
Don't you want to eat?

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,820
You don't eat.

95
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,140
You don't eat.

96
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,320
This is all.

97
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,740
You don't have money.

98
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:40,960
I don't have money.

99
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,320
You don't drink up.

100
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,160
No money.

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,480
He's a genius!

102
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
A cactus.

103
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,940
I don't have any blue ones, so I'll take them.

104
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
A frog!

105
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,240
I'll take this one, too.

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,760
You're late, Ryotsu.

107
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,820
Sorry to keep you waiting!

108
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,380
Ryotsu, did you bring the ingredients?

109
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,580
Of course.

110
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,020
Here you are.

111
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,860
What is that?

112
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,520
I got it from the pachinko store.

113
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,480
No, it's not that.

114
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,140
I can see something in it.

115
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,120
It's a frog.

116
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,360
You're in trouble because of this.

117
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,560
Frogs are on the menu at the Izakaya.

118
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,380
What are you doing?

119
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:39,980
It's a dark pot.

120
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,620
A dark pot?

121
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,120
I put it in, so I'll take it.

122
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,560
A frog?

123
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,280
You put it in?

124
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,920
You told me that you don't need to put anything in it.

125
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,900
Well, I did, but...

126
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,560
Then there is no problem.

127
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,860
You didn't put anything else in it, did you?

128
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,100
Don't worry.

129
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,920
You can eat it because it's a pachinko-based product.

130
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,400
But...

131
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,680
Well, you ate it, you ate it.

132
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,760
It's the beginning of the dark pot party.

133
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,640
It can't be helped.

134
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,980
Then, let's eat in order.

135
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,660
Starting with Maria.

136
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,040
Okay.

137
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,600
What's wrong?

138
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,060
The rule of the dark pot is that you must eat the food that you put the chopsticks on at least once.

139
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,040
I understand.

140
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,240
It's sweet and delicious!

141
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,340
I didn't put anything sweet in it.

142
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,700
Then that's the pineapple can I put in it.

143
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,540
I'm glad.

144
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,720
Okay, next. Nakagawa.

145
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,780
Y- yes.

146
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:39,980
Here you go.

147
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,040
Oh, this is a pine mushroom. It's delicious.

148
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,600
Reiko-san, this is the best!

149
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,780
I'm glad, Kei-chan.

150
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,480
He's a lucky guy.

151
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,820
Okay, next is my turn.

152
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,780
What? It's a frog!

153
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,840
Why do I have to eat it?

154
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,560
It's because you're not doing it right every day.

155
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,420
Eat it properly. It's the rule.

156
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,740
I understand.

157
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,340
Okay, next is my turn.

158
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:18,920
Ouch!

159
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,800
Oh, that's a hairy crab.

160
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,680
Yeah, I guess so.

161
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,480
I'm different from Ryotsu and I'm good at doing things on a daily basis.

162
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,620
The hairy crab is kind of...

163
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,000
What is this?

164
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,600
It's no good, Chief. You have to eat it properly.

165
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,020
It looks like a vegetable.

166
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,220
The key is not a vegetable.

167
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,140
Then, how about this?

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,500
Hey, Terai! Turn off the lights!

169
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,600
Ah, yes.

170
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,140
Tch.

171
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,160
Tch. Tch.

172
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,460
Tch. Tch.

173
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:47,720
Tch. Tch. Tch.

174
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,080
Tch. Tch. Tch. Tch.

175
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,740
This is a cactus, isn't it?

176
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,260
I put it in there.

177
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,180
Does the paying for pachinko bring that?

178
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,760
No, I picked it up from there.

179
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,820
What? Ryo, I thought it was in front of thecombination.

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,100
Ah, I see.

181
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,940
It's not good, Chief.

182
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,240
It's not good?

183
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,060
Cactus is a proper food in Mexico.

184
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,760
It's not good.

185
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,620
-Not that... -Nakagawa, enough!

186
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,300
Ryotsu! You put my important Saboten in the pot!

187
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,140
Eh? No way! This Saboten is...

188
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,820
The Saboten that the chief gave to Hiromi!

189
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,740
I-I'm sorry, chief! I didn't know at all!

190
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,160
C-Chief...

191
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,080
"The Adolf Dinosaur"

192
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,740
It was an idiot!

193
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,300
The public only included Chiyoko one of the today's specials!

194
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
You are fired!

195
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,300
You fell in love with Saboten just by putting it in the pot?

196
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,540
Rather than somebody who worked together for years,

197
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,280
raelions are more important than subordinates!

198
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,260
That's right!

199
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,240
Hey...

200
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,860
Ah! I get it now!

201
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,700
I'm sorry to work under a boss like you!

202
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,440
Stop it as of today!

203
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,660
-What? -What?

204
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,920
No way...

205
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,760
Ryo!

206
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,300
-Senpai! -Ryo!

207
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,600
Senpai!

208
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,720
Ryo, the boss is also reflecting on what you said.

209
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,900
He said that if you lower your head, you can shave off your neck.

210
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,660
But he said that's fine.

211
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,020
So...

212
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,000
You're too late.

213
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,420
Senpai, please don't be so stubborn...

214
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,100
Shut up!

215
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,520
You're a boss who's cuter than your subordinates.

216
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,000
You should lower your head!

217
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,920
Stop it!

218
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,220
Ryo!

219
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,380
If you take the police officer from Ryo, what will remain?

220
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,960
What?

221
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,740
Ryo, if you become the boss, I'll quit the police too!

222
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,780
Maria, I appreciate your feelings, but this is my problem.

223
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,360
Anyway, I'm going to bid bye to Hashizoto as of today.

224
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,180
Have a good time, everyone.

225
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,040
-Ryo, Senpai... -Senpai...

226
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,320
Senpai, Ryo.

227
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,080
...

228
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,600
drugs

229
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:26,960
What's the last thing that will remain when

230
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,300
I take the police officer from Ryo?

231
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,820
What's this?

232
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,920
"Love the sea and protect justice."

233
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,960
Who read this? Poseidon.

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,500
I'll put it in my pants.

235
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,300
I'll put it in my pants.

236
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,480
I'm the captain of the police force on the water.

237
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm the sea's Dozaemon.

238
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,480
A mischievous Yashiki Kappo is the trademark of Dolphin.

239
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,340
It's you, as I thought.

240
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,940
It's been a while, Ryotsu.

241
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,700
You're always so long.

242
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,900
By the way, what are you doing here?

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,120
I heard you became the head of the park before the launch.

244
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,000
You're pretty quick-witted.

245
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,000
There's no place to go or stop.

246
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,340
Well, well.

247
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,860
Then come to the special police station.

248
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,960
Bang!

249
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,060
To the special police station!

250
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,620
You guys live in a place like this?

251
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,960
It's like a hotel.

252
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,020
The 5th floor is now a dormitory.

253
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,660
Dormitory?

254
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,080
How many people are in the special police station?

255
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,620
Six people so far.

256
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,640
Six people?

257
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,720
Only six people live here?

258
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,040
This is the Yua-buro.

259
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,120
What?

260
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,040
This is the sauna.

261
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,820
There's even a sauna?

262
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,100
There's also a game center and a karaoke room.

263
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,060
Oh, right.

264
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,760
Not only this floor, but there's also a movie theater.

265
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,320
It's a big difference from Niko Niko Ryo.

266
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,500
We special police officers are the elite among the elite.

267
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:21,160
You don't look like an elite.

268
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,100
You don't look like an elite.

269
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,160
You don't look like an elite.

270
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,220
This is the training room.

271
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,780
There should be a

272
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:49,160
Special police officer,

273
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,580
and one black eyed girl.

274
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,900
The Sovereign.

275
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,380
I'm coming, Sanjiro.

276
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,080
Ryoji,

277
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,180
it's been a long time.

278
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,000
Why are you grabbing the door?

279
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,280
What's the matter?

280
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,500
T- this music is --

281
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,100
Moonlight Power

282
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,960
It's them again.

283
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:19,120
The power of this powerhouse.

284
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,140
Envision the power of this powerhouse.

285
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,300
I'll show you the power of the Moonlight Deca.

286
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,400
Big Dinosaur, you're too fast!

287
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,380
Sorry, it was the short version.

288
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
Let me explain.

289
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,160
The Moonlight Deca can show 7 special abilities by changing its costume.

290
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,200
Then I...

291
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,580
Hey...

292
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,940
The Moonlight is my energy!

293
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,560
The master of the Moonlight, Moonlight Deca!

294
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,640
I'm also Venus Deca!

295
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,300
I'm back, Kenzan!

296
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,760
Why can't you guys appear normally?

297
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,300
I'm going home, after all!

298
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,200
Wait!

299
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,360
I really need your help.

300
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,020
Let go of me! I can't be of any use to you!

301
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,800
The Special Police Department is being targeted.

302
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,320
The Tiger Deca, the Mustang Deca, and the Chief's Chonmage Deca are all in the hospital,

303
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,500
with serious injuries.

304
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,380
Then I can't stay here.

305
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,400
I see.

306
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,260
Can you help me?

307
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,140
What?

308
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,000
I knew it, Ryotsu.

309
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
I knew you'd say that.

310
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,520
I didn't say that!

311
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,660
Are you listening to me?

312
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm going home!

313
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,780
Then,

314
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,380
will you bow your head to Chief Ohara and go back to the station?

315
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,240
I can't do that!

316
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,540
Then, go to the Special Police Department.

317
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,460
We'll welcome you.

318
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,840
I got it.

319
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,400
I'll be in trouble for the rest of my life.

320
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,560
I see.

321
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,240
We'll have to organize the moving luggage today.

322
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,300
We'll greet the Chief tomorrow.

323
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,540
What?

324
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,720
Chief's Chonmage Deca is in the hospital, isn't he?

325
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,360
He's a new chief.

326
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:01,820
What?

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,200
Did he get a new job from the head office?

328
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,800
No.

329
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,080
He got a job from my department.

330
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,080
The criminal's research rate is 100%.

331
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,260
Me too.

332
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,020
Maybe it's a dolphin.

333
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,460
Maybe it's a moon.

334
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,520
He's the one who set up the gold-stone tower that couldn't be accomplished.

335
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,380
Who is he?

336
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,360
You know him well.

337
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,460
I know him well, too.

338
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,980
I see.

339
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,700
Good morning, everyone.

340
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,740
Chief.

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,980
Good morning.

342
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,640
What?

343
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,620
Is Ryotsu late again?

344
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,500
That idiot.

345
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,480
Well...

346
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,100
Oh.

347
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,580
I remembered he's casually resignation.

348
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,780
Chief, please forgive him.

349
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,000
And make him work here again.

350
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
I'll do.

351
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,300
What?

352
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,000
You can be quiet because he isn't here.

353
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,800
This is how the old department should be.

354
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

355
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,560
Ah...

356
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,120
The End

357
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,600
Good morning.

358
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,540
Chief, I've brought the Chief of Police.

359
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,400
The Chief says, "Good job!"

360
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,840
Ah! It's Damon!

361
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,580
He says, "Don't abandon me!"

362
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,020
What did you say? Hey, what on earth is going on?

363
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,000
You're the one who's in trouble.

364
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,240
When I was working as a special detective as a pigeon-puppet department,

365
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,200
at that time, I used pigeons to watch over Chief Ohara,

366
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,900
and I made him collect the money he was losing.

367
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,640
Well, well.

368
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,640
At that time, Chief Damon used the techniques you used to collect information,

369
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,540
and used the rich capital of a nobat, of hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars,

370
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,480
to become a subordinate and to collect information

371
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,060
that was more powerful than the police.

372
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,600
So, I've created a network of subordinates.

373
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,840
Thanks to that...

374
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,340
Ah! It's a bird! Someone, catch it!

375
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,820
The End

376
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,680
The End

377
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,600
The End

378
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,040
The End

379
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,120
The End

380
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,940
The End

381
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,260
The End

382
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,600
The End

383
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:32,860
The End

384
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:32,920
The End

385
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:35,780
The End

386
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,080
The End

387
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,680
The End

388
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,580
The End

389
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:39,620
The End

390
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:39,780
The End

391
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,500
The End

392
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,160
The End

393
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,360
The End

394
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,100
The End

395
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,580
What did you say?

396
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,580
Now, he even has a beautiful wife and has a self-sufficient life.

397
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,780
Isn't that amazing, Dengemon?

398
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,600
It's like he's made a name for himself because of me.

399
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,860
He said, "Don't make it easy for you to come."

400
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,700
What? With the dove's body?

401
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,020
Stop it, Ryotsu.

402
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,360
It hurts! Stop it, you idiot! Stop it! Stop it!

403
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,020
He said, "I won't forgive your grudge."

404
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,940
I understand. I understand, but stop it! Stop it!

405
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,620
You guys! You're making such a big face for that dove!

406
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,280
Don't you understand?

407
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,560
Even if it's a dove, the chief is still the chief.

408
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,020
Even if it's a special detective, we're going to Miyazuka, too.

409
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,180
What? What? You're really good at understanding things.

410
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,680
Mr. Ryotsu!

411
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,320
Huh?

412
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,000
W-What?

413
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,780
The chief said this.

414
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,340
This?

415
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,300
"We're going to hire you as the teacher of the Hato Poppo, so keep it in your mind."

416
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,760
What? Are you kidding me?

417
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,900
You're not going to watch under that dove!

418
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,820
Ryotsu!

419
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,420
Let go, you big dolphin!

420
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,760
If you ruin the mood of the chief of Dengemon here, you won't be able to stay in the dorms.

421
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,600
You have to be patient here.

422
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,200
That's good.

423
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,120
Gah...

424
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,600
Dengemon...

425
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,980
It's the man who made me mad!

426
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,720
I'm going to show him how good I am!

427
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,480
Mr. Ryotsu!

428
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,760
Mr. Ryotsu!

429
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,440
I'm so proud of you!

430
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:31,460
I'm so proud of you, too!

431
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,420
Now, listen to this.

432
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,600
You can do whatever you want.

433
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:38,840
That's right.

434
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,860
I'm happy for you, too!

435
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,320
This is the best choice!

436
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,540
We're in a coffin!!

437
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:43,860
Damn!

438
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,480
*Gunshot*

439
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,260

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,480

*Gunshot*

460
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,020
I am Champion!

461
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,360
I am Champion!

462
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,660
Rocket Fueler!

463
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,540
Rocket Fueler!

464
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,080
I am Champion!

465
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,120
Rocket Fueler!

466
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,860
Rocket Fueler!

467
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:31,960
Rocket Fueler!

468
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,580
I want to make a new dojo,

469
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,000
He's much better than Kaipan, Dolphin, and Gekkou Deka.

470
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,280
Boss!

471
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,760
Hmph.

472
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,300
I won't forget the grudge of losing to Kaipan's pervert move and being put in jail for five years.

473
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,520
I'm the same.

474
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,540
I used the shark to revenge Dolphin and the dolphins.

475
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,120
I'm the same.

476
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,020
I used this transformation move to defeat Gekkou Deka.

477
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,500
They're a reliable bunch.

478
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,280
Now I'm thinking of a way to take down those three detectives at once.

479
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,860
Until then, keep burning the flame of revenge.

480
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,100
Emergency! Emergency!

481
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,900
Special agents, please gather in the strategy room.

482
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,420
I'm Hato Poppotekami Nanai, Ryozu Kankichi.

483
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:30,980
I've arrived!

484
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,960
The pistol gang is standing in the way of the financial company.

485
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,680
There was just a request for a special agent to come with us.

486
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,320
Where did the criminal stand in the way?

487
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,080
Wow! It's all set up!

488
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,400
It's so high-tech!

489
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,760
This is the culprit.

490
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,220
He's standing in the way of this building's fifth floor.

491
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,320
There's a river. I'll go.

492
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,980
No, if it's the fifth floor, we can enter through the sky.

493
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,420
Leave it to us.

494
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,960
This is a land case. It's my turn.

495
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,400
The chief said if we have Gekkou Deka and Hato Poppotekami Nanai,

496
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,640
the case will be solved easily.

497
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,300
All right. Hato Poppotekami Nanai.

498
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,240
Let's go.

499
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:49,540
Team Hato Poppotekami Nanai

500
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,100
The

501
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,760
The

502
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:51,800
The

503
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,040
The

504
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,100
The

505
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,160
The

506
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,400
The

507
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,540
The

508
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:52,560
The

509
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:52,800
The

510
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:52,860
The

511
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,140
The

512
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,220
The

513
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,240
The

514
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,620
The

515
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:53,640
The

516
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,460
That was a word in a long sentence!

517
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,660
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

518
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,260
Give the money to me!

519
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,420
Stand up. Go!

520
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,840
What is this?

521
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,220
You fool!

522
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,140
You idiot! Are you going to make me a scarecrow?!

523
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,640
He's going to jump in!

524
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,700
Let him go!

525
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,840
Roger!

526
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,020
You idiot!

527
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
I did it!

528
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,420
The Yamauchi Family

529
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:00,820
The Yamauchi Family

530
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,660
The Yamauchi Family

531
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,420
The Yamauchi Family

532
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:09,620
The Special Investigation Department is very active...

533
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,360
I wonder if he's worried about Ryo-chan.

534
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,420
Don't be stupid!

535
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,540
Who cares about him?!

536
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,200
But, Chief...

537
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,260
If we keep this up, Senpai will keep getting involved with the Special Investigation Department.

538
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,660
That's right.

539
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,380
We're getting along pretty well.

540
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,220
Y-You think so?

541
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,220
I just remembered something.

542
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,080
I'm going out.

543
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,380
Damn it!

544
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,980
He's using me to make him a scarecrow!

545
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,260
He's giving me a lesson!

546
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:55,980
What's going on?!

547
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,420
The snake's legs are loose, and he's hanging wider!

548
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:01,880
Don't be overreacting!

549
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,160
Junji!

550
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,600
That really was ailsome!

551
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,460
Just now you were overreacting, so I have to apologize!

552
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,220
Then do me a favor and apologize.

553
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,140
I was not exactly overreacting at all.

554
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,340
But I'm not sure I'm not gonna make a change yet.

555
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,220
It may be that if I apologize, I might not be able to get out of here.

556
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,580
What are you doing here?

557
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,880
Well, I...

558
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,260
If you want to go back to the office, I can talk to you.

559
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,040
Who said that?

560
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,020
The chief of the special police department is kind to his subordinates, unlike the chief of another office.

561
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,560
What?

562
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,720
I'm relieved that the troublemaker is gone.

563
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,260
Oh, really? That's good.

564
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,440
I can't go back to the office, so I have to make myself comfortable.

565
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,480
Hey, chief of the special police department. We've arrived.

566
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,200
Hey, chief of the special police department. We've arrived.

567
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,820
Hey, chief of the special police department. We've arrived.

568
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,160
Why are you in a hurry?

569
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,540
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

570
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,520
What are you doing?

571
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,660
I'm sorry. I won't do anything to the chief.

572
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,940
What's with that wing-waving pigeon?

573
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,640
It's the chief's wife.

574
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,460
What? Are you married?

575
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:50,760
Did you get married?

576
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,960
Why were they fighting?

577
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,080
The chief had lipstick on his body

578
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,140
with another female's.

579
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,480
Oh, the one in the car?

580
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,280
The chief was still

581
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:26,920
under the command of his wife.

582
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,500
That's a good thing.

583
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,840
The boss is a troublemaker.

584
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,740
The kids are all over the place.

585
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,500
In this world where

586
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,080
I don't know what to believe,

587
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,260
I believed that the chief and Ryo

588
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,740
were the best pair.

589
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,440
The fool and me?

590
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,360
Yes, they often fight.

591
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,980
But to be so serious

592
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,280
about it,

593
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,900
even the parents don't care.

594
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,560
I'm sure Ryo wants to go back.

595
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,360
He can't help it.

596
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:03,920
Really?

597
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,340
Yes, he's just being stubborn.

598
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,360
Why don't you tell him

599
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,280
that the chief is here?

600
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:15,900
Oh.

601
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,360
He's a good-for-nothing.

602
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,000
I'll tell him.

603
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,680
He's a good-for-nothing.

604
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:43,720
He's a good-for-nothing.

605
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:43,760
He's a good-for-nothing.

606
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:43,860
That's all right.

607
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,340
Do you want to kill me?

608
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,480
I want to kill you, too.

609
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,260
I'll kill you.

610
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,340
No, I'm not.

611
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:47,920
I'm not.

612
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,380
I beg you.

613
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,020
Oh, if you don't want to, it's fine.

614
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,840
I'll just show this picture to your wife.

615
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

616
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,960
I beg you to spare me that.

617
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,560
I beg you for a lifetime.

618
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,940
Then, you'll admit me as a special detective?

619
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

620
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,160
Yes, I understand.

621
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,480
Good.

622
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,760
From now on, you can be my subordinate.

623
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

624
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,820
That's a little...

625
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,340
Oh?

626
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,500
Then, from now on, your wife's...

627
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

628
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,560
I understand.

629
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,380
I'll do as you say, so please forgive me.

630
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,500
Good.

631
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,700
From now on, I'll be the special detective behind you.

632
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

633
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,000
This is the Katsushika-show.

634
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,040
I'll lure the people here and do it at once.

635
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:36,780
Yeah!

636
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,940
You're quite bold to be on the police show, boss.

637
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,840
Revenge is better in a flashy way.

638
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,340
Now, let's go.

639
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,620
Yasashii and Yumiya!

640
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,760
You're right.

641
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,100
I thought we'd forget about you two.

642
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,440
You can't do anything to me.

643
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:58,960
I've always been like this.

644
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,080
Come on, yuki!

645
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,000
You have to do it!

646
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,240
I'll help.

647
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:08,980
Oh!

648
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:09,760
Yes, yes, yes.

649
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,760
No!

650
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,420
Don't kick him!

651
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,480
What's wrong, Yuki?

652
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,800
I'm in a bad mood, or I'm not laughing.

653
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,140
You said you got a head start.

654
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,460
Oh, yeah.

655
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,100
I don't mind, but the people at the police station are not feeling well.

656
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,400
Or something like that.

657
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,220
You're the most boring person out there.

658
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,200
No, that's...

659
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,540
That's true.

660
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,460
I got it.

661
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,660
I'll contact the special police and go back to Ryosu.

662
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:46,560
What?

663
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,240
What?

664
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,140
No way!

665
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,940
Why are the police so good?

666
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,160
No way!

667
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,840
We're in trouble.

668
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,040
The sun's water and sand came out from the roof of the first floor.

669
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,760
What?

670
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,320
Ohara.

671
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:11,960
Yes.

672
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,540
Raise your hand.

673
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,340
What?

674
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,400
What are you doing?

675
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,640
Oh, if you don't do as I say, the wind will blow through the

676
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,660
We just got on the Katsushika show.

677
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:29,820
Who are you?

678
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,720
What are you doing in the Katsushika show?

679
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,180
Me?

680
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,240
Did you forget?

681
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,940
You...

682
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,300
You're...

683
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,760
You're...

684
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:43,980
You're...

685
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,540
You're...

686
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:45,920
You're...

687
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,220
You're that weenie.

688
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,800
That's you!

689
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,500
That's you!

690
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,260
It's you.

691
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,960
You're Tewi...

692
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:52,760
I want your name...

693
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:52,940
Oh, wait.

694
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:53,680
Oh!

695
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,200
How dare you。

696
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,460
Oh, wait.

697
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:55,780
You're being passing the king's order.

698
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,860
I'm going to see what you're talking about.

699
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:57,960
What is it?

700
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,640
I'm going to ask the king.

701
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:02,980
What are you talking about!

702
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,220
Hey, wait a minute.

703
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,540
What's this thing?

704
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,540
This is the Katsushika show?

705
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:12,600
Do you know what the Katsushika show is?

706
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,080
What?

707
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,560
Jack?

708
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,800
This is the culprit of the C-Jack I arrested.

709
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,580
Aniko!

710
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,280
This woman was arrested for our brilliant transformation.

711
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,600
The fake spirit.

712
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,420
Kaipan.

713
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,320
Dolphin.

714
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,300
Eko.

715
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,800
Long time no see.

716
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,180
It was our fault to kill the Chiefs of the Chonmage.

717
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,260
What?

718
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,380
Look at that!

719
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,140
Chief!

720
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,240
The Chief is the Chief!

721
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,180
If you want the life of the hostages,

722
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,020
the gold of the

723
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,400
That's all.

724
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:54,980
I'm done for.

725
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,740
The Chief is the hostages.

726
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,680
I'm done with you!

727
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,200
I'm done with you!

728
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,240
You're all dead.

729
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,360
Chief, let's all step in.

730
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,120
Yes, sir.

731
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,940
Yes, sir.

732
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,660
Yes, sir.

733
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,720
No, the culprit is asking you to come in alone.

734
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,420
You should go alone.

735
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,140
What?

736
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,020
The Chief and I have other jobs.

737
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,640
I understand.

738
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,200
We are enough.

739
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,400
Let's go.

740
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,860
Yes, sir.

741
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,200
Damn.

742
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,440
The hall was filled with water.

743
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,280
No way we can get through.

744
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,580
Kaipan,

745
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,280
I colored

746
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,520
Minoshiro's 300 million Jewish coins.

747
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,980
Thank you.

748
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,860
How dare you say that of Nakagawa Group?

749
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,080
But why isn't Ryo here?

750
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,900
He has other jobs.

751
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,960
He has others?

752
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,940
They say the Chief is in danger.

753
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,300
I'll go join Ryo.

754
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,740
I'm going.

755
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,120
I don't have time.

756
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,060
-Let's go, everyone. -Okay.

757
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,640
Here they are. They're coming from the moon.

758
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,120
Open the breakthrough port.

759
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,540
Let's go, Venus.

760
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,580
-Let's start the operation. -Roger.

761
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,260
I am champion!

762
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,360
Missile launch!

763
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,660
What?

764
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,160
Moon Decker. Venus Decker.

765
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,220
Moon Decker. Venus Decker.

766
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,820
It's okay. We're safe somehow.

767
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,480
Leave this to me.

768
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,740
We're going to enter from the underground tunnel.

769
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:10,940
What?

770
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,920
We've successfully entered.

771
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,200
We're here, Dolphin!

772
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,660
I did it.

773
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,820
Eat this fish!

774
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,360
I won't let you!

775
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,220
Fish!

776
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,780
I can see through your attack.

777
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,400
I saw the cute dolphin under your hand being the prey of the shark.

778
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,780
I saw it.

779
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,600
There's nothing I can do but watch.

780
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,680
Stop it!

781
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,620
Bring back more fish.

782
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,020
Since Dengenbo gave 1 million,

783
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:11,340
Just by collecting 100,000 miles, I can get 100,000 yen in a blink of an eye.

784
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,340
Ryo, what are you doing?

785
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,780
What are you doing?

786
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,840
Senpai, why aren't you coming?

787
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,780
The chief is a hostage.

788
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,280
It doesn't matter if you're a boss or not.

789
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,100
It has nothing to do with me.

790
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,400
What are you talking about?

791
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,500
The chief was involved in the case by telling the chief to lower his head so that he could return to the escape room.

792
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,320
What?

793
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,980
What?

794
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,020
Ryo, please help me.

795
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,940
Ryo.

796
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,080
Please come with us.

797
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,740
I'm relieved that the troublemaker is gone.

798
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,160
You know? I'm in a hurry. Go home.

799
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:51,740
Ryo.

800
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,680
I didn't know you were such a person.

801
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,880
I've let Senpai down.

802
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,700
Let's go home.

803
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,840
Let's rescue the chief by our hands.

804
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,020
Ryo, you idiot.

805
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,960
What's with this kind of attitude?

806
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:11,740
You don't get anything, do you?

807
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,860
Hiromi!

808
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,060
Chief.

809
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:27,680
Hey!

810
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,940
Stop collecting coins!

811
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,780
Tenemon, gather the friends from the inn right away!

812
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,940
Tenemon, gather the friends from the inn right away!

813
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,920
He says he's already prepared.

814
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:37,820
What?

815
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,200
What's that?

816
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,040
Wow! That's amazing, Dengemon!

817
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,100
Alright! Let's go, Dengemon!

818
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,780
Pat-Pot-Potega's...

819
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,320
...Return!

820
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,600
Return!

821
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,880
Dolphin's a jerk.

822
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,600
It's only a matter of time before he becomes a shark.

823
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,000
All we have to do is defeat the big guy and get 300 million yen.

824
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,200
You criminals, get out of here!

825
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,600
Are you scared, you villains?

826
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,220
Ryo Tsukankichi...

827
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,980
No, Pat-Pot-Potega is back!

828
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,040
I don't care! Get rid of him, too!

829
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,280
Get back!

830
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,600
Oh, Pinka!

831
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,300
Pat-Pot-Potega is back!

832
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,920
That's a message from the big guy!

833
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,640
You won't be scared if you get rid of the shark, either!

834
00:38:59,280 --> 00:38:59,880
What?

835
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,280
I see.

836
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,840
Alright, I got it!

837
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,740
What's that?

838
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,700
What?

839
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,120
Stop it!

840
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,620
But...

841
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,040
This is too dangerous!

842
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,460
I'll cover you!

843
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:33,820
What?

844
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:33,960
I'll rip you up!

845
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,300
And this is...

846
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,660
What?

847
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,620
Because this is my gift to you!

848
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:44,640
Where are you going?

849
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,560
You want to shoot me down?

850
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
I don't care.

851
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,760
No, no.

852
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,760
I'm going to...

853
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,280
I knew you would come.

854
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,980
Well, I can't help but cry for you.

855
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,580
Oh, Lord Ryo.

856
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,160
Kaipan Dekka, Gekkou Dekka, Venus Dekka.

857
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,100
We will enter this place by leaving it to Dolphin Dekka and Nakagawa!

858
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,120
Yeah!

859
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,340
Damn you, Lord Ryo.

860
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,180
It's finally my turn.

861
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,160
You're out, pervert!

862
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,720
This is my opponent.

863
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,620
Kaipan Dekka, I will make you pay for waiting for this day.

864
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,800
A man versus a man.

865
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,920
A bare-faced match!

866
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,240
How dare you.

867
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,680
Hey, Kaipan!

868
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,840
Don't touch me.

869
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,940
This is a man versus a man.

870
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,180
A bare-faced match.

871
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,280
What?

872
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,020
What?

873
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,620
It's time to recharge your energy.

874
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,380
I told you to stop with the bananas!

875
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,820
It's a splendid attack.

876
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,960
But if you're a banana,

877
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,940
I'll give you a mask melon.

878
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,340
What are you thinking?

879
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,820
I got one.

880
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,420
I can't let you get away with this.

881
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,540
I'm going to get you, Kaipan.

882
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,500
You're getting away with this?

883
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,440
I said you're going to get away with this.

884
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,840
You have to stop.

885
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,660
All right.

886
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,740
Stop.

887
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,280
Stop.

888
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,680
Stop.

889
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,200
Stop.

890
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,960
Stop.

891
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,300
Stop.

892
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,000
Stop.

893
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,540
Stop.

894
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:50,660
Stop.

895
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:50,900
Stop.

896
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:50,940
Stop.

897
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,740
Stop.

898
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,320
Please subscribe if you like this video!

899
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
What the hell does that mean?

900
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,880
How's this?

901
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,780
I'm defeated!

902
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,400
You should follow me!

903
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,560
Here we go, old fool!

904
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,940
-Chief! -R- Ryoichi!

905
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,880
What did you do with the chief and the criminal?

906
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,100
The culprit... The culprit ran to the roof with Oharu-kun.

907
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,460
The roof...

908
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,460
You're still alive.

909
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,960
You're not the Moon King, you're the Venus.

910
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,960
This woman is dangerous.

911
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,960
You've defeated the Moon King.

912
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,680
This time, I'll stop your breath.

913
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,860
Moonlight Power!

914
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,460
Reika!

915
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,320
Ah, it started again.

916
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,100
Don't look!

917
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,140
Tekumakumayakin, tekumakumayakin!

918
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,200
Become a horizontal rope!

919
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,600
You're just changing your clothes.

920
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,180
Don't look!

921
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,560
Fighting! Moonlight Power!

922
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,120
Let me explain.

923
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,360
By transforming the Moonlight Power into a female pro-wrestler,

924
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,880
you can show incredible strength and technique.

925
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,800
Yippee!

926
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,740
I'll explain myself.

927
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,760
I'll transform into a female pro-wrestler,

928
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,160
and use Rocket Harute to get rid of Sekinen's grudge.

929
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,360
Yippee!

930
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,680
Rocket Harute!

931
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,000
Ah, Moonlight King!

932
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,340
Moonlight King!

933
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,880
He's a guy who can't even speak.

934
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,940
Damn it!

935
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,420
Now, I'll be your opponent, Hato Popo!

936
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,220
Gen'emon!

937
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,740
It's the "Hato Popo" strategy!

938
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,360
What?

939
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,680
What?

940
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,960
Then, it's not Hato Popo,

941
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,460
but Hata Popo!

942
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,120
That's what I was talking about!

943
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,160
All right!

944
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,480
It's too early to be happy!

945
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,180
Huh?

946
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,460
Chief!

947
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,480
Ryousu!

948
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,860
Ryousu Kankichi,

949
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,080
I'm going to pay for this grudge!

950
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,720
The grudge before?

951
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,860
Who are you?

952
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,820
Hey, who are you?

953
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,320
Huh? Who is it?

954
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,640
Who?

955
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,360
A fat Katamura from the summer special!

956
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,920
Yeah, I saw you.

957
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,400
I forgot it, since you're not that impressive.

958
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,440
Thanks to the special detective team,

959
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,080
I met with you in Hidomi.

960
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,840
My brother is still missing!

961
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,020
I'll check this case next time.

962
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,020
It was all because of him!

963
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,740
So that's what it was.

964
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,340
You lost, Ryotsu.

965
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,940
I wonder about that.

966
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,240
Don't do that!

967
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,120
If you get close, he'll die!

968
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,760
Ryotsu!

969
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,920
Can't you hear me? I'll really shoot!

970
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,320
Go ahead, as you wish.

971
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,440
What?

972
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,140
You're a boss who cares about his subordinates more than I do.

973
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:11,980
You don't know what's gonna happen.

974
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,800
Ryotsu!

975
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,280
Alright, go ahead and shoot.

976
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,540
I don't care at all.

977
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,340
Why don't you ask your subordinates to help you, too?

978
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,120
Right, Ryotsu?

979
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,000
What?

980
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:25,420
Ryotsu!

981
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:26,720
Hey!

982
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,380
I won't forgive you!

983
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,060
I won't forgive you!

984
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,740
I won't forgive you!

985
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,360
Ryotsu, calm down!

986
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,860
Shut up! You don't know what's going on!

987
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,320
It's a plan! A plan!

988
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,700
A plan?

989
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,640
You want me to get angry and make him go crazy on purpose?

990
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,660
That's the plan!

991
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,560
I thought he would die.

992
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,680
When did you expect this?

993
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,840
So you were the one who did this.

994
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,040
I did this?

995
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,380
I knew what you're like.

996
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,180
So I knew you would do this.

997
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,720
Ryotsu...

998
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,140
What's wrong, boss?

999
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,780
No matter what, you've come to help me.

1000
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:11,840
Thank you.

1001
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,200
Chief, I'm sorry for being a important sabotage.

1002
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,180
It's okay.

1003
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,600
Then, please return to the station.

1004
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,300
Yes.

1005
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,720
I see.

1006
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,780
Thank you.

1007
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,260
Everyone.

1008
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,740
By the way, Denemon.

1009
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,640
This photo is...

1010
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,280
He said, "Please stop. Please forgive me."

1011
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,080
Don't misunderstand.

1012
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,960
I'll do this.

1013
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,140
Look.

1014
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,120
Hey, Ryotsu.

1015
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:52,340
Yes?

1016
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,420
What was that?

1017
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:55,980
Nothing.

1018
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,840
But why don't you go out today?

1019
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,180
Oh, that's good.

1020
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,700
We're going to say goodbye today.

1021
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:05,540
Okay.

1022
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,720
I'll treat you to a hot pot party.

1023
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,040
Sounds good.

1024
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,900
Then why don't we have a hot pot party?

1025
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,540
Sounds good.

1026
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,780
Idiot!

1027
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,380
This is a joke!

1028
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:17,960
Chief!

1029
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,420
Urgh!
