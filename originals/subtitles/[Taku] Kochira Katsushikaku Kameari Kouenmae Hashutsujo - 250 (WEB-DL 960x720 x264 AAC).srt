00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,240
Tencent Video"

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,420
When you're watching the TV, bright your room and leave it.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,700
Those who have no money, come to me.

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,840
I don't have any, but I worry.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,600
I'm worried about you

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,980
Look at the blue sky

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,960
The white clouds

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,280
I'm sure that one day

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,700
We'll be able to do something

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,260
We'll be able to do something

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,760
We'll be able to do something

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,800
Come to me

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,200
Come to me

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,300
Come to me

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not here

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,540
But don't worry

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,160
Look at the burning

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,020
Look at the burning

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,940
Red light

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,640
Blue clouds

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,280
We'll be able to do something

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,740
We'll be able to do something

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,620
You know it, don't you?

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
You know it, you know it.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,720
If you do, then shut up and follow me!

26
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,600
The Robot

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,240
What a great robot!

28
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,980
Is this the latest type of humanoid robot?

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,820
It moves smoothly.

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,580
In the old days, when you imitated robots...

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,120
Gashin!

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,620
Gashin! Gashin!

33
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,240
That's right.

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,180
The real robot was that one.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,340
That's why.

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,000
It's a great progress.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,280
The study of practicality is also in progress, isn't it?

38
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,460
Yes.

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,440
There are also fire stations that actually work on fire sites.

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,340
In the meantime, it may be time to leave all dangerous work to robots.

41
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,220
The robot officer may have appeared.

42
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,260
There was a robot officer!

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,800
Development 001!

44
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,800
It was a useless robot.

45
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,340
The robot officer is already in trouble.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,980
That's right.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,060
Certainly.

48
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,800
Everyone, be happy!

49
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,180
The latest robot officer will be deployed at this launch site.

50
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,820
Boss! What did you say now?

51
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,200
The latest robot officer will come.

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,180
Development 004.

53
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,340
Why? Aren't you happy?

54
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
I'm not happy!

55
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,340
Anyway, it is like 001.

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,480
The crap of the modern age will come.

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,240
You are naive, Ryotsu.

58
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:14,880
What?

59
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,960
Based on the experience so far,

60
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,920
we have joined 2,000 researchers.

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,360
We have invented 3,000 cutting-edge technologies.

62
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,880
Then,

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,480
something like this?

64
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,920
This time, a car will transform!

65
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,080
Yeah.

66
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,800
"I think it's not a humanoid robot."

67
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,920
"It looks like a great robot is coming this time, Ryo-san."

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,020
"No, I can't be relieved until I see the real thing."

69
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,280
"Don't look down on the real thing, Ryo-tsu."

70
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:59,760
"This is the latest robot model developed by 2000 researchers and 3000 cutting-edge technology, the development 0045 Otsugata."

71
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,460
"Hello, this is the development 0045 Otsugata."

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,760
"How is it? You look surprised and you can't even speak."

73
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,460
"This is..."

74
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,260
"The latest model?"

75
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,860
"It's got a very human-like atmosphere."

76
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,160
"What are you doing?"

77
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,460
"Hey, Ryo-tsu!"

78
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,640
"It's definitely a robot."

79
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,840
"Of course!"

80
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,800
"It's the latest model developed by 2000 researchers and 3000 cutting-edge technology."

81
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,600
"It's the latest model developed by 2000 researchers and 3000 cutting-edge technology."

82
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,340
"It's the latest model developed by 2000 researchers and 3000 cutting-edge technology."

83
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,520
"But the design sense is old."

84
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,860
"What?"

85
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,340
"This design was designed by a thousand famous designers and their maximum number of contracts was put together."

86
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,360
"So to speak, it's the most advanced design in the 21st century."

87
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,400
"It's not something you can put together."

88
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
"The contents must be amazing."

89
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,020
"That's right."

90
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,240
"I'm counting on you, 0045."

91
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,340
"Yes, I'll do my best."

92
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,020
"Senpai, what are you going to do, 0045?"

93
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,240
"If you make me do something wrong, I'll just complain to the director."

94
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,760
"Let's get out of here."

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,700
"No way!"

96
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,240
"I came here to do my job. Please let me do something."

97
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,880
"I got it, I got it."

98
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,160
"It's really human-like."

99
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,400
"It's the latest model after all."

100
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,800
"So, what can you do?"

101
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,700
"Yes, I've memorized all the laws."

102
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,340
"What about the work of the station?"

103
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,960
"No, I've been told that I can learn it on the spot."

104
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,040
"You're really a new officer."

105
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,000
"Hmm."

106
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,260
"Maybe you should think of it as the same as a normal new officer."

107
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,060
"I guess so."

108
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,760
"Alright, I got it."

109
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,640
"I don't know if it's the latest model, but I'll treat it as a new officer here."

110
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,300
"What?"

111
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,880
"Do you have a problem?"

112
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,680
"No, not really."

113
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,100
"I'm not a new officer."

114
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,880
"I'm a senior in this office."

115
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,360
"I'm supposed to be told to obey seniors."

116
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,480
"Yes, I got it, senior."

117
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,040
"You're not a senior. Call me God."

118
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,240
"God?"

119
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,500
"God?"

120
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,680
"Yes, it's up to me to educate you to be a good detective."

121
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,020
"So, I'm God to you."

122
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,200
"I see."

123
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,300
"I got it, God."

124
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,660
"What?"

125
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,860
"I don't need that!"

126
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,300
"Yes, God."

127
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,360
"Alright, that's enough. I'll go patrol. Follow me, 0045!"

128
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,880
"Yes, God."

129
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:44,040
"A police officer who is in the police station writes documents such as address, address, and escape, and patrols to protect his or her safety."

130
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,360
"I see."

131
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,140
"It's important to be careful to be loved by the residents."

132
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,200
"What do you mean?"

133
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,400
"For example."

134
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,820
"I'll take your hand and give it to the old woman who's waiting for the signal."

135
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,860
"Okay, I got it."

136
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,760
"Hey!"

137
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,140
"Let's go together."

138
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,840
"Don't hesitate."

139
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,500
"Help!"

140
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,900
"Are you alright, old woman?"

141
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,120
"Ow, ow, ow."

142
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,540
"You idiot! You're going to kill me, aren't you?"

143
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,340
"I'm going to do as God says."

144
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,720
"Look closely! The signal is red."

145
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,700
"Oh, you're right."

146
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,940
"Come on, be strong."

147
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,600
"I'm sorry."

148
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
"You bastard!"

149
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,780
"You bastard!"

150
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,460
"No, it's a fight."

151
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,260
"Oh, I'm scared."

152
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,040
"Hey, you can't be scared."

153
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,680
"I'm not good at fighting."

154
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,560
"It's the police officer's job to stop the fight."

155
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,180
"Ah, the police officer's job?"

156
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,520
"A robot can't lose to a human."

157
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,160
"Go, 0045!"

158
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,600
"Y-Yes, God."

159
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,720
"You bastard!"

160
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,200
"You bastard!"

161
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,040
"Please stop!"

162
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:54,720
"You bastard!"

163
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,620
"Go, 0045!"

164
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,460
"God, help me!"

165
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,540
"He's really weak."

166
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,100
"Hey, stop it!"

167
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,400
"Aah!"

168
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,200
"I'm really sorry, God."

169
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,580
"Show me something useful."

170
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,720
"I'll do my best."

171
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,760
"Ah, Yuji!"

172
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,000
"Ah!"

173
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,720
"Get out of my way!"

174
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,200
"Ah, the kid!"

175
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,420
"I'll help you!"

176
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:21,720
"Huh?"

177
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,900
"Aah!"

178
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,460
"Wait, 0045!"

179
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,660
"I'll help you!"

180
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,360
"Aah!"

181
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,620
"I'm hurt!"

182
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,060
"God, please help me!"

183
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,200
"If you can't swim, don't jump!"

184
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,420
"Aah!"

185
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,200
"Ah!"

186
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,460
"I'm so relieved, Yuji."

187
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,260
"Geez, how did humans have to help robots?"

188
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,660
"It's the opposite of normal."

189
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,300
I'm sorry, God.

190
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,480
Wake up! We're going to continue patrolling!

191
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,840
It looks like the water got in and it's not working anymore.

192
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,400
What?

193
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,560
Just do some waterproofing.

194
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,640
I mean, which one of these is the latest model?

195
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,620
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

196
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,000
All right.

197
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,960
This should be fine.

198
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,130
Oh, really?

199
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,680
Thank you, God.

200
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,420
I'm sorry. The truck's broken down.

201
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,940
This kind of hard work is the job of a robot, 0045.

202
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,040
Yes, I understand, God.

203
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,380
Do your best, 0045!

204
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,480
Be strong!

205
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,980
Just a little more.

206
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,760
I'm sorry. Let me rest for a while.

207
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,960
Are you really a robot?

208
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,780
All right. Here's your second try.

209
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,180
Just one more breath.

210
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,620
Yes!

211
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,560
Stop it!

212
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,040
Help me, God!

213
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,440
Don't increase my work!

214
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,180
I'm sorry!

215
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,760
Good job, Ryo.

216
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,960
I'm not strong. I have zero athletic ability.

217
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,160
And I always fail no matter what I do.

218
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,820
I'm really a bad robot.

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,920
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,160
Everyone fails at first.

221
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,380
Don't be afraid. Just do your best.

222
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,580
Thank you very much. I'll do my best.

223
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,920
Oh, no! I drank tea.

224
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,140
I have no energy.

225
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,080
What do I do? My body is so rusty!

226
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,180
Calm down and spit it out.

227
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,160
He's got a name.

228
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,100
Huh?

229
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,460
All right.

230
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,060
I'm Dametaro.

231
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,880
Dametaro?

232
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,720
I think it's a good name.

233
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,100
Dametaro.

234
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,240
Robot Officer Dametaro

235
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,720
Hey, Dametaro! Let's go on a patrol!

236
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,040
Yes, God!

237
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,220
Well, I'm going to go for a bit.

238
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,060
Have a good trip!

239
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,300
Be careful!

240
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,020
You two are a good pair.

241
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,120
Dametaro-kun has gotten used to this dressing room.

242
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,420
Hmm... I'll take a break for a bit.

243
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,760
It looks delicious.

244
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,620
If you drink it, it'll rust, right?

245
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,640
Yes.

246
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,560
Don't look so pathetic.

247
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,260
I thought something like this would happen.

248
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,280
This is a high-end pure katsu for a radio station.

249
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,420
Wow! Thank you, God!

250
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,700
Drink it carefully.

251
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,360
Yes, sir.

252
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,940
Ryo-chan is quite kind.

253
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,040
Reiko? Are you back from shopping?

254
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,360
Yes.

255
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,280
Good work.

256
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,820
Ryo-chan,

257
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,700
are you on a patrol?

258
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,720
Yes.

259
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm taking a break.

260
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,300
Sir,

261
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,180
kick it!

262
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,440
Oh!

263
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,960
God,

264
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,640
please let me do this.

265
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

266
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,900
Yes, sir.

267
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,720
Here we go!

268
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,840
Ouch!

269
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,960
Dametaro-kun!

270
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,300
What are you doing, Dametaro?

271
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,900
Hahaha, I feel like I have a bad brother.

272
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,600
Ohara-kun.

273
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,660
I'm talking about 004 development of Robot Police.

274
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,300
Have you heard of them?

275
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,540
Huh?

276
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,560
What?

277
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,640
It seems that they are calling you Dametaro

278
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,140
in front of the police force in the field.

279
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,820
004 is a robot made by 2000 researchers

280
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,920
and 3000 cutting-edge technologies.

281
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,140
It's a robot made of a piece of paper.

282
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,120
Why is that nickname?

283
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,260
I saw the report, but there seems to be a lot of failures.

284
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,420
That's probably because Ryotsu made his failure 004.

285
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,560
No, I can't just say that.

286
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,660
Some people have actually seen 004 fail.

287
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,120
At this rate, we will be held responsible.

288
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,920
I'll have to do something about it.

289
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,840
Yes, sir.

290
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,060
I'm back.

291
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,060
Ryotsu, Chief Ohara is waiting for you.

292
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,660
At times like this, it's not a good idea to talk about it.

293
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,560
What is it, Chief?

294
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,660
Ryotsu.

295
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,840
What did you do to 004?

296
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,780
What?

297
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,620
What did you say?

298
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,520
004 was made by collecting the essence of the latest technology.

299
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,280
That's useless.

300
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,120
What did you do to make it like that?

301
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,040
What did you do?

302
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,620
I didn't do anything.

303
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,120
Don't lie.

304
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,200
Then why did 004 become like that?

305
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,160
It was like that from the beginning.

306
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,820
Don't be stupid.

307
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,240
You must have done something.

308
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

309
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,880
The chief will be here in three days.

310
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,060
At that time, 004 will have the power.

311
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,600
If you don't have the power, you won't get any bonus.

312
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

313
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,160
If you don't want that, you have to put it back in three days.

314
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,800
That's ridiculous.

315
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,160
If I can't give you the power in three days, what will happen to 004?

316
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,740
If it's useless, you have to collect it.

317
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,920
I guess we have to scrap it.

318
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,040
What?

319
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,480
Dametaro scrapped it?

320
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,280
Ryo, what you just said...

321
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,100
You guys heard that?

322
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,260
Dametaro didn't...

323
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,160
It's okay.

324
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,460
I'll go to the library with Terai.

325
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,740
I see.

326
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,580
Is that true, senpai?

327
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,480
Dametaro will be scrapped.

328
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,100
He'll be scrapped.

329
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,800
If the investigation comes from the capital three days later, and it's still not good,

330
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,940
that's what's going to happen.

331
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,180
What?

332
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:56,640
I'll scrap that guy.

333
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,960
Is this the god's room?

334
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,880
Here's the god's room.

335
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,240
You're going to sleep here for a while.

336
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,100
What are you doing, god?

337
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,280
Oh, my God!

338
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,600
This is the design of 004 that I got at a very low price.

339
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,660
If it is made as it is, it should be able to exert more power than humans.

340
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,780
Let's look into it.

341
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,820
There is no abnormality.

342
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,360
Let's try and increase the output a little.

343
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,480
All right. How is this?

344
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,460
How do you feel, Damedaro?

345
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
No! Something's wrong!

346
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,900
What? The transmission? What's wrong?

347
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,760
What's wrong?

348
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,800
Stop it, Damedaro!

349
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,120
Damn it!

350
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:09,860
Emergency!

351
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,980
The transmission is here.

352
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,900
I knew it.

353
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,860
That was dangerous.

354
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,360
The voltage may have been too high.

355
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,680
How about this time?

356
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,160
How do you feel, Damedaro?

357
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,200
Oh, it's been a long time, God.

358
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,780
You didn't come to see me at all.

359
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,240
I was lonely.

360
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,260
You're right.

361
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,880
I'll make you a snack sometime.

362
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,560
Yeah.

363
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,320
That's great.

364
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,540
You've become more girlish.

365
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,840
Why does my body start to flutter?

366
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,860
It seems to be more useful than before.

367
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,960
Damedaro is a genius.

368
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:57,900
What about Miyako?

369
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,140
I got it.

370
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,900
You got something?

371
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,680
No?

372
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,200
My head!

373
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,920
What should we do, senpai?

374
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,860
We should do some special training!

375
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,140
Look, your chin's up!

376
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,040
Three more laps!

377
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,660
Okay!

378
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,420
It's no use doing such a thing to a robot.

379
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,820
Yeah, it's not like it's going to give you muscle.

380
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,340
No, it's actually quite meaningful.

381
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,580
What?

382
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,060
Dametaro has the latest learning features.

383
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,120
So by accumulating experiences,

384
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,520
he learns how to move efficiently.

385
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,260
As a result, he should be able to show off his skills more and more.

386
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,520
Huh?

387
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,620
I see.

388
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,940
The problem is that he only has two days left.

389
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,520
Hey, your hips aren't in!

390
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,520
Ouch!

391
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,360
What are you doing?

392
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,060
Like this!

393
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,220
Shoooo!

394
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,020
Come on, 100 more laps!

395
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,980
Ouch... I wanna get out of here...

396
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,520
You don't!

397
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,540
Swim faster!

398
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,980
Oh...

399
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,580
What's with your motivation?

400
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,640
200 more...

401
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,720
Oh-! It's me!

402
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
What's the problem!?

403
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,600
I'm the leader!

404
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,540
Okay! I'll be right back!

405
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,280
*Sigh*

406
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,460
I'm going back to the toilet.

407
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,120
200 more laps.

408
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,760
Let's do it one more time!

409
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,560
Okay.

410
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,220
Alright.

411
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,660
Oh, the battery's dead.

412
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,760
Huh? Nobody's here.

413
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,800
Let me charge it up.

414
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,840
What? Is it today?

415
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:57,880
Really?

416
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,680
Oh, it's God's voice.

417
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,960
You were supposed to come two days later, right?

418
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,240
I was in a hurry for the general meeting.

419
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,820
No way!

420
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,720
It won't change much when it's today.

421
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,720
Or are you planning something bad?

422
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,360
No, I'm not!

423
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,580
Please, wait a little longer!

424
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,960
I don't want to scrap the useless ones!

425
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,680
I don't want to scrap the useless ones!

426
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,440
I'm going to scrap them!

427
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,340
Ryo-tsu.

428
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,100
Yes, it's Ohara.

429
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,740
Ah, I understand.

430
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,960
I heard that we'll be able to see the general office soon.

431
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:44,980
What?

432
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,000
Damn it!

433
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,120
Ryo-chan!

434
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,760
Senpai!

435
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,780
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

436
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,920
Who's there?

437
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,200
Who's there?

438
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,440
What kind of place have you placed your clothes in?

439
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,960
Ah, these are Tametaro's clothes!

440
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,780
I didn't know you listened to what I just said.

441
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Tametaro!

442
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,520
Even though you were born as a robot police officer,

443
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,780
it was such a waste of time that you didn't use them at all.

444
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,620
Ah!

445
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:28,600
- The

446
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,560
tank is exploding! - We can't fight it! - There

447
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,240
are people left! - We'll be caught up in the explosion! - What?

448
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:48,940
- You can't run. I'm a police officer! - - - You

449
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,320
're...!

450
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,440
-

451
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,100
- - - - - - - - - - -

452
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,720
- - - - - - - - - -

453
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,900
- - - - - - - - - -

454
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,980
I'm sorry!

455
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,340
Thanks to you, we didn't get into a mess.

456
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,880
We saved the officer officer.

457
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,980
Of course.

458
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,460
As expected of a new robot officer.

459
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,680
He has 2,000 researchers and 3,000 advanced technology.

460
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,720
If he can't move due to a battery out, he should have said so from the beginning.

461
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,620
If he can't move, he can't talk.

462
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,260
Ryo is happy.

463
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,600
I've never seen such a senior before.

464
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,100
What did you do, God?

465
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,300
Nothing!

466
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,460
As a policeman, you're still a criminal.

467
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,000
I'll train you more and more.

468
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,720
Wait!

469
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,380
Ouch!

470
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,060
Idiot! Don't jump out of the road suddenly!

471
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,920
But, God...

472
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,640
What'd you up to?

473
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020

482
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,660
You're sometimes helping someone

Baby do you know me?

484
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,820
Head to tomorrow with a nice breath

Don't feel wrecked

486
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,580

A cute heart breath

489
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,700
That's right I want to show you

490
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,540
Than to look back

491
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,200
It's alright

492
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,880
Next time

493
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,060
You appeared again, Professor To-no-mo!

494
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,120
What? The medicine to become a transparent person?

495
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,820
Who would cooperate with such a human experiment?

496
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,300
Wait, my legs are transparent before I knew it!

497
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,080
Damn it! You're not good at measuring!

498
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,840
Next time, "The Transparent Deca-Arawaru"

499
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,840
