1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,220
When you're watching TV

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,900
Make the room bright and try to get away

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:25,220
It's like someone's calling

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,200
After the rain

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,300
I walked looking back

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,100
I was drawn to the gacha

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,740
I felt it at that time

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,500
A strange feeling

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,200
So I walked on the Akegogai Tile

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,440
Only the black part

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,160
I saw it

12
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,320
Everyone was a child once

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,660
But everyone forgets

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,220
A politician with a great face

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,700
A blue aunt above his eyes

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,720
Turn around and see

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,000
That corner

18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,500
I can meet everyone

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,460
There is a wall there

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,200
There is a wall there

21
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,620
There must be a wall there

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,280
Come and visit us

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,700
Thank you!

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,800
Eh?

25
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,020
Meyoto Manzai?

26
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,440
Me and Reyko-san?

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,140
No, I can't, my boss

28
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,420
It's a celebration of the annual 30th Anniversary of Katsushika because of the discovery of the Shrine

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,200
In contrast, it's the year

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,740
I'm glad you did it.

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,460
You're a good man.

32
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,340
The manzai of me and the temple at the memorial party is already a standard.

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,080
What the hell is that?

34
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,980
Yoshida-san!

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,380
It's not true!

36
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,040
Ryo-tsu, who can't stand the natural and unspoken manzai and high-tech drama,

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,000
is looking forward to the manzai of the ryo-tsu manzai combination once a year.

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,420
There are also many officers who call their parents and siblings from their hometown.

39
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,680
Glasses, glasses.

40
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,800
If it's Kouhaku, I don't want you to say that it's a joke to our Geo, which is the breath of Kobayashi Sachiko.

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,700
What's this?

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,740
Aren't these stylish glasses, Terai-kun?

43
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,780
No, Ryo-san, this is a bucket.

44
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,040
That's true.

45
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,300
He's breathing perfectly.

46
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,280
That's good.

47
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,200
That was a light warming up.

48
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,580
Sometimes, Ryo-tsu of the tsukkomi shows his bokeh,

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,100
and Terai shows his tsukkomi.

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,600
Manzai and combination are free to change.

51
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,740
But on the other hand...

52
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,180
Captain!

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,000
Sensei!

54
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,400
There are many claims that your manzai is vulgar and vulgar.

55
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,360
I'm saying that I'm ashamed of my dirty jokes, so I'll stop.

56
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,080
Ryo-tsu, I think you're getting into your jokes soon.

57
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,900
I'm not running into dirty jokes because I'm in trouble with my jokes.

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,400
I'm going to show off the cold-headed customer's head

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,620
at the long-standing feast of the team's hidden greeting.

60
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,760
It's the most effective way to warm up the customer's head when they're cold.

61
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,620
That's why I'm actively introducing dirty jokes to grab the customer's attention.

62
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,360
Please withdraw all complaints.

63
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,620
I, I understand.

64
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm sorry, Ryo-san.

65
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,680
I didn't know that you were thinking that far.

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,740
I can't do this with you anymore.

67
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,160
It's a combination resolution.

68
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,260
That's good.

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,480
Don't relax!

70
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,100
A daily conversation is a manzai as it is.

71
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,280
As expected, veterans are different.

72
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,820
You can't buy anything even if you have a lot of money.

73
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,160
That's the customer's laugh.

74
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,240
You two, who don't know how to do it, can't do manzai.

75
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,820
Ryo-chan, I don't think that's the way to say it.

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,020
Oh, then you can do manzai.

77
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,440
I'm not saying that you should not appear in Ryo-tsu.

78
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,680
What can they do?

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
They're making fun of the joke.

80
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,080
They're licking the manzai.

81
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,680
That's not true.

82
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,300
There's no such thing as licking the manzai.

83
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,540
Making people laugh is a wonderful job.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,860
Then, you'll do it for me, right?

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,320
Yes.

86
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,440
I see.

87
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,600
I'll register you as a member of the cast.

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,260
If you come out, the event will be more beautiful.

89
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,240
If you ruin the name of the station before we built it, we won't pay you.

90
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,380
It seems that we are really going to do manzai.

91
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,080
What? How do you prepare?

92
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,400
I don't know at all.

93
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,860
Um...

94
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,740
To protect the citizens from the crimes that are getting worse every year,

95
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,580
We both need each of you's wisdom and strength.

96
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,920
The other day, this happened.

97
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,520
The director is talking for thirty minutes now.

98
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,000
It's about time to go to work.

99
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,280
I'll really appreciate it.

100
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,120
Leave it to me.

101
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,960
The baseball season has come, hasn't it?

102
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,780
Yes.

103
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,820
I love baseball.

104
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,800
I love to put it on my shoulder and endure the heat.

105
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,600
That's a baseball.

106
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,300
Keiichi and Reiko.

107
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,060
Yes.

108
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,700
You two are next.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,600
Okay.

110
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,780
What should I do, Keiichi? I can't do it.

111
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,100
We can't run away now.

112
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,240
Don't worry.

113
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,900
I'll warm up the audience at the store.

114
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,740
I'll warm up the audience at the store.

115
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,100
Everyone, we're waiting.

116
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,920
Ryozu and Terai.

117
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,660
Hello.

118
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,020
I'm Ryozu.

119
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,740
I'm Terai.

120
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,280
Nice to meet you.

121
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,260
Anyway, we have to see the results of our practice.

122
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,020
Today is a day of hard work.

123
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,780
So Ryozu is in the team.

124
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:11,880
Yes.

125
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,600
Do you mean you didn't make him leave?

126
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,000
I did.

127
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,520
I was quiet until now, but there is actually a witness.

128
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,080
A witness?

129
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,380
It's only this talk.

130
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,460
After that, the president rushed to the bathroom with me.

131
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,320
Oh, the president.

132
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,220
That's a lie.

133
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,620
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,620
The president is the only witness who can speak to my doubts, and he is a suspect.

135
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,260
Ryo, if you say that, you will be at the top of the list again.

136
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,420
Yes.

137
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,080
President.

138
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,220
I'm going to pour this water on each other.

139
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,460
Please enjoy it!

140
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,660
Please enjoy it!

141
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,740
I'm done.

142
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,060
Eh? What are you doing, Kei-chan?

143
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,220
I heard that if you write the word "human" on your palm, you won't get up.

144
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,960
I'll do it too.

145
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,720
India.

146
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,720
What are you going to do if you drink India?

147
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,520
It's a person. A person.

148
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,020
Oh?

149
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,400
Next, it's the two of you.

150
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,800
The heated audience is on the top again.

151
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,080
Ryo-san, you won't scare me, will you?

152
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,880
Good luck!

153
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,520
Next, it's Keiichi and Reiko.

154
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,540
Please welcome them with applause.

155
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,260
Keiichi-san!

156
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,180
Reiko-san!

157
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,440
Hello. I'm Keiichi and...

158
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,260
Reiko.

159
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,740
Kei-chan?

160
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,380
Thank you.

161
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,160
What's up?

162
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,740
Did something interesting happen recently?

163
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,120
Well, you know...

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,460
It was fun! It was fun!

165
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,880
What's so fun about it?

166
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,580
It was fun!

167
00:07:53,900 --> 00:08:00,560
Yeah, Ryo-san. You're famous this year.

168
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,660
Well, it's my ability.

169
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,760
Thank you.

170
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,820
Well, this person has something to say.

171
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,840
"Nice to meet you. I am something like this."

172
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,930
"Event producer?"

173
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,280
"I would like you two to participate in the next Asakusa Manzai Contest."

174
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,140
"Contest?"

175
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,160
"Is it a scout?"

176
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,420
"Yes."

177
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,060
"Asakusa Manzai Contest is a young man's new manzai story.

178
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,940
"It is broadcast on TV and if he wants to win, he will be the face of the nation."

179
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,020
"I knew you knew it, Mr. Ryotaro."

180
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,780
"Well, yes."

181
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,420
"We have gathered the participants to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the contest and discover the talent of the new era of manzai."

182
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,740
"But now we have one thing missing."

183
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:58,760
"But! At this Katsushika-jo, where we visited for the re-writing of the license today, we were able to see the two's manzai by chance."

184
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,800
"I see."

185
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,240
"This is a fateful encounter."

186
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,300
"I cannot say this with a loud voice, but I am the winner."

187
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
"I will let you participate."

188
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,800
"Of course."

189
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,460
"Wait a minute, Mr. Ryo."

190
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,060
"Our manzai is just a hobby and it is impossible to do it on TV."

191
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,080
"What?"

192
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,840
"Did you not hear the sound of the crowd earlier?"

193
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,820
"Our manzai has already exceeded the range of a hobby."

194
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,660
"But the audience is almost acquaintances and we are not just receiving the prize."

195
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,460
"What? My manzai is not working?"

196
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,860
"It is so painful."

197
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,160
"I am writing a script of a manzai for the audience."

198
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,720
"So if you are from Alaska, you are from Alaska."

199
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,000
"If you are from Egypt, you are writing a manzai to make the Egyptian audience laugh."

200
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,620
"If you are from Asakusa, you are writing a manzai to make the Egyptian audience laugh."

201
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,480
"I see. I see. So let me go."

202
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,280
"What?"

203
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,540
"You have no talent. Why do you have to do this?"

204
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,440
"Did you receive the dollars from a dúo to every woman who caused the manzai to be popular?"

205
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,340
"I am doing this to get our ass kicked out of this place. That's why."

206
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,720
"Overcome your fate!"

207
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,980
"No way. Mr. Ryo was a bad guy."

208
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,900
"I must say that our com Squeeze is wonderful."

209
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,500
"By the way, what is the prize of this contest?"

210
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,900
"This contest costs about 3 million yen per person."

211
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,340
"3 million yen?"

212
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,800
"You are not the only one who wins this game, Mr. Ryo."

213
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,640
"Yes."

214
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,040
You still have 30 years until the loan you owe me back.

215
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,960
I created a ring for the owner of the farmed parlor!

216
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,460
A ring! What are you going to do!

217
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,060
You bastard!

218
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,240
I'm sorry!

219
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,640
I'll fix it, Ryo.

220
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,320
Good.

221
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,600
Then we'll hear this story later...

222
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,640
Thank you very much!

223
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,620
Thanks to you, I failed so badly.

224
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,840
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,940
I'm sorry for the second time.

226
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,300
No, no, no.

227
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,560
It was a big success.

228
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,740
It's not like that.

229
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,280
If you weren't there, I could have done better.

230
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,940
I'm so frustrated because I practiced so much.

231
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,620
These guys are the first stage today.

232
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,220
Please forgive me.

233
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,160
It's an amateur game.

234
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,120
I can't believe I'm leaving so many people on the first stage.

235
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryochi and Mr. Terai.

236
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,880
Mr. Kenichi and Mr. Reiko.

237
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,000
Please participate in the contest.

238
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,900
What?

239
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,680
What?

240
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
I'm going to give you a series of manzai.

241
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,100
I'm going to give you a series of manzai.

242
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,400
I'm going to give you a series of manzai.

243
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,820
I'm going to give you a series of manzai.

244
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,820
I'm going to give you a series of manzai.

245
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,600
The contest was originally an unexpected story.

246
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,220
Please cheer up, Mr. Ryo.

247
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,440
Shut up!

248
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,120
If you said OK at that time,

249
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,140
Nakagawa and Reiko would have had a chance.

250
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,460
I refuse.

251
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,280
We're not manzai.

252
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,060
You can't stand out in the contest.

253
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,120
What a waste of money to say that.

254
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,480
It's 3 million yen.

255
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,400
The prize money is 3 million yen.

256
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,060
Mr. Ryo.

257
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:31,920
Eh?

258
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,900
I can't say it because it's wasteful to say that to two great manzai.

259
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,200
Darn it.

260
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,560
Disappointed as if he drew the toes of a little finger from the shoes.

261
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,500
It would be nice if a senior was crowned for us.

262
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,580
Yes.

263
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,640
That was the story at the beginning.

264
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,360
If you can do that, I don't expect anything from you.

265
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,640
Ryo, that producer is a mess.

266
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,040
The contest is banned.

267
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,820
What?

268
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
He worked so hard on the manzai.

269
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,300
Poor guy.

270
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,460
Don't worry.

271
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,560
I'll raise you to be great manzai artists by the contest.

272
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:08,940
What?

273
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,380
Nakagawa, Reiko, I'll teach you all of me.

274
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,400
I'll teach you all of me.

275
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,580
Wait a minute, Ryo.

276
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,480
Wait until the sun rises.

277
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,220
Heaven will not let you go.

278
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,100
I went to the theater with my mother.

279
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,180
Enomoto Kenichi, Furukawa Roppa, Kamigata Manzai's Entatsu Achako.

280
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,680
We are going to the contest.

281
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,860
No, I can't do it.

282
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,220
What should I do, Reiko?

283
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,360
I'm afraid if you refuse.

284
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,760
I don't know what kind of manzai you are.

285
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,180
I don't know if you will do it for me.

286
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,420
Please.

287
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,620
Please.

288
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
I love manzai so much.

289
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,300
And I love Asakusa.

290
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,480
I'm sorry.

291
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,200
Reiko, Nakagawa.

292
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,880
Ryo.

293
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,220
I get it.

294
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,360
This time.

295
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,020
Do you?

296
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,120
Thank you very much.

297
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,540
Okay.

298
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,360
I can win these two.

299
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,980
And I will get the prize money.

300
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,380
Listen.

301
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,880
I'll be your teacher.

302
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,240
Don't go against what the teacher said.

303
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,680
If I say I'm black, all the posts and bananas are black.

304
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,460
Got it?

305
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,040
Y-Yes.

306
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,760
I don't like this kind of outfit.

307
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,280
Me too.

308
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,700
There's only a week left until the contest.

309
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,020
We're going to do practical training here.

310
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,860
I see.

311
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,920
First, I'll show you my example.

312
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,280
Yes.

313
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,380
Stretch your arms and push the chicken.

314
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,320
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

315
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,440
Try it.

316
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,820
I feel embarrassed.

317
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,720
Try it in a less crowded place, Senpai.

318
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,420
Call me teacher.

319
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,440
Teacher?

320
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,540
If you're embarrassed, you can't make people laugh.

321
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,560
Do it now.

322
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,960
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

323
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,380
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

324
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,380
Make a small voice.

325
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,260
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

326
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,820
Make a big voice.

327
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,740
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

328
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,280
Raise your face.

329
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,620
Don't forget to smile.

330
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,560
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

331
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,020
Keep the rhythm.

332
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,320
Yes, yes.

333
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,300
Next is the chicken running.

334
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,080
Why is that?

335
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,600
Why is that?

336
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,780
Let's go.

337
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,100
Welcome home.

338
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,060
How is it?

339
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,620
You're a little more confident, aren't you?

340
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,700
Then I'll go to the patron, so I'll leave it to you.

341
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,720
No.

342
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,300
The daily life of laughter is a series of jokes and comments.

343
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,800
Well, first of all, let's drink tea and have a drink.

344
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,680
First, boil water in a kettle.

345
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,240
What are you doing watching a joke?

346
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,800
Yes, that was a joke.

347
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,360
No, it's boring.

348
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,800
You can laugh at one of your partner's jokes.

349
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,260
If your partner is drunk, you can't help but say it.

350
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,100
Yes.

351
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,160
Then I'll do it from the beginning.

352
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,740
First, boil water in a kettle.

353
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,700
Oh, there's no lid in this kettle.

354
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,000
Then this is a bucket.

355
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,920
Oh, that's good, Reiko.

356
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,860
When did you learn to ride a ride?

357
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,680
Oh, is this okay?

358
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,040
That's the spirit.

359
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,820
Don't be afraid.

360
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,260
Come on.

361
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,080
Yes.

362
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,140
Then put the tea in the kettle.

363
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,740
That's a kettle.

364
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,560
Oh, no.

365
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,980
I jumped into it even though I wasn't dumb.

366
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,940
Nakagawa, I was so impatient that I thought I was late for Reiko.

367
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,140
Focus on your partner's words.

368
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,220
Focus on your actions.

369
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,120
Yes.

370
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,700
Oh, no.

371
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,420
Oh, no.

372
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,620
Oh, no.

373
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,240
What's wrong, Terai?

374
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,260
Terai.

375
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,920
When did you become so big?

376
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,860
That's a light bulb.

377
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,720
It's not the time to be stupid.

378
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,560
It's the third time.

379
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,000
You're a kisser, Terai.

380
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,720
Stop it.

381
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,400
All right, let's go.

382
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,620
Yes.

383
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,080
Let's go Ikezu.

384
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,160
The chance of becoming stupid is rolling.

385
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,080
Yes.

386
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,160
It's continue.

387
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,660
Nice to meet you.

388
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,140
Welcome.

389
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,120
I'm the new meoto old man, Deka, who'd like to meet you.

390
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,160
What?

391
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,460
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

392
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,220
Then, I won't let you change your bag!

393
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,660
You can't change it.

394
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,700
You have to change it.

395
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,740
Well then, excuse me.

396
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,820
Oh, it's a nice bag.

397
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,480
Which one is your present?

398
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,000
I got this from someone.

399
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,020
I see, it's a present.

400
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,160
How can you be convinced?

401
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,620
I got it from someone, but you didn't tell me.

402
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,780
You didn't wait for me, did you?

403
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,320
That's not true.

404
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,200
Well then, excuse me. I'll take a look at the contents of your bag.

405
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,880
That's a little...

406
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,040
Then, that's enough.

407
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,700
You give up too quickly.

408
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,260
I'm pushing you here on purpose.

409
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,800
Pushing, pushing.

410
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:10,880
That's not pushing.

411
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,720
Oh, pushing, pushing.

412
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,940
So, what are you going to do if I push you?

413
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,360
But, I heard that it's not pushing.

414
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,220
So, do it stronger.

415
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,120
Stronger?

416
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,260
Push...

417
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,140
So, I told you not to push.

418
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,500
I'm sorry for killing a snake raw.

419
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,160
Do it quickly if you can't catch it.

420
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,620
You're really rich.

421
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,100
So, I'll get the culprit, right?

422
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,080
Now, arrest him.

423
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,640
Okay.

424
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,360
Oh, no, I forgot the camera.

425
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,560
Then, I can't arrest him.

426
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,000
Please wait a moment.

427
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,080
It's here.

428
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,820
Then, let's arrest the fast one.

429
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,620
It's arrest.

430
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,480
A octopus.

431
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,200
How can I arrest you with this?

432
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,360
So, you have to grab it with your chest.

433
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,480
You can't arrest me with this!

434
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,260
Bring it here quickly!

435
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:03,920
Okay!

436
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,240
Hey, don't go!

437
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,920
It's okay. I'll be back soon.

438
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,500
I've brought it!

439
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,280
So, what are you going to do with the squid?

440
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,860
You have to grab it with your chest.

441
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,480
Please, grab it quickly!

442
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,480
You have to grab it with your chest.

443
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:19,620
Oh!

444
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,620
Somehow my body became lighter and the words of the tsukkomi came out naturally from the bottom of my heart.

445
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,780
It was a strange feeling.

446
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,820
I was able to blurt out the words one by one so that the fog in front of me would clear up.

447
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,920
You have to endure these five days of training well.

448
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,760
And you have successfully learned the tsukkomi.

449
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,820
Master, this is...

450
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,980
I have been warming my eyes for many years for the sake of my life partner.

451
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,260
This is the script of the crime.

452
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,560
I don't think I'll get to use it for a while, so I'll submit it to you.

453
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,700
What?

454
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,180
You're giving us such an important thing?

455
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,540
Here, there are plenty of stories that Asakusa's customers will like.

456
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,980
Please give this guy his life in my place.

457
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,700
Master...

458
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,100
I'm sorry to trouble you, but I can't take this script.

459
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,060
Reiko-san!

460
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,940
Why are you saying that without even reading the script?

461
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,600
If we did it, it would be a temporary Asakusa.

462
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,180
I think it would only be a temporary Manzai.

463
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,680
That's why I want to think about the script ourselves.

464
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,320
I'm sorry to say this selfishly.

465
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,260
If you're so determined, then try it yourself.

466
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,600
But the contest is the day after tomorrow.

467
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,920
There's no time left.

468
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,660
There are still two days.

469
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,960
You two will make our Manzai.

470
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,600
You two will make our Manzai.

471
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,500
I understand.

472
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,380
Yeah.

473
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,500
The excellent Manzai Combi must have its own unique personality.

474
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,340
Find out your own personality.

475
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,720
Our own personality?

476
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,140
I'm sure we'll find it.

477
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,920
Nakagawa-kun is slow.

478
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:13,980
He's really slow.

479
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,700
Maybe he's scared.

480
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,320
They will surely come.

481
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,720
I believe in their comedian spirit.

482
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,760
But...

483
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,860
That's the police officer.

484
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,100
Really?

485
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,400
Really?

486
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,020
They're coming?

487
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,900
I'm scared.

488
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,200
I'm scared.

489
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,740
I'm scared.

490
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,360
I'm scared.

491
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,420
I'm scared.

492
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,080
I'm scared.

493
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,040
I'm scared.

494
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,420
I'm scared.

495
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,420
Spirit of the league

496
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,000
What's that outfit?

497
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,040
They've found our unique trait.

498
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,560
We were aware that we are the richest team in the world

499
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,800
and also made it happen to be a magical pair.

500
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,800
Huh?

501
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,380
I will show my unique trait to the customers in Asakusa!

502
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,260
All for our teacher!

503
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,680
Master...

504
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,740
Ah...

505
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,360
No, I'll just buy half a can of the customer's.

506
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,700
My 3 million yen...

507
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,820
Ryo, you don't want me to go to the venue, do you?

508
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,320
Let's watch TV together at the exit.

509
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,540
Gakushin, you watch over them inside.

510
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,400
I'll go home with a pachinko.

511
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,860
What? The winner?

512
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,000
The two of them are the best.

513
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,760
I wish I could watch it too.

514
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,040
Here's the prize money.

515
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,900
This is for me?

516
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,420
Thank you for letting me know.

517
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,520
Now you can go back to the theater without worry.

518
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,220
Wow, it's so big on the newspaper.

519
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm glad, Ryo.

520
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,820
All my wishes came true.

521
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,620
What kind of show did the two of them do?

522
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,740
What kind of show?

523
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,220
I just remembered.

524
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,600
I'm sorry.

525
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:03,940
I don't know why you're laughing.

526
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,020
Good morning.

527
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,220
Good morning.

528
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,460
Please stop.

529
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,200
Please don't make me laugh.

530
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,740
When I watched your show on TV yesterday,

531
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,540
I laughed too much and my stomach was twisted.

532
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,900
I almost called an ambulance.

533
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,640
Did you watch their show too?

534
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,700
Why didn't I watch it, Ryo?

535
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,540
What?

536
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,060
Ryo, you didn't watch it?

537
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,120
Nishi-Shinjuku?

538
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,180
Hektopascal?

539
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,840
Will you peel the onion?

540
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,000
What?

541
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,400
What happened in Nishi-Shinjuku?

542
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:41,780
What happened?

543
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,100
