"How to Get a Person to Love You"

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,380
When watching tv on television, please bright up your room and try to leave.

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,780
When watching tv on television, please bright up your room and try to leave.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,700
For those who don't have money, come to me!

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,340
Even I don't have one, but that worries me.

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:36,060
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:42,180
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,200
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,040
If you don't have a job, come to my place

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,520
I don't have one, but don't worry

11
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,360
Look, it's burning

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,520
The red-hot cloud

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,160
The red-hot cloud

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,640
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,480
I know, I know, I know

16
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,760
If you know, be quiet and follow me

17
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,080
Come and get me!

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,680
COMPLETED

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,900
OOFARA is addicted to games!

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,260
Ah, here it is!

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,800
Damn it!

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,800
Crap!

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,500
Ah, here it is!

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,360
Good!

25
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,500
Run!

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,660
Alright!

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,200
I won! I won!

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,380
Hooray!

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,940
Yahoo!

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,240
Oh, it seems like you're having a lot of fun, Ryotsu.

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,180
Of course.

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,700
This week, I've been stealing the leader's attention,

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,760
and I've been doing it over and over again,

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,800
and finally it's clear.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,460
Oh, I see.

36
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,580
Yeah.

37
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,800
Well, how much trouble did I have to make

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,440
to get you here?

39
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,020
Huh?

40
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,120
You idiot!

41
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,360
Ah, leader!

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,620
I don't like this, leader.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,300
When did you get here?

44
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,540
If you're here, please tell me you're here.

45
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,320
Ryotsu!

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,980
You were the one who said,

47
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,320
"If I look away for a little bit, I'll skip work right away,"

48
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,340
and you've been playing games for the past week.

49
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,040
Well, I was just playing during my work.

50
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,780
I was just playing during my work.

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,380
I was just playing during my work.

52
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,080
Well, I was just playing during my work.

53
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,640
I've been playing games for a long time without knowing,

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,240
and playing games is still a scary thing, leader.

55
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,620
And I'm sick of it once I get hooked on it.

56
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,040
and I'm sick of it once I get hooked on it.

57
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,100
I can't get it out of my head.

58
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,620
How about you give it a try, leader?

59
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,640
What a fool!

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,300
I don't play games, do I!

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,080
What do you think your job is, after all?

62
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,720
What do you think your job is, after all?

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,020
A way to survive during work?

64
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,420
A way to survive during work?

65
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:19,840
A way to survive during work?

66
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,940
You know nothing about work!

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,360
You'll pay for this.

68
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,700
No way! Give it back!

69
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,600
Shut up! No need to ask!

70
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,740
Do not bring games to the post office anymore!

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Understood?

72
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,640
Yes sir!

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,180
This one too.

74
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,900
This one too.

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,600
This one too.

76
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,520
I'll take care of the games.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,600
I will not play games during work, so please return the club.

78
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,600
That is my life.

79
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,380
Who would believe such a thing?

80
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,660
You don't play games all the time, do you?

81
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,060
I'm in trouble because adults play it and it's fun.

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,180
Idiot!

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,560
Don't do that!

84
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,300
It's like a mother's fight with a primary school student.

85
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,340
Indeed.

86
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,540
Please, sir!

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,480
Each and every game is a treasure chest of my memories.

88
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,540
Let go!

89
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,860
Here you are, kids.

90
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,140
This is a present for you.

91
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,660
Bring your favorite game.

92
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,940
Yes, yes.

93
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,640
Don't push it.

94
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,860
There are many games in order.

95
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,940
There are many.

96
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,340
Up to three per person.

97
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,080
This is ...

98
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,660
What?

99
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,400
Wow!

100
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,000
It's a game!

101
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,620
It's a game!

102
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,980
Well, it's mine.

103
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,840
This is no good either.

104
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,840
Huh?

105
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,320
Ryo-tsu!

106
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,700
You and that guy are giving up!

107
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,060
This is a great punishment!

108
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,360
No!

109
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,540
I will not play games!

110
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,840
Ryo-tsu!

111
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,720
You're not allowed to play games in the future!

112
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,780
You're not allowed to play games!

113
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,020
Understood?

114
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,740
Yes, sir!

115
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,600
Yes, sir!

116
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,580
Grandpa!

117
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:20,840
Oh ...

118
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,160
Oh, Daisuke, you're here!

119
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,060
Yes!

120
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,060
I'm with my mother and Sakura.

121
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,920
Oh, that's right.

122
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,700
It's good to see you, Daisuke.

123
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,860
Grandpa, this is ...

124
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,580
Huh?

125
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,400
What is this?

126
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,740
This is a present for Grandpa.

127
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,980
Oh ...

128
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,860
I see.

129
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,880
This is a present for your grandpa ...

130
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,100
Thank you.

131
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,680
Thank you, Daisuke.

132
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,000
Well then ...

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,520
I wonder what Daisuke's present is.

134
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,460
Is this a game of chess?

135
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,340
Yes.

136
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,380
Grandpa always plays chess by himself at home, so this is no problem for him.

137
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,840
I went to the department store the other day and Daisuke said he would buy it for Grandpa no matter what.

138
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,320
That's good for you.

139
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,180
Oh, yeah.

140
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,520
Hey, try it, try it!

141
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,580
That's right.

142
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,380
But before I tell Ryotsu about it, I can't get this.

143
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,920
Hey, Grandpa.

144
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,920
Hurry up and try it!

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,680
I'll tell you where you don't know.

146
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,760
I see.

147
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,080
Wow, it's amazing!

148
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,800
It's so small, but it's a real chessboard.

149
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,360
Use this cross key to move the cursor.

150
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,560
I see.

151
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,520
Cursor?

152
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,520
This arrow.

153
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,120
If you choose the piece to move with it, press the B button.

154
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,380
B button?

155
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,760
It's moving!

156
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,780
Oh, the other piece, too!

157
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,000
This is amazing!

158
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,840
Honey, are you playing the game of chess?

159
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,740
Hey, shut up!

160
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,060
This is an important moment.

161
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,180
What are you talking about?

162
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:30,120
All right, the master has waited.

163
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,140
How do you like it?

164
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,220
Did you manage to come?

165
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,220
As expected of our master.

166
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,320
I'm going to the game.

167
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,520
I'm going to the game.

168
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,460
I'm going to the game.

169
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,840
I'm going to the game.

170
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,420
I didn't notice the game.

171
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,840
I didn't notice the game.

172
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,420
I didn't notice the game.

173
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,860
I'm worried about the game again.

174
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,820
But I can't run away anymore.

175
00:07:59,380 --> 00:07:59,840
But I can't run away anymore.

176
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,860
I see.

177
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,580
Then I'll leave.

178
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,580
I'm in a tight spot.

179
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,480
I can't move.

180
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,060
I'm in a tight spot.

181
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,320
Chief.

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,820
I've organized the Japanese.

183
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,480
I see.

184
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,460
I was surprised.

185
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,980
I was surprised that you started talking to me.

186
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,440
I was surprised that you started talking to me.

187
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,000
I wanted to put you behind me.

188
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,580
I could understand Ryotsu's feelings.

189
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,240
I wanted to be as good as him.

190
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,180
I could understand Ryotsu's feelings.

191
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
How did you get this?

192
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:47,200
Oh, well.

193
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,440
I'm not very good at books.

194
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,280
Okay.

195
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:51,800
Good luck.

196
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,920
I'm sorry.

197
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,340
Good luck.

198
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:55,680
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:55,820
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,020
What should I do?

201
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,040
No, no.

202
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,200
Now I'm just like Ryochi.

203
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,320
I'll forget about the game.

204
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,560
Now I have to work.

205
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,540
At Kameari Park...

206
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,100
Oh, right. The corner.

207
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,260
3, 4, corner.

208
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,460
And where the opponent runs away...

209
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,240
5, 4, gold.

210
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,560
If I attack, there is no place to run.

211
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,960
This is it.

212
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,380
No, no.

213
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,700
I can't get away from the game.

214
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,740
I'll forget about it.

215
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,720
I'll work.

216
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,180
Shoking the book

217
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,620
Shoking the book

218
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,600
Shoking the book

219
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,920
Shoking the book

220
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,620
Shoking the book

221
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,760
Shoking the book

222
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,840
Shoking the book

223
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,080
Shoking the book

224
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,660
One more! One more! I'll finish it off with this!

225
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,980
Well, this is like this...

226
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,480
So this is like this.

227
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,560
I see, I see.

228
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,820
I did it! I finally defeated the great man!

229
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,880
What's wrong, chief?

230
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,200
Oh, it's nothing.

231
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,260
It's nothing.

232
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,340
This is dangerous.

233
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,700
I thought I was done, but I'm so absorbed in it.

234
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,640
It would be terrible if Ryo-tsu finds this place.

235
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,080
What's wrong, chief?

236
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,020
Ryo-tsu!

237
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,680
You must be surprised to see someone suddenly talk to you!

238
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,780
What should I do when I have a job?

239
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,760
Even if I have a job, I'll just be quiet.

240
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,440
What should I do?

241
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,820
Can't you tell the chief anything?

242
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,580
Shut up!

243
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,720
Don't just stand there and talk!

244
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,040
You go over there!

245
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,660
I'm not going to be quiet this time.

246
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,880
If you can go, go!

247
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,820
Yes, sir.

248
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,040
What's wrong with the chief today?

249
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,440
The chief is a little weird, isn't he?

250
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,800
He's been so calm lately.

251
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,920
Why hasn't the chief seen a word of Akira for a while?

252
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:06,140
W-what?

253
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,040
Ryo-tsu, you've been very peaceful lately.

254
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,360
Why is it

255
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,260
Ryo-tsu, you're angry.

256
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,660
Ryo-tsu, you're a young man!

257
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,980
I can't play games anymore...

258
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,080
I'll go patrol.

259
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:34,540
Just one song... Just one song...

260
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,460
What's wrong, Ryotsu?

261
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,960
I thought I'd patrol along with you, Chief.

262
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,260
What? You don't have to follow me.

263
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,000
You can go back to the station and work.

264
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,600
You don't have to say such hard things.

265
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,060
Let's go.

266
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:05,460
The weather is nice, Chief.

267
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,340
The town is peaceful, so there's nothing to say.

268
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,660
That's right.

269
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,840
Hey, Ryotsu, how far are you going to follow me?

270
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,620
I'll follow you anywhere.

271
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,720
You're my superior, so I should respect you.

272
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,920
Damn it.

273
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,080
Ryotsu, you're always like this.

274
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,860
Chitan, hurry up and make me shoot the next shot.

275
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,440
I knew it.

276
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,300
Chief.

277
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,460
What are you doing?

278
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,860
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,380
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
That girl is cute.

281
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,120
What class is she in?

282
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,140
I think she's in the 5th grade.

283
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,860
5-3-5-3-4.

284
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,380
I see.

285
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,540
Chief, what's wrong?

286
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,240
Oh, nothing.

287
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,020
Silver.

288
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,680
Gold.

289
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,380
Blue.

290
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,800
Gold.

291
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,020
Gold.

292
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,040
Gold.

293
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,480
Red.

294
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,860
Blue.

295
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,420
Yellow.

296
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,160
Yellow.

297
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,320
Yellow.

298
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,920
Blue.

299
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:38,960
Red.

300
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,020
Looks like you're glittering.

301
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,560
Let go of me!

302
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,280
I see.

303
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,960
I already told you I can't play games anymore.

304
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,120
Will you be all right?

305
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,020
2. Inhabitants

306
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,740
4. No room.

307
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,940
Um, what is this place?

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,080
This is the problem.

309
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,880
Um, there are two missing pieces.

310
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,700
*Groan*

311
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,200
*Groan*

312
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,640
*Groan*

313
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:50,780
*Groan*

314
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,080
*Groan*

315
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,600
*Groan*

316
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,240
*Groan*

317
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,580
Nakagawa, isn't it time for you to go to the library?

318
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,560
Oh, that's right.

319
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,540
Reiko, you go patrol the library.

320
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,120
Yes, sir.

321
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,480
*Groan*

322
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,380
*Groan*

323
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,720
*Groan*

324
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,140
*Groan*

325
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,420
*Groan*

326
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,300
Chief, what's wrong?

327
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,440
Oh, uh, nothing.

328
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,620
*Groan*

329
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,980
I can't work at a time like this.

330
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,300
*Groan*

331
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,300
Chief, I'm going to patrol the library.

332
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,960
*Groan*

333
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,740
Oh, I see.

334
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,960
*Groan*

335
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,460
*Groan*

336
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,400
*Groan*

337
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,540
*Groan*

338
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,680
*Groan*

339
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,100
*Groan*

340
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,800
*M Dialogues*

341
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,300
*Groan*

342
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,500
*Groan*

343
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,340
*Groan*

344
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,020
*Groan*

345
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,100
*Groan*

346
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,940
*M Dialogues*

347
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,600
*M Dialogues*

348
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,400
*M Dialogues*

349
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,720
*M Dialogues*

350
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,240
Oh, oh.

351
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,260
The second stage will begin soon.

352
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,640
Are you today's opponent?

353
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,500
He spoke!

354
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,860
You don't know how much you can challenge me.

355
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,020
I'll make you pay for this!

356
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,220
I see.

357
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,060
So this is what the second stage is all about.

358
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,040
Alright, I won't lose.

359
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,160
I'll see you later.

360
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,320
What's wrong?

361
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,320
Isn't it Meijin's turn?

362
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,020
If you're impatient, you lose.

363
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,020
This is a piece of cake.

364
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,540
A psychological battle.

365
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,300
As expected of Meijin.

366
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,800
It's a nice day today.

367
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,840
Don't you think so?

368
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,580
I do.

369
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,720
I want to forget about work on a day like this.

370
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,620
I know.

371
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,620
I'll hurry up and get my motivation up.

372
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,220
I can't afford to lose.

373
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,960
What?

374
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,680
Meijin, leave this to me.

375
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,880
What?

376
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,080
You call me a jerk?

377
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll admit it if you beat me.

378
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,740
That's funny.

379
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,900
I'll be your opponent.

380
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,900
How's that?

381
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,860
You're so cowardly.

382
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,320
What's wrong?

383
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,040
How dare you call me a coward?

384
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,720
I'll defeat you,

385
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,700
and I'll get my motivation back!

386
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,460
How dare you call me a coward?

387
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:45,680
I'll get my motivation back!

388
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,640
I'll get my motivation back!

Oh...

392
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,540
I'm going on patrol!

393
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,520
Well, well...

394
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
The gold is going to be like this...

395
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,440
10 seconds left.

396
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,400
8, 7, 6...

397
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,140
How's this?

398
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,500
I'm here.

With 147 points,

Mr. Greer wins.

401
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,700
I lost to you.

402
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,360
Then I'll take the punishment.

403
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,340
I'll take it off.

404
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,940
Stop! Stop!

405
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,380
I'm not going to let you do that!

406
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,340
Don't look at me like that! It's embarrassing!

407
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:01,540
What the hell?

408
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,340
I didn't expect this to happen.

409
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,000
See you later.

410
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,980
Then I'll be your opponent.

411
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,640
Finally, it's the Meijin battle.

412
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,920
I've been waiting for this.

413
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,840
What the?

414
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,120
What?

415
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,400
If you get hurt, it's game over.

416
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
If you want to compete with the Meijin, you have to catch up.

417
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,700
Then, ready, go!

418
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,380
Why... why is the car game changing?

419
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,440
I've never played a game like this before.

420
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,960
It's the Meijin's car.

421
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,140
Give me back the Meijin!

422
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,900
Oh, no!

423
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,400
Damn it!

424
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,320
Damn it!

425
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,200
Damn it!

426
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,120
Okay, this is the last game.

427
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,920
Oh, the Meijin!

428
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,460
You've done well.

429
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,660
I'll praise you.

430
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,740
It's finally over.

431
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,120
It can't be helped.

432
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,140
If you want to get back the Meijin,

433
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,400
you have to compete with me in a marathon!

434
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,480
Marathon.

435
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,980
Then, run as I say.

436
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,700
By the way, this game machine has a speed meter built in.

437
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,540
If you're going to be late by any chance,

438
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,360
I won't let you get back the Meijin!

439
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,600
What?

440
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,640
Then, ready!

441
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,460
Hey!

442
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,160
Now, hurry up and run!

443
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,500
Meijin, I'll help you now!

444
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,980
Yes, go straight!

445
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,900
Why do I have to run?

446
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,380
Go right there!

447
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,540
This is the Zig-Gag Park!

448
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,360
Go!

449
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,600

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,460

I'm sorry.

482
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,800
It's going to be the final soon!

483
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,000
Catch it there, Geist!

484
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,780
You got it, Geist!

485
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,320
I did it!

486
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,260
O-Harakuro...

S-Shyo-Shyo!

"I'm not playing games anymore."

490
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,000
Ohara-kun!

491
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,720
What's going on? What are you doing while you're working?

492
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,760
You're so mature, but you're still obsessed with games.

493
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,220
What do you think your job is?

494
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,940
You're always being careful about your parents.

495
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,680
What are you supposed to do?

496
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,760
"I'm not playing games anymore."

497
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,580
Oh, I see.

498
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,560
If you think the game is weird, it's all Ryo's doing.

499
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,860
Damn it!

500
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,780
Hey, Ryo!

501
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,520
You were having fun, right?

502
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,400
Why?

503
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,460
Why?

504
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,380
Why?

505
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,080
Why?

506
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,700
Why?

507
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,500
Why?

508
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,440
Why?

509
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,980
Why?

510
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,560
Why?

511
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,080
Why?

512
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,840
Why?

Why?

515
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,580
Ryo is playing for games all the time.

516
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,420
Why?

517
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,040
Why?

518
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,780
Why?

519
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,160
Why?

520
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,100
Why are you always playing games?

521
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,900
Why?

522
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,280
It doesn't matter, but

523
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,760
The title of this anime is so long

524
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,060
This is Katsushika-ku, Kameari Park, my first appearance

525
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,400
Why?

526
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,880
Why?

527
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,360
Why?

528
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,440
Everyone together!

529
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,460
Why?

530
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,660
What?

531
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:33,240
You said there's something you don't like about lemons?

532
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,460
If you say that, even if you go to elementary school, you'll have trouble with your school lunch

533
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,720
Leave it to me, I'll fix your likes and dislikes

534
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,520
So, what's wrong?

535
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,460
Next time, "I hate lemons without eating them"

536
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,840
Please watch

537
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,060
There's a Kameari over there

538
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,940
Ah, there's definitely a Kameari

539
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,680
Everyone, come to our town

540
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,780
Thank you!
