[01:00.000 --> 01:03.180] Ah, puripuripuripuri, puripuripuripuri, forgive...
[01:03.180 --> 01:13.500] Ahhhhhhhhh
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.280] Binabi Gazey ni Honi
[01:19.280 --> 01:21.000] Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.000] Binabi Gazey ni Honi
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.640] Thank you
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000] Police officer Ryotsu appears
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.000] Here he comes!
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.000] Here he comes!
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000] The police are really motivated, Ryo-san!
[02:22.000 --> 02:23.000] He's late!
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.000] I can't believe he let me stay in a place like this!
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.000] He's late!
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000] I can't believe he let me stay in a place like this
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000] What kind of nerve does he have?
[02:32.000 --> 02:33.000] He's in the way!
[02:47.000 --> 02:48.000] No way
[02:48.000 --> 02:49.000] Wait!
[02:56.000 --> 02:57.000] What is he?!
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000] It's Ryoutsu Kankichi!
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000] Kamearu, a super walletless, super beast, and super careless caveman!
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000] Police outside, wait!
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000] Primitives outside!
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000] Are you angry just so you can catch this Ryotsu Kankichi?
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000] We're now over 30km/h!
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000] And now 40km, 50km, 60km, 70km, 80km!
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000] The tachometer is entering the red dawn at its highest rotation!
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000] Hang on and 90 degrees!
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000] So awful!
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000] Enough!
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000] Ugh...!
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000] I did it
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.000] Just in time
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.000] Enough!
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000] Just in time
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.000] Just in time, just in time
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000] If you try, you can do it, I'm glad.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000] That's not good, Ryo-san.
[04:35.000 --> 04:36.000] You broke the glass.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000] The manager will get angry with you again.
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000] Hey Ryo-chan.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000] I watered that flower every day.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000] It finally bloomed.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000] If you touch it again, I won't forgive you.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000] He's still as noisy as ever.
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.000] What's up?
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000] The manager hasn't come yet.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000] He hasn't.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000] Most people who are in charge of others should always
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000] come 30 minutes early.
[05:03.000 --> 05:04.000] Ryo-san
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000] What's wrong?
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000] Chief
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000] You're here early again today
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.000] Wow, you're coming from that remote area
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000] You commute two and a half hours every day
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000] How great
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000] You're the model for all police officers
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000] You don't need audio, do you?
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000] You weren't late at all today
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000] He made a great save just one minute before the game
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000] Wow
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000] No matter how old you are, you're always doing
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000] You're just like the neighborhood bully
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000] How many island records do you think you've written
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000] Are you planning on getting into the kinesthetic book or something?
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000] That's why you don't even have a wife
[06:00.000 --> 06:03.000] Live your life more steadily
[06:03.000 --> 06:07.000] There's a song by Kiyoko Suisenji that I like that goes like this
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.000] One step a day
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.000] Three steps in three days
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.800] Three steps forward, two steps back. What a mess!
[06:18.800 --> 06:21.600] No no no, you're like the manager's rice paddy!
[06:22.360 --> 06:26.000] That's it, that's it. Three steps forward, two steps back in life.
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.600] It's the same if you take a step forward and then rest.
[06:33.600 --> 06:38.600] I was foolish to try to teach you humility in life.
[06:40.320 --> 06:41.800] My head hurts.
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.800] It's finally over. I'll remember that you're an idiot for the second time.
[06:53.800 --> 06:57.800] Oh, boss. Did you forget something?
[07:01.600 --> 07:03.800] That's right, today was payday.
[07:04.600 --> 07:07.200] I don't want to do this to you, but there's no other way.
[07:07.200 --> 07:11.800] Listen, Ryoutsu. Just because you get some money doesn't mean you should spend it straight away.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000] Think about the future and use it wisely.
[07:17.000 --> 07:17.600] Yes.
[07:22.200 --> 07:24.600] You can get another radio-controlled car now.
[07:27.400 --> 07:32.000] What are you doing, boss? With the fruits of my sweat and tears from a month!
[07:32.600 --> 07:36.800] The door, the glass, and the compensation for my bike.
[07:37.400 --> 07:39.200] It's so sturdy.
[07:39.200 --> 07:41.600] Oh well. If only I had this much more.
[07:41.600 --> 07:44.200] I've got it, it's payday!
[07:48.800 --> 07:51.600] I've come to collect the money due.
[07:52.400 --> 07:55.400] No, the whole shopping district is here!
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.800] Shit, if it's like this, run away!
[07:58.800 --> 07:59.800] Don't come!
[08:00.200 --> 08:01.200] Boss!
[08:01.200 --> 08:04.000] He's not coming, hold down Ryotsu's legs!
[08:04.800 --> 08:05.800] Y-Yes!
[08:06.800 --> 08:08.000] Let go! Let go!
[08:08.600 --> 08:10.400] It won't come out! Let go!
[08:11.600 --> 08:14.400] Come on everyone, please take it.
[08:14.400 --> 08:15.400] Let go!
[08:16.000 --> 08:17.400] Sorry, Ryo-san.
[08:17.400 --> 08:20.200] The game software and the plastic model dive are 38,000 yen.
[08:20.200 --> 08:21.200] I'll have it.
[08:21.600 --> 08:23.800] Ramen, 22,000 yen.
[08:24.600 --> 08:27.200] Beer and whisky, 28,000 yen.
[08:27.200 --> 08:28.600] Hitoshi, please pass!
[08:29.800 --> 08:32.200] Raisins, 18,000 yen.
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.400] The change, 3,000 yen.
[08:34.400 --> 08:36.400] Seriously, seriously?
[08:36.400 --> 08:38.200] My gary!
[08:43.200 --> 08:44.200] 150 yen.
[08:45.400 --> 08:48.200] Is that all you're gonna get this month?
[08:48.200 --> 08:50.000] You got what you deserve.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.200] That's why I say you have to live a stable life.
[08:53.200 --> 08:54.200] Boss!

[08:54.600 --> 08:56.200] You can't be a liar!

[08:56.200 --> 08:59.000] Be a man and try to live on that for a month!

[08:59.000 --> 09:00.400] No way!

[09:00.400 --> 09:04.200] Neither Terai nor Reiko should lend money to Ryotsu!

[09:04.800 --> 09:07.600] There are family theories in the virtual world too.

[09:08.000 --> 09:11.600] That's average, Ryo-chan, you can live on that alone.
[09:12.200 --> 09:14.000] That's right, don't spoil him.
[09:14.000 --> 09:15.200] It's for Ryotsu's sake.
[09:15.400 --> 09:16.200] Manager!
[09:16.600 --> 09:20.000] Don't say that, just give me 50,000, no, even 30,000.
[09:21.000 --> 09:22.600] Then 20,000!
[09:23.600 --> 09:24.400] Ten thousand!
[09:24.400 --> 09:26.800] At least 1,000 yen!
[09:26.800 --> 09:27.800] No!
[09:30.600 --> 09:31.800] Good job!
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.600] I'm not going to cry to anyone anymore.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000] I'd rather starve to death than cry to these cold-hearted people!
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.800] I told you, don't forget those words.
[09:44.400 --> 09:47.000] I don't care if you come crying to me because you're hungry!
[09:50.400 --> 09:54.600] For 150 yen, I'll give you a luxurious life!
[09:55.400 --> 09:56.600] It's just a child's quarrel.
[09:56.600 --> 09:57.400] Really?
[10:00.400 --> 10:03.000] My stomach clock is really accurate.
[10:05.400 --> 10:06.000] Huh?
[10:09.200 --> 10:10.000] It's closed!
[10:10.000 --> 10:11.400] Reiko's not here!
[10:30.400 --> 10:33.600] Shall I get some lunch while you're out?
[10:39.600 --> 10:42.400] Ouch!
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.200] Ryo-chan, I'd rather you starve to death than cry!
[10:46.200 --> 10:48.400] Who was it that said that, and where was it from?
[10:50.200 --> 10:53.000] Shit, they could read my behavior patterns.
[11:01.400 --> 11:03.400] Give me your bed!

[11:03.400 --> 11:05.400] No, you can't!

[11:05.400 --> 11:06.400] It's mine!

[11:06.400 --> 11:07.400] Give it to me!

[11:08.400 --> 11:11.400] Ryo-chan, it's annoying when you steal other people's stuff!

[11:12.400 --> 11:14.400] Shut up! Do you have a name written on a grain of rice?

[11:16.400 --> 11:17.400] Give it to me!

[11:19.400 --> 11:21.400] Ryo-chan, stop it!

[11:22.400 --> 11:23.400] Stop it!

[11:23.400 --> 11:24.400] It's a waking moment!

[11:30.400 --> 11:31.400] Yay!

[11:40.400 --> 11:43.400] Reiko, that's fine!

[11:53.400 --> 11:55.400] When it comes to the real thing, it's amazing.
[11:55.400 --> 11:56.400] Huh?
[12:02.400 --> 12:03.400] Dammit!
[12:12.400 --> 12:15.400] Next time I see it, I'll wrap it around my neck!
[12:16.400 --> 12:17.400] Huh?
[12:23.400 --> 12:25.400] I'm hungry
[12:26.400 --> 12:28.400] Do you have anything to eat?
[12:29.400 --> 12:31.400] Oh, I found it! Kagami mochi!
[12:32.400 --> 12:34.400] There's always something to eat somewhere.
[12:35.400 --> 12:37.400] A little bit of suit ponzu sauce.
[12:38.400 --> 12:39.400] Oh, I put in too much.
[12:40.400 --> 12:41.400] This might make it spy-like.
[12:42.400 --> 12:43.400] I'll add salt to make it dry.
[12:46.400 --> 12:47.400] You've put in way too much.
[12:48.400 --> 12:49.400] Let's add sugar.
[12:52.400 --> 12:54.400] Oh well, that's about right.
[12:55.400 --> 12:58.400] Finish with tonkatsu sauce
[12:59.400 --> 13:00.400] Mass-produced hotpot is complete!
[13:01.400 --> 13:04.400] I had some kagami mochi left over from New Year's
[13:05.400 --> 13:08.400] Isn't that the one that was chewed up like crazy?
[13:09.400 --> 13:11.400] That's stupid, mushrooms are also a kind of chew
[13:11.400 --> 13:15.400] It also contains some Ajina leaves, so the nutritional balance is perfect
[13:16.400 --> 13:18.400] Eating Ajina leaves?
[13:19.400 --> 13:21.400] It's called Ajina, so it's bound to taste good
[13:24.400 --> 13:25.400] The colors are lacking
[13:30.400 --> 13:32.400] Mass production, y-you're Reiko's
[13:33.400 --> 13:35.400] Color is important in cooking
[13:37.400 --> 13:39.400] Let's eat!
[13:42.400 --> 13:43.400] Ryo-chan?
[13:44.400 --> 13:46.400] What are you doing!
[13:49.400 --> 13:50.400] I told you not to touch it again!

[13:51.400 --> 13:52.400] Damn it!

[13:59.400 --> 14:00.400] Damn it

[14:01.400 --> 14:03.400] Leave it for a while, you cheapskate

[14:07.400 --> 14:09.400] I'm hungry

[14:12.400 --> 14:13.400] Huh?

[14:15.400 --> 14:16.400] What is this?

[14:21.400 --> 14:23.400] There! There!

[14:24.400 --> 14:27.400] Isn't that Junpei and Kappe from the tofu shop?
[14:34.400 --> 14:36.400] Good luck, Junpei!
[14:36.400 --> 14:38.400] No no no, you're doing your job
[14:39.400 --> 14:41.400] Hmm? You've got some good skills
[14:42.400 --> 14:44.400] Those takoyaki look delicious, Stra Junpei
[14:45.400 --> 14:46.400] You have to compete with me
[14:47.400 --> 14:48.400] Huh?
[14:48.400 --> 14:49.400] With Ryo-san?
[14:49.400 --> 14:51.400] That's right, let's have a one-shot game.
[14:52.400 --> 14:54.400] If I win, I'll get these takoyaki.
[14:56.400 --> 14:57.400] If Ryo-san loses?
[14:58.400 --> 15:03.400] I'll give you anything you like from my collection, whether it's a plastic model or a video game.
[15:03.400 --> 15:04.400] Eh? A plastic model?
[15:05.400 --> 15:07.400] How about it, let's do it, Junpei.
[15:08.400 --> 15:09.400] Yeah
[15:10.400 --> 15:11.400] Do your best, Junpei!
[15:11.400 --> 15:13.400] Do your best, Junpei!
[15:16.400 --> 15:19.400] It's so lively, Ryo-san
[15:24.400 --> 15:25.400] You did it!
[15:25.400 --> 15:28.400] Already 980 points out of 1000000
[15:28.400 --> 15:29.400] You're doing pretty well
[15:29.400 --> 15:31.400] Okay, it's my turn next
[15:35.400 --> 15:36.400] Start
[15:36.400 --> 15:37.400] Start!
[15:37.400 --> 15:41.400] Kurenai left-handed
[15:59.400 --> 16:00.400] Got it
[16:02.400 --> 16:03.400] Opponent hit
[16:16.400 --> 16:17.400] We won!
[16:18.400 --> 16:19.400] Amazing
[16:20.400 --> 16:21.400] How's it going?
[16:22.400 --> 16:23.400] We lost
[16:23.400 --> 16:25.400] You should have stopped, big brother
[16:25.400 --> 16:27.400] I'll take the takoyaki as promised
[16:41.400 --> 16:42.400] Junpei-chan!
[16:43.400 --> 16:45.400] You bastard!
[16:45.400 --> 16:46.400] Are you okay?
[16:48.400 --> 16:50.400] Ryo-san, I caught him!
[16:51.400 --> 16:52.400] Leave it to me!
[16:52.400 --> 16:54.400] Wait!
[16:55.400 --> 16:56.400] Wait!
[17:00.400 --> 17:01.400] Wait!
[17:03.400 --> 17:04.400] Oh no!
[17:13.400 --> 17:14.400] You can rent a bike!
[17:15.400 --> 17:17.400] Ultra Power Turbo On!
[17:18.400 --> 17:19.400] All right!
[17:25.400 --> 17:26.400] Got it!
[17:26.400 --> 17:28.400] I'm chasing you on my bike!
[17:28.400 --> 17:29.400] There's no way I can catch up!
[17:30.400 --> 17:32.400] I'm not going to let myself get caught just because I borrowed my bike!
[17:32.400 --> 17:33.400] Are you serious?
[17:33.400 --> 17:35.400] I'll let you go!
[18:02.400 --> 18:03.400] You bastard!
[18:03.400 --> 18:05.400] Okay, let's get ahead of him!
[18:06.400 --> 18:09.400] Missile jump!
[18:32.400 --> 18:34.400] Shit, that's a shortcut!
[18:41.400 --> 18:43.400] Oh no, I took the wrong road!
[18:46.400 --> 18:48.400] Ryo-san, what are you doing?
[18:48.400 --> 18:49.400] Zum!
[18:49.400 --> 18:50.400] Fist!
[18:50.400 --> 18:51.400] Gun!
[18:53.400 --> 18:54.400] Stop it!
[18:54.400 --> 18:55.400] Stop it!
[18:56.400 --> 18:57.400] Stop it!
[18:57.400 --> 18:58.400] Stop it!

[18:58.400 --> 18:59.400] Stop it!

[18:59.400 --> 19:00.400] Stop it!

[19:00.400 --> 19:01.400] Stop it!

[19:26.400 --> 19:28.400] What are you doing, Ryo-san?

[19:28.400 --> 19:30.400] Track the run!

[19:34.400 --> 19:35.400] Wait!

[19:39.400 --> 19:40.400] I caught up with you!

[19:41.400 --> 19:42.400] They're still coming after me!
[19:42.400 --> 19:43.400] Hurry, hurry!
[19:44.400 --> 19:45.400] What a persistent guy!
[19:49.400 --> 19:52.400] Don't underestimate this base between the two places!
[19:59.400 --> 20:02.400] Can't you catch up with me at 80km?
[20:03.400 --> 20:04.400] Hurry!
[20:12.400 --> 20:14.400] Get out of the way, you stupid dog!
[20:29.400 --> 20:31.400] Looks like he's finally given up
[20:32.400 --> 20:33.400] No way!
[20:37.400 --> 20:39.400] Wait, you bastard!
[20:41.400 --> 20:43.400] Is he a monster?!
[20:58.400 --> 20:59.400] He's not following me anymore!
[21:00.400 --> 21:01.400] Good job, Ken-chan!
[21:01.400 --> 21:02.400] What's the big deal?
[21:12.400 --> 21:13.400] Damn, it's the exit!
[21:15.400 --> 21:16.400] Stop it!
[21:16.400 --> 21:17.400] Stop it!
[21:17.400 --> 21:18.400] Stop it!
[21:18.400 --> 21:19.400] Stop it!
[21:19.400 --> 21:20.400] Stop it!
[21:20.400 --> 21:21.400] Stop it!
[21:21.400 --> 21:22.400] Stop it!
[21:22.400 --> 21:23.400] Stop it!
[21:23.400 --> 21:24.400] Stop it!
[21:24.400 --> 21:25.400] Stop it!
[21:25.400 --> 21:26.400] Stop it!
[21:26.400 --> 21:27.400] Damn, it's the exit!
[21:50.400 --> 21:52.400] The culprit has been arrested, Ryo-san
[21:52.400 --> 21:53.400] Well done!
[21:56.400 --> 21:57.400] You bastard!
[21:58.400 --> 22:00.400] I'm sorry, I won't do it again
[22:02.400 --> 22:04.400] Give me back the takoyaki!
[22:06.400 --> 22:08.400] It's takoyaki, takoyaki!
[22:08.400 --> 22:10.400] Give me back my takoyaki!
[22:19.400 --> 22:21.400] You did it, Ryo-chan
[22:21.400 --> 22:24.400] It's been 8 years since we last caught a criminal
[22:24.400 --> 22:25.400] Congratulations
[22:25.400 --> 22:29.400] Well, the claws with the brains have been holding the hawks together for a while
[22:29.400 --> 22:31.400] The hawks with the brains hide their claws, right?
[22:31.400 --> 22:33.400] It doesn't suit you, Ryo-chan
[22:33.400 --> 22:35.400] Ryo-san!
[22:35.400 --> 22:37.400] Hey, Junpei
[22:37.400 --> 22:39.400] Is your leg feeling better?
[22:39.400 --> 22:42.400] This isn't a big deal
[22:42.400 --> 22:45.400] Ryo-san, we'll definitely win the game next time
[22:45.400 --> 22:49.400] Hey, hey, make sure you practice hard, Junpei
[22:51.400 --> 22:54.400] Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything yet.
[22:54.400 --> 22:56.400] Oh, that's right.
[22:56.400 --> 23:00.400] Apparently that driver was a regular traffic offender.
[23:00.400 --> 23:04.400] Maybe this will lead to a special award, a cash prize.
[23:04.400 --> 23:05.400] A cash prize!
[23:05.400 --> 23:08.400] Yay! This will save me this month!
[23:08.400 --> 23:11.400] Do you need money?
[23:14.400 --> 23:15.400] Yes!
[23:15.400 --> 23:19.400] The excellent police officer from Kameari who arrested the vicious hit-and-run criminal
[23:19.400 --> 23:23.400] Sergeant Ryotsu Kankichi is here
[23:25.400 --> 23:27.400] He'll give you a sum of money, right?
[23:27.400 --> 23:30.400] You idiot!
[23:32.400 --> 23:34.400] Look outside!
[23:38.400 --> 23:43.400] Ryotsu, I hear you've caused trouble for your neighbors again
[23:43.400 --> 23:47.400] I'll have to pay it off with next month's salary!
[23:47.400 --> 23:49.400] No way!
[23:50.400 --> 23:53.400] Please spare me!
[24:05.400 --> 24:09.400] A new police officer arrives at the station in front of Kameari Park
[24:09.400 --> 24:13.400] Apparently he's the only son of the very wealthy Nakagawa family
[24:13.400 --> 24:17.400] Do you think a rich kid like that can be a police officer?
[24:17.400 --> 24:21.400] See you next time, new police officer from the sky!
[24:47.400 --> 24:49.400] Turtle Park departure point
[25:17.400 --> 25:19.400] Turtle Park departure point
