1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,640
"Tekken"

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,900
When you're watching TV

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,740
Make sure you make the room light and stay away!

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,980
Hey, Ryo, you want to do fortune-telling again?

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,020
This time, it's about the fortune-telling of animals!

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,160
I told you that fortune-telling is all over the place!

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,900
What exactly is a fortune-telling of animals?

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,980
It's about the marriage of a young man named Koala, a monkey, and a girl named Mihara Junko!

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,620
No, Ryo! This is not a fortune-telling of animals, but a fortune-telling of gods!

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,400
Ryo, who was born on March 3rd, is a god of Kamakura!

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,160
He's proud of his average height even when he's hit by rain or wind!

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,140
If it's a god, then it's Kamakura, right?

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,220
We're all the same, right?

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,400
After the rain, as if someone was calling me

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,720
I walked back and forth, holding my mother's hand

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,560
I felt something strange at that time

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,000
So I'll give you a new tile!

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,680
I only walked through the dark side

19
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,880
Everyone was a child once, but they all forgot

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,860
A politician with a big-faced face and a blue aunt on top of his/her eyes

21
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,200
Turn and look at that corner

22
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,660
To everyone, to everyone!

23
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,840
I can meet you there

24
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,580
There's a turtle over there

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,860
Oh, there's a turtle for sure

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,500
Everyone, come to our town

27
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,600
Thank you!

28
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,740
Drink the haji and get a part-time job!

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,660
Did you have fun, Daisuke?

30
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,220
Yes!

31
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,100
I see

32
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,380
Here you are

33
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,120
Oh, this is Ohara-san

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,000
Yamada-san

35
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,560
A part-time job?

36
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,940
I'm sorry to be embarrassing, but I was fired

37
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,140
So I can't find a job

38
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,080
Here you are

39
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,600
So you knew the manager?

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,820
I was shocked. I think he's the same age as me

41
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,640
So I was shocked. I think he's the same age as me

42
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,460
There's a saying that a part-time job is not easy

43
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,740
So I was shocked. I think he's the same age as me

44
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,820
Well, he wasn't depressed, that's good

45
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,440
You should be careful too

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,560
If you're fired that young

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,660
You'll have to make a way to Ibarani

48
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,480
Don't be stupid!

49
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,040
You'll be the best in the country

50
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,900
You'll be the best in the country

51
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,500
Don't be stupid!

52
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,440
You're a good person

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
It's okay

54
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,580
It's fine. Even if it is, I can live no matter what I do.

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,120
Because I'm like a part-time job for the police.

56
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,240
Idiot! Are you proud of that?

57
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,620
Mr. Omari, the suspicious guy who sneaked into the building...

58
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:36,920
Huh?

59
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,460
The culprit found out that there was a continuous storm of buildings during the execution.

60
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,060
Thank you all for your cooperation.

61
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,160
Thank you for your cooperation.

62
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,640
So, Chief, let's go to the library.

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,900
Ryotsu, why do you have to go to the library?

64
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,800
There's no other way. They say they're paying for the patrol car.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,880
It's better to wait for the patrol car.

66
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,380
No, it's better for us to go to the library.

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,360
It's a bonus.

68
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,460
Please wait a minute, Chief.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,280
What? What's wrong?

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,820
I peed.

71
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,640
What? You're not a child, so be patient.

72
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,540
No! I'll leak!

73
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,220
I'll do it in this park.

74
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,160
Ryotsu, wait!

75
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,200
I can't help it.

76
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,380
Sir, please hurry up.

77
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,100
Don't be in a hurry. You'll be in charge of the car for a while.

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,080
Take a good breath now.

79
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,020
Sir, there's no good air in a place like this.

80
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,440
That's right.

81
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,660
Is this a toilet?

82
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,760
I'm sorry, Ryotsu.

83
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,700
Hey, wait!

84
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,860
Oh, no!

85
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,320
Wait!

86
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,880
Wait!

87
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,260
Ryotsu!

88
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,300
I'm sorry!

89
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,520
Sir, this!

90
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,840
Damn it! If you let me go here, I'll get a bonus.

91
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,180
But I'll be in trouble!

92
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,940
Wait a minute!

93
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,060
Hey, wait!

94
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,700
What?!

95
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,360
What are you doing?

96
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,800
Sakuya!

97
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,680
Wait!

98
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,660
You'll be in trouble if you do this!

99
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,160
ah!

100
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,880
Oh, Ryotsu's not here!

101
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,260
Wait!

102
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,840
Come on!

103
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,840
No! No! No!

104
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,660
No! No! No!

105
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,400
No! No! No!

106
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,320
Oh! Oh! Oh!

107
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,180
You idiot! You want to burn me alive?

108
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,160
You can do both, but it's your responsibility as a director, Ohara-kun!

109
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,240
I'm sorry. What should I say?

110
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,740
I don't want to hear anything!

111
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,780
You're fired! You're fired!

112
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,900
I'm fired?

113
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,320
Chief, the time has come when you should be afraid.

114
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,120
Chief, are you also fired?

115
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,800
You idiot! You too!

116
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,180
Huh? I knew it.

117
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,560
I never thought I'd be fired.

118
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,720
Chief, you can't just keep sighing.

119
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,500
If you do this, you have to find your own way to live.

120
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,200
A way to live?

121
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,840
Yes.

122
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,320
You can work part-time or do anything to earn money for your living.

123
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,640
I-I see. Ryo-kun, do you have a good part-time job?

124
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,220
Yes.

125
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,600
Chief, do you have any special skills?

126
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,240
Special skills?

127
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,920
Well, I have a master's degree, a master's degree, a sword skills...

128
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,900
You can't have special skills like that.

129
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,700
You need to be a high-ranking officer or use a computer.

130
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,920
You don't have any special skills.

131
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,860
I can't have that.

132
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,480
But I have a career as a police officer for 34 years...

133
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
That's useless!

134
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,760
What?

135
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,900
You can't have a license to handle dangerous objects or a cooking license.

136
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,020
What would you need to get a fire-fighting license?

137
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,740
What would you need to be a fireman or an instructor?

138
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,520
There's no need for that.

139
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,300
You have to have some knowledge of paarthing.

140
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,040
You can also make an assistant.

141
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,220
If you have enough experience, you can make hats.

142
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,920
If you can handle it, you can also make cookies.

143
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,740
You have to be good at cooking and they'll be able to eat spagetti in your appetite!

144
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,760
What?

145
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,080
You really can't do basic means!

146
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,040
At this age, it's tough to find it.

147
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,360
No, Ryo-kun.

148
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,480
I have to protect my own life, too.

149
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,940
I'm counting on you, Ryotsu.

150
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,840
Hmm. It's not good to be asked by a former boss.

151
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,280
Former...? I'm counting on you.

152
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,780
You can't refuse a former boss' request.

153
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,600
Former?

154
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,380
Well, if I'm with you, it'll be fine.

155
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,180
Let's look for a part-time job together.

156
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm counting on you. You're the only one I can count on.

157
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,860
Leave it to me.

158
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,340
I'm counting on you.

159
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:39,620
Hahaha.

160
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,960
Welcome. How are the fries?

161
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,480
Hmm. They're a bit hard.

162
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,700
You don't look happy.

163
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,360
There are a lot of young people around here, so you must be hostile.

164
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,320
N-No, I'm not.

165
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,340
What do you mean?

166
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,700
I hate young people.

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,020
I'm in trouble. There are only young customers.

168
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,380
That's right.

169
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,940
I'm not angry, I'm not in trouble, I don't think anything.

170
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,560
The rule is basic.

171
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,380
Can you do it?

172
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,060
It's all right.

173
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,560
Look, this is not a store for old-timers.

174
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,220
Hey, I'll order.

175
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,660
Yes, I'm home.

176
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,240
Welcome. We have an easy-to-see menu here.

177
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,420
I don't need it.

178
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,880
Just a shake and cheeseburger, please.

179
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,620
Yes, one shake and one cheeseburger.

180
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,100
Would you like fries with it?

181
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,620
I said I don't need it.

182
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,900
That's what I said, right? Hurry up.

183
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,560
Here's your shake and cheeseburger.

184
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,740
It's 380 yen.

185
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,900
That Ryotsu doesn't get hungry easily.

186
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,220
It's a perfect match.

187
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,600
Thank you very much.

188
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,480
Please take it easy.

189
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,540
You put up with it well.

190
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,820
Because fast food is a lot of fun with a smile.

191
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,380
Usually, I kick that guy, but it's for the money.

192
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,500
It's amazing that the share is for the money.

193
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,360
It's for living.

194
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:07,980
Welcome.

195
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,780
Now you try it.

196
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,540
Smile, smile.

197
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,520
Welcome.

198
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,540
Here's an easy menu.

199
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,300
Why? Are you an old man?

200
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,140
I get mad when I see an old man.

201
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,200
What?

202
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,120
Don't get angry.

203
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,620
What are you doing?

204
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,420
You're a bad old man.

205
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,880
I feel bad.

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,760
What?

207
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,200
What?

208
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,540
I can't help it.

209
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,460
What?

210
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,020
Shut up.

211
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,320
You be quiet.

212
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,660
You?

213
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,560
I can't help it.

214
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,220
You're right.

215
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:50,940
I can't help it.

216
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,380
Smile.

217
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,420
Stop laughing.

218
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll give you a cute little guy.

219
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,540
You don't know how to talk.

220
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,660
Wait a minute.

221
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,540
I'll teach you something called courtesy.

222
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,060
You stupid.

223
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,340
You're too fast.

224
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,420
You need to act.

225
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,400
I'm serious.

226
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,180
Stop right there, kid.

227
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,360
What are you doing?

228
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,480
The cost?

229
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,760
Each color's different.

230
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,180
Just one.

231
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,940
So, you're making me laugh?

232
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:34,980
Get out of the way and get out of my way.

233
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,940
I can't hear you.

234
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,440
No, you can't hear me.

235
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,740
It's a part-time job, so please do it as the manual says.

236
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,860
I got it.

237
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,740
Listen, no matter what kind of guy comes, don't get angry.

238
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,660
I got it.

239
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm hungry.

240
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm hungry.

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,360
Welcome.

242
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,040
Here.

243
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,720
I'm hungry.

244
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,700
I'm hungry.

245
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,680
I'm hungry.

246
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,760
You guys.

247
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,380
You think it's okay to eat something that you can't see?

248
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,400
What?

249
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,740
Shut up.

250
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,880
I'm hungry.

251
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,300
You should pay when you go out.

252
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,920
You idiots.

253
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,300
You're just like you.

254
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,220
You're pretending not to see.

255
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,380
But you're a man.

256
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:35,900
What?

257
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:36,640
Listen, you idiot.

258
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,400
Do you have any respect for your family?

259
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,920
You've got a strong temper.

260
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,840
So, you want to be fired again.

261
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,700
After all they fired a kid.

262
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,400
What's going on in this country.

263
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,440
I can feel the worst.

264
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,820
It's impossible for the head of the company to be a customer.

265
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:06,980
Yeah.

266
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,220
So I've found something that suits you.

267
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,340
It's a daily wage, so you'll have the feeling that you're working.

268
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,540
What do you think, chief?

269
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,420
You don't have to be careful with this book.

270
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,720
Well, I guess.

271
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,180
What are you doing, old man? You're so annoying.

272
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,820
Ah, sorry.

273
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,800
Clean up that early and bring the money over there.

274
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Y-yes, sir.

275
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,380
Chief, please be careful with your foot.

276
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,820
I-I'm fine.

277
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,420
No, I'm not.

278
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,260
I'll rest for a bit.

279
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,040
Again?

280
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,980
Well, it can't be helped.

281
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,000
Then let's put it down here.

282
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,900
Be careful.

283
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,960
Lucky, lunch time!

284
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,780
Th-thanks.

285
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,340
Chief, this won't last a day for just half a day.

286
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,220
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,480
Huh?

288
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,020
Hey, didn't you have my lunch there?

289
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,440
I left mine there, too.

290
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,120
Huh?

291
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:26,920
You're putting a lock here?

292
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,740
No, it's illegal.

293
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,340
But the chief will be fired one after another.

294
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,540
If you say no, I'll say no.

295
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:34,740
Good luck, sir.

296
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,160
Hey, what are you doing?

297
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:36,560
Huh?

298
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,600
No filling up.

299
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,880
All right.

300
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,280
Come with us to the police station.

301
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,140
Well, um, you know.

302
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,940
No, no.

303
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,920
We're from the police department.

304
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,420
I was just collecting the loot.

305
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,060
Collecting?

306
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,340
Chief, run away!

307
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,520
Hey, get in the car!

308
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,700
Chief, get out of the car!

309
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,340
Hey!

310
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,920
Oh, come on!

311
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,280
I don't want to live like this anymore.

312
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,880
I never thought my part-time job would be this hard.

313
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,320
That was a good bath. I'm finally tired.

314
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,280
Thank you for your hard work today.

315
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,940
You seem to be tired lately, but please don't overdo it.

316
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,540
It's not easy for you to be sick.

317
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,860
I'll try my best.

318
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,480
It's my duty to support my family no matter how hard it is.

319
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:12,500
I'll try my best.

320
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,300
You have to be patient this time.

321
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,120
I'm your former boss, so I'm doing my best.

322
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,780
Former boss...

323
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,220
This is really the last part-time job.

324
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,400
I'm afraid of heights.

325
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,140
Don't look down.

326
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,360
Please wipe the windows properly.

327
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,660
No, I'm scared.

328
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,600
It's too scary.

329
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,220
It's for living.

330
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,180
If you don't want to, I don't want to.

331
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,240
Get out of the way.

332
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,040
No.

333
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,300
Don't mess with me.

334
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,280
Stop it.

335
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,880
Don't push me in a place like this.

336
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,580
Who are you?

337
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,260
Don't step on the switch.

338
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,040
Ryotsu, stop.

339
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,840
Down, down.

340
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,620
Down?

341
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,660
You're going too far.

342
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,380
Up, up.

343
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
What are you talking about?

344
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,800
Stop.

345
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,200
Stop.

346
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,360
Good.

347
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:27,960
Here.

348
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,140
Down slowly.

349
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,160
Stop.

350
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,800
Ryotsu, look.

351
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,540
What?

352
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,540
Look.

353
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,220
It's him.

354
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,280
The one who left the building in the storm.

355
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,900
That bastard.

356
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,620
What?

357
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,560
What are you going to do, Ryotsu?

358
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,460
Let's break through the window and get in.

359
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,900
Idiot.

360
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,720
The windows at such a high place are all thick and double.

361
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,300
If you hit with a hammer, you can only get cracks.

362
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,640
And if the glass shards fall down, it's bad.

363
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,040
Let's climb up and step inside for now.

364
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,840
Roger.

365
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,380
Good.

366
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,560
Okay.

367
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,340
Captain, hurry.

368
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,680
Oh, this must be the worst floor, Captain.

369
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,220
What?

370
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,280
What? This is the 80th floor, so it's probably 30 floors below.

371
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,660
All right, let's go 50 floors.

372
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,200
Roger.

373
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,220
But you saved me on Sunday.

374
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,360
It's easy to find the culprit without anyone.

375
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,540
Ryo-chan, you go there.

376
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,440
Roger.

377
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,760
Wrong.

378
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,740
Wrong.

379
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,320
Wrong.

380
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,640
Wrong.

381
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:07,940
Wrong.

382
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,320
Wrong.

383
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,380
Wrong.

384
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,340
Wrong.

385
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,360
Wrong.

386
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,800
Did you find it?

387
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,440
It's not this floor.

388
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,340
All right, let's go one floor below.

389
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,920
Hey, is this floor all office?

390
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,160
That's right.

391
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,260
What about a private room like a law firm or a president's office?

392
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,180
Private room?

393
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,480
I think it's two or three floors below.

394
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,700
All right, wait.

395
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,200
Yes, sir.

396
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,540
It's two or three floors below.

397
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,100
Good luck, sir.

398
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,200
I'm coming first.

399
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,520
Please come after me.

400
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,380
Ooh.

401
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:49,860
Ooh.

402
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,160
Ooh.

403
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,380
Ooh.

404
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,620
Ooh.

405
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,780
Oh.

406
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,220
Oh.

407
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,260
Oh.

408
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,060
Oh.

409
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,500
Oh.

410
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,300
Oh.

411
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,480
Oh.

412
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:03,640
Oh.

413
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,280
Oh.

414
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,440
Oh.

415
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,580
Oh.

416
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:15,720
I'm going to heave a good night's sleep, so get some rest.

417
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,540
Pack the bags and go to the bedroom.

418
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,220
Wait up!

419
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,460
Are you okay, chief?

420
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,040
I'm fine.

421
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,000
Go down.

422
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,340
Roger that.

423
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,540
Damn, down.

424
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,360
Alright, we're here.

425
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,220
Damn, we're down!

426
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,340
Wait, are we really down?

427
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,980
Huh?

428
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,240
I can't do this...

429
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,680
Huh?

430
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,300
I'll never let you get away with this!

431
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,120
Prepare yourself!

432
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,780
Wait!

433
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,680
Wait!

434
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,380
Kanishiro!

435
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,400
You did it, Ryotsu.

436
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,100
Yes, sir!

437
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,580
Thank you for your help in arresting the culprit.

438
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,360
You're the one who...

439
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,580
You're in my way.

440
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,580
Yes, sir.

441
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,420
I'm sorry.

442
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,180
I'm sorry.

443
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,560
Ohara, you're a great man.

444
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,260
I didn't know you were following the culprit while you were working part-time during the probation period.

445
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,160
Well, how should I say it?

446
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,160
The long-standing reputation as a policeman has led to the arrest of the culprit.

447
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,020
What did you just say, sir?

448
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,180
The probation period?

449
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,000
That's right. Congratulations.

450
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,300
From tomorrow on,

451
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,520
you'll be the head of the police force.

452
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,640
Then, I'll be the head of the police force.

453
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,040
Who said that?

454
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,540
I won't let a policeman like you go.

455
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Oh, thank you very much.

456
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,700
That's great, sir.

457
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,320
Let's work hard together as policemen.

458
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,940
Ryotsu...

459
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,620
I see.

460
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,360
At that time, I knew that being a policeman was my job.

461
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,720
I'm glad I became a policeman.

462
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,500
So, you didn't come to the police station.

463
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,220
And Ryo-chan and the chief.

464
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,640
Well...

465
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,560
So, the young men's dislike for the chief is a little better, isn't it?

466
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,420
That's right.

467
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,240
I have to understand their way of thinking.

468
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,140
They don't always pretend to be watching.

469
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,060
They're doing pretty well as a team.

470
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,440
Their appearance is good and so are their ways of thinking.

471
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,200
You guys!

472
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:43,940
What?

473
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,160
Huh?

474
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,920
Don't you have to throw away your empty cans in the trash?

475
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,580
Hey, wait!

476
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,000

Profiler from the main office?

500
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,600
Is profiling the latest investigation method

501
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,860
that analyzes the psychology of the culprit

502
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,680
and divides the number of criminals?

503
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,220
I understand that,

504
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,460
