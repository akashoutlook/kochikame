1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,840
Slytherin

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,340
When you're watching TV

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,960
Make sure to stay on top of the room and take off in the meantime

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,340
Soumet

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:29,980
I・Soument

6
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,680
It's so kind of you

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,720
From the water tank of the Tunganiboshi

8
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,300
To the Taishakuten

9
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,460
The sun is setting

10
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:23,500
Tomorrow is already over

11
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,360
It's over, right?

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,860
If I were to win again

13
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,140
I'd lose my happiness

14
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,440
I've realized

15
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,720
I'm such an idiot

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,440
The infinite universe

17
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,700
There are still unknown things there

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,440
From now on

19
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,160
For another thirty minutes

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,460
Your eyes will be separated from your body

21
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,120
And enter this mysterious time

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,340
A gift from space

23
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,580
Ryo, it'll be hard for the chief to find you making that

24
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,180
It'll be fine

25
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:23,860
I'll finish it before the chief comes

26
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,100
If you're so motivated

27
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,020
At least half of it will be for work

28
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,140
Okay, one more

29
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:49,540
You're eating so hard

30
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,600
You're eating so hard

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:51,760
You're eating so hard

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,040
You're eating so hard

33
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,640
The dessert's like a diamond

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,980
Rub it in

35
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,100
Oh my gosh

36
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,260
What are you doing?

37
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,520
Oh, hello

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:03,840
What are you doing?

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,360
What are you doing?

40
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,920
Gyo

41
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,860
It was you

42
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,420
Be careful

43
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,640
What happens, is it your weight?

44
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,240
What do you mean by "how"

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,400
I can't be stupid

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Let me see

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,300
The gun was 그러면ed

48
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,780
Oh my gosh

49
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,260
A hole is open.

50
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,700
It looks like something fell from the sky.

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,280
I wonder if it's a meteorite.

52
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,120
I'll check it out.

53
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,200
Senpai!

54
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,880
It's broken, but it seems to be a meteorite.

55
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,280
Senpai, it's better not to get too close.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,860
I wonder if that's true.

57
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,600
Even so, it was dangerous.

58
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,800
If it had been a little more off, it would have been a direct hit on the exhaust.

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,840
That's true.

60
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,840
The wild horses are gathering.

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,020
I'll contact the office.

62
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,120
I'll clean up.

63
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,780
Let's leave before it's too late.

64
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,020
My Zero-Sense was shot down!

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,780
It can't be helped. You were a genius.

66
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,840
It was almost complete.

67
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,700
Damn it!

68
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,380
What is this?

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,880
It's like a real rock.

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,340
Ryo!

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,760
Help me clean up without eating the rice crackers.

72
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,180
Oh, no!

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,280
I have to wake up early tomorrow and watch Otsuka on Mezamashi TV.

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,660
I'm sorry, but I'm counting on you.

75
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,940
You're cheating, Ryo!

76
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,520
He ran away.

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,260
It's troublesome to be asked about anything at the first discovery.

78
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:52,060
Are there any differences in molecular structure in the rock?

79
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:52,920
That's right.

80
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,100
Never-Earth materials.

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,360
Is that dangerous?

82
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,640
Sir.

83
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,160
Professor will be coming this afternoon.

84
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,740
Phew, I slept well!

85
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,980
Somehow I feel good today, though.

86
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,240
That's the guy.

87
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,580
It's light for your legs, too!

88
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,860
What? It seems my body just floated away!

89
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,840
Go away!

90
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,420
What is going on here?

91
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,520
She floated into the universe!

92
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:42,640
What?

93
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,340
What?

94
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,980
What?

95
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,400
I can't feel my weight.

96
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,900
What's going on?

97
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,080
Ryotsu!

98
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,100
Yes, sir?

99
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,800
What are you doing here?

100
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,100
I'd like to ask you something.

101
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,400
Actually...

102
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,780
Sorry, I caught a cold.

103
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,680
Ryotsu?

104
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:12,900
Yes, sir!

105
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,500
Get him!

106
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,280
Ryotsu, where did you go?

107
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
I finally stopped.

108
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,260
Idiot! Get away from me!

109
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,300
Yes, sir!

110
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,620
Three grams?

111
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,700
What's going on? I can't believe it.

112
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,000
I can't believe it either.

113
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,500
What a noisy man.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,500
You're not only doing normal things, but you're also light.

115
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,840
Don't sneeze at me!

116
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,720
Sorry.

117
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,940
I'm glad you put on weight.

118
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,260
I'm a balloon.

119
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,760
But what on earth happened to you?

120
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,100
If you know that, I won't bother you.

121
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:30,120
What is that?

122
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,240
I have a bad feeling about this.

123
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,660
Oolong tea is the world's best drink in the world.

124
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,300
Professor Eizaki.

125
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,140
It's you, after all.

126
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,300
Hello, everyone in the expulsion center.

127
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,860
What the hell are you doing here?

128
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,680
Thank you.

129
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,380
Chashu, shumai, ginger, rose, hoikoro.

130
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,460
Don't say something you don't understand.

131
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,840
Well, I've been studying Chinese at Peking University since last month.

132
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,060
I finally got to speak Chinese in my daily conversation.

133
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,260
You're just lining up Chinese food menus.

134
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,200
Japanese are not good at it.

135
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,500
Ah, Japanese are short-tempered.

136
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,740
The 4,000-year teaching of China is like the flow of the Yosu River.

137
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,200
It's about living comfortably.

138
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,320
You're going to go to China again in a while?

139
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,380
But I think Chinese people will get angry if they see us.

140
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,880
So, Professor, what do you want to do today?

141
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,700
I heard that a meteorite collapsed near here last night.

142
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,440
What?

143
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,120
So, a special professor is coming.

144
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,980
Professor Ezaki?

145
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,580
Didn't you major in mechanical engineering?

146
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,900
Space physics is also a professor's specialty.

147
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,640
Is there something in that meteorite?

148
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,380
Actually, that meteorite is a special meteorite made of an unknown substance.

149
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,000
And then what changed?

150
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,720
If you say something has changed...

151
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,680
I think it's about this idiot's weight becoming 3 grams.

152
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,080
That's it!

153
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,820
The meteorite must be wrong!

154
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,700
What?

155
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,960
Look.

156
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,000
The meteorite is stuck on this rock.

157
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,940
Oh, that's right.

158
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,160
No way.

159
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,480
This meteorite is made of a anti-gravity substance that is not on Earth.

160
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,420
Because of that, the body has become lighter.

161
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,440
Anti-gravity substance?

162
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,820
What's that?

163
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,100
In other words, it's a substance that has the power to repel the earth's gravity.

164
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,940
But how did it get inside your body?

165
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,360
I don't know!

166
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,500
After all, you picked up something that was falling and ate it.

167
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,580
Even if it was me, I wouldn't pick up a meteorite and eat it.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,080
Oh, by the way, at that time...

169
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,020
What is this?

170
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,820
It's hard like a real rock.

171
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,980
There was a meteorite in that rock.

172
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,160
That's right.

173
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,580
I didn't expect there to be a difference between rock and rock.

174
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,360
But it's strange.

175
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,820
Why did a meteorite, which should have the power to repel the earth's gravity, fall on Earth?

176
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,320
Rick.

177
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,400
Come to think of it...

178
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,680
There's a kind of amino acid that's affecting it.

179
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,280
Amino acid?

180
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,080
You!

181
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Last night, after putting a meteorite inside your body, did you eat something?

182
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,140
Is it a lebanin?

183
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,620
That's right!

184
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,080
As a result of the fusion of a meteorite and a lebanin in his stomach,

185
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,260
the characteristic of a anti-gravity substance has been created.

186
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,280
Beautiful.

187
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,600
It's a little...

188
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,040
Is that so?

189
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
I don't think I can trust you.

190
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,100
What?

191
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,380
Hey!

192
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,720
Ryo!

193
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,860
Senpai!

194
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,400
What's going on?

195
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,180
Apparently, the anti-gravity substance has increased.

196
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,300
At this rate, it will soon penetrate the atmosphere and enter the space.

197
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,580
I'm not kidding!

198
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,220
Please, do something!

199
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,460
You're really unlucky.

200
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,960
Why?

201
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Because I have a secret scroll that tells you how to make the Chinese 4,000-year-old anti-gravity substance.

202
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,160
Why anti-gravity?

203
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,920
Wasn't it in the physics of the universe?

204
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,200
You!

205
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,780
Don't underestimate anti-gravity!

206
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,220
Anti-gravity is to listen to anything!

207
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,220
That's not what I meant.

208
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,420
I understand.

209
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,900
The medicine for this man is...

210
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,380
Whatever the symptom, if you drink this, it will heal in one shot!

211
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,000
It's a medicine!

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,580
If you drink this, the influence of the meteor will disappear!

213
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,820
You're not convincing at all!

214
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,300
If that's the case, I will return to China as it is.

215
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,880
Wait for me!

216
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,560
All right, let me drink it!

217
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,220
I'm counting on you, Professor.

218
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,980
With the power of science, I have no choice but to rely on the mystery of the East and the West!

219
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,220
Please!

220
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,920
Don't abandon Ryo!

221
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,460
I can't help it if you're asked to teach me something cute and beautiful.

222
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,200
Then, let's...

223
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,980
Before that, let's stop here.

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,280
It's tea time.

225
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:57,900
Huh?

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,020
Ah...

227
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,520
Ah...

228
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,300
Ah...

229
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,260
This is really...

230
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,380
Ah...

231
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,500
Not good, right?

232
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,140
That's enough!

233
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,380
Hurry up and do it!

234
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,800
The End

271
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,260
Here, drink it.

272
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:56,920
Huh?

273
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,440
You're drinking this?

274
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,440
It's fine. It should be easier to drink than the blue juice.

275
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,160
Be patient, Ryozu!

276
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,260
This is no time to be luxurious!

277
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,160
I know, but I can't help it.

278
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,360
The taste is unbearable.

279
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,820
Sen-senpai!

280
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,560
Ryo-chan!

281
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,500
It's coming down.

282
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
Yay! It's a success!

283
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,940
You did it! You're on the floor!

284
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,240
Ryozu, try on the weight scale.

285
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,940
I did it, chief!

286
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,920
It's exactly the same as before!

287
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,340
You did well, senpai.

288
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,160
Congratulations, Ryo-chan!

289
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,100
There's no such thing as impossibility in the history of 4,000 years of China.

290
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,260
Ryo-chan!

291
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,380
Ah-ha! Thank goodness.

292
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,940
Seems like what you're saying about theDrive's invention is totally legitimate.

293
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,040
I've finally got back to work.

294
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,020
Yay!

295
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,480
The kid is coming!

296
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,980
You bastard!

297
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:03,860
Wait!

298
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,360
Oh no! The police!

299
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,360
How can you run away without me tagging along again?

300
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,680
Huh?

301
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,220
Almost there.

302
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,900
Cease fire.

303
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:16,920
Now change!

304
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,140
Hurry up!

305
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,080
I feel like my body is getting heavier.

306
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,620
He's so light-hearted.

307
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,860
You thief!

308
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:36,320
I'm lucky to have found you, Lord Ryozu Kankichi!

309
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,420
What's wrong? Your body suddenly became heavy.

310
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,940
It hurts!

311
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,400
Stop!

312
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,540
Hey, wait!

313
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,180
My body doesn't move!

314
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,800
You're getting heavier, Professor!

315
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,460
How many kilograms do you have?

316
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,820
If I come this far...

317
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,420
He's chasing me!

318
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,020
It's like a barbell!

319
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,380
It's running!

320
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,440
It's a monster!

321
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,500
Stop!

322
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,260
It's so heavy!

323
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,160
I can't let it escape!

324
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,540
It's a downhill!

325
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,320
It's faster to fall down!

326
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,140
What?

327
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,720
I got it!

328
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,340
But stop!

329
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,040
Stop!

330
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,540
Stop!

331
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,640
Stop!

332
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,760
Stop!

333
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,020
Stop!

334
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,020
You're so heavy!

335
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,220
What?

336
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,180
800 kg?

337
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,740
No way!

338
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,000
No way!

339
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,940
Are you alright, senior?

340
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,960
I'm not!

341
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,480
I'm not!

342
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,340
Uhhh...

343
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,320
Ahh! I've passed the limit!

344
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:22,740
Huh?

345
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,300
Even an elephant can't break the weight scale!

346
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,240
Cycling! Cycling!

347
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,560
Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo!

348
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,340
So where are you going to bring that extra?

349
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,800
Ni hao!

350
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,640
In Chinese "Takurama-kan Saboku"

351
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,360
Takurama-san means "If you enter once, you'll never be able to leave"

352
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,560
Hey! Because you drank a strange herbal medicine,

353
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,820
your body is getting heavier and heavier this time!

354
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,660
I-I'm getting heavier again...

355
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,780
Ha ha ha! I knew this would happen!

356
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,340
No need to worry!

357
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,120
I knew it! Do something about it!

358
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,160
Don't worry!

359
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,520
You can drink this and you'll be fine!

360
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,700
The magic weapon used by the Chinese "Sengin" to fly in the sky!

361
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,160
You can chew it, so hurry up and fly, you!

362
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,740
Oh no!

363
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,040
I mixed another medicine with a tea-brewed candy!

364
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,580
What?

365
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,000
What is it?

366
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,640
No need to worry.

367
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,980
Let's see...

368
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,740
Hey! Hurry up and do it!

369
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,020
Hm? This!

370
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,640
Really?

371
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,060
No doubt!

372
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,920
It's a one or two or eight!

373
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,240
Ryo-chan!

374
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,880
Senpai!

375
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,960
Ryo-chan!

376
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,040
Somehow, my body is...

377
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,740
Wahhh! It's getting heavier!

378
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,620
Help me!

379
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,800
Ryo-chan!

380
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,340
Senpai!

381
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:43,640
Senpai!

382
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,940
Ryo-chan!

383
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,000
What's this?

384
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,780
What's wrong?

385
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,140
It's just a little, but a strange gravity field has been detected.

386
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,200
What?

387
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,620
Wahhh!

388
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,800
I finally made it.

389
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,400
Shuman! Shuman!

390
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:05,700
What?

391
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,920
It seems that he gave another medicine.

392
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,520
It seems that the insect reacted and became heavier and heavier.

393
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,560
What's the medicine?

394
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,000
That's a medicine when a thousand people fly.

395
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,680
Ha-ha-ha!

396
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,000
A thousand people will fall from a tree, right?

397
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,740
It's a joke about the year 4,000 in China.

398
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,760
A monkey falls from a tree, right?

399
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,500
Huh?

400
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,000
But your feet are warm.

401
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,100
Wahhh!

402
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,920
Wahhh!

403
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,160
Gorilla-kun!

404
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,760
It's a hot spring!

405
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,040
You dug up a hot spring!

406
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,580
It's a hot spring!

407
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,020
I've got it!

408
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,780
I can make a fortune with this!

409
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,640
First, I built a giant hot spring in Cameari.

410
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,500
Then I used the earth's heat and made a jungle paradise and a nether world.

411
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,100
We have to expand our business with the zoo!

412
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,600
But if we keep this up, we'll drown!

413
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,280
Hurry up and give me the medicine!

414
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,660
Oh, right, let's see...

415
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,000
This is it!

416
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,900
Where is it, Mr. Gorilla?

417
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,960
It's here!

418
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,060
Oh, is that where your brother is?

419
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,640
It's okay, hurry up and give me the medicine.

420
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,200
Oh, wait...

421
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,100
It's getting heavier again!

422
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,740
It's getting sucked in!

423
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,200
What's the cause?

424
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,440
I don't know.

425
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,620
But it's true that something huge is forming on the Eurasia Plate.

426
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,380
This is bad!

427
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,240
The gravity is increasing even more!

428
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,620
That's right, it's getting heavier and heavier.

429
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,780
What are you going to do about it?

430
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,140
You know the dolphin, right?

431
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,080
The Eurasian dolphin is a dolphin that lives in the water, and it's in danger of extinction!

432
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,800
Don't lie to me!

433
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,140
What's this?

434
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,920
It's a dinosaur fossil.

435
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,520
Moreover, it hasn't been discovered in Japan yet.

436
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,880
Tyrannosaurus rex!

437
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,620
Really?

438
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,920
I'm the dinosaur doctor, so I'm sure of it!

439
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,440
Since when did you become a dinosaur doctor?

440
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,020
Dinos...

441
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,000
What?

442
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,140
Stop it, you liar!

443
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,000
Hey, there are some more!

444
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,540
Oh, this is Brachiosaurus.

445
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,520
This is Euprochephalus.

446
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,080
This is Tornacromerum.

447
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,400
This is a great discovery!

448
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,660
It'll sell high on the Dinosaur Mania!

449
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,500
No, first, we'll build a dinosaur museum in Kameari.

450
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,880
Furthermore, we'll expand our business with character products and theme parks!

451
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,760
This is a new type of discovery, you know.

452
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,560
Let's call it Ezaki Kameari Zaulus!

453
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,480
You can include my name too!

454
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,080
Well, let's celebrate our success and have a cup of tea.

455
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,860
Oh, right, the tea-making candy...

456
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,680
This is the flying fire!

457
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,120
Hey, you! Don't leave me alone!

458
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,460
Oh, the fishing...

459
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,960
It's getting heavier again!

460
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,060
I got it!

461
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,260
Japanese Kameari!

462
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,460
It's 10,000 meters underground!

463
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,320
Oh, Kameari!

464
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,780
I'll show you the main screen!

465
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,200
The problem is that the X-Men are moving to the underground, while increasing the amount of matter!

466
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,600
At this rate, we'll be able to get through to the Mantle層!

467
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,960
It's getting hotter and hotter!

468
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,920
It's magma!

469
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,000
The X-Men are being pushed back by the Mantle層!

470
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,800
They're being pushed back by magma!

471
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
The amount of matter is increasing!

472
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,280
No! At this rate...

473
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,040
What will happen at this rate?

474
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,600
If the amount of X-Men continues to increase, the amount of matter will increase!

475
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,140
The Earth's Earth's axis will tilt!

476
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,680
The Earth's Earth's axis has tilted!

477
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:50,060
It's Hawaii, as I thought!

478
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,760
Yeah, you're right.

479
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,720
What?

480
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,960
Snow?

481
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,720
It's terrible!

482
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,680
The Earth's entire environment is in danger due to the tilt of the Earth's axis!

483
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,580
The Earth's entire environment is in danger due to the tilt of the Earth's axis!

484
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,140
The Earth's Earth's Earth is in danger due to the tilt of the Earth's axis!

485
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,640
The Earth's Earth's Earth is in danger due to the tilt of the Earth's axis!

486
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,180
Ryo-sensei!

487
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,840
Senpai!

488
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,200
Ryo-chan!

489
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,380
What?

490
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,040
As long as we have the X-Men, we can't escape the threat of the Earth's destruction.

491
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,000
Please give your decision, President!

492
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,160
I understand...

493
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,200
As soon as possible!

494
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,380
Execute Project Tornado!

495
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,560
Look! The rocket was launched!

496
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,580
The Earth was destroyed by the Earthquake, but the X-Wing disappeared!

497
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,580
Everyone around the world, the Earth is saved!

498
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:53,660
It's broken!

499
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,600
Captain!

500
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,260
How long will I live in this place?

501
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,360
The meteorite will become a poop and come out of your body.

502
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Or if you want, you can stay there forever.

503
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,700
No way! I want to make a plastic model and a radio.

504
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,540
What's going to happen to the next game?

505
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,380
Don't worry.

506
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,840
It's okay to be as heavy as it is in the weightless space.

507
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,120
You can go anywhere.

508
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,320
Hey! Professor Tornado! Why are you here?

509
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,820
Thanks to the medicine, I was able to come to the universe.

510
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,360
That's right.

511
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,240
It's all because of your strange herbal medicine.

512
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,860
Wait, it's tea time.

513
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,200
Don't come to this place and have tea.

514
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,780
The oolong tea I drink in the universe is special.

515
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,220
There are still many strange things in the universe.

516
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,680
You should be careful when you eat the bone-in-the-sandwich.

517
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,460
There may be some gifts from the universe.

518
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,140
Episode 2: The Oolong Tea

519
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,520
Komachi and Nakagawa went to the countryside.

520
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,820
They looked so upset.

521
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,180
But I have a photo of the oolong tea that has no movement.

522
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,800
Next time, "The Oolong Tea I Long For."

523
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,420
What are you going to do, Komachi?

524
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,120
This time, we will find out this story at the end.

525
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,180
Let's see its true meaning.

526
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,700
Please help us this time.

527
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,360
The Oolong Teaently

528
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,680
"Bowl's Oolong Tea"

529
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,120
A small jade, isn't it?

530
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,060
A huge jade.

531
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,820
It looks like a painting by a Japanese artist.

532
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,960
What is the meaning of this jade?

533
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,400
Whet, what is this?

534
00:24:51,520 --> 00:25:18,560
-Depedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedepedep

535
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,280
It's on the ground.

536
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,080
But a regardez beckons from grandeur.

537
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,820
Isn't this amazing?

538
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,800
No way we're making that up!
