Nost Cheerios the Great Transoul

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,700
The End

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,280
The weather is great today, too!

25
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,580
The inside...

26
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,920
Please break something...

27
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
What's wrong, Senpai?!

28
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,680
Senpai!

29
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,340
I thought it was real, so I put in all my money.

30
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,140
But it fell off before the goal.

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
I'll just have to...

32
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,240
Don't put it all in the bucket.

33
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,600
Just leave some for me.

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,840
When it comes to a match, I'll go all out.

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,400
That's what a match is.

36
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,560
When did you become a matchmaker?

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,560
And you've been losing all this time, haven't you?

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
That's right.

39
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,620
If I have the ability to predict the future,

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,200
I'll win every match.

41
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,320
The end.

42
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,740
The end.

43
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,880
The end.

44
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,980
Senpai!

45
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,800
Are you okay?

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,100
Senpai!

47
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,580
My head still feels dizzy.

48
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,940
The wire was a direct hit.

49
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,440
It must have done a lot of damage, even to Senpai.

50
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,260
Of course!

51
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,140
Of course!

52
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,040
Anyway, what was that?

53
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,580
What do you mean?

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,800
I saw it for a moment when the iron pipe hit.

55
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,020
Oh, no!

56
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,780
The head of the Katsushika...

57
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,900
The head of the Katsushika...

58
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,140
I saw it in the miniskirt.

59
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,780
It fell off the stairs!

60
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,580
What?

61
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,620
Why do you know about it?

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,040
Why do you ask?

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,940
I saw the same thing just now.

64
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,900
You mean when you hit your head?

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,560
Right.

66
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,180
Oh, I see.

67
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,940
I did it!

68
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,340
This is the ability to predict the future!

69
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,540
What?

70
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,320
No way!

71
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,340
No way!

72
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,560
Because I hit my head a while ago,

73
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,760
the power that I had been hidden awakened!

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,900
Yahoo!

75
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,380
Is that really true?

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,140
It's not at all.

77
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,520
The famous Dutch predictor, Peter Furcos,

78
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,060
was shocked when he fell from the top of a ladder 10 meters high,

79
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,620
and his ability to predict the future was awakened.

80
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,820
Yahoo!

81
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,140
Then, Ryo also has a psychic ability?

82
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,780
I did it!

83
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,740
It's not just a coincidence!

84
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,240
It's not a coincidence!

85
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,340
You'll see if you try it again.

86
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,100
Hehehe.

87
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,200
It's Osaka's specialty, the Harisen Chop.

88
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,920
With this, you can try to hit this part with one shot.

89
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,260
What?

90
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,180
No, I can't hit my senior!

91
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,620
Isn't it better to use a bat or something?

92
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,460
Idiot!

93
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,180
It really hurts, right?

94
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,540
Besides, what if all the good kids imitate it?

95
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,760
Now, Nagawa, do your best.

96
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,520
I-I'm good, right?

97
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,360
Really?

98
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,500
Yeah, do it, Nagawa.

99
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,900
Then, here I go!

100
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,600
Two...

101
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,460
Ryo-chan!

102
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,180
Wow!

103
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,760
I saw it! I saw it!

104
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,420
The pink panties!

105
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,100
Reiko, show me!

106
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,580
No, Ryo!

107
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,180
Hey, this is a demonstration of your prediction!

108
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,420
Hey, Ryo-chan!

109
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,440
Hey, hey, hey!

110
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,560
Wait a minute!

111
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,160
Um...

112
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,080
Huh?

113
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,640
That's mine.

114
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,980
Um...

115
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,820
Hey, Ryo-chan and Kei-chan, what are you doing?

116
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,940
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,240
I didn't hit it so well.

118
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,160
But this proves that I have the ability to predict.

119
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,580
I wonder.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,680
It's not just a coincidence.

121
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,380
No, I may be the reincarnation of Nostradamus.

122
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,320
Nostradamus?

123
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,900
That's a fraud, isn't it?

124
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,600
What?

125
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,300
No, it's not a lie.

126
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,800
Nostradamus is a French prophet from the 16th century.

127
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:45,320
The prediction written in his four lines is a perfect example of the appearance of Napoleon and Hitler, as well as the Second World War.

128
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,760
Although, the topic of this is a great example of fear.

129
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,340
I'm the greatest of the Nostradamus.

130
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,520
You're just as annoying.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,600
What?

132
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,300
My prediction is real.

133
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,460
What?

134
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,220
It's amazing.

135
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,700
What are you talking about?

136
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,780
What?

137
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,540
Ryo-chan is the one with the ability to predict.

138
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,640
You're right, director.

139
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,520
Ta-da!

140
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,480
I'm the one with the ability to predict.

141
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,320
What are you talking about?

142
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,280
Is that a thing?

143
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,360
Yes, it is.

144
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,260
I saw the president falling down the stairs, and I saw the color of Nostradamus' trousers with my ability to predict.

145
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,880
It's just a coincidence.

146
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,080
Then let's try again.

147
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,160
Nostradamus!

148
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,440
Yes, sir!

149
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,340
Let's go!

150
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,600
No!

151
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,940
That can't be!

152
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,320
The next day

153
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,900
I saw it! The boss' tonight's side dish is sashimi!

154
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,320
Oh, and then?

155
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,880
And then...

156
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,440
Here I go!

157
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,360
Tomorrow's breakfast is a great meal!

158
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,940
I can't help it if you keep saying that.

159
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,300
Kei, I'll do it this time.

160
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,060
Y, yes.

161
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,280
I'm going to the restaurant!

162
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,020
I'm going to the restaurant!

163
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,000
Wait, Reiko! You don't have to be so strict!

164
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,440
No problem!

165
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Ryo, are you okay?

166
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,020
I'm not okay.

167
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,400
It's worse than that.

168
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,400
The 707th, the member of the order, is going to the Potato Bank tonight!

169
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,000
What?

170
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,700
Is that true, Ryo?

171
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,940
The 707th, the member of the order, is going to the Potato Bank tonight!

172
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,380
The 707th, the member of the order, is going to the Potato Bank tonight!

173
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:42,800
The 707th, the member of the order, is going to the Potato Bank tonight!

174
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,020
What?

175
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,040
It's obvious what you were trying to do!

176
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,180
What was that?!

177
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,480
Good for you. You did it, Ryo.

178
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,620
Ryo, you're amazing!

179
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,600
Nostradamus, you look amazing!

180
00:07:59,600 --> 00:07:59,640
It's a bonus.

181
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,920
From now on, call me the great prophet of the century, Nostradios!

182
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,160
Let me meet Nostradios!

183
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,760
There are so many reporters.

184
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:24,940
They're all the same.

185
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,280
Well, humans have a special trait.

186
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,720
With this ability, you can go to any street or street corner.

187
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,360
You can be a real rich guy.

188
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,760
Ready, set...

189
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,580
The weather tomorrow will be cloudy, and the day after that, it will be rainy.

190
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,900
The chance of getting a high water level is 60%.

191
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,900
No, no, it's not like that!

192
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,800
Ready, set...

193
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,520
It worked.

194
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,020
I'm sure the chief will be angry today.

195
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,800
No, it's not like that!

196
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,320
Why can't I wait for the horse and the deer?

197
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,080
This is a treasure hunt.

198
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,940
Here it comes! Nostradios!

199
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,060
Nostradios!

200
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,860
I have a prophecy for you today.

201
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,000
Please give me a miracle!

202
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,580
Wait, wait!

203
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,800
Prophecies are light.

204
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,900
Wait.

205
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,760
Even if the horse and the deer are useless,

206
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,560
I have this hand.

207
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,420
Prophecy?

208
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,040
What do you mean, Ryotsu?

209
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,040
That's why at the end of the century,

210
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,760
everyone is anxious about the citizens.

211
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,400
I'm going to solve that anxiety with my ability.

212
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,040
You're thinking about something else again.

213
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,440
I'm just kidding.

214
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,460
I'm a citizen service.

215
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,100
But I've never heard of a prophecy.

216
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,660
What?

217
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,780
I have a bad feeling about this.

218
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,280
I have a bad feeling about this!

219
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,200
What?

220
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,220
Chief, you fell down the stairs and got injured.

221
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm going to solve something even worse.

222
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,400
What?

223
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,600
What's going to happen?

224
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,520
I'm going to solve that anxiety with the Diogenes.

225
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,340
The Diogenes are necessary for the peace of mankind.

226
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,160
Do you understand?

227
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,680
Deceive or Not

228
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,240
I'm going to collect ten thousand yen and take this much for one of the prophecies.

229
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,200
Ten thousand yen for one of the prophecies.

230
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,600
Welcome.

231
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,780
I'm coming right now.

232
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:37,700
Chief!

233
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,500
Tuber � cuanto!

234
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,060
Ryotsu, you said you were a citizen service!

235
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,480
What the hell did you say?

236
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,360
Chief.

237
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,120
Listen!

238
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,540
Don't take any money!

239
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:49,920
Don't take anything from me!

240
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,520
Do you understand!?

241
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,360
Ahaha, yes.

242
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,480
If I can't get money, it's no use.

243
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,820
Um...

244
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,600
Actually...

245
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,320
Oh! You!

246
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,740
You have some problems, don't you?

247
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,980
No, I can understand that face.

248
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,520
Ah...

249
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,640
Actually...

250
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:09,800
Wait!

251
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:10,700
Huh?

252
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,740
You seem to be good at fortune telling.

253
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,000
Fortune telling?

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,080
That's right. There are many ways of fortune telling that suit each person.

255
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,240
Bring the steak immediately.

256
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,160
It's medium rare.

257
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,140
Um...

258
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,520
It's pretty good meat. You have a good heart.

259
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,240
Yeah...

260
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,780
So, what do you want me to fortune tell?

261
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,620
Don't say that. I know everything.

262
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,360
Ah!

263
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,820
In front of you!

264
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,300
Go the way you want.

265
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,920
If you do that,

266
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,560
the road will open.

267
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,120
Really, Ryo-tsu!?

268
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,580
Call me Nostra Ryo-tsu.

269
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,500
There's no mistake in what I say.

270
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Alright! I was wondering, but I made up my mind!

271
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,660
I'll get another limited figure!

272
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,700
Wait for me, Saori!

273
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,340
Haha, it's easy to be stupid.

274
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,400
Here, the next person.

275
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,860
Um...

276
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,400
Huh!?

277
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,360
You have a coffee fortune-telling.

278
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,780
Bring the coffee immediately.

279
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,060
Huh!?

280
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,200
Hmm...

281
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,820
The coffee after the meal is delicious.

282
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,900
Um...

283
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,960
I know how to fortune tell.

284
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,940
You'll start to fortune tell from now on.

285
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,800
Ah!

286
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,000
Th-this is...

287
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,100
The fortune of your relationship with her...

288
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,500
If she's in love with you, it'll go well.

289
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,240
If the other person hates you, it's no good.

290
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,200
I understand.

291
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,220
Ah, somehow...

292
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,640
Good!

293
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,060
Here, the next person.

294
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,040
Please!

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,460
You guys are good at fortune telling!

296
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,940
Fortune telling?

297
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,120
Hmm...

298
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
How is it? Did you understand something?

299
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,000
Hey, don't rest your hands.

300
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,180
We just saw your future.

301
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,480
Really?

302
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,980
It can't be helped.

303
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,020
Ah, there!

304
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,360
Ah, a little more strongly!

305
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,540
Hmm...

306
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,160
Gradually, we can see your future.

307
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,480
Ryo-tsu!

308
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,700
I wonder if you could fortune tell me one thing.

309
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,680
Good.

310
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,980
Then, take off your jacket.

311
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:17,960
Ah!

312
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,760
Uwaaah!

313
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,640
What are you doing, Ryo-tsu?

314
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,420
I'm going to fortune tell after I get on the rope.

315
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,900
I'm going to fortune tell!

316
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,180
W-what?

317
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,580
Hmm...

318
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,760
You're not very good at fortune telling.

319
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,600
Oh!

320
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,320
Then, one more time!

321
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,960
Ah, stop it!

322
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,620
Ah, Ryo-tsu!

323
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,300
You're already fortune telling!

324
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,660
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

325
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,480
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

326
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,840
Somehow, the direction has changed.

327
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,680
It's Ryo-chan's bad habit.

328
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,720
Ryo-tsu, please fortune tell me one thing.

329
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,440
I understand.

330
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,580
Then, how about fortune telling with candles?

331
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,020
Ah!

332
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,760
A fortune-telling?

333
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,320
Yes.

334
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,960
Then, please give me a note.

335
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,560
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

336
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,280
With this, I can make a paper airplane.

337
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,420
While I'm thinking about my wishes, I'll make this airplane.

338
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,820
And I'll make a paper airplane.

339
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,540
I'll fly to that platform.

340
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,640
There!

341
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,420
Oh!

342
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,680
If you land well, your wish will come true.

343
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,040
The paper to fold the airplane is 1000 yen, 5000 yen, 10,000 yen and it's expensive, so it's beneficial.

344
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,520
Now, let's try it together!

345
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,380
All right!

346
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,340
All right!

347
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:31,920
All right!

348
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:32,940
All right!

349
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,600
All right!

350
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,340
Too bad!

351
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,280
Your wish couldn't come true.

352
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,300
Um...

353
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,340
That money...

354
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,520
It's not money.

355
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,340
It's a paper airplane.

356
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,440
If your wish doesn't come true, you'll have to make a paper airplane at home.

357
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,200
But...

358
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,840
If you're talking nonsense, you'll get punished.

359
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,540
Ah, yes.

360
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,740
Hey!

361
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,020
Ryo-tsu!

362
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,880
I told you not to take so much money!

363
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,220
I'm not taking money!

364
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,740
This is a paper airplane.

365
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,100
Shut up!

366
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,720
Give it back quickly!

367
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,120
Eh?

368
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,320
There's a secret layer!

369
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,320
Huh?

370
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,660
What?

371
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,500
Let's make a detailed fortune telling.

372
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,840
Anye parapa hundarabeche!

373
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:18,820
Huh?

374
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,720
Ouch!

375
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,360
What's this?

376
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,380
What's this?

377
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,480
It's a hundred-price fortune!

378
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,820
Let's pay it now.

379
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,560
Pay?

380
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,160
What are you doing, Ryo-tsu?

381
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,640
You can't run away!

382
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,740
You have to kick out the villain in the head of the team!

383
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,120
I have to kick him out!

384
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,160
There's no such thing!

385
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,340
Don't just stand there!

386
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,260
Wake up!

387
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,520
I'm not!

388
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,180
You villain!

389
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,680
You need to change your body to look like a leader!

390
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,040
I told you I was wrong!

391
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,400
A joke!

392
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,820
Now the villain has left.

393
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,380
That's good.

394
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,240
Hey!

395
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,820
There's no such thing!

396
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,360
How dare you!

397
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,600
You villain!

398
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,340
I'm not funny!

399
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,500
It's starting to get even worse!

400
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,380
Ryo-tsu lost control of his control from that rusty guy.

401
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,680
I could never get a chance to win that fortune example!

402
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,020
Being lucky color was nothing but a ragtag.

403
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,980
I'm a real bop.

404
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,260
One of my limited edition figures that I paid a huge sum for bought.

405
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,040
I took a hold of it because it was a fake .

406
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,360
You said it would go great together, but...

407
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,420
-They dumped us! -What happened to the money?

408
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,480
-We got caught in the mud. -The car got hit.

409
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,360
Let's go to the fair! What's with the Nostradamus?

410
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,140
What?

411
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,060
-We made quite a fortune. -Senpai.

412
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,000
What's wrong, Nagagawa Reigo?

413
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,920
Well...

414
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,620
The fortune-telling of Ryo-chan is a lie. Komachi-chan and the others have formed an alliance of victims.

415
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,320
-We're heading this way. -What?

416
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,940
-Ryotsu, Kankichi, are you there? -What?

417
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,800
Oh, you're all here. Do you need anything?

418
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,720
No, I don't! Don't bother us!

419
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,760
None of your words have been answered!

420
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,060
You're so annoying!

421
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,400
What can I say? My fortune-telling ability hasn't declined at all.

422
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,720
You were the first one to get caught, weren't you? You stupid genius!

423
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:36,840
You fools! I'll show you the greatness of my fortune-telling ability, Nagagawa!

424
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,260
Yes, I'm coming!

425
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,760
What?

426
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,680
What's wrong? Hurry and tell us your fortune-telling ability!

427
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,540
Huh?

428
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,820
Nagagawa, you have to be stronger!

429
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,420
Yes, senpai!

430
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:58,060
What the hell? My fortune-telling ability has been destroyed at the most important moment!

431
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,060
You were just playing around, weren't you?

432
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,040
No, I wasn't!

433
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,240
Then, tell us your fortune-telling ability!

434
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,580
Fortune-telling?

435
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,820
What do you want to say?

436
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,580
T-T-T-Tokyo Bay!

437
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,180
Tokyo Bay?

438
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,180
When the sea water is overflowing - Then

439
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,440
what? The

440
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:28,720
Sumida River will overflow, and the ancient beasts will be revived, and they will be back to normal again! Ancient

441
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,400
beasts? Yes,

442
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,380
they are. When?

443
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,820
What? Um, next Sunday?

444
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,520
That's a lie.

445
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,020
It's a lie!

446
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,680
Those who don't believe my fortune will be shocked by the devil's rage and disappear into the deep of the sea!

447
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,060
I said I don't believe it!

448
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,160
Then it's fine. If you don't get it, I'll ask everyone to pay the doctor's fee.

449
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,800
Oh, that's fine.

450
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,500
I don't care if you're going to cry later. Let's go.

451
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,060
What?

452
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,520
Senpai, are you sure about that?

453
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,640
Maybe it's a slip of the tongue?

454
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,600
It's fine. The prophecy of Nostra Reutzi will definitely come true.

455
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,540
This place where the appearance of the devil was foretold by Nostra Reutzi, the last prophet of the century,

456
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,400
There are many people gathering to see the truth of Sumida River.

457
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,980
There is a place called Sumida Park near here.

458
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,980
In addition to the stalls, there are also shops selling prophecy goods, and it is sometimes a fever of demons.

459
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,640
Yes, yes, the ticket fee is 1000 yen per person.

460
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,500
The camera of the media is 10,000 yen.

461
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,360
The sales of the stalls are also 30% mine. This is a big profit.

462
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,880
Oh, I have to collect the amount of sightings from the yacht.

463
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,080
Yes, 1000 yen per person. Yes, yes, yes.

464
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,560
Senpai, it's easy...

465
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,520
I'm sorry, but is it okay?

466
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,140
The prophecy from that time was a lie.

467
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,860
If nothing appears after such a big mess, I'm sorry for nothing.

468
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,260
Well, it's time for the prophecy.

469
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,020
Will the great prophecy come true?

470
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,000
What is the devil?

471
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,640
Does it mean the destruction of humanity?

472
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,300
Soon, that time will come.

473
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,620
It's here!

474
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,820
It's here!

475
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,540
Is this the ancient devil?

476
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,480
What is its true identity?

477
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,980
And what is the fate of humanity?

478
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,880
Wow!

479
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,020
What?

480
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,320
What?

481
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,920
What is this?

482
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,160
It's a dinosaur!

483
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,040
The ancient devil is a dinosaur revived in the present!

484
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,820
You see, the prophecy has been realized!

485
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,060
No, no way!

486
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,060
It's a lie.

487
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,900
How can this happen in reality?

488
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,040
Demon, sink your anger and return to the sea!

489
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,220
Yeah!

490
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,020
Ryotsu is using his power to sink the monster!

491
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,840
N-n-n-no!

492
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,660
Let's go back into the water!

493
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,460
Huh?

494
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,400
Nya?

495
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:40,980
Ah!

496
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,220
Harry Potter!

497
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,420
Sorry, Ryotsu!

498
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,480
Even if I'm in charge of all weapons, the submarine can't take control!

499
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,200
I can't do this.

500
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,720
Idiot!

501
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,780
Do you have a way to get out of here?

502
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,240
Why do you think you stole the submarine from Yokosuka?

503
00:21:59,460 --> 00:21:59,900
What?

504
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,340
I thought you were a cheater!

505
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,900
Hey, hey, hey!

506
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,580
Oh no!

507
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,380
Run, Volvo!

508
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,000
You're in the way!

509
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,260
I can't do this!

510
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,860
I can't run away!

511
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,180
It's okay!

512
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:14,940
Huh?

513
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,180
Th-this music is...

514
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,660
What?

515
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,680
I knew it!

516
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,300
It's Colonel Buckley!

517
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,500
You two!

518
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,700
Do you think you can get out of here with the submarine from the US?

519
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,080
What are you doing?

520
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,100
Get in the water!

521
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,860
I didn't say that!

522
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,800
Ouch!

523
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,700
I'm in trouble!

524
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,960
Each one of you is a mess!

525
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,040
I've pressed some switch!

526
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,520
Ah!

527
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
That's a switch from a spaceship!

528
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,220
Oh!

529
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Why are you coming here?

530
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,100
Ah!

531
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,720
Why are you coming here?

532
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,920
I'm in trouble!

533
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,120
Ah!

534
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,200
Hey!

535
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,600
Hey!

536
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,220
Hey!

537
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,940
Hey!

538
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,680
Hey!

539
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,520
*Squeaky*

540
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,360
*Squeaky*

541
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:24,800
*Squeaky*

542
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,300
I was saved somehow.

543
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,300
*Squeaky* Hey, Ryo!

544
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:29,840
Ah, Chief!

545
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,280
What have you done to me, you idiot!

546
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,760
But, Chief,

547
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,860
I have fulfilled my promise.

548
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,220
Everyone disappeared into thin air.

549
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Idiot!

550
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,400
You will be the only one who remains in the sea!

551
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,360
*Squeaky*

552
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,140
Wait!

553
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,480
*Squeaky*

554
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,460
Hmm. I might be the king of fear,

555
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,240
as predicted by Nostradamus.

556
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,820
*Squeaky*

557
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,780
Ah, you're the worst!

558
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,260
Damn it!

559
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,300
I hate Nostradamus so much!

560
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,180
*Squeaky*

561
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,280
Even if you fell into a pit,

562
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,420
you have a strong will.

563
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,360
*Squeaky*

564
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,180
If you are the king,

565
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,940
you're the best.

566
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,480
If you are the king,

567
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,380
Even boring talks

568
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,980
are hot,

569
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,470
I want to see

570
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,700
even if they are hot.

571
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,200
*Squeaky*

572
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,540
I'm sure

573
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,460
I want to be loved

574
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,280
A little

575
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,840
The more everyone says

576
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,200
I feel like we're melting

577
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,580
I want to shoot you

578
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:07,880
For some reason, love is just cowardly

579
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,520
Don't hide all the strong feelings

580
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,820
