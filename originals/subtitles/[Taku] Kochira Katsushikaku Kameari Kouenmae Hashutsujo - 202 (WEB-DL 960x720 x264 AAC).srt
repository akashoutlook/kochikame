1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
Mamma Mia!

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,860
When you watch TV take a bright room and look away.

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,080
Come to me if you're penniless.

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm not either but I'm worried.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,960
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,120
I wonder what will happen to them

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:55,460
I wonder what will happen to them

8
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,400
Come to me, you jobless man

9
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,540
I'm not here, but don't worry

10
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,420
Look, the red clouds are burning

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,100
The red clouds are burning

12
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,560
I wonder what will happen to them

13
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,600
You know it, don't you?

14
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,280
You know it, don't you?

15
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,840
If you know it, then keep quiet and follow me!

16
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,100
Rakugaku!

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,640
KASUKE!

18
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,360
Right!

19
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,700
TOT LOL

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,140
TOT LOL

21
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,420
Hit Subscribe!

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,160
Hm?

23
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,380
This stain...

24
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,120
Looks like something?

25
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,000
What is it?

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,140
Wait...

27
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,160
Eh...

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,280
You put it here.

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
Here...

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,920
Called...

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,220
This...

32
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,500
You put it here...

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,840
Called...

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,260
It became like this

35
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,740
Nyanygyonyonyonyonyonyonyonyonyonyony...

36
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:10,840
Nyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyany...

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,860
Nyanyanyanyanyanyan...

38
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:11,960
Nyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyany...

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,720
And this, and this...

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,060
and this...

41
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,000
and this...

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,820
Ah! It's Chief Ohara's little beard!

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,360
You noisy old man!

44
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,660
You've been making fun of me in front of the subordinates all this time!

45
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,420
Geez, you're just like any other child!

46
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,400
Ryo-tsu!

47
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,980
Why don't you act with a sense of responsibility and awareness in the position of the chief of the police?

48
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,600
You can't get married in that situation!

49
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,800
Damn it! I'm getting dizzy just thinking about it!

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
I'll do it like this!

51
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,260
Oh! You've been playing a prank on me!

52
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,680
Hehehe! You're so annoying!

53
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,400
No, Ryo-chan! What are you drawing?

54
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,220
Huh?

55
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,220
Huh?

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,320
Ah!

57
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,860
Oh, no! What am I doing?!

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,300
Ryo-chan, you have to erase it properly!

59
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,980
Eh?

60
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,560
Ehhh...

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,400
Now that I think about it, I drew it with oil-based magic!

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,480
I'm sure there was an oil-based cleaner somewhere.

63
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,420
Thanks.

64
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,560
Be careful!

65
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,600
Ah! Finally, this day has come!

66
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,960
Be quiet! Why are you getting excited by yourself?

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,620
Ryo-chan!

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,200
That person was the 9,999th person I guided on my way!

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,680
Huh?

70
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,180
Actually...

71
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,280
The first job I did when I came to this police station was a guide!

72
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,200
That's why I took the number of people I guided every day to the corner of the road!

73
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,680
See!

74
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,740
Huh?

75
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,880
Did you draw this letter?

76
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,540
I've been wondering what it was for a long time, but now the mystery has been solved!

77
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,840
Oh, that's not it!

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,460
Hey, Ryo-chan! Listen to me until the end!

79
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,080
The person I drew just now was the 9,999th person!

80
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,120
That means...

81
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,640
It's magic number one, Ryo-san!

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,100
Magic number one?

83
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,840
That means I've reached 10,000 today!

84
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,280
Look at this, Ryo-san!

85
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,460
What's that?

86
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,540
It's a mini-sand ball I made myself.

87
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,700
I made it last night at night...

88
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,400
I'll have the 10,000th person draw this.

89
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,020
This is a souvenir for my heart.

90
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,280
Are you a junior high school student?

91
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,540
Then lend it to me!

92
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,120
What are you doing, Ryo-san?

93
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,540
I'll pull it for you.

94
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,620
No, no, no, no, no, no!

95
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,060
Let me break it!

96
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,700
I'll have the 10,000th person draw it!

97
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,620
Lend me your hand!

98
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,340
*Sneeze*

99
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,980
Stop it, Ryo-san!

100
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,160
If you don't break it, I'll tickle you more!

101
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,260
*Sneeze*

102
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,840
Stop it! Stop it!

103
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,400
*Sneeze*

104
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,480
What are you doing?

105
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,000
*Sneeze*

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,540
Ryo-san, help me! Help me!

107
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,980
You're a big guy.

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,020
*Sneeze*

109
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,460
I'm sorry for making a crumpled shoe.

110
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Ryo-san!

111
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,860
If someone comes to the street,

112
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,280
I'll be the guide!

113
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,480
If it's a gas station,

114
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,420
it's located at the second signal.

115
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,300
Thank you!

116
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,960
*Scream*

117
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,640
Ouch!

118
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,020
*Sneeze*

119
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,820
My 10,000th person is gone.

120
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,420
What's that?

121
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,820
It's cute, isn't it?

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,480
*Scream*

123
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,540
Stop it, Reiko-san!

124
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

125
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,440
Anyway, I'll be the next guide.

126
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,440
And don't try to break my mini-caterpillar!

127
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,780
That's all!

128
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,660
Don't be so angry over that.

129
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,400
*Sneeze*

130
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,020
Huh? What was I trying to do just now?

131
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,060
*Sneeze*

132
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,420
Be quiet, will you?

133
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,880
*Sneeze*

134
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,120
*Meow*

135
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,760
*Meow*

136
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:06,960
Oh, no!

137
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
I've never heard of a cat's death.

138
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,040
*Meow*

139
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,360
I wonder when he was out.

140
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,680
I didn't notice at all.

141
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,760
Poor thing.

142
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,640
He's so fat.

143
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,420
I think he's hungry.

144
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,580
He's too fat.

145
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:22,820
He's too fat.

146
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,000
He should go on a diet.

147
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,440
He had some milk, didn't he?

148
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,520
*Kiss*

149
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,280
*Kiss*

150
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,680
I don't think Reiko is going to buy anything here.

151
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,900
If you're feeling better, you should find a buyer.

152
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,040
Ryo-chan!

153
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,080
*Sneeze*

154
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,960
Did you call me?

155
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,820
You're so manly!

156
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,300
Of course!

157
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
Don't you deny my gender!

158
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,600
You haven't folded your bed sheet yet!

159
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,340
This isn't your room!

160
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,900
*Sneeze*

161
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,220
Poor thing.

162
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:53,920
You're suffering.

163
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,760
*Sneeze*

164
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880
I'm sorry.

165
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,920
*Sneeze*

166
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,080
*Sneeze*

167
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,100
I'm sorry.

168
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,800
Once you're done, clean up the trash.

169
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,380
You should separate the trash that burns from the trash that doesn't.

170
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,600
Okay?

171
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,640
I know.

172
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,960
I'll give you some milk now.

173
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,960
*Sneeze*

174
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,720
Who do you think I am?

175
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,240
If you separate the trash, what will come out of me?

176
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
*Sneeze*

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,440
You're so hungry.

178
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
*Sneeze*

179
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,120
*Sneeze*

180
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,940
Ouch!

181
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,040
What are you doing?

182
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,860
I'll be back in a minute.

183
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,120
Chief?

184
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,340
What?

185
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,900
Ouch!

186
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,480
What's wrong, Chief?

187
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,700
Chief Ohara is having a stomachache.

188
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,880
What?

189
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,600
Oh, no!

190
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,500
*Sneeze*

191
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,060
Oh, no!

192
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,180
I forgot to erase the drawing!

193
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,920
Oh, no!

194
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,420
Don't scare me, Ryo-chan!

195
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,040
Oh, no!

196
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,340
Oh, no!

197
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,540
What's wrong?

198
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,400
I'll tell you.

199
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,140
That cat looks strange.

200
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,340
Oh, yeah.

201
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,780
I'm going to give you milk.

202
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,520
*Sneeze*

203
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,020
*Sneeze*

204
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,600
What a mess!

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,520
What?

206
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,280
What's going on?

207
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,260
This is Kameari Park Expo!

208
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,000
*Sneeze*

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,460
Oh, my, my, my.

210
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,240
Hey, Kien, is that you?

211
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,440
Hm?

212
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
A prayer room?

213
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,780
Okay.

214
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,540
*Sneeze*

215
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,940
*Sneeze*

216
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,300
*Sneeze*

217
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,680
*Sneeze*

218
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,780
Oh, no.

219
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,440
No, it's not going to stick anymore. What should I do?

220
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,500
- It's not my phone. - No, it's not.

221
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,780
I see. Nakagawa, can you lower the chair a little?

222
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:30,960
Yes.

223
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,200
Thank you.

224
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,960
Why did you get so surprised, Chief?

225
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,760
Oh, yesterday...

226
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,040
I was just trying to find a way to put the bonsai in the garden.

227
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
And I was so surprised.

228
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,700
It wasn't a heavy pot, you know.

229
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,180
Are you okay?

230
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,360
That must be a lot of things.

231
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:52,680
Yes.

232
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,920
Nakagawa, can I have a cup of tea?

233
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,300
Yes.

234
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,440
I can't just sit here like this forever.

235
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,520
Oh, right.

236
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,820
Chief, why don't you take a break in the back room?

237
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,040
Right? Let's do that.

238
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,340
Oh, right.

239
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,920
Here. Take your time.

240
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,440
Oh, no! It looks like she's pregnant!

241
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,800
What?

242
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,440
Excuse me. My hand slipped.

243
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,960
Would you like some tea?

244
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,180
Please.

245
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,300
Pregnant? Whose child is that?

246
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,320
Well, that's...

247
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,400
You don't know?

248
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,160
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

249
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,100
Chief, it's not Reiko who's pregnant.

250
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,120
It's a cat. A cat.

251
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,400
A cat?

252
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,860
That cat?

253
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,460
That cat?

254
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,220
She was lying down in front of the exit.

255
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,960
Oh, poor thing.

256
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,280
That's why I want to let her give birth in this room at least.

257
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,300
I see. Ryozu, please lower the chair.

258
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,740
Huh? But, Chief...

259
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,360
No, today I have only one day break for boys.

260
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,260
Lower the chairs, Ryozu.

261
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,360
Uh... Okay...

262
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,420
Thank you, Chief.

263
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,660
I'm sorry.

264
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,840
There's something I'd like you to look at.

265
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,660
Um, which one was it?

266
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,780
Um...

267
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,120
It looks like someone is here.

268
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,300
That's it. Don't worry about us.

269
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,400
Hey, you with your hands free!

270
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,400
Yes?

271
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,700
Yes, sir!

272
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,860
What's wrong?

273
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,940
Is there a problem with this file?

274
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,280
That's the biggest problem.

275
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,000
The second corner is on the left.

276
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,440
The next corner is on the right.

277
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,520
You'll find out soon.

278
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,640
Thank you very much.

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,700
My number 10,000!

280
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,480
The cat will be surprised, so be quiet!

281
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,420
I'm sorry.

282
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Please, sir.

283
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,700
Thank you.

284
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,600
What's the number 10,000?

285
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,080
It's the number of people I've guided since I worked here.

286
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,600
Amazing!

287
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,700
Did you guide the 10,000 citizens?

288
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,960
Only one of us is 10,000.

289
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,560
As long as there's a serious officer like you,

290
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,760
Katsushika's safety is safe.

291
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,640
I'm sorry I didn't know.

292
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,800
He's doing it on his own.

293
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,580
There's no need to apologize.

294
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,040
That's right.

295
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm just thinking on my own.

296
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,320
Next time, I'll let you know.

297
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
Thank you.

298
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,140
Ryotsu, you're always looking at the bookshelf.

299
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,060
I'll have you show me this file again.

300
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,780
Is that so?

301
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,720
Then, how about this?

302
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,740
Thank you.

303
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,400
My black eye can't help you.

304
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,940
I thought I'd never borrow your help.

305
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't want to, sir.

306
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,300
Please say anything.

307
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,060
It's so wet.

308
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,980
There it is.

309
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,540
Please let me stay here for a while until I get a call.

310
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,120
I'll wait here to get a call as soon as possible.

311
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,460
Please rest assured, sir.

312
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,280
Really?

313
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,600
Oh, I see.

314
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,300
Excuse me.

315
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,280
I'm sorry.

316
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,480
I'm sorry.

317
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,760
What am I supposed to do?

318
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,380
Summoning Katsushika

319
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,920
Summoning Katsushika

320
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,240
Summoning Katsushika

321
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,440
Summoning Katsushika

322
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,080
Summoning Katsushika

323
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,980
Summoning Katsushika

324
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,400
Kuromatsu.

325
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,840
You seem to be well chosen, sir.

326
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,580
Well...

327
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,240
Well...

328
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,160
Can you tell?

329
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,080
I know my father.

330
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,940
He's the president of the bonsai association.

331
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,160
There is a person who works as a board member of the forestry association.

332
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,340
I've heard of his hard work in growing vegetables.

333
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,640
It is not easy to raise such a branch.

334
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,840
Yes. It took me 10 years to raise it all the way here.

335
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,940
10 years? Ryo-san, the picture of the bonsai that the chief grew.

336
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,740
Oh, what a good branch.

337
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,320
You don't know what a branch is.

338
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,080
You're thinking that bonsai is something that old people do when they have free time.

339
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,580
I usually say it here, but I'm a little weak here.

340
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,260
I'm going to do it carefully.

341
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,680
I'm not even going to do it.

342
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:50,960
Since I saw the bonsai at the chief's house, I've been thinking that I want to make bonsai my hobby.

343
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,180
I see.

344
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,580
Senpai is good at small work, and he may be good at it.

345
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,840
Yesterday.

346
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
If only I could fix the short part of the tree.

347
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,220
Shut up!

348
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,360
Actually, I ordered this for the bonsai auction today.

349
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,640
Is that so?

350
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,640
My wife went to the venue on my behalf.

351
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,800
As soon as I get the result, I'll contact you.

352
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,820
Then the phone the chief is waiting for is from his wife.

353
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,020
From his wife?

354
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,940
Yeah.

355
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,180
I'm kind of nervous.

356
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,540
Come to think of it, these 10 years have been a battle against myself.

357
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
This bonsai is a work like my own statue.

358
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,560
When I think that the statue is now being evaluated by others,

359
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,340
whether I stand or not,

360
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,640
Ouch!

361
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,560
Are you all right?

362
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,480
Chief.

363
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,420
You always say, "Kaho, sleep."

364
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,840
Chief.

365
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,040
If you can't go to the venue, you should just sleep at home.

366
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,560
If it's a phone call, it's the same no matter where you answer it.

367
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,360
It's hard to wait at home alone.

368
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,000
I understand how you feel.

369
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,820
You feel like you're back to the entrance exam students, don't you?

370
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,860
That's right.

371
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,480
It's a bad thing.

372
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,180
If I'm here, I'll be confused about something.

373
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,840
When the chief sits here as it is,

374
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,040
I have to do something about the graffiti on the wall.

375
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,080
But I can't do anything on my own.

376
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,980
I need backup.

377
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,540
I can't be a monk.

378
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,640
I can't be a wild snake and be found out by the chief.

379
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,560
Then I have no choice but to hug Nakagawa.

380
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,340
What is it, senpai?

381
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,360
What's wrong?

382
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,400
Yeah.

383
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,020
What's wrong?

384
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,580
There's a cardboard box on the locker.

385
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,200
Take that out.

386
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,900
Cleaning detergent?

387
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,020
Are you going to clean it?

388
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,780
Senpai!

389
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,960
What are you writing?

390
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,160
I'll tell you more about this later.

391
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,340
I want to erase this so that the chief won't notice.

392
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,460
Please help me.

393
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,840
That's impossible.

394
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,100
Just take the box on the locker.

395
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,220
Please.

396
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,440
I'll just take it.

397
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,380
What are you doing?

398
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,240
While waiting for the wife to contact me,

399
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,800
I'll ask the chief if there's anything you can do to keep me from getting bored.

400
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,600
Ryotsu.

401
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,700
You...

402
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,760
Now!

403
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,600
Now!

404
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,380
Now!

405
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,560
Now!

406
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,840
Y... Y...

407
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,900
Y... Y...

408
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,280
Hey, Ttaki!

409
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,000
Z... Zoot!

410
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,800
Ahhhhh!

411
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:09,820
Why the...

412
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,480
Why the bat!

413
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,480
No, we don't have much time!

414
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,920
We will keep our eyes on them until the conclusion.

415
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,840
What?

416
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,620
Zoot!

417
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,280
T... T... Zoot!

418
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,580
Zoot!

419
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,440
Zoot!

420
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,200
Hm, hm.

421
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,120
I apologize for the mess.

422
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,000
This is what a monk should do.

423
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,360
But it's too late to regret now.

424
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,620
That's right.

425
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,800
This is it.

426
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,480
Ah!

427
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,500
Chief! I have a good thing.

428
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,080
Let's do a show of martial arts.

429
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,700
But you're working, aren't you?

430
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
There are monks and Nakagawa.

431
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,420
I'm not going anywhere.

432
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:53,960
It's not like I'm going anywhere.

433
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,800
Isn't it good to do it once in a while?

434
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,560
Let's do it, Chief.

435
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,400
I see.

436
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,840
I'm not sure about this.

437
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,100
Let's do it.

438
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,020
I'll go first.

439
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:23,720
Ah.

440
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,620
I see.

441
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,200
It's your turn, Ryotsu.

442
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,340
Before I come here,

443
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,040
Before I knew it, I had the actress shake hands with Sayuri Yoshikawa.

444
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,340
So I don't want to touch anyone else today.

445
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,800
What's up with you all of a sudden?

446
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,040
Is that why you've been acting suspicious?

447
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,460
But it's Sayuri Yoshikawa.

448
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,600
I don't see her very often.

449
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,060
I wanted to see her too.

450
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,940
I was shooting near the Katsushika library.

451
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,380
I've been a fan of yours for a long time, so I had you shake hands with me.

452
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,420
You're a junior high school student, huh?

453
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,820
I've never been told by you.

454
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,300
I'm kind of relieved to hear what Nakagawa-kun has to say.

455
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,340
That's right.

456
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,240
Nakagawa, who seems to be completely innocent, has a personality like everyone else.

457
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,080
Please don't tease me.

458
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,540
Hey, everyone.

459
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,780
What?

460
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,040
What?

461
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,220
I was born.

462
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,300
Oh, I see.

463
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,160
You're so tiny.

464
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,640
You're so cute.

465
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,280
Good job.

466
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,600
No, I'm nothing.

467
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,740
It was all done by my mother cat alone.

468
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,520
I was just watching by her side.

469
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,940
This skin...

470
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,780
The oil-based cleaner...

471
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,300
This one, huh?

472
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,040
It's too light.

473
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,440
Excuse me!

474
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,200
Um, Michio...

475
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,760
Terai, you have a guest!

476
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,020
Huh?

477
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,540
The 10,000th one!

478
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,980
You've finally reached your goal, Terai-san.

479
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,780
What's that?

480
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,680
What's that?

481
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:47,920
It's really a huge trip!

482
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,740
This is a big trip.

483
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,880
Uh...

484
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,680
What?

485
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:55,860
What a great trip.

486
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,640
I've been here for over a year and a half, but it's all for nothing!

487
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,440
You said it had aENCe!

488
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,140
It's just a 5-minute trip!

489
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,880
Or even one and a half have a 10,000th one?

490
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:04,920
It's a real one!

491
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,620
You're only worth it.

492
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,440
Oh, come on!

493
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,960
Your 10,000th one is now 10,000th one!

494
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,300
Can you tell me what it's worth with this trip?

495
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,040
What do you need?

496
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,060
Shall we take a walk here at Ijimaki?

497
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,080
I'll take a walk around Ijimaki-tee!

498
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,620
Let's walk!

499
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,640
There's only one left.

500
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,900
Let's just send the complicated case and wait for the next one.

501
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,440
That's right.

502
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,820
Hey, Terai!

503
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,260
What is it, Ryo-san?

504
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,980
Where is the nearest convenience store around here?

505
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,060
If that's the case, it's near the new Colomart that opened last week.

506
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,340
It's about 200 meters from here, and to the left...

507
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:38,660
Thank you!

508
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,460
What are you doing, Ryo-san?

509
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,360
I just wanted you to be honest with me from the beginning.

510
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,080
I don't want to be the first person to get 10,000!

511
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,180
Hello?

512
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,440
Yes, that's me.

513
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,840
Please wait a moment.

514
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,920
It's me, your wife.

515
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,800
I see.

516
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,860
Hello? It's me.

517
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,520
Yes.

518
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,700
Yes.

519
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,200
I see.

520
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,560
I understand.

521
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,980
What's the result, Chief?

522
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,300
It seems she was in second place.

523
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,180
She's the runner-up!

524
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,340
Isn't that amazing, Chief?

525
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,200
Congratulations!

526
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,320
What are you talking about?

527
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,280
Oh, thank you.

528
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,980
Thank you.

529
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,320
I won't let you shake hands with me today.

530
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,040
No, Chief.

531
00:22:59,460 --> 00:22:59,980
Congratulations.

532
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,480
You're giving an indirect hand shake with Sayuri Yoshikawa, aren't you?

533
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,000
OK. I'll show you what's done today.

534
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,080
Is there something wrong with Sayuri Yoshikawa?

535
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,920
She's seen you again, Ryo-san.

536
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,240
Oh, no.

537
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,380
I don't want to, you'll be embarrassed, Chief.

538
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,400
I can't show that anymore.

539
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,800
You were perfect for me today, and you did a great job.

540
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,260
Thank you.

541
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,460
Hey, Chief, what's wrong?

542
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,540
You're not like a Chief, please stop.

543
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,700
I've never felt as strongly about your presence as today.

544
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,840
Thank you.

545
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,540
You're the only one who can draw something like this!

546
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,820
I thought you were stuck up all night today, so I hid this.

547
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,420
No, Ryo-chan, you didn't turn off the alarm this morning, did you?

548
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,880
Chief, there are many reasons for this!

549
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,920
You idiot!

550
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,000
What happened to Gikkuri-goshi, Chief?

551
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,660
Fourth

552
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:18,800
Thank you, Chief.

553
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,100
After the rain, I looked back at someone calling me, and I was walking.

554
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,700
I knew.

555
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,060
It was my parents, who were killed in that rain while I was walking.

556
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,340
I'm sure it's the same being important that...

557
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,000
I walked only to a far place

558
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,140
Everyone was a child once

559
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,240
But everyone has forgotten

560
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,860
A politician with a great face

561
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,120
And a blue old lady above

562
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,040
Turn around and look at that corner

563
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,520
I'll see you all

564
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,580
Let's go!

565
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,900
There is a wall

566
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,500
There must be a wall

567
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,360
Everyone come to our town

568
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,420
Thank you!

569
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,800
Speaking of Grandma's Harajuku, it's Sugamo

570
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,580
But Grandpa has nothing

571
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,020
There is nothing there

572
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,400
I thought

573
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,660
I'll make Kameari Grandma's Harajuku

574
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,680
And make a town

575
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,040
It's a great plan

576
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,240
Next time, Ryotsu Town renovation plan

577
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,620
Please look forward to it

578
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,300
There is a wall

579
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,980
There must be a wall

580
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,820
Everyone come to our town

581
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
Thank you!
