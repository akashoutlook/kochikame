00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,540
Wednesday, April 8, 2010

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,280
I look at one day,

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:22,040
floating in the river,

4
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,380
Even if you're a kid, you're a patsushika

5
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,640
Even if you're a kid, you're a patsushika

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,460
The city's waves are strangely gentle

7
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,760
From the waterfront of Tongari Boshi

8
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,400
To Kaishakuten

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,460
The sunset falls

10
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,740
Tomorrow will end like this

11
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,600
If you're a patsushika, you'll be happy again

12
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,640
I've lost it, but I've realized

13
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,700
Because I'm such an idiot

14
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,220
I'm more of a patsusika than a penser

15
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,920
I want to see you like a patsushika

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,140
Every time I am the patsushika

17
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,240
Every time I am the patsushika

18
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,220
In order to make you happy, I have to love you

19
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,300
I love you, Inol

20
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,740
I love you, Inol

21
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,120
This is the Akasaka Geyhinkan station.

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,020
The car with the Kokuo family will soon arrive.

23
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,660
500 police officers are guarding the Geyhinkan.

24
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,200
In an emergency situation, the police will receive orders from the headquarters.

25
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,400
The first two laps have been one-on-one.

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
The batter is not yet a hit today.

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,280
The Kokuo car is coming.

28
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,560
The princess is also in a hurry.

29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,760
The pitcher is in first place.

30
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,620
He throws!

31
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,620
He's hit!

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,520
What?

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,920
Let the car stop!

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,840
Oh no!

35
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,580
Something terrible has happened!

36
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,480
Ryo, if you make a mistake, you should apologize soon.

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,960
What happened?

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,060
Well, I didn't do anything.

39
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,920
What is this?

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,320
Soon, the home run will be hit.

41
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,520
The home run was hit.

42
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,860
That's right.

43
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,840
Excuse me.

44
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,940
It seems that my subordinates misunderstood.

45
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,160
No, it's really a trouble for Takahashi.

46
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,060
Idiot!

47
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,360
You!

48
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,520
What do you think of the national honor?

49
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,440
Ouch!

50
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,740
I'm fine here.

51
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,220
It's fine.

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,100
Tomorrow's your day off is over.

53
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,460
No!

54
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,680
I don't want that.

55
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,340
I arrived safely.

56
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,480
Japan seems to have become less safe than before.

57
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,400
Tomorrow's new security will be more strict.

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,160
What?

59
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,440
Oh, what's wrong, Fanny?

60
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,820
Well...

61
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,200
Even if it's not like that,

62
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,780
when the SP people are around,

63
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,100
the private schedule is not fun.

64
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,760
Fanny is always a child.

65
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,820
Oh, I'm already an adult.

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,400
Because tomorrow...

67
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,720
Your Majesty,

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,920
the official schedule will be changed a little tomorrow.

69
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,060
I see.

70
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,200
Your Majesty,

71
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,240
tomorrow is...

72
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,060
I've fixed the dress for tomorrow.

73
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,920
I'll go now.

74
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,280
Fanny,

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,400
the one who got the money,

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,240
don't bother her.

77
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,200
Be a good girl.

78
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,260
Everyone completely forgets about my birthday.

79
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,160
Where are you going, Fanny?

80
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,000
Princess, move!

81
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,860
To the toilet!

82
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,820
Princess Bunny will be officially visited by this Kazushika Wonderland.

83
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,260
The visit time is 30 minutes.

84
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,880
Until then, don't let the princess get in danger.

85
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,960
Be careful.

86
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,980
Be careful with the best of your ability.

87
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,740
It's such a short time already

88
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,860
You're so slow.

89
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,500
Ryo-san.

90
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,180
Eh?

91
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,180
Ouch!

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,220
You're here to take revenge for what you did last night.

93
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,420
If you listen to baseball,

94
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,520
I'll give you a thrashing this time.

95
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,720
I know.

96
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,800
I had a request from the amusement park.

97
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,720
I wanted you to avoid the disgusting security guards.

98
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,000
So we'll guard the princess so that the public won't notice.

99
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,440
The Princess Guard

100
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,600
The Princess Guard

101
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:00,780
The Princess Guard

102
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,200
The Princess Guard

103
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,380
The Princess Guard

104
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,300
The Princess Guard

105
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,980
I can't believe they didn't notice.

106
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,920
He looks weak.

107
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
And he's hard to move.

108
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,180
Don't say that.

109
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:11,920
Huh?

110
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,700
The Princess Guard

111
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,360
The Princess Guard

112
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,100
The princess looks too good on him.

113
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,940
The Princess Guard

114
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,180
Hello.

115
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,380
Everyone.

116
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,220
Are you ready?

117
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,100
Huh?

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,500
I asked the Torrent to teach you how to move.

119
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,580
There's such a thing?

120
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,740
Let's start with the basic greeting.

121
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,300
Spread your hands like this.

122
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,200
Welcome to Wonderland.

123
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,220
Next is the pose when you're asked for a picture.

124
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,640
The point is to lightly touch the customer.

125
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,360
And this is the bye-bye pose when you go home.

126
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,760
Pay attention to the movement of the bridge.

127
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,100
You're telling us to do that?

128
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,320
Mr. Ryo.

129
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,100
Mr. Ryo.

130
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,480
Huh?

131
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,040
What?

132
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,180
The pose for hello.

133
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,280
The pose for the picture.

134
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,320
Bye-bye.

135
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,500
Bye-bye.

136
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,820
He's doing his best.

137
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,300
So, what's the question?

138
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,140
Teacher, a question.

139
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,420
If there's a naughty child, can I hit him?

140
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,200
You can't.

141
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,600
He'll jump.

142
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,740
But I saw a drunk person hugging the Princess Guard.

143
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,440
Do you pretend not to see it even at that time?

144
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,080
If so, what would you do?

145
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,020
If so...

146
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,340
Such characters are harshly warned.

147
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,480
Idol characters shouldn't touch it.

148
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,980
I see.

149
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,440
If the customer is beautiful,

150
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,160
can I ask about his phone number?

151
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,720
I mean, before, the sleepy man who had seven boys was probably picking up...

152
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,020
Shut up.

153
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,800
Then how many Tsukki Bears are in this amusement park?

154
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,820
What?

155
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,500
In my gut, I feel like there are at least ten.

156
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,980
But...

157
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,080
Hmm...

158
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,740
Okay, I'll answer.

159
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,600
There's only one Tsukkii Bear in your hearts.

160
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,340
Eh? Then how many females do you have?

161
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,820
You! Don't call me a female, you're a Nini Bear!

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,180
And stop calling me a "hiki", "hiki"!

163
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:02,820
Question.

164
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,080
The Prince of Tolland played at Roppongi's Foreigner Bar.

165
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
Is that okay?

166
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,740
Tolland is a world of dreams and fantasy.

167
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,700
Don't check out those kind of places!

168
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,540
Ah, I understand.

169
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,300
Well then, bye-bye!

170
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,440
That teacher is so full of his moves.

171
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,340
Wow!

172
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,000
It's so nice!

173
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,220
We'll be there in 30 minutes.

174
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,340
I understand.

175
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,520
Ah, Yakuza!

176
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:45,980
We're free to go!

177
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,240
Hey, girl!

178
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's play together!

179
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,920
Eh?

180
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,260
You're coming alone, right?

181
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,460
Hey, don't you mind?

182
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,400
But, I...

183
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
Let's have fun!

184
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,880
Hm?

185
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,160
What?

186
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,160
Bye-bye!

187
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,580
Oh, Tsukkii!

188
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,800
You're protecting me?

189
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,880
Yeah.

190
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,760
So you're my bodyguards here?

191
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,060
That's wonderful!

192
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,300
Hmm...

193
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,960
I'm just a boring middle-aged old man,

194
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,240
but if you're so boring,

195
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,820
I'm sure you're a real shop.

196
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey, Azulim!

197
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,480
Let's play here!

198
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,280
Shut up!

199
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:22,720
Go away!

200
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,100
I don't have time to play with you!

201
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,100
You kids!

202
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:26,900
Huh?

203
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,160
Why do you think we're fighting?

204
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,820
We're playing the role of customers,

205
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,120
but we're also protecting the princess.

206
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,580
Ha ha ha.

207
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,280
Welcome to Wonderland!

208
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,000
Welcome to Wonderland!

209
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,300
Yo-san, your legs are upside down!

210
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,440
Ah, wait!

211
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,280
Ouch! Ouch!

212
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,380
Ouch!

213
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,500
Ouch!

214
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,260
Ouch!

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,780
Ouch!

216
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,300
Ouch!

217
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,760
Ouch!

218
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,300
Ouch!

219
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,200
Oh!

220
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:54,880
Oh, welcome!

221
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,380
Ha ha ha!

222
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,520
What a fun ride!

223
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,980
Let's ride that!

224
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,840
Huh?

225
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,560
What?

226
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,740
Hurry, hurry!

227
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,400
Ouch!

228
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,140
One more time.

229
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,200
We'll do this later.

230
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:09,760
OK.

231
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,020
Cool!

232
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,840
That was fun!

233
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,400
This time it's that sound!

234
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,100
Here we go!

235
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,760
Next it's this one!

236
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Wait!

237
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,360
That was fun!

238
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,140
I'm not going to let you go.

239
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,160
You're old. You're not going to let me go.

240
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,460
Don't look away from the princess.

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,220
I'm not going to let you go.

242
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:09,800
I'm not going to let you go.

243
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,680
It's a parade!

244
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:11,940
Huh?

245
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,340
There's a rumor that the princess is coming.

246
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,100
You need to be very careful during the parade.

247
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,020
If you're such an important person,

248
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,600
you should lock the room and get out.

249
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,140
Wow! Cute!

250
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,860
T-that Trump wasn't there.

251
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,640
Hey! Stop that Trump!

252
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,060
Hey, who are you?

253
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,980
I'm just an attraction.

254
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,880
What?

255
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,860
Piyo!

256
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:38,580
Huh?

257
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,680
Who are you? Get away from her!

258
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,840
Help me!

259
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,560
Ryotsu! What's wrong, Ryotsu?

260
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,080
You bastard!

261
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,820
This way.

262
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,960
They're trying to kidnap me!

263
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,440
What? Let's go back to headquarters.

264
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,940
No! If we go back, we'll be caught!

265
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,640
What do you mean?

266
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,020
I'm so sad.

267
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,380
You're good, princess.

268
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,580
This way!

269
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,660
What's this?

270
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,280
It hurts.

271
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,260
This way!

272
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,200
Chucky!

273
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,520
Nobody's here.

274
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,380
Over there!

275
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,160
We should leave the amusement park.

276
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,120
Yeah.

277
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,180
What's wrong?

278
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,220
I'm sorry.

279
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,500
Tsukki suddenly turned into a gorilla.

280
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,460
It was bad of him.

281
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,240
No way.

282
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,060
We just went to pick up the princess.

283
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,800
What's going on?

284
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,960
You didn't hear the order to hand over the princess to the SP?

285
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,720
Ryotsu!

286
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,620
Ryotsu!

287
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,320
Can you hear us?

288
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,380
If you can hear us, answer us!

289
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,400
Ryotsu!

290
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,440
Bring Fanny back!

291
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,860
Ryotsu!

292
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,940
That's enough!

293
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,420
We'll lead the way from here.

294
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,660
The kidnappers are running away with Princess Fanny.

295
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,220
Kidnapping?

296
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,820
Wait!

297
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,440
That's stupid, but he wouldn't do that!

298
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,460
That's right.

299
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,440
We should hurry as soon as we find her.

300
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,140
Yeah.

301
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,600
We can't just kill her.

302
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:37,900
What?

303
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,120
Remember this!

304
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,740
CI

305
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,360
Hello?

306
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,080
You didn't answer your phone!

307
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,840
Damn, they got me!

308
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,460
Do you know this?

309
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,280
Eiffel Tower?

310
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,640
Yeah, that's the Tokyo tower.

311
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,860
I have to let the chief know soon.

312
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,020
There's the Golden Gate Bridge over there!

313
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,560
That's the Rainbow Bridge.

314
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,460
It's not time to be watching Tokyo.

315
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,220
Where's the Koshuden?

316
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,040
It's not working.

317
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,580
I see.

318
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,140
It's faster to take a taxi and go straight to the office.

319
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,100
But you're the kidnapper.

320
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,520
Are those pirates the SP who came to pick me up?

321
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,300
I'm sorry.

322
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,720
I don't know!

323
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,920
What did you do to me?

324
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,520
What will happen to me?

325
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,060
Will I be beheaded?

326
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,480
I'll be beheaded for sure!

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,840
Tsukki!

328
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,580
Don't stop!

329
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,360
I'll pick you up, so go back to the office by yourself!

330
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,260
Hey, taxi!

331
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,240
I don't want to go back yet!

332
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
I want to stay like this longer.

333
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,620
I want to know more about this country.

334
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,460
If you listen to my request, I'll definitely thank you.

335
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,320
You'll thank me?

336
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,260
Yes.

337
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,280
I'm the princess of the Ejinbu Kingdom.

338
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,280
I see.

339
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,880
Princess = rich = thank you?

340
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,620
I understand.

341
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,180
If it's a request from the Princess Fanny, who is nothing else...

342
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,900
Really?

343
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,600
I'm so happy!

344
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:38,080
It's so nice.

345
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,140
Thank you, Tsukki.

346
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,140
Not Tsukki, I'm Ryotsu Kankichi.

347
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,460
Kankiri?

348
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,040
Not Kankiri, Kankichi.

349
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,780
You're right to choose me as your tour guide.

350
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,120
But I'm specialized in northern towns.

351
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,000
Kankichi

352
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,040
Kankichi

353
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,740
Kankichi

354
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,080
Kankichi

355
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,760
Kankichi

356
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,000
Kankichi

357
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,180
Kankichi

358
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,280
Kankichi

359
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,040
Kankichi

360
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,060
Kankichi

361
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,860
Kankichi

362
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,320
Kankichi

363
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,060
Kankichi

364
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,180
Kankichi

365
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,580
Kankichi

366
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,020
Kankichi

367
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,120
Kankichi

368
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,400
Kankichi

369
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,580
Kankichi

370
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:14,600
Kankichi

371
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,060
Kankichi

372
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,580
Kankichi

373
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,260
Kankichi

374
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,520
Kankichi

375
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,220
Kankichi

376
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,880
Kankichi

377
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,580
Kankichi

378
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,900
Look! It's a cute doll!

379
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,260
It's good!

380
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,960
Can you eat this?

381
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,480
It's sweet!

382
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,180
If you eat it, you'll have to pay for it.

383
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,760
I...

384
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,400
What? You don't have money?

385
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,020
Not at all?

386
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,840
What's wrong with you?

387
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,760
This is a salted bean.

388
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,840
It's a snack that I couldn't eat when I was a kid because it was expensive.

389
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,520
You're so bad.

390
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,700
Like this.

391
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,640
Yes. There's also this.

392
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,740
There are many other ways to eat it.

393
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,820
I'm Kannon from Asakusa.

394
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,800
I want to make a wish for you.

395
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,520
What about Kankichi?

396
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
When I was a kid,

397
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,140
I asked him to make me rich, but he still wouldn't make me rich.

398
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,000
Do you have any wishes for a princess?

399
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,380
I want to be a normal girl, not a princess.

400
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,820
Today is my birthday.

401
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,180
Birthday?

402
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,440
I was always alone.

403
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,920
My father and mother were there for me.

404
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,460
Uba, Ji-Jo, and SP were there for me.

405
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,760
But it was their job.

406
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,080
There was no one who understood my feelings.

407
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,060
My house is poor.

408
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,360
My parents are always scolded and beaten.

409
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,420
I'm sorry.

410
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,680
I asked them to make me a child of a different family.

411
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,940
I thought that a person like you wouldn't have any worries.

412
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,580
They must have forgotten my birthday.

413
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,180
I'm 20 years old today.

414
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,760
Okay.

415
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,320
Then, while we celebrate your birthday,

416
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,500
let's go to the garden in Fukagawa.

417
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,740
I'll be there, Kankichi.

418
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,260
Are you okay, Fanny?

419
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,800
No!

420
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,380
W-W-Wait!

421
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,780
Move!

422
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,340
Kankichi!

423
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,120
I found you, Fanny.

424
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,520
This way.

425
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,280
You're so good at this.

426
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,020
This is the party for Princess Fanny's birthday party.

427
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,000
What's wrong?

428
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,920
The princess kept it a secret for today.

429
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,140
The Japanese Prime Minister and the king of Japan were preparing for the party.

430
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,660
But the princess isn't feeling well.

431
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,100
Oh, no!

432
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,460
So the party started a little late.

433
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,840
Are you okay?

434
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,300
Kankichi, I...

435
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,520
That's good.

436
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,360
Kankichi!

437
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,280
Fanny!

438
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,000
Ryo!

439
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,460
Don't move, Ryo!

440
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,040
Let's go.

441
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,680
His Majesty is very worried.

442
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,380
You're so rude!

443
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,260
I asked him to guide us to Tokyo.

444
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,900
Get out of the way!

445
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,800
I'm honored to be of help.

446
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,420
Oh, I see.

447
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,820
I was worried about you all, but today was the best day for me.

448
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,960
Thank you, Kankichi.

449
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:04,900
You're welcome.

450
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,760
I'll give the car to Princess Fanny.

451
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,520
Okay.

452
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,100
Um... Your Majesty!

453
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,260
This is to commemorate Tokyo.

454
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,580
Thank you.

455
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,700
And since we celebrate Fukagawa's birthday every month,

456
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,480
I'll be waiting to meet you again.

457
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,880
Oh...

458
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:25,900
Yeah.

459
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,560
Okay, goodbye.

460
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,140
Ah...

461
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,320
*sigh*

462
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:49,680
Congratulations! Princess Fanny!

463
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,780
*sigh*

464
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,460
*slight sigh*

465
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:52,680
Fanny?

466
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:01,880
*Gasps*

467
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,340
*Gasps*

468
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:04,740
*Gasps*

469
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,360
*Laughs*

470
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,580
*Gasps*

471
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,780
*Laughs*

472
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,420
That girl,

473
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,040
finally came back.

474
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,860
Did you take care of the princess?

475
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,600
I was also

476
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,440
not able to thank her,

477
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,200
so I had to take care of her.

478
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,100
Is Ryotsu here?

479
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,100
It seems that Fanny-san sent it to you.

480
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,300
What? Fanny sent it to me?

481
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,780
What? Fanny sent it to me?

482
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,680
A doll?

483
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,020
Fanny-san seems to have liked

484
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,500
in this case.

485
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,800
The director is also happy.

486
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,000
We will see how it goes.

487
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,920
I'm glad, Ryotsu.

488
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,240
Oh, Senpai!

489
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,600
What?

490
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,280
My bodyguard, Kankichi?

491
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,840
Thank you for your wonderful birthday.

492
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,940
Please come to the Ejinbu someday.

493
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,820
Please come to the Ejinbu someday.

494
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,220
This time, I will be your guide.

495
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,660
With love from Fanny.

496
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,460
With love from Fanny.

497
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,120
That's good, Ryotsu-san.

498
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,780
Fanny is in love with me!

499
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,100
Then, I'll go!

500
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,840
Ryotsu!

501
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,080
Don't tell me you seriously want to go to the Ejinbu Kingdom.

502
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,420
Don't tell me you seriously want to go to the Ejinbu Kingdom.

503
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,980
But Senpai, I think it's just a car accident.

504
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,980
But Senpai, I think it's just a car accident.

505
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,000
Everyone, stay healthy!

506
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,580
When we meet again, I'm Prince Kankichi.

507
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,760
When we meet again, I'm Prince Kankichi.

508
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,360
When we meet again, I'm Prince Kankichi.

509
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,460
-Bye-bye! -Bye-bye!

510
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,440
-It's hard! -What?

511
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,240
A few days ago, the princess of the Ejinbu Kingdom

512
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,980
announced her engagement.

513
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,200
announced her engagement.

514
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,880
Her partner is the rumored princess of the neighboring kingdom.

515
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,660
her partner is the rumored princess of the neighboring kingdom.

516
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,520
It was a car accident, after all.

517
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,280
And Ryo-san forgot something.

518
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,100
And Ryo-san forgot something.

519
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,380
How stupid he is!

520
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,100
How stupid he is!

521
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,860
Wait, honey!

522
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,120
Your beloved Prince Kankichi is coming!

523
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,500
Your beloved Prince Kankichi is coming!

524
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,340
You're not going to believe this!

525
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,280
You're not going to believe this!

526
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,040
Don't look at me like that and go away.

527
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,180
Daddy!

528
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,960
Daddy!

529
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,180
I can't believe you guys

530
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,560
why don't you go home?

531
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,980
Do you want him to put me here again?

532
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,480
I can't believe you guys

533
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,220
It's like a dream, the final energy

534
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,460
Tomorrow, the third day, yesterday, the new year, the universe

535
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,560
If we stand on the ground, the stars in the mirror will turn into a circle

536
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,120
This is good, right?

537
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,420
There's no reason to say it's good!

538
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,840
The film studio Orion-za

539
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,060
The film studio Orion-za has been in the spotlight for a long time

540
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,920
There are memories of my childhood

541
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,620
When the movie was the king of entertainment

542
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,040
It was hot that summer day

543
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,580
Next time, Asakusa Cinema Paradise

544
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,480
Thank you!
