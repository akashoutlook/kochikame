1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
Opening닝

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,040
Te, te TV wo miru toki wo

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,380
Hey, a wa karukku shitte hanarette mite ne

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,560
Nakakawa ni ukabu

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,880
Noru hi wo megakete

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,860
I kicked the pebble and it flew to my shoes

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,560
I wonder if I'm going to the gym that I was working out

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,680
I laughed at the fact that I was just a child

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,880
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,760
I'm just a child

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,400
The cityscape that doesn't change is strangely gentle

12
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:09,980
From the water tank of a pointed hat

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,940
The sun goes down to the sea

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,220
tomorrow

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,800
This is how it ends

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,880
I realized that I lost happiness

17
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,680
Because I'm a fool

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,100
Oh, there's something unusual

19
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,480
Is it a shield?

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,460
It's called a recorder now

21
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,580
I fell into the abyss before this

22
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,000
I used to play with this a lot

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,220
I imitated Charmela

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,580
When I was a kid, I played with a flute

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,180
You did too, didn't you?

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,580
I was a flute when I was a kid

27
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,800
A flute is a string

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,260
Back in the days, when you were a whiz

29
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,540
I had a gold-plated flute

30
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,120
I'm sorry

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,500
It's too old for us

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,080
I see

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,120
Why was Reiko learning that?

34
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,000
Even if you tell me why

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,660
The first piano I got was a flute

36
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,140
I was a fruit at first.

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,020
I was a fruit at first.

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,260
I was a special student in the middle school.

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,340
Why do you guys always have good quality things?

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,780
When it comes to elementary school, it's all about the Tatebue!

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,800
Even if you say that ...

42
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,280
Senpai, you have a lot of memories.

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,360
I'm so frustrated! I can't talk about Tatebue!

44
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,860
You won't cry, will you?

45
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,080
Oh? There's a meaning to it.

46
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,740
What?

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,900
It's true.

48
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,080
Maybe it's an initials of the owner.

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,140
I think so.

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,580
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

51
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,000
I just remembered.

52
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,460
I once had an initials.

53
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,560
It's a Tatebue memory of Senpai.

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,480
Let me hear it.

55
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,160
I want to hear it too.

56
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,120
I think it was when I was in the fifth grade of elementary school.

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,100
I remember that.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,900
I remember it.

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,660
I remember it.

60
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,000
A girl named Himeno has transferred to this class.

61
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,160
I am Yukiko Himeno.

62
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,280
Nice to meet you.

63
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,300
That girl is so cute.

64
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,080
She's an idol.

65
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,600
She came to me a few days later.

66
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,980
Um ...

67
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,980
Kankichi-kun ...

68
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,660
There's something I want to ask of you.

69
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,660
Oh, me?

70
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,100
"A beautiful girl in Class 1 is asking for Kankichi?"

71
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,580
What's going on?

72
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,640
What do you mean, "Kankichi is asking for me"?

73
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,800
That's...

74
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,500
What's wrong? Tell me.

75
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,600
No way...

76
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,360
Kankichi, please go out with me.

77
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,720
Oh, no.

78
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,820
Actually, it's about the flute.

79
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,140
Flute?

80
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,380
Yes, the one we use for music.

81
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,920
What's wrong with the flute?

82
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,680
A classmate of mine is exchanging his flute with mine.

83
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,740
What?

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,440
I noticed something was wrong, so I bought a new one.

85
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,200
I see.

86
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,800
So you're exchanging your flute for an indirect kiss.

87
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,080
I don't feel good.

88
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,540
I thought Kankichi would do something for me.

89
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,780
Himeno...

90
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,960
Okay, don't cry. I'll do something for you.

91
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,360
I'll do something.

92
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,380
Really?

93
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,820
Yes, leave it to me.

94
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,120
Listen, put my flute in Himeno's flute bag until the music starts.

95
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,480
Wait.

96
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,840
If you do this, you'll know who exchanged it.

97
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,520
I don't feel good.

98
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,040
That's too much.

99
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,640
The flute was exchanged for a good one.

100
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,900
Let's dig up the letter K.

101
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,860
He's exchanging it again.

102
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,300
Two or three months.

103
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,820
So that's why most of the class boys...

104
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,640
use the flute with the letter K on it.

105
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,940
Aren't you embarrassed?

106
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,320
You exchanged your flute with your own.

107
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,660
The evidence is the K mark on your flute.

108
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,520
Really?

109
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,800
It's a mark I left on my flute for Himeno's flute.

110
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,280
I'll beat you up!

111
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,020
I'll beat you up!

112
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll beat you up!

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,460
Of course! I won't do it again.

114
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,180
Thank you, Kankichi.

115
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,080
So we solved the case safely.

116
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,240
I see.

117
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,180
That's good.

118
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,440
Good!

119
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,060
Hey!

120
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,940
Hey, is the stolen thing delivered?

121
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,620
Stolen thing?

122
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,680
Yes! It's Sonori-ko!

123
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,840
What? Is this Junpei's?

124
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,980
Yes! It says Junpei's J here.

125
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,980
It's definitely mine.

126
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,000
That's great.

127
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,940
Don't drop it again.

128
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,820
Yes! Thank you very much!

129
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,660
Well then.

130
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,660
Hey, Senpai, it's patrol time.

131
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,820
I have a lot to do even though I look like this.

132
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,740
I have to keep an eye on the social movements.

133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Ryo-chan, you're going to skip again?

134
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,240
Then I'll go instead.

135
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,280
Nagaya! I'm going after all!

136
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,140
Senpai!

137
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,660
I'm going after you, Ryo-chan.

138
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,840
I'm really in a hurry.

139
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,220
It's certainly getting old.

140
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,060
Hey!

141
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,860
Idiot!

142
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,080
You got caught, Kankichi!

143
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:06,980
What?

144
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,300
I'm not Kankichi!

145
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,780
You too?

146
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,760
I saw you in the newspaper this morning.

147
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,580
I was going to watch it again before I was taken away.

148
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,600
Me too.

149
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,800
No.

150
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,180
You got yelled at earlier and my body reacted.

151
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,300
That thrill is nostalgic now.

152
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,340
Yes, indeed.

153
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,160
Our classroom is here.

154
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,700
It's small.

155
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,400
Our desk has grown.

156
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,900
You've grown up.

157
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,940
What? 10 people in one class?

158
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,220
It's like a city.

159
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,440
We had about 50 people back in the day.

160
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,340
There were so many people,

161
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,500
that we couldn't find anyone in the next class who would eat.

162
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,960
You did it!

163
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,220
You always didn't have enough food,

164
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,940
so you became one of the seven mysteries of school!

165
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,940
Speaking of the seven mysteries,

166
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,880
it's the one where ghosts appear in the big mirror in the hallway.

167
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,000
The one where ghosts appear in the big mirror in the hallway.

168
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,220
But the real one was...

169
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,000
Kankichi.

170
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,300
You did it!

171
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,740
And the one where Beethoven's eyes move in the music room.

172
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,840
That was also Kankichi.

173
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,920
He was peeking from behind the wall.

174
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,500
He was usually playing with a ball and deceiving us.

175
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,620
The seven mysteries of school are like the ones we made!

176
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,020
Speaking of the music room,

177
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,660
there's also the one where the piano plays.

178
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,300
Huh?

179
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,400
Oh, I know!

180
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,980
Is this good enough?

181
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,620
It looks like there's really no one here.

182
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,200
Hey, it looks like someone's coming.

183
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,260
Okay.

184
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,380
Huh?

185
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,460
Stop it!

186
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,140
Tompei and Chinkichi!

187
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,800
So, the one who played the piano was...

188
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,260
Kankichi, didn't you?

189
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,900
So it was him?

190
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,760
No one would be scared of such a little freak.

191
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,820
Even ghosts.

192
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,760
Do you like this one?

193
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,840
First time, we went for a walk!

194
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,160
Amazing!

195
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,720
You are very talented, Himeno.

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,040
I love playing Piano.

197
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,520
It's my dream to be a pianist.

198
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,660
Himeno, are you ready?

199
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,320
I am ready!

200
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,740
Alright.

201
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,080
Grrr, okay.

202
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,320
Huh?

203
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,980
What's taking you so long?

204
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,580
I getغatome~

205
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,900
I getgotome~

206
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,320
I getgotome~

207
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,560
Hey, Kankichi! You again!

208
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,640
Run!

209
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,940
Himeno!

210
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,980
Hey! Wait!

211
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,260
Himeno went to Europe to study piano right after graduating from elementary school.

212
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,300
What's he doing now?

213
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,740
You don't know?

214
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,640
Huh?

215
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,420
Himeno died in a car accident last year.

216
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,280
What?

217
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,620
He had a dream and became a pianist. He was trying his best.

218
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,560
I see. I didn't know that.

219
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,110
Kankichi...

220
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,280
Hey! I heard the piano!

221
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,180
You can't hear it?

222
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,440
I can hear it!

223
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,360
There's no one here!

224
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,960
No way...

225
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,880
I can hear it from here.

226
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,520
Let's go!

227
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:55,620
Let's go!

228
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,880
What's that? A bell?

229
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,280
It's automatic.

230
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,500
Oh...

231
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,560
Let's go.

232
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,180
Are we going to the music room?

233
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,040
That's the only place to play the piano.

234
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,980
I knew it.

235
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,400
Kankichi, open the door.

236
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:23,880
Open the door.

237
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,700
Me?

238
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,520
Donbei, you do it.

239
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,680
Why me?

240
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,440
Kankichi, open the door.

241
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,600
I don't know what to do.

242
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,140
Let's do it together.

243
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,820
Okay.

244
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,760
Let's go.

245
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,020
A student is playing the piano.

246
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,320
What?

247
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,060
Himeno!

248
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,060
I'm sorry!

249
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,920
What?

250
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,280
The piano...

251
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,660
I used it without permission.

252
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,780
What?

253
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:56,880
You?

254
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,580
What?

255
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,040
Was it Himeno's daughter?

256
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,740
It's true. It's similar.

257
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,640
Her name is Megumi.

258
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,420
Maybe...

259
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,220
It's the three members of the Tonshin family, right?

260
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,640
Why do you know that?

261
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,260
I often heard from my mother.

262
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,520
Himeno told us about us?

263
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,180
Yes.

264
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,160
It's exactly what I imagined.

265
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,800
All three of them.

266
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,900
I used gold-colored pens and made a golden golden pen,

267
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,940
and a dehumidifier used alcohol lamps to grill and eat.

268
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,960
My mother said she had so much fun in school,

269
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,600
I probably wasn't good at this.

270
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,680
At the time,

271
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,980
I knew that my school would be detained,

272
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,380
so I decided to check the newspaper one by one.

273
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,280
When I entered the music room,

274
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,300
I bumped into the piano,

275
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,580
so I just...

276
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,960
So that's where we came by chance.

277
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,920
I feel like that's fate.

278
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,920
Megumi is good at piano, but is it a dream to be a pianist like me?

279
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,540
Yes! But I'm not sure if I can be like you.

280
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,720
You don't have confidence? You were playing so well.

281
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,780
Compared to you, I've been aiming for you all this time.

282
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,560
But you're no longer there.

283
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,260
I thought you played better while you were playing.

284
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,020
That's not true. I was the same age as you.

285
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,340
You?

286
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,240
What's wrong?

287
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,000
See? I filled in the time capsule.

288
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,320
Time capsule?

289
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,120
I was at the school when you graduated.

290
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,520
Oh, so you're in it too.

291
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,680
I'll make you the same age as Megumi.

292
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,840
I thought it was around here.

293
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,220
It was more than 20 years ago.

294
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,900
Hey, Ryozu.

295
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,700
Yes?

296
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,500
When I said I wasn't confident, you said you were the same age as your mother.

297
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,820
Yes.

298
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,640
Can you tell me about that time?

299
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,500
We were the same age when we graduated.

300
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,540
Are you going abroad?

301
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,800
Yes.

302
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,940
Are you sure? You can't understand Japanese if you go abroad.

303
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,540
You're going to eat with a knife and fork instead of chopsticks.

304
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,460
Are you worried about me?

305
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,140
Yes.

306
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,340
No, it's nothing.

307
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,240
It's a little sad to part with everyone at this school, but I've already decided.

308
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,220
I see. You're really good at playing the piano.

309
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,200
It's better to study abroad than in Japan.

310
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,400
Kankichi.

311
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,060
Do your best. I'm supporting you.

312
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,500
But I have a test before that.

313
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,180
You'll pass it for sure.

314
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,740
But good students come to take the test from all the schools.

315
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,020
If it's okay, I'll take it.

316
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,100
I guarantee it.

317
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,340
Thank you, Kankichi.

318
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,120
No, I can't play well.

319
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,640
I have only one week left until the test.

320
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
What's wrong?

321
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,440
You were playing so well until recently.

322
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,520
I heard it.

323
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,260
It's the first time I've ever seen Kankichi.

324
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,220
He's not even bad.

325
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,740
You're really good at playing.

326
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,440
Good luck.

327
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,600
Really.

328
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,180
Hey, Momo.

329
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,500
What are you talking about?

330
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,750
Why are you so serious?

331
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,020
We mean it, right?

332
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,780
I know you're going to try.

333
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,080
I didn't know.

334
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,520
The bat didn't come out smoothly, but I tried my best to hit it, and when I hit the shirimochi, the strength of my shoulders came out.

335
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,900
I think it was good to relax and swing the bat without getting tired.

336
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,660
Yes, this is it.

337
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,160
This is the second one.

338
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,440
There's a simpler way to do it without showing your face.

339
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,660
What is it?

340
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,820
If you do this,

341
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,760
Look!

342
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,420
Look, the strength of my shoulders came out.

343
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,740
Don't interrupt me!

344
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,060
Hey, Himeno!

345
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,420
This was a big failure.

346
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,000
Of course, Chuno!

347
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,520
Shut up! I thought it was a good idea at that time.

348
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,500
I tried a lot to make Himeno relax, but it didn't work out.

349
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,920
I can't do it.

350
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,300
Hehehe, Himeno. Don't make such a difficult face. Relax your shoulders.

351
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,120
I told you to stay away from me! I hate you, Kankichi!

352
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,820
Himeno! Please open the door! I can't go up alone!

353
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,260
Finally, he stopped listening to me.

354
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,040
I couldn't help but notice that he was in a bad mood.

355
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,260
I can't do this. I can't do this at all.

356
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,120
Hang in there. You can do it.

357
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,820
Himeno...

358
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,820
Yes.

359
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,300
What are you worried about, little girl?

360
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,060
Huh?

361
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,760
It's me! It's me!

362
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,740
It's me!

363
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,460
You don't know that I'm right in front of you?

364
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,340
No way.

365
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,440
Look at me.

366
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,920
Do you understand? I'm Beethoven.

367
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,960
I've been here all along, listening to your performance.

368
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:54,800
Again?

369
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,420
Don't worry. You have enough talent.

370
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,420
All you have to do is relax.

371
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,580
Relax?

372
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,220
I know you love playing the piano.

373
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,140
You used to play it more happily.

374
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,440
If you play it with fun and relaxation, you'll get good results.

375
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,440
Yes, Mr. Beethoven.

376
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,860
Relax your shoulders.

377
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,020
He's praised his exhibition.

378
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,520
Nice. You're doing fine.

379
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,560
So you've all been doing this to ease me, haven't you?

380
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,940
Thank you, Kankichi.

381
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,720
I did it!

382
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,360
"He told us he doesn't like the school."

383
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:09,140
"He said he will go to school anytime."

384
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:18,600
Congratulations, Mr. Himeno!

385
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,660
Congratulations!!

386
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,700
Congratulations!

387
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,520
You did it, Himeno!

388
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,380
Congratulations!

389
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,800
That's it.

390
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,060
Mom, you didn't tell me that...

391
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,240
Hey, did you find it?

392
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,180
No.

393
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,300
I didn't.

394
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
Where did you bury it?

395
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,740
Kankichi!

396
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,400
Himeno.

397
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,780
Thank you, Beethoven.

398
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,760
What? You found out?

399
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,620
Even if I go abroad, I won't forget about you.

400
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,800
Because you are my Beethoven.

401
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,840
You'll do your best.

402
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,140
Yes.

403
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,960
Did you find it, Kankichi?

404
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,900
No, not at all.

405
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,920
Did you really bury it?

406
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,620
It's getting more and more suspicious.

407
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,380
It's dark and we can't go any further.

408
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,860
But...

409
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,400
What?

410
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,480
But the demolition will start tomorrow.

411
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,800
Oh, yeah.

412
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,340
But if it gets dark like this, it'll be...

413
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,840
If I really wait, I won't be able to play for the rest of my life.

414
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,880
Megumi...

415
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,520
Tompei! Chinkichi!

416
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
Turn on all the lights in the school!

417
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,220
Oh, it's surprisingly bright.

418
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,660
We'll find it tonight.

419
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,140
It should be there.

420
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,900
I'll get it back!

421
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,140
Don't worry, Megumi.

422
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,460
We'll find it for sure.

423
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,420
Kankichi, the system will change!

424
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,060
It won't!

425
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,640
More importantly, don't you guys stop!

426
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,040
Found it!

427
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,700
This is it!

428
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,980
Did you find it?

429
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:01,880
No doubt!

430
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,520
Himeno's is...

431
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,500
Found it!

432
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
This is Mama's.

433
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,000
Try to open it.

434
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,500
There should be a 6th grade Mama like Megumi.

435
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,420
Yes!

436
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,340
Hey, we have one too!

437
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,320
What did you write?

438
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,800
I don't remember at all.

439
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,560
"I'm the future jet pilot?"

440
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
"I'm the future Prime Minister?"

441
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,560
And "B-Ball"?

442
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,660
Those are the ones who write stupid things!

443
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,760
What? Show us Kankichi's!

444
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,100
I'm not as childish as you guys!

445
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,520
I'm the captain of the Earth Defense Force!

446
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,480
You're the most childish!

447
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,040
There's still the mud ball.

448
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,520
That's right.

449
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,280
What about Himeno?

450
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,760
"I'm the future captain of the Earth Defense Force."

451
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,500
"I'm the future captain of the Earth Defense Force."

452
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,920
I'm not as childish as you guys.

453
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,320
That's right!

454
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,760
Do you remember me?

455
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,480
Here's a picture.

456
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,480
That's me.

457
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,020
I'm the future captain, Himeno Yukiko.

458
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,300
They keep having fun.

459
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,580
"Oh, Jin иメレも一緇だ。

460
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,680
What? Mama was the same as me, right?

461
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,680
Thank you, everyone. I've finally made up my mind.

462
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,660
I'll walk the path that Mama walked.

463
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,660
I love playing the piano too, Bono.

464
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,700
I see. You'll be happy too, right, Himeno?

465
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,480
Yeah.

466
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,480
Now, let's send them off, Megumi-chan.

467
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:40,980
Yes!

468
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,860
I'm so glad I came to this school today.

469
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,020
We're glad we could meet our old selves again.

470
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,620
The school called everyone.

471
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,720
They made us make our last memory.

472
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,060
We'll be out at 5:00 tomorrow.

473
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,060
We'll have it set.

474
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,800
Bye, everyone.

475
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,780
Yeah.

476
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,880
بعد

477
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,300
I want to be with you

478
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,520
I want to be loved

479
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,700
Just a little

480
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,900
The more everyone says

481
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,280
I feel like we're melting

482
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:01,380
I want to shoot you

483
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:07,880
For some reason, love is just cowardice

484
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,320
Don't hide all the strong feelings

485
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,600
Don't hide all the strong feelings
