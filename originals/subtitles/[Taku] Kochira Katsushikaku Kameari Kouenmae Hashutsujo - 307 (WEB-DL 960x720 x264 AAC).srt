00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:33,800
It's a manga!

33
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,100
Anyway, let's have dinner with him.

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,880
Ah, senpai.

35
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,620
Itadakimasu.

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,420
It's a strange taste.

37
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,740
I don't know.

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,260
I can do it.

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,700
It's so noisy.

40
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,460
You bastard!

41
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,800
Ouch!

42
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,100
Damn it! What the hell is this?

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,440
Huh?

44
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,220
Ouch!

45
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,980
Ouch!

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:29,800
Ouch! Ouch!

47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,960
What happened?

48
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,480
What is this?

49
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,140
Mr. Ryo of Gomu Gomu.

50
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,460
What happened to my body?

51
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,340
I'm going to the hospital.

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,240
I need an ambulance.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,560
Ah, senpai.

54
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,400
Move!

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,520
Move!

56
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,440
Senpai!

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,800
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

58
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,840
It's nothing.

59
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,600
Senpai, you became a rubber human after all.

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,060
Shut it! It's your fault!

61
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,940
Why didn't you stop it at that time?

62
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,420
Eh? I stopped it, but you ate it.

63
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,460
Hey! I don't care about that.

64
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,660
I don't care about that.

65
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,920
I'm a doctor.

66
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,940
I need to go to the hospital.

67
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,140
Yes!

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,500
Let's go, Mr. Ryo of Gomu Gomu.

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,660
Okay. I'm going to the emergency room.

70
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,520
Okay!

71
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,260
I'll be right there.

72
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,420
Yeah.

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,220
Wow!

74
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,280
Oh, my God!

75
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,100
What's wrong, Mr. Ryo of Gomu Gomu?

76
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,740
Hey, Mr. Ryo of Gomu Gomu!

77
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:46,940
Ouch!

78
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,340
Ouch!

79
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,520
Ouch!

80
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,760
Ouch!

81
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,260
Ah!

82
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,460
Ouch!

83
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,320
Ouch!

84
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,480
Ouch!

85
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,960
Ouch!

86
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:01,980
Ouch!

87
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,300
Ouch!

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,160
Finally it stopped.

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,300
What?

90
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,520
Boss! I'll save you right now.

91
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,160
What?

92
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,400
Really, I'm...

93
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,360
Senpai!

94
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,280
What are you doing?

95
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,840
I can't swim anymore!

96
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,480
What?

97
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,220
Your body became rubber?

98
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,140
That's right.

99
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,120
When I woke up this morning, my arms were stretched and shrunk.

100
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,680
I can't believe that kind of manga story.

101
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,840
Then, Reiko, try pulling my hand.

102
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,940
It's really stretched.

103
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,020
Not only your arms.

104
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,280
Nakagawa, try pulling your leg.

105
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,900
Yes, sir.

106
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,860
Don't talk to me like that.

107
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm not used to this yet.

108
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,120
Please be careful.

109
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,700
I-I understand.

110
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,400
But if your legs are stretched,

111
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,540
does that mean your head and face are stretched too?

112
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,520
Yes, that's right.

113
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,080
Thanks to that, you can drown in the river.

114
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,600
You can walk outside in this body.

115
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,040
But why did you become like that?

116
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,980
Because I ate a tree called rubber that I picked up in the sea yesterday,

117
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,960
I became a rubber human.

118
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,140
What?

119
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,520
Your arms, legs, head and face are all stretched.

120
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,900
I see.

121
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,960
Well, you used to be two or six people.

122
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,700
You're still in a bad shape.

123
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,280
You guys should be worried.

124
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,040
Why am I in such a mess?

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,340
You idiot!

126
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,820
Because I'm usually in a bad shape,

127
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,280
I become like that.

128
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,540
You're in a bad shape because you ate a tree I picked up in the sea.

129
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,860
You're a big idiot.

130
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,640
Can you live a decent life?

131
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,520
Please stop, sir!

132
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,400
Then, Mr. Honda,

133
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,980
is there any way to get back to normal?

134
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,680
So far, I've been working on my body.

135
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,060
But it seems like you haven't experienced it.

136
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,800
What?

137
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,160
Does that mean I'll be a rubber human for the rest of my life?

138
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,260
Maybe.

139
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:20,700
You!

140
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,660
I thought it was just a word.

141
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,480
Please stop, senpai!

142
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,080
My legs!

143
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,520
Don't work on Honda!

144
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,300
It's your own business!

145
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
I'm a rubber human, so I don't want to be beaten.

146
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,720
You're so rude!

147
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,280
So, I'm tired of being a strange body,

148
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,160
so I'll leave today.

149
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,500
What are you talking about?

150
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,860
Do you think you can forgive me for that?

151
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,060
Hey, it's fine.

152
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,760
I'm taking a day off.

153
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,140
What?

154
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,880
It hurts!

155
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,120
If you have time to rest,

156
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,900
you can think of a way to use that strange ability for the people and the world.

157
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,200
What?

158
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,020
For the people and the world?

159
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,800
Yes.

160
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,480
It might be useful if you use it well.

161
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,220
If you say it's useful for your body,

162
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,640
I won't complain.

163
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,600
Are you serious, chief?

164
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:12,900
Alright.

165
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,320
From today, I'm a rubber human, Ryo Tsukanki!

166
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,940
What are you doing, you idiot?

167
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:25,920
Ouch!

168
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,880
I'm not used to this body yet.

169
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,440
Please look at me with longer eyes.

170
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,640
Longer eyes...

171
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,740
Don't do such a stupid thing!

172
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,520
Hey, your body is to blame.

173
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:45,620
Ugh...

174
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,280
Hehehe, well done, bro.

175
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,020
Now we're rich, too.

176
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,460
Let's get through this quickly.

177
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,900
Stop right there.

178
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,400
Who's there?

179
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,340
I can't run anymore.

180
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,080
Give me your nose quietly.

181
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,320
Heh.

182
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,540
What can you do from a place like that?

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,040
Do you think you can wait until I come here?

184
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,060
Do you think I'll wait until you come?

185
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,180
No, I won't let you wait.

186
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,520
Take this!

187
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,060
What!?

188
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,240
Big brother!

189
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,440
Did I die?

190
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,620
I'm fine because I fell from that height.

191
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,000
It's a monster!

192
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,100
Run away quickly!

193
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,680
I said I can't run away!

194
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,020
Let's go!

195
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,680
It's time for the Gomu Gomu!

196
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,680
I can't catch up anymore.

197
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,200
What was that guy?

198
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,360
You're done, big brother.

199
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
I had a bad dream.

200
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,800
I-is that so?

201
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,460
Yeah, yeah.

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,360
W-what's that guy?

203
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,220
I don't care!

204
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,040
I'll just blow him up!

205
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,160
Gomu Gomu's Diet!

206
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,700
What are you doing?

207
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,220
I'm the Gomu Gomu's Ryo.

208
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,460
Trouble!

209
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,480
I knew it.

210
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,660
Gomu Gomu's Suicide!

211
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,740
Gomu...

212
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,900
I-I-it's a monster!

213
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,080
LOL.

214
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,380
I'm in trouble.

215
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,660
S-help!

216
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,000
What are you doing?

217
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:51,960
Your fingers!

218
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,580
Yes, nowhere hard.

219
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,620
Leave it to me!

220
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,300
The Gomu Gomu's Suicide!

221
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,160
Ronin!

222
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,180
Your thumb is my life!

223
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,860
I'll attack you a little!

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,300
It's okay now. Let's run!

225
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,620
But the fire is already there...

226
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,720
What?!

227
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,480
You don't need to go through the room.

228
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,200
It's okay! Believe me!

229
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,180
The rescue of Bon Bon is complete!

230
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,640
Senpai, you're amazing!

231
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,240
You're so active!

232
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,420
Of course!

233
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,200
Thanks to being a rubber human,

234
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,360
I don't have to be beaten or hit by cars.

235
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,780
Besides, if you use the power of rubber,

236
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,320
your punches and kicks will be a few times more powerful.

237
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,560
If you get used to it, you won't have such a convenient ability.

238
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,940
As expected of Ryo-chan!

239
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,980
You're very adaptive.

240
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,860
Ryo-chan, you did well.

241
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,360
Actually, I've decided that you're going to get a police officer's certificate soon.

242
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,640
Really?

243
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,760
Of course!

244
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,680
As I said, I'm active for the sake of the world and the people.

245
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,660
There's nothing more exciting than this, Ryo-chan!

246
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,900
Of course!

247
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,800
I'll keep doing my best!

248
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,040
Yes, of course!

249
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,340
I'll use this power for everyone's sake!

250
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,120
Here!

251
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,500
Good.

252
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,860
Well, as I get used to it, this body is also very convenient.

253
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,660
Even if I sit down, I can reach the distant things.

254
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,320
As expected, I can't grab the snacks that are gone.

255
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,460
I'll go to a convenience store.

256
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,760
But I want to watch TV.

257
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,580
Oh, yes!

258
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,960
I'll go to a convenience store.

259
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,160
But I want to watch TV.

260
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,460
What is this?

261
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,920
I can't...

262
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,260
I'm sorry.

263
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,940
It costs 3,885 yen.

264
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I'll return 1,115 yen from 4,000 to 5,000 yen.

265
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:32,620
I'll return 1,115 yen from 4,000 to 5,000 yen.

266
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,560
*Growl*

267
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:35,640
*Growl*

268
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,480
*Growl*

269
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,180
*Growl*

270
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,020
*Growl*

271
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,820
This is very useful.

272
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,600
If this is the case, I can do anything while staying at home.

273
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,200
*Growl*

274
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,800
Thank you very much.

275
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,800
*Growl*

276
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,620
*Growl*

277
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,020
Ryotsu! Where is Ryotsu?

278
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,140
I haven't seen him since this morning.

279
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,880
What?

280
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,240
I told you to deliver the documents today.

281
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,840
I told you to deliver the documents today.

282
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,600
I told you to deliver the documents today.

283
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,180
*Growl*

284
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,460
*Growl*

285
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,140
*Growl*

286
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,940
This is the document that Ryotsu asked for.

287
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,140
What was that?

288
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,060
*Growl*

289
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,400
*Growl*

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,600
Yes, this is the park.

291
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,960
Ryo-chan?

292
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,940
You saw the video, didn't you?

293
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,660
I have to stretch my arm to move around.

294
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,760
I have to stretch my arm to move around.

295
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,820
I have to stretch my arm to move around.

296
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,080
I have to stretch my arm to move around.

297
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,420
You idiot!

298
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,900
Do you think you can do that?

299
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,960
Go to the station and show your face.

300
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,080
I understand.

301
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,220
Bye.

302
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,480
Bye?

303
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,840
I showed my face.

304
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,260
You idiot!

305
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,580
I showed my face.

306
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,140
I showed my face.

307
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,180
But,

308
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,080
I installed the camera in the station.

309
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,660
I installed the camera in the station.

310
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,740
I can't do it at all.

311
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,380
I can't do it at all.

312
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,380
It's annoying.

313
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,160
I caught you now.

314
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,620
Bring your body to me.

315
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,800
No, I can't do it.

316
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,660
I can't do it.

317
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,000
I can't do it.

318
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,620
I said no.

319
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,260
Idiot!

320
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,280
Go away.

321
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,380
*Growl*

322
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,900
*Growl*

323
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,580
What is this?

324
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,660
This is...

325
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,020
What's wrong with me?

326
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,960
Senpai!

327
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,220
Isn't it dangerous to be so hot?

328
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,060
Huh?

329
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,640
Ryo-chan is working at home.

330
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,880
He's doing great with his rubber rubber ability,

331
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,600
so he's getting a lot of selfishness.

332
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,000
But I wonder if he can work at home.

333
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,000
What?

334
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,100
Honda!

335
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,300
You'll understand as soon as you say a bad word.

336
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,400
I'll understand!

337
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,080
Senpai, where are you?

338
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,740
Honda-san, over there.

339
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,640
Over there.

340
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,200
Huh?

341
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,300
You can watch the

342
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:13,340
It's really rubber rubber.

343
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,020
Senpai, you're using the wrong ability.

344
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,440
This isn't rubber rubber, it's a raggy Ryo-chan.

345
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,280
This isn't rubber rubber, it's a raggy Ryo-chan.

346
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,620
This isn't rubber rubber, it's a raggy Ryo-chan.

347
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,100
Good morning, everyone.

348
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,540
Good morning.

349
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,820
Ryo-chan hasn't come yet?

350
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,140
I told him to come today.

351
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,040
I think he'll be here soon.

352
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,900
Oh, look.

353
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,760
Oh?

354
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,620
That's rare.

355
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,100
He failed.

356
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,560
It happens a lot lately.

357
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,420
He's lost his documents,

358
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,540
and his hands can't reach them.

359
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,780
Oh, he'll be fine this time.

360
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,100
That's too bad.

361
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,200
What are you doing?

362
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,380
That idiot can't even help me.

363
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,220
All right, I'm going!

364
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,320
Get up!

365
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,140
Oh!

366
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,820
Good morning!

367
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,160
I'm exhausted.

368
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,680
What's wrong with your body?

369
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,480
Actually, I realized I had to keep moving,

370
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,860
so I couldn't really move now.

371
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,180
I started to get very used to it, so I stopped talking.

372
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,780
I was just kidding.

373
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,060
You're too lazy, you idiot!

374
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,760
You're not a rubber today, you're a fat one!

375
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,580
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

376
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,820
Hey, thief!

377
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,220
Thief!

378
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,440
Catch him!

379
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,540
- Let's go! - Yes!

380
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,680
Ah, what a pain.

381
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,200
I'll wait for you.

382
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,280
You're coming too!

383
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
Hey, no way!

384
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm not getting caught!

385
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,100
You're not getting caught.

386
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,640
Hurry up!

387
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,480
Run, run!

388
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,640
Help me, chief!

389
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,540
What are you doing?

390
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,320
I'm going to run away!

391
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,140
Damn it!

392
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,540
Could this be a rubber missile?

393
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,720
Is it heavy?

394
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,160
I'm going to arrest you!

395
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,820
It's not a missile.

396
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,520
It's a rubber ball-throwing.

397
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,720
What?

398
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,020
You're so lazy,

399
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,320
you're becoming like this.

400
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,480
Repent a little!

401
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,080
Hey!

402
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,440
But chief,

403
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,140
it's a convenient skill.

404
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,820
Shut up!

405
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,420
You're so loud.

406
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,200
Listen.

407
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,700
From today on, I won't forgive you for being lazy.

408
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,800
I'll make you work hard until you lose this money.

409
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,860
So get ready!

410
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,180
Shut up!

411
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,380
Yes, this is the exit before the park.

412
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,540
Hm?

413
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,740
Yes, I got it.

414
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,040
I'll be right there.

415
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,660
Chief, it seems that the car thief is running away.

416
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,860
The car is the red car.

417
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,400
I got it.

418
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,680
Everyone, get out!

419
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,480
Make sure to contact me by wireless.

420
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,860
Roger!

421
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,240
You go, too!

422
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,580
Yes!

423
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,360
Damn it, what's this fat ass?

424
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,480
I'll get angry again and get back at the chief.

425
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,560
Oh, that's the car thief's...

426
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,700
Let's get out of here!

427
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,740
Rubber ball-throwing!

428
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:03,180
You don't know how to do it, do you?

429
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,760
I'll show you the real deal!

430
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,060
F-fine.

431
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,100
All right.

432
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,560
the car thief is passing through this way.

433
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,060
I'm using the car bumper of the car.

434
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,140
If you follow my hand, you'll know.

435
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,160
I know!

436
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,680
What? I know!

437
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,160
Even if you die, don't let go of that hand!

438
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,620
I know!

439
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,680
I'm proud to have caught this guy!

440
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,020
Why are you going through a place like this?

441
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,940
Apparently the culprit passed through by one of the rails.

442
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,420
What a scoundrel.

443
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,060
Chief, what should I do?

444
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,140
Stay there for a while, but don't let go of your hand.

445
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,580
No way!

446
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,880
Hey, how far are you going to run away?

447
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,040
One more step and...

448
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,340
They were selling stolen cars overseas.

449
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,680
Overseas?

450
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,160
I'll tell you what happened.

451
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,300
I don't like this anymore.

452
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,380
I can't stay here until I catch the culprit.

453
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,840
I'm not kidding.

454
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,580
I'll let go of your hand.

455
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,720
I'll let go of your hand.

456
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,920
Huh?

457
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,480
I can't get my hands back.

458
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,880
Why?

459
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,680
What?

460
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,860
You're in Brazil?

461
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,360
The car theft group sold cars overseas.

462
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,580
I found out that they were going to Brazil when I looked up the destination of the cargo ship.

463
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,000
So... what about my hands?

464
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,940
You're under the Brazilian sky now.

465
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,620
No way.

466
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,860
What should I do?

467
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,320
By the way, are you a little thin?

468
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,360
Yeah.

469
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
I'm not even 20 years old.

470
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,280
Huh?

471
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,660
Chief!

472
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,640
I haven't eaten anything for a while.

473
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,560
I've lost my money and I'm being pulled.

474
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,180
Yeah?

475
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,660
If you go back now, I don't know where you'll go.

476
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,140
Nakagawa!

477
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,700
Chief!

478
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,960
Please don't let go of my hand!

479
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,540
Nakagawa!

480
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,120
The rope!

481
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,720
Bring me the rope!

482
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,380
Yes!

483
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:29,980
Chief!

484
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,880
Help me!

485
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,700
Nakagawa is coming soon.

486
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,200
You step on it too!

487
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,780
Yes!

488
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,520
Oh my goodness!

489
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,480
Chief!

490
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,560
Senpai!

491
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,320
Ryozu!

492
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,120
Don't get me in trouble!

493
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,500
You said you wouldn't let go of my hand, right?

494
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:51,920
Don't you agree, sir?

495
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,520
W-What?

496
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,200
Oh, you did it! You're under arrest!

497
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,160
You're the most experienced of the Settou-dan!

498
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,580
Ryozu, you did it!

499
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,620
Huh? Ryozu? Ryozu!

500
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,700
Hey, where are you, Ryozu?

501
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,060
Answer me, Ryozu!

502
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,320
I won't eat the mushrooms I picked up anymore, so someone help me!

503
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,520
Please help me!

504
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,000
Damn it, Ryu-senshi!

505
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,060
You really beat my Robodeca-bancho!

506
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,860
In this case, I'll replace the manga magazine, and I'll crush the Weekly Sapphire!

507
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,180
Huh? Who will I let write the manga?

508
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,000
I have a good idea!

509
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,360
Next time on Ryozu Ryu Manga School!

510
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,420
Thanks for watching!

511
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,600
Everyone, come to our town!

512
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,760
Thank you!
