A Gift from the Night Sky

18
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,840
The room temperature is 37 degrees.

19
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,660
Don't check it. It'll get hotter.

20
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,300
I'm home.

21
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,580
I bought ice cream.

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,040
Yay!

23
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,920
And then, I bought fireworks.

24
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,600
You too, Reiko?

25
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,560
What? You too, Kei?

26
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,440
Yes.

27
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,720
And then, I bought them directly from a friend's factory.

28
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,620
There's so much, it's 5,000 yen.

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,720
It's cheap, but what are you going to do with it?

30
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,240
It's obvious, Teraikun.

31
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,000
There's a fireworks show in the back park.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,280
She's got a lot of fireworks.

33
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,400
I know the stuff she's making.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,180
I know too, but they change colors.

35
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,820
There it is.

36
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,380
It's so nice to have had one.

37
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,000
Ich inevitably

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,980
I'm going to chase after her!

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,160
She's chasing me!

40
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm going to chase her!

41
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,260
I get catched!

42
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,640
Oh, it's Ryo's doing again.

43
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,820
What is this?

44
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,740
What's this, Nagagawa?

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,700
Don't you know the Rat Fire?

46
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,580
I was abroad when I was a kid.

47
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,280
You can't predict how it'll work, can you?

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,740
We used to play a lot when we were kids.

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,020
And if you call it a fire, it's this.

50
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,520
Cha-cha-cha!

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,980
It's the King of Fire, Fireworks!

52
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,480
What?

53
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,720
What a size!

54
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,060
It's no good, Ryo!

55
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,140
That's right, in a place like this...

56
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,380
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,000
The firework is what makes the sky so bright.

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,420
I made this for you.

59
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,940
It's the 200th time I've made it.

60
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,480
What?

61
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,680
Get out of the way!

62
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:43,420
It won't come up.

63
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,660
That's strange.

64
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,800
It's the plan of the great king.

65
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,080
Ohara-kun, it seems there's no one.

66
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,620
That's not right.

67
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,760
That's strange.

68
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,400
It'll be fine this time.

69
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,680
Ryo!

70
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,940
Huh?

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,840
Chief!

72
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,260
The president too!

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,680
Huh?

74
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,580
What are you doing in this place?

75
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,320
Well, that's...

76
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,740
You're hiding something.

77
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,980
No, it's nothing.

78
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,840
Liar!

79
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,660
No, it's true.

80
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,000
You're free to do whatever you want!

81
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,780
I don't care!

82
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,180
D-don't six!

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,740
W-Water, water!

84
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,220
Ugh... I'm saved...

85
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,580
What?

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,640
Ryotsu, are you ready?

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,560
S-sir!

88
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,980
I'll never forgive you for this!

89
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,060
You're fired!

90
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,640
I understand your anger, sir!

91
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,820
But isn't firing too heavy a burden?

92
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,680
If he's so bad-tempered...

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,480
If he's so bad-tempered, then it's all over!

94
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,320
Anyway, Ohara, it's your responsibility!

95
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,460
Huh?

96
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,680
You've been so spoiled all this time, so you can't do it!

97
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,420
Hey, do you want to go shopping for the holidays?

98
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,400
No, I can't!

99
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,160
Please, I'll take care of it somehow!

100
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,400
What?!

101
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,040
You're fired?!

102
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,800
That's right.

103
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,140
This month's salary will be cut by 50%!

104
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,420
50% is half, isn't it?!

105
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,060
That's not fair!

106
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,920
It's not even cheap!

107
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,680
If you cut 50% off, I can't live!

108
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,860
I don't care!

109
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,720
It's my own business!

110
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,040
Can I be your father's cute husband?

111
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,220
You're not cute!

112
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,100
You're just a nuisance!

113
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,780
If I die, I'll go to the chief's place every day!

114
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,040
You can live by eating weeds!

115
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,200
Chief's demon!

116
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,400
Yeah, I don't care if you're a demon or not!

117
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm tired of taking care of you!

118
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,780
...or something like that.

119
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,460
I think you'll have to pay for your own service.

120
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,120
You're right.

121
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,500
I won't care if you're a good man or not!

122
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,480
What?!

123
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,800
Ryo-chan, you're saying too much!

124
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,280
Yes, I am, Senpai!

125
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:28,900
Heh!

126
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,800
Anyway, I don't understand you, the men or women!

127
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,320
I'm not a man or a woman, but...

128
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,140
You, keep quiet!

129
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,800
I'll change my words!

130
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,620
I... I don't think so.

131
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,860
I don't think you're a chief, or a ohira!

132
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,760
I don't think you're a chief, or a ohira!

133
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,340
Enough! I don't think you're a subordinate!

134
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,640
Yes, yes! I'm at the exit in front of the park!

135
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,300
Yes, yes!

136
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,080
Um, Chief!

137
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,620
This is from my wife.

138
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,880
Ah, it's me.

139
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,200
I see! You were born!

140
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,000
So, where's Hiromi?

141
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,620
Tell me you're here.

142
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,520
Tell me you're here.

143
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,720
Chief, that was...

144
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,740
You have a granddaughter, huh?

145
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,580
Ah, she's a girl this time.

146
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,660
Wow! Congratulations!

147
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,180
So, you're a family now?

148
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,880
I was asked to think of a name for my daughter.

149
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,100
I thought about it a lot, but...

150
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,460
How about Sakura?

151
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,620
That's a good name!

152
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,060
Really?

153
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,360
I-I guess so.

154
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,660
That's strange!

155
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,120
The eldest son is Daisuke, right?

156
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,580
If the eldest is Daisuke, the youngest is Hanako, right?

157
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,380
Then, it's a manzai duo.

158
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,880
Otherwise, the eldest is Torajirou, right?

159
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,800
Isn't it Torasan?

160
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,620
You should change your last name to Hayashiya, Pei, and Paako.

161
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,880
Ryo-chan!

162
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,920
Well, well.

163
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,500
I don't have time to fight such an idiot.

164
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,100
Anyway, when Hiromi is discharged, I'll prepare a feast.

165
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,060
Come and see your grandchildren.

166
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,420
Huh? A feast?

167
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
It has nothing to do with you.

168
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,460
You're not my subordinate.

169
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,620
I know!

170
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,640
After all, they're all newborn babies.

171
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,780
They all look like monkeys.

172
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
It's not interesting at all.

173
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,760
Oh, right.

174
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,580
I'd like to see you next Sunday.

175
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,540
There's a fireworks festival in the neighborhood.

176
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,520
It looks good from the garden of my house.

177
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,860
That's nice.

178
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,440
I'm glad to see you.

179
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,880
I have to think of something for the celebration.

180
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,520
Don't worry about it.

181
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,500
I'll tell you I was asked to do it.

182
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,640
But half the salary is hard.

183
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,240
I have to do something about it.

184
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,440
But I don't have time to do it.

185
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,060
A part-time job?

186
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,800
Ryo-chan?

187
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:47,960
Right.

188
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,760
In this season, there are fireworks events all over the place.

189
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,000
So, it's time to start.

190
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,060
I want to work there, too.

191
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,360
Right?

192
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,360
I'm in trouble with my salary being reduced.

193
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,500
Right? Right?

194
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,200
Well, things that are too busy are too busy.

195
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,340
Anyway, it's a dangerous job.

196
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,320
Even if you call it a part-time job.

197
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,840
I'm experienced.

198
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,680
Have you ever made a fireworks?

199
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,400
There's no fireworks but I'm a veteran of explosions

200
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,000
You can't blow up

201
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,260
But explosions and fireworks are the same

202
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,320
It's not the same even if you use a gun

203
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,340
The fireworks are an art of the sky made by craftsmen

204
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,820
This is the handmade fireworks

205
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,000
Red, green and blue will change to three colors while the fireworks are burning

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,560
It looks like a fireball

207
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,500
It's like a fireball

208
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,860
Many stars in the fireworks will change colors and fly in all directions

209
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,540
But they won't be the same if you just fly

210
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,380
It won't look good if you fly in circles

211
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,400
So you have to line up like this

212
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,900
You have to calculate the colors and make the stars

213
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,600
I see, it's a craftsmanship

214
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,840
Right

215
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,040
That's why people with a rough personality won't like it

216
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,200
I'm a rare face

217
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,560
You can tell by my face

218
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,620
I have a license to handle dangerous objects

219
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,560
And I became a veteran because of the fireworks

220
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,580
Of course

221
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,900
If you help people while you're alive, you'll be fine

222
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,980
Don't kill me easily

223
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,280
I trained my son so I can give him a reward

224
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,940
I told you to stop

225
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,780
I can't help it

226
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,460
I did it, will you hire me?

227
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,640
Ryo, you got a lot better

228
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,020
You're right

229
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,040
I have an idea for a new fireworks

230
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,740
A new fireworks?

231
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,060
I'll give you an idea

232
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,040
It's a huge hit

233
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,740
The last firework

234
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,620
Like this, the last firework had to be lit with candles.

235
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,240
This is troublesome, and the candle light disappears in the wind.

236
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,640
This is what we improved and made it compatible with matches.

237
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,860
When you light a fire, it becomes a flash fire.

238
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,040
In a ski resort, you can turn this into a torch and do a night ski.

239
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,020
You can take this.

240
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,180
I failed a little earlier, but this time I'm fine.

241
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,760
This is a giant snake firework. It's called a "Taija firework."

242
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,840
This one is a big deal!

243
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,200
This time, it's fine. It's a "Message firework."

244
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,640
A "Message firework"?

245
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,080
A machine with a fluorescent diode is placed inside the firework.

246
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,940
You can send a message to the fluorescent diode.

247
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,240
When it explodes, it will open.

248
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,120
When the fireworks are lit, a message will appear in the night sky.

249
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,560
That's amazing! If that's true, it's a big hit!

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,640
By the way, this prototype is called "Banzai."

251
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,020
Let's give it a try!

252
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,620
There was a lot of firewood.

253
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,120
This is no good.

254
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:25,880
"Banzai"

255
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,860
"Banzai"

256
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,320
Thanks for the good service!

257
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,120
Miyasako, is this a picture of your grandchild?

258
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,500
Yes.

259
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,820
Isn't it cute? How many have you got?

260
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,260
I've got three this year.

261
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,120
It's almost my birthday.

262
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,880
I'm thinking of giving her a gift.

263
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,960
Is your grandchild really that cute?

264
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,420
You bet it is!

265
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,060
Just looking at the picture gives me the energy.

266
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,720
I don't even have a grandchild or a wife.

267
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,660
Actually, right after she was born, the company I founded had to go bankrupt.

268
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,820
I was already very happy, but when I saw my newborn grandchild's smile, I felt that I had to work hard.

269
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,900
So you came here.

270
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,360
Yes. I've been dating the president here since I was a kid.

271
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,680
After all, my grandchild is the source of my energy.

272
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,500
What do you think of Sakura?

273
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,360
Come to think of it, the president also had a very happy face.

274
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,560
What?

275
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:38,260
Hey, you two! It's the president's fault that I had to work here!

276
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,020
What's wrong with my grandchild?

277
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,300
To be continued

278
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,640
Hey, have you decided on something for Sakura's present?

279
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,780
That's quite difficult.

280
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,620
I think it's good to have something with the name Sakura.

281
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,740
Hey, Ryo. What are you planning to do?

282
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,660
Hey, Ryo.

283
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,800
Ah, shut up. I'm tired from working part-time.

284
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,020
I don't know anything about the president.

285
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,340
What?

286
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,140
What are you doing?

287
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:20,660
What?

288
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,200
You're working part-time?

289
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,080
Yes, it seems so.

290
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,540
Hey, you idiot.

291
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,920
Don't you have the will to do something about this?

292
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,320
Listen. Don't tell anyone about this.

293
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,320
If the president hears about this, I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

294
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:36,760
What?

295
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,720
Oh, no. It's nothing.

296
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,320
Anyway, I'm counting on you.

297
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes.

298
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,360
But I'm not used to seeing you like this.

299
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,720
You're not used to seeing me like this.

300
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,020
Oh, I see.

301
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,760
By the way, when my president's first grandchild was born, I took a picture of him from Nobe's closet and watched him.

302
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,180
Oh, you're the president's wife.

303
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,020
The president is not a normal person.

304
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,080
It's enough to call a boss who doesn't protect his subordinates.

305
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,460
I see. I don't think that's the case.

306
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,720
Huh?

307
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,220
I've told you before.

308
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,220
I was a small boy, too.

309
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,040
I was running the company myself.

310
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,360
I didn't know how to do work properly.

311
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,800
Since I'm an employee of your club, I don't know how to do it right.

312
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,820
I'm with you, but I'm also with you.

313
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,160
I understand your feeling of love.

314
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,720
Now that your government has said so, please don't cross yourself out.

315
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,740
Thanks for telling me the truth, but after Jae was killed,

316
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,720
I found out that he had nothing to do with the murder.

317
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,020
This is where Ryo's part-time job is.

318
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,340
It's a fireworks factory where the president was scolded.

319
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,300
Excuse me.

320
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,140
This is the man.

321
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,380
How is he? Is he working hard?

322
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,820
Are you talking about Ryo?

323
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,620
Yes. I'm not suspicious.

324
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,780
Are you the president?

325
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,660
Uh, well...

326
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,080
Ryo is always talking.

327
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,060
You're worried about your subordinates, aren't you?

328
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,240
Well, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

329
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,220
What's wrong?

330
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,480
I thought the wind was nice.

331
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,160
The wind...

332
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,740
The wind, huh?

333
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,040
Reiko!

334
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,800
Oh, Komachi and Naoko.

335
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,960
What are you doing here?

336
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,080
I'm picking a present.

337
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,480
It's the president's grandchild's birthday present.

338
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,960
Is the president Oohara's?

339
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,320
Yes. The second grandchild was born the other day.

340
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,580
Tomorrow, we're going to see each other's faces.

341
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,840
Oh, right.

342
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,040
Speaking of Oohara, the other day...

343
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,300
What? What happened to the president?

344
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,420
I saw him the other day.

345
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:11,960
What?

346
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,580
Actually...

347
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,160
Please. I'll take care of it.

348
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,980
I'll be punished just like Ryo.

349
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,180
So, please watch over me this time.

350
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,960
Did the president say that?

351
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,280
Yes. And both of them will have their pay cut by 50%.

352
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,140
What?

353
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
You think you're going to be a burden on your own?

354
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,700
You don't even think about your subordinates.

355
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,060
I don't even think about my subordinates.

356
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,140
I don't even think about my subordinates.

357
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,480
I have to go see Ryo-chan.

358
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,120
Reiko!

359
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,940
Komachi, what are you going to do?

360
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,460
We don't have any time to be together.

361
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,840
Before that, I want a lover.

362
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,860
What? The president?

363
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,920
Yes. Komachi and the others saw it.

364
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,860
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

365
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,940
Is the president still thinking only about himself?

366
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,800
Yes.

367
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,600
Yes.

368
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,220
Tomorrow, come to Sakura-chan's birthday party and apologize to the president.

369
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,340
Is that okay?

370
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,440
That's right, Ryo-san.

371
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,420
I was worried about you earlier and came to look into it in secret.

372
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,000
What?

373
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,600
The president?

374
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,880
That's just right.

375
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,040
My grandchild will go in and make up with you.

376
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,600
That's right, Ryo-chan.

377
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,940
Please come. Absolutely.

378
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,920
So, did the senior come?

379
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,990
I don't know exactly.

380
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,380
I told him to come.

381
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,900
Ryo-san is stubborn.

382
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,400
I'm sorry.

383
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,140
I'm sorry.

384
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,100
I'm sorry.

385
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,100
I'm sorry.

386
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,380
I'm sorry.

387
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,360
I'm sorry.

388
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:58,540
I'm sorry.

389
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,400
I'm sorry.

390
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,280
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,280
I'm sorry.

394
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,840
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm sorry.

396
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,700
Thanks to you.

397
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,100
Thank you.

398
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,040
Thank you.

399
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,000
Thank you.

400
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,040
Thank you very much.

401
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,160
Thank you very much.

402
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,340
Thank you very much.

403
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,620
Really, they have come so close.

404
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:26,960
You look like me.

405
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,740
Really?

406
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,680
Your dad says you look like yourself.

407
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,600
We look alike, don't we?

408
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,100
Like the spot where the eyes are open.

409
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,160
Come to think of it, I wonder if that's true.

410
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,660
This is a wedding dress for you.

411
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,040
Mine is a set of clothes that can be learned from a zero-year-old who is kind to the environment.

412
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,640
Mine is a set of paper blankets.

413
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,200
I'm sorry, you have to be careful.

414
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,720
Thank you, thank you.

415
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,880
I'll be able to prepare for dinner soon, so don't hesitate and relax.

416
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,580
Yes.

417
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,520
Ryo-san, I wonder if he's coming.

418
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,020
I think so.

419
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,440
He just said that.

420
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:07,920
Done!

421
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,580
Thank you, Miyasaka-san.

422
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,680
It's all thanks to you.

423
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,180
Even though you're the head chef's grandson, I can't keep quiet when I hear that you're doing this for your grandson.

424
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,080
I'm counting on you for that, too.

425
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,380
Thank you for the meal.

426
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,380
You're welcome.

427
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,180
I'm full.

428
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,400
I feel like I've eaten for Ryo-san.

429
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,120
The fireworks show is about to start.

430
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,220
You can see it clearly from this garden.

431
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,100
It's up.

432
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,120
It's beautiful.

433
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,320
It really is.

434
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,160
It's a special seat.

435
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,000
Ryo-chan, what's wrong?

436
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Ryo-tsu?

437
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,700
Forget about him.

438
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,800
Let's enjoy the fireworks.

439
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,520
Okay.

440
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,120
I hate them so much.

441
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,960
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:00,560
Please...

443
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,020
"Let only the pretty one know."

444
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,940
Hey, you can talk, Ryo-san.

445
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,000
Ryo-san, the fireworks show is about to start.

446
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,920
No way.

447
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,620
Please hurry.

448
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,880
Let me tell you.

449
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,880
Do they really have to do that?

450
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,540
Isn't that true?

451
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,240
They're trying to drag us down here.

452
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,660
The fireworks!

453
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,940
Ryo-san!

454
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,160
It's so dark.

455
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,860
What's the big deal?

456
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,040
It's okay.

457
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,280
Ouch!

458
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,640
Ouch!

459
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:31,840
Ouch!

460
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:31,980
Ouch!

461
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,240
Ouch!

462
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,440
Where's the fire?

463
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,400
Wait!

464
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,280
Wait for me!

465
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,240
Someone please catch that fire!

466
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,880
Ouch!

467
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,660
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

468
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,680
I think it's still burning!

469
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,440
Ouch!

470
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,580
Ouch!

471
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,700
Ouch!

472
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,100
Ryo!

473
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,020
What happened?

474
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,280
Ryo!

475
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,220
Ryo!

476
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,620
Senpai!

477
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,280
Ryo!

478
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,300
Ryo!

479
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,340
You little...

480
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,540
You're doing something stupid again!

481
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,520
Right?

482
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,200
No, Chief.

483
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,580
There's a deep reason behind this...

484
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,100
I'm going to get sick of this!

485
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,640
I don't even know what's going on!

486
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,200
I told you there's a reason!

487
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,500
It's about you anyway.

488
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,520
It's a stupid reason!

489
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,520
Dad, look!

490
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,240
That fire!

491
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,860
This is...

492
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,300
Amazing!

493
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,720
What?

494
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,500
What?

495
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:54,980
This is...

496
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,340
Great!

497
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,560
I-I did it, Ryo!

498
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,660
I did it!

499
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,140
No one can ever imagine

500
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,300
a birthday celebration like this!

501
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,200
That's Ryo!

502
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,220
Ryo!

503
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,000
Thank you!

504
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,960
Dad!

505
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,020
Meow!

506
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,220
It's not much of a gift,

507
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,440
The fortune-telling is a gift that remains in my heart.

508
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,280
Ryotsu.

509
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,400
Chief.

510
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,700
Let's drink, Ryotsu.

511
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,260
Yes.

512
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,120
Hey, are there any more feast left?

513
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,260
Yes, there are still many.

514
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,260
Chief, is that okay?

515
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,560
This month is a lot of work for the chief's house.

516
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,980
It's all your fault.

517
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,760
In the season that's changing so slowly,

518
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,260
I've become better at making laughter.

519
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,400
How will I be reflected in your eyes

520
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,140
when you're looking away and changing?

521
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,460
After a fight, I always give you a short kiss.

522
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,360
You were so dear to me, with tears in your eyes.

523
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,540
How much can a person get

524
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,420
from such irreplaceable things in life?

525
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,440
How much can a person get from such irreplaceable things in life?

526
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,520
How much can a person get from such irreplaceable things in life?

527
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,200
You are me,

528
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,020
and I am you.

529
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,640
That alone is enough to make me full.

530
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,900
Just by laughing,

531
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,920
I feel like any pain was healed.

532
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,760
I feel like any pain was healed.

533
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,840
I feel like any pain was healed.

534
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,660
And to the pain I reaped,

535
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:24,680
I can't hide the pain anymore.

536
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,120
If you act as you have to act,

537
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,320
then you'll come back to be happy,

538
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,760
and I will be the one to come back back to you.

539
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,740
Please leave it to us
