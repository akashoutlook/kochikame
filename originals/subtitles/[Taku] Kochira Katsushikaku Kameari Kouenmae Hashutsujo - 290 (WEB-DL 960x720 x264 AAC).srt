1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
The End

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,560
Eh? Ryo-san is on the radio?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,560
Yeah. The director asked me to do it.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,320
He said I should be on a local radio show.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,260
So Ryo-san said "OK" to it?

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,840
Yeah. He said I could talk to him as much as I want since I'm an amateur.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,880
He said I could get a good appearance and even get a good price.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,080
What a good story!

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,980
But the director didn't say anything.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,780
If he finds out, it'll be bad.

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,340
Don't worry. He won't find out.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,300
The show starts at 10:00 tonight.

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,940
Listen carefully.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,420
When you watch TV, make the room bright and look away.

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,700
Then you'll dream of a nice time like a dream.

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,360
Make the time to look - Look

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:21,620
at the blue sky, look at the white clouds. I

18
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,060
'm sure they'll come eventually. Make

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,740
I know it!

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,680
I know, I know!

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,260
If you do, then just hide and follow me!

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,340
This is Kameyari Broadcasting Station.

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,340
Wow!

24
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,520
Meow!

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,980
Hey there! It's 10 o'clock in the night.

26
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,020
"Wai Wai Paradise" starts tonight!

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,380
Today, I invited a special guest of Katsushika's specialty, Mr. Omawari.

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,660
Introducing, Mr. Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,900
*bark*

30
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,320
*bark*

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,660
*bark*

32
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,360
*bark*

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,280
*bark*

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,820
Sorry, sorry!

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,940
I ate eight dumplings and lebanese for dinner.

36
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,220
*bark*

37
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,520
*bark*

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,440
Yes! I'm Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

39
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,480
Call me "Ryo-san"!

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,840
Y-Yes...

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,040
B-By the way, I heard that you work at the station before Kameari Park.

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,040
Yeah, that area is like my garden.

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,820
From the maniac plastic shop to the popular pachinko shop, I know everything.

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,160
Pa-pachinko shop?

45
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,260
Yeah, it's called "Pachinko Plaza Kamedasu".

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,480
It's a really good shop.

47
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,780
The nails are sweet, and the wheels spin.

48
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,500
The furniture is all organized, and there are lots of unbreakable stalls.

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,320
I line up at 3 a.m. every morning.

50
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,860
Every morning!?

51
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,560
Ah, no.

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,100
Now it's just here.

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,500
If I get in trouble, I'll get scolded again.

54
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,540
B-But this is a live broadcast.

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,220
No, I'm not!

56
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,520
Hey! Just a little while ago! Cut! Cut!

57
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,760
No, it's a live broadcast, so I'll edit.

58
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,680
You're talking as if you like me.

59
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,760
I told you just a minute ago... I told you just a minute ago... I told you just a minute ago... I told you just a minute ago... I told you just a minute ago...

60
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:18,840
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:19,660
Yes.

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,880
It's the "Telephone Life Consultation" corner!

63
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,240
Ryo-san, I'm looking forward to your advice.

64
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,680
Leave it to me.

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:29,980
Ask me anything.

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,320
This is very reliable.

67
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,560
Well then, let's start with the first person.

68
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,460
Let's call him Mr. A.

69
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,160
Mr. A?

70
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,940
Yes.

71
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,660
What would you like to talk about?

72
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,740
Ah, yes.

73
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,500
Uh, well...

74
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,260
Don't be shy.

75
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,240
I'm actually...

76
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,640
Are you nervous?

77
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,620
Relax, relax.

78
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,840
Ah, yes.

79
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,560
Um, well...

80
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,340
What's wrong?

81
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,300
Please give me some advice.

82
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,980
I understand.

83
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,620
Um...

84
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,900
What should I say?

85
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,900
Um...

86
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,240
What should I say?

87
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,640
Um...

88
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:06,800
What should I say?

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,180
You idiot!

90
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,120
I'm here for advice!

91
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,380
I'm not here to talk about that nonsense!

92
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,280
If you're a man, just say it!

93
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,240
You idiot!

94
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,360
Uh, yes.

95
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,920
All right, I'll listen to it.

96
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,680
Go on now.

97
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,440
Actually, um, um...

98
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,980
I have someone I love, so...

99
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,180
And?

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,380
Someone I love...

101
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,120
And so, um...

102
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,840
I'm wondering what I should do.

103
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,400
Do you talk about that anything?

104
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,320
That...

105
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,220
It's something that's important to me,

106
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,380
and if I say it...

107
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,300
You idiot!!

108
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,920
No need to worry over that.

109
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,380
If you have time to call here,

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,380
just tell me about it.

111
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,980
Confess, now!

112
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,920
Confess?

113
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,820
Yes, if you like him, you like him.

114
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,940
You can't be too sure of your partner.

115
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,800
But...

116
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,660
It's hard to say if you like him or not, A-san.

117
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,880
Yes...

118
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,260
Then, send him a love letter, or send him an e-mail.

119
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,460
No! That's not it!

120
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,740
I won't allow you to do that!

121
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
If you get lost, hit him!

122
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,640
Got it?

123
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes...

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,700
Okay, next!

125
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,140
But, if it doesn't work...

126
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,640
I don't care!

127
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,860
That's it!

128
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,760
Next!

129
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,760
Let's go to the next person.

130
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,420
Hello?

131
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,860
What's your problem?

132
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,980
Well, my boyfriend is really cold these days.

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,320
He doesn't call me at all.

134
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,620
He's always busy, and he doesn't go on dates.

135
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,400
You're cheating, huh?

136
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,100
That's it!

137
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,860
Hey, wait!

138
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,480
Don't decide that on your own!

139
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,640
Confession is the most important thing!

140
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,680
Okay...

141
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,660
I can't do this anymore!

142
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,620
What's wrong?

143
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,340
My company is being taken over, my god is running away, my wallet is being stolen, my car is being stolen...

144
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,400
What should I do now?

145
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,700
I don't know either.

146
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,500
See you later.

147
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,540
Wait, wait!

148
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,600
That's not the answer, is it?

149
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,780
But, I don't know what's going on with you.

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,460
No, no!

151
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,180
I'm irresponsible!

152
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,340
What?

153
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,000
Why do you have to be responsible for something that I've never done?

154
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,500
Don't say that!

155
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,820
You can't do anything about your own life!

156
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,680
That's why you're being taken over and run away from God!

157
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,680
Do you understand?

158
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,020
Um, thank you for your simple advice.

159
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,100
Shall we go to the next one?

160
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,600
Do it.

161
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,960
Ah!

162
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,020
Now, it's time for Radio Shopping!

163
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,660
Hi!

164
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,660
Hello, hello!

165
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,680
Listen and understand!

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,260
Buy and understand!

167
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,320
This is the time for Japanese Takeda's Radio Shopping!

168
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,860
I've been waiting for you!

169
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,060
Thank you for your good reaction.

170
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,960
Today's product is this!

171
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,520
The highest quality beef fat bag, 4 points set!

172
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:50,740
Oh!

173
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,400
What a wonderful bag!

174
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
This product is an original product only for Japanese Takeda.

175
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,220
Is that so?

176
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,780
But, if it's a product like this, the price is...

177
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,800
But, this time, this product is...

178
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,060
It's sold for 30,000 yen!

179
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,180
Oh!

180
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,740
This is 30,000 yen!

181
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,560
Yes!

182
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,220
Well, it's 5,000 yen.

183
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,020
Ugh!

184
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,680
I'm telling you it's the highest quality, but no matter how you look at it, it's cheap!

185
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,160
Oh!

186
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,540
What are you saying, you!

187
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,460
This is the most luxurious beef fat!

188
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,040
Huh!

189
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,440
Is it really beef fat?

190
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,100
Is it a rat's skin or something?

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,080
What are you saying?

192
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,460
You don't even have a chance to see the product, so don't say anything.

193
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,600
What?

194
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,660
Are you trying to sell something good?

195
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,360
What kind of attitude is that?

196
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,120
What's wrong?

197
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,820
I'm going to give this to everyone now!

198
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,360
This is for everyone who calls the theater now.

199
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,060
I will give you this bag.

200
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,660
Come on, bring it on!

201
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,140
No way!

202
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,860
It's the best beef fat I've ever seen.

203
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,820
Yes, yes.

204
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,120
The phone inside the theater is in full swing.

205
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,260
That's right.

206
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,400
What's going on?

207
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,780
I can't wait anymore!

208
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm going to chase him out!

209
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,600
What?

210
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,620
Well, the listeners' opinions are that it's funny so do more is overwhelming.

211
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,380
It's been a great response since the show started, such as "it's fun and irresponsible" or "I like crazy stuff" or "tomorrow too".

212
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,940
Awesome! Awesome!

213
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:25,660
And this time, at the place of Sugi Heisuke, the chief of the red light, Takashi Beed came to greet us, and the members of the red light noticed that our chief is a great person.

214
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,040
So they said, "What's up?"

215
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,120
What? Regular appearance?

216
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,880
Yeah, I heard that you really liked yesterday's show. I'm starting as the main personality from tonight.

217
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:38,800
Huh?

218
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,180
No matter what happens to my broadcast, it's attractive enough to be broadcast live.

219
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,840
That's true.

220
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,760
So I'll leave everything to me from this program to the composition.

221
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,960
What? That's amazing!

222
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,640
Everyone who's listening to the radio is watching.

223
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,880
I'll make it an overwhelming show.

224
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,220
Don't forget to listen to it.

225
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,220
It's around 5 o'clock today.

226
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,260
No, I'll wait.

227
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,120
Nakagawa, are you listening?

228
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,300
What?

229
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,680
Ouch!

230
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,240
Ouch!

231
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,680
Why is my senior's voice...

232
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,180
This program started from today.

233
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,080
What?

234
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,620
Ryo-san's "2 to 3 hours tonight".

235
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,960
I'm the personality, Ryo Tsukankichi.

236
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,620
I'm the main personality, Ryo Tsukankichi.

237
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,060
Nice to meet you.

238
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,260
Is he your senior?

239
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,880
By the way, Nakagawa is my subordinate.

240
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,100
By the way, he has a big money with the ability to come up with three or four

241
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,300
bells.

242
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,980
He's a rich man.

243
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,360
He's probably driving around Roppongi in his Ferrari.

244
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,700
He'll pay you for everything.

245
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,680
Call him if you see him.

246
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,720
The number is Mr. Shinagawa's.

247
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,400
Wait!

248
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,700
What?

249
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,520
What's going on?

250
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,720
What's going on?

251
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,420
What's going on?

252
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:56,960
What's going on?

253
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,760
What's going on?

254
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,220
Wait!

255
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,660
I had a very embarrassing experience.

256
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,680
So he's your senior?

257
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,840
He's been aggressive for four or eight years.

258
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,080
I didn't expect him to be a radio personality.

259
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,520
That's all right.

260
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,960
I've had a very embarrassing experience.

261
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,840
My colleague has a woman.

262
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,840
But I've been embarrassed.

263
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,980
So no one is the right one.

264
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,200
Anyway, he's a man like me.

265
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,860
I'm calm now.

266
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,520
But before, he always talked with girls.

267
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,660
He hung out with girls at night.

268
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,000
But he has high goals.

269
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,800
He said he would marry a woman like Kyo Koyama and Miho Nakayama.

270
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,680
He said.

271
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,080
I'm not saying that I'm going to get married.

272
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,500
It's a story that everyone understands.

273
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,540
Are you listening, Honda?

274
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,780
Ryo is really talking.

275
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,640
It's still a mess.

276
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,620
He's making fun of us.

277
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,980
Next fax.

278
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,400
Pink penguin female high school student.

279
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,220
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ryo.

280
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:06,600
I have a question.

281
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,440
What should I do to make my chest bigger?

282
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,600
I don't think men know this.

283
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,100
There's a woman named Reiko Akimoto at the Kameari Park.

284
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,780
Ask her.

285
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,880
That's all.

286
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,700
Next fax.

287
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,560
Don't give me his name.

288
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,360
Come on.

289
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,960
Reiko?

290
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,180
That's amazing.

291
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,940
Ryo, you idiot.

292
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,720
Next fax.

293
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,280
You're right.

294
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,520
I don't know.

295
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,840
I don't know.

296
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,080
Ryo.

297
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,160
I'm sorry.

298
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,180
I understand.

299
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,940
I'm counting on you.

300
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,880
The five of you, please.

301
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,740
Okay, next message.

302
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,140
"My name is Yamadome Tatsuhiko.

303
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,660
The police seems to have a strict relationship with me.

304
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,160
Do you have a bad boss?"

305
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,920
Yes, I do.

306
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,820
"I can't use my computer or my cell phone,

307
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,320
but I'm always angry.

308
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,540
I've been in the metal industry for 40 years.

309
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,720
I still haven't been able to get a good job.

310
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,700
I'm a pitiful boss who just got promoted in the year-end school.

311
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,560
But I'm talking about you, Chief Ohara."

312
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,520
Well, there are no bad bosses like that anywhere.

313
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,840
"By the way, Chief Ohara is like a big city when he gets angry.

314
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,000
He's a little bit arrogant and a little bit mischievous.

315
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,320
So if you see him in the city,

316
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,120
please smile and smile at him."

317
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,880
Damn it, Ryotsu!

318
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,100
I'm the one who wants to say it with public radio.

319
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,620
I will never forgive you!

320
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,280
Driver, change the destination.

321
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,200
Immediately!

322
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,100
Please go to this radio station.

323
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,300
Yes, sir!

324
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,380
Both of them are not bad.

325
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,560
It's like a manga.

326
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,420
Then, commercial.

327
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,460
What's the next corner?

328
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,460
What was it, Fujiyama-chan?

329
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,200
Hey, Ryotsu!

330
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,920
Ryotsu!

331
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,640
Senpai!

332
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,560
It's you!

333
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,120
You!

334
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,420
You're a bad guy!

335
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,180
You're terrible, senpai!

336
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,180
What are you doing?

337
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,940
What are you going to say?

338
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,660
Huh?

339
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,260
Maybe everyone's listening to the radio.

340
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,180
Why are you all...

341
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,560
Oh, I see.

342
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,500
They're trying to make fun of everyone.

343
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,280
What are you doing?

344
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,360
Let's get rid of them right away.

345
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,620
As expected of Mr. Wario.

346
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,820
I didn't expect you to prepare such a performance.

347
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,460
A performance?

348
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,340
Oh!

349
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,120
Mr. Ryo made a joke of his colleague on purpose.

350
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,000
He got angry and came into the studio.

351
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,540
It's amazing that he came with such a hand.

352
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,520
This is going to be a great show.

353
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,320
Who do you usually refuse and go on the radio?

354
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,080
Do you think it's okay for me, your boss, to do this without permission?

355
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,000
But, Mr. Ryo.

356
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,440
Listeners are looking for personalities like me.

357
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,540
Shut up!

358
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This program is a sudden stop.

359
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,600
No way!

360
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,440
It's not possible to continue a program that makes people talk without refusing.

361
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,660
That's right, senpai!

362
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,880
Please reflect on yourself.

363
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,600
Let's go home, Ryo.

364
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,120
Huh?

365
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,180
No way!

366
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,080
I can't throw out the program on the way during the live broadcast.

367
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,580
I can't do such irresponsible things.

368
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,400
I've been through so much trouble at times like this.

369
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,980
If this happens, I'll bring it back with me.

370
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,860
Come on!

371
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,680
I don't want to!

372
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,680
Hey!

373
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,880
I don't want to!

374
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,520
I don't want to!

375
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,580
I don't want to!

376
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,660
I don't want to!

377
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,960
Ryo is a jerk!

378
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,420
I don't want to!

379
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:01,600
Huh?

380
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,540
Ryo is a jerk!

381
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,080
You better not...

382
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,040
You better not...

383
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,420
D-Dynamite!?

384
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,380
I said Ryo is a jerk!

385
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,560
Is it you?

386
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,600
So disgusting!

387
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,540
What do you want?

388
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,560
Don't you remember me?

389
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,440
What?

390
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,460
I talked to you in the live broadcast yesterday.

391
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,100
I talked to you first.

392
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,460
Well...

393
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,340
I was telling you I was a good guy!

394
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,100
Was there such a guy?

395
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,420
There was someone I liked, but I asked him what to do!

396
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,680
Hmm?

397
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,600
Ah, I think there was someone like that.

398
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,940
I confessed to him as you said.

399
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,980
Then, then...

400
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,720
Then, then...

401
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
It seems that he was dumped.

402
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,320
He was taken by his senior's irresponsible advice.

403
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,540
Poor thing...

404
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,920
Ryo-tsu! You are not only us, but also a nuisance to the general public!

405
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,540
No way!

406
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,660
It's not good to blame me for being dumped!

407
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,560
It's not good to blame me for being dumped!

408
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,760
Shut up!

409
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,180
You played with my order!

410
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,140
If this happens, I'll blow them all away!

411
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,080
Hey!

412
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,500
Wait! Calm down!

413
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,400
Let's talk calmly!

414
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,240
There's nothing to talk about! I can't do it either!

415
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,360
I have dreams and hopes.

416
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,280
I've lost everything.

417
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,840
Ryo-tsu! It's all because of your heartless words!

418
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,880
I told you not to listen to what I say!

419
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,280
Shut up!

420
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,960
Yes, yes.

421
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,040
It's amazing!

422
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,940
The phone and fax are all punk!

423
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,580
The question "Is the bomb real?" is coming like a mountain!

424
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,240
It's definitely fake!

425
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,760
It's a fake!

426
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,660
It's amazing, Ryo-san!

427
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,700
You can't even do this!

428
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,440
But I have a friend I can talk to!

429
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,940
Hello?

430
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,640
I have a friend I can talk to!

431
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:01,820
President!

432
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,020
What's that radio you're on right now?

433
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,360
It's not just Ryo-tsu!

434
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,380
It's a bomb!

435
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,600
I'm in touch with the book!

436
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,420
Is that real?

437
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,900
What's wrong with you?

438
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,160
I don't like it, President!

439
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:13,740
It's definitely fake!

440
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,180
It's Ryo-san's performance!

441
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,600
Performance?

442
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,580
Yes!

443
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,840
I told you that I'd make a great show that everyone will be surprised!

444
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,680
So please don't worry!

445
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,160
I'm in touch with the commercial!

446
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,520
Ryo-san, close the door!

447
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,380
Huh?

448
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,140
Then I'll be doing the commercial here!

449
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,300
Ryo-tsu Kakuchi's "2 to 3 hours tonight!"

450
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,680
Did you hear that?

451
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,980
If it's a real bomb, there's no way we're going to do a commercial!

452
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,900
That's true, but...

453
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,040
But I'm jealous of everyone.

454
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,920
I wanted to be on the radio, too.

455
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,060
You guys, don't sleep!

456
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,680
Ryo-san's "2 to 3 hours tonight!"

457
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,080
We're on the way to the program, but I'll tell you the news here.

458
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,700
Around 6:30 this afternoon, dynamite was stolen from a construction site in Katsushika.

459
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,620
According to the witness, the culprit is a man in his 20s and is currently searching for his whereabouts.

460
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,280
I repeat, around 6:30 this afternoon, dynamite was stolen from a construction site in Katsushika.

461
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,240
Is this Ryo-san's performance, too?

462
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,720
No!

463
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,760
Then, over there is...

464
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,200
A real bomb killer?

465
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,560
Yes, Mr. Katsushika.

466
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,120
There's a bomb killer in the radio station?

467
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,600
That's all a play.

468
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,720
There's no way there's such a messy story.

469
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,880
But, Genny, right now...

470
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,460
Don't worry. Ryo-tsu is doing it anyway, so it's a lie.

471
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,420
Yes, yes.

472
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,480
Ryo-tsu, Katsushika.

473
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,540
I can't believe you.

474
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,520
What should we do?

475
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,500
Wait a minute.

476
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,640
There's a real bomb killer and the police!

477
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,600
A real bomb killer and the police!

478
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,300
What should we do?

479
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,960
There's no way they can do something like this!

480
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,060
What should we do?

481
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,460
We'll continue broadcasting!

482
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,540
What?

483
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,200
This is going to be a great show!

484
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,940
Listen to me for now!

485
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,020
Shut up!

486
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,800
Your story is useless!

487
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,880
But, you know, you can't be a loser just because you were dumped once.

488
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,460
That's right. I've been dumped over and over again.

489
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,680
If you live, you'll find someone wonderful someday.

490
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,040
Someday?

491
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,720
Today?

492
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,380
Or later?

493
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,220
When?

494
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,220
Well, that's...

495
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,980
That's right!

496
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,600
That's just right!

497
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
Reiko, you go out with him.

498
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,840
What are you doing, Ryo-tsu?

499
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,380
This is also a story of some kind.

500
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,160
Reiko, if you fall in love with him, this case will be solved at any time.

501
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,760
Don't say anything.

502
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,160
Don't do anything.

503
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,660
You can decide at this time.

504
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,760
What is this time?

505
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,420
Don't make a joke at this time.

506
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,820
Shut up!

507
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:47,700
Hey!

508
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:47,880
What?

509
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,620
You keep talking nonsense.

510
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,560
How can you understand how I feel?

511
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,280
Stop!

512
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,260
You can understand it if you talk to me.

513
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,860
You say it again.

514
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,740
It's all your fault that I became like this.

515
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,760
If you let me say it, you'll get in trouble.

516
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
Don't blame others for everything.

517
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,640
If you didn't talk about such a stupid thing, this wouldn't have happened.

518
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,120
Stupid?

519
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,700
Stupid?

520
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,000
Ryo-tsu is terrible.

521
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,800
He is talking seriously with people who are listening.

522
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,200
That's right.

523
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,140
You are too insincere.

524
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,320
Radio has to speak with responsibility for every word.

525
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,360
But you are...

526
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,520
I'm going to be on his side, too.

527
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,720
I won't forgive you.

528
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,300
I can't let you live like you.

529
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,500
It's all your fault.

530
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,440
That's right, Ryo-tsu.

531
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,500
Everyone is right.

532
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,260
It's all your fault.

533
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,580
Chief!

534
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,400
You're unresponsive.

535
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,960
You go on the radio, don't think.

536
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,560
You talk back, you bother others.

537
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,960
This is the result you've been connected with.

538
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,280
But you say you're bad at everybody's business?

539
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,620
You can't be a fool and you'll get a good assignment.

540
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,540
Sorry, chief.

541
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,620
Well.

542
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,760
You're very responsible.

543
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,420
I'll let you have your decision.

544
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,960
You're not able to decide.

545
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,200
Do you think women will be

546
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,040
a man you can't decide for yourself?

547
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,820
Okay, now! Play the music!

548
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:19,640
Yes!

549
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,840
Don't blame others for your mistakes!

550
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,920
Even if there are other causes, you're the one who made the final decision!

551
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,400
You're not always being spoiled because you're old!

552
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,200
Life isn't all good.

553
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,680
There are many painful and painful things too.

554
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,840
So what if you get jealous of other people and get old?

555
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,180
Even in the most painful times, you must endure it and do something about it!

556
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,820
That's what being an adult is!

557
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm sorry.

558
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,920
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

559
00:21:59,480 --> 00:21:59,920
I'm sorry.

560
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,420
I'm sorry.

561
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,980
Damn it. I'm sorry.

562
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,180
As long as you understand.

563
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,340
Life is long.

564
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,620
You still have a long way to go.

565
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,560
What?

566
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,600
One, two, three...

567
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,200
You've been a great leader.

568
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,160
It's well done.

569
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,880
I'm glad you didn't have to take it seriously.

570
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,520
Really really.

571
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,080
All I thought about was what would happen one day.

572
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,420
You brought everything to a leader.

573
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,360
Yes!

574
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,280
What a good story!

575
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,640
Ryo-san's play is as good as expected!

576
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,980
Let's go.

577
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,800
Yes.

578
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,680
I sent it by document touch.

579
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,240
But the chief's line was a little smelly.

580
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,180
The music was a little smelly, Fujiyama-chan.

581
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,520
Ryotsu, what are you doing?

582
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,240
What? The continuation of the program.

583
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,560
Katsu, are you still coming? This big idiot.

584
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,200
See, I'm going home.

585
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:02,780
No.

586
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,780
Come on.

587
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:04,940
No.

588
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,880
You.

589
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,060
I'm not going.

590
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,720
I said the broadcast is canceled.

591
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,340
I'll continue.

592
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,020
I said I won't forgive you.

593
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,580
It's on air.

594
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,680
I'm on the radio.

595
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,100
Yes.

596
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,080
The power that even Ryotsu can't understand.

597
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,600
That warmth that made the bomb victims cry.

598
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,780
Please appear in our new program.

599
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,760
The title of the program is "You win over the chief Ohara".

600
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,580
This is decided.

601
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,880
No, I don't want to.

602
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,260
I'm begging you.

603
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,240
The era needs a personality like Ohara-san.

604
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,460
Please.

605
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,400
But...

606
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:43,940
There.

607
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,720
Please somehow.

608
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,500
After all, my program is canceled once.

609
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,440
It can't be helped.

610
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,720
I caused such a problem.

611
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,220
It's up to you.

612
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,420
But the chief's persuasion was really powerful.

613
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,520
Please appear.

614
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,820
It's over.

615
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

616
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,720
Oh, no.

617
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
Please appear.

618
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,260
Yes, dear.

619
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,420
Ah...

620
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:13,640
Oh...

621
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,540
Oh...

622
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,420
To be a different person,

623
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,080
I need to know.

624
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,120
I'm a sap.

625
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:20,920
I went buy a ball...

626
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,320
No.

627
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,500
I don't believe it.

628
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,320
My speech wasалы.

629
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:35,420
I think if I had become a boy I would have become a man.

630
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,460
To be the father of the most important baby.

631
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,320
Why?

632
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,300
Why does it happen only once every four years?

633
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,820
Why?

634
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,060
Nakagawa-san doesn't lend money to Ryo-san

635
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,600
But he can easily borrow a tank or a fighter

636
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,000
Why?

637
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,820
Why?

638
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,220
Rei-ko-san is very rich

639
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,680
But he works at the gas station

640
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,080
Why?

641
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,180
Why?

642
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,500
Why?

643
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,360
Why?

644
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,160
Over

645
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,180
I used up the money I collected from the first trip

646
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:37,240
I'll be in trouble if I don't take everyone to the trip

647
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,460
Who thought of the octopus in Atami?

648
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,880
Next time, "Atami Octopus Trip"

649
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,080
Don't forget it!

650
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,760
Come to our town!

651
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,860
Thank you!
