Willing To

00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,260
When you watch the TV,

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,540
make your room bright and beiutiful

00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,600
Sleepy

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,940
When you have no money,

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,860
come with me

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,240
I'm also not,

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,620
so worry about me

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:35,920
Look at the blue sky, the white clouds

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,040
It will be fine in a while

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,900
You know, right? You know, you know

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,180
If you know, then keep quiet and follow me

Translated by Vortex

15
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,000
I can't sleep at all. Who is it?

16
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,700
What is this?

17
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,420
Who wrote this?

18
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,120
It's not written by anyone. It's my own luggage.

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,500
Camera?

20
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:58,940
Huh?

21
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,160
What is it?

22
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,720
This camera is a cursed camera.

23
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,960
If you don't take 100 photos of the police officer's swimsuit within a week, you will be unfortunate.

24
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,280
Moreover, if you take other photos, you will be unfortunate, so please be careful.

25
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,060
What is this?

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,540
It's stupid. What is a cursed camera?

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,460
Such an idiotic story. Who will believe it?

28
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,020
Why is the washing machine...

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,420
It can't be...

30
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,760
It's such an idiotic story.

31
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,900
Where does it come from?

32
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,540
It's a cursed camera.

33
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:56,880
It can't be...

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,760
Is this really a cursed camera?

35
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,840
Why is this kind of thing in my place?

36
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,260
I don't need this kind of thing.

37
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,100
It's just a piece of cake.

38
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,580
It's really cursed. This camera is cursed.

39
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,240
Uh, uh...

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,720
Uh, uh...

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,080
Eh? This is the cursed camera.

42
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,460
Within a week, a picture of the lady police officer in a swimsuit...

43
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,560
Now that you mention it, I'm going to the beach on my trip to Katsushika.

44
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,080
What? Isn't it easy?

45
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,140
100 or 200 pictures of swimsuits.

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,240
Wait for me, cursed camera.

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,960
I'll take as many pictures as you want!

48
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,880
Get the pictures of the swimsuits!

49
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,280
What? You're saying that this year's trip is to the mountains?

50
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,980
Senior, didn't you know?

51
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,460
No, I didn't!

52
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,620
I thought that the trip was always to the beach.

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,600
The police decided it on their own.

54
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,040
We're not even men.

55
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,500
You're kidding!

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,300
Hey, you!

57
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,700
What are you doing?

58
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,380
Why did you change your trip to the mountains?

59
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,160
What are you talking about, you primitive?

60
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,520
Do you have any complaints?

61
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,040
The sea is the best in summer.

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,640
We've built a shelter for the mountains since this year.

63
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,400
That's why we're going to the mountains this year.

64
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,620
Right?

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,740
The sea and the sea water are full of UV rays.

66
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,840
That's right. It's a mountain that's perfect for preventing sunburn.

67
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,600
Right?

68
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,620
What?

69
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,500
The mountains in summer are quiet and cool.

70
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,360
It also has the effect of healing.

71
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,460
Right?

72
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,860
Right?

73
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:52,380
No, it's not right!

74
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,720
I will never accept it!

75
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,220
The sea is not the sea!

76
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,360
What are you saying, you primitive!

77
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,980
I've already decided.

78
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,920
I can't change it yet.

79
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,300
Come on, if you're done.

80
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,160
Go home now!

81
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,560
Come on!

82
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,160
Come on!

83
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,040
Come on!

84
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,220
Come on, Jenny!

85
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,800
Oh my God.

86
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,360
I thought that I could take a picture with no protection on the beach.

87
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,500
But I was wrong.

88
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,360
It's very natural and easy.

89
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,600
I didn't get suspicious at all.

90
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,620
But I didn't expect to be forced to wear a swimsuit in the mountains.

91
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,200
Anyway, if you call the people in the mountains to take pictures,

92
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,840
I'm sure they'll be suspicious.

93
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,540
I have to do something.

94
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,100
What?

95
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,580
You said you'd cooperate to take a picture of the mountains with no protection on the beach?

96
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,580
That's right.

97
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,620
I need your help right now.

98
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,840
No, I don't want to do that.

99
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,700
I'll ask for your help somehow, Nakagawa.

100
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,740
No, you can't.

101
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,440
Are you sure you can't?

102
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,140
I'm sure you can't.

103
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,260
Can't I ask for this much?

104
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,820
You can't ask for anything.

105
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,580
I'm angry!

106
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,520
What do you need to take a picture of the mountains with no protection on the beach?

107
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,200
Well, that's...

108
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,980
You're planning to make some money again, right?

109
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,540
Senpai, you shouldn't be doing that.

110
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,120
That's not a part-time job.

111
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,580
No, it's not.

112
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,380
Then what is it?

113
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,120
That's...

114
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,040
You can't tell me.

115
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,200
I can tell you.

116
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,120
But I don't know if you can believe me.

117
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,340
Anyway, please tell me.

118
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,980
Actually...

119
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,820
What?

120
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,320
What?

121
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,520
This is the cursed camera, right?

122
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,480
That's right.

123
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,340
If you take pictures of anything other than the swimsuit of the

124
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,020
poor, misfortune will come.

125
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,340
What's with that face?

126
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,480
Senpai, if it's a lie, let's make it better.

127
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,260
No, it's not a lie.

128
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,820
I'm really in misfortune.

129
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,480
No one believes in such a story.

130
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,180
Look at my eyes.

131
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,220
This is the lie.

132
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,020
It's really true.

133
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,300
It's really true.

134
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,400
This is the lie.

135
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,880
If you doubt it so much, you should try it.

136
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,520
Me?

137
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,820
That's right.

138
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,080
Take pictures of anything around there.

139
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,480
Then, this flower...

140
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,100
No, this bear.

141
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,540
Or this lantern...

142
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,260
Take pictures of anything, hurry up!

143
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,560
But what's wrong with wasting the film?

144
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,740
Hmm...

145
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,400
Maybe the angle is different.

146
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,620
Maybe the angle is different.

147
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,540
Maybe it's better from here?

148
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,440
No, I think it's better from here.

149
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,440
Hmm...

150
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,260
Maybe it's better from the front?

151
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,060
No, no, no.

152
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,600
I don't care where you take it from.

153
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,420
Hurry up and take it.

154
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,400
Hurry up.

155
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,320
I don't like the subject.

156
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,060
Come on, come on.

157
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,500
What?

158
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,960
Since we're here, I'll take a picture of you.

159
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,760
Me?

160
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,040
Is that okay, Senpai?

161
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Here, cheese.

162
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,000
Shut up.

163
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,500
Just take it.

164
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,380
But since we're here, I'll take a picture of you.

165
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,540
Senpai.

166
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,720
Here, cheese.

167
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,720
Cheese.

168
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,780
Senpai!

169
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,200
Why are you here?

170
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,120
How is it? Did you get it, Sakagawa?

171
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,840
Yes, somehow.

172
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,660
Then you'll help me, right?

173
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,280
Yes, I'll help you.

174
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,080
But it's strange.

175
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,780
Don't turn around, idiot.

176
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,560
Don't take it anymore.

177
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,080
I know it.

178
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,200
Huh?

179
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:59,920
It's kind of good.

180
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,240
This is the right answer, after all.

181
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:03,860
Right?

182
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,140
Oh, I'm starting to see it.

183
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,200
I found it!

184
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,940
Where is it?

185
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,280
It's not a deck!

186
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,700
This is the ocean, isn't it?

187
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,800
Why is there an ocean here?

188
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,200
Huh?

189
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,360
Nakagawa Leisure Development?

190
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,180
Nakagawa-san, what is this?

191
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,740
That's...

192
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:49,580
Welcome, everyone!

193
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,560
Ryo-chan!

194
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,700
You're here!

195
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,220
The ocean is the best!

196
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,540
The ocean, my ocean!

197
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,980
The ocean is...

198
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,040
Big and wide!

199
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,800
Speaking of summer, the ocean!

200
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,700
This is the best!

201
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,180
Come on, everyone!

202
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,740
This beautiful ocean is your private beach!

203
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,880
Let's swim as much as you want!

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,120
What is this?

205
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,240
You don't have to swim all of a sudden.

206
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,480
I don't have a swimsuit!

207
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,900
Hmm...

208
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,800
Don't worry.

209
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,860
I've got a rental swimsuit for you.

210
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,180
The latest release this year.

211
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,460
It's all of the latest products.

212
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,800
Come on!

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,940
You can have whatever you want.

214
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,020
By the way, what's the rental fee?

215
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,820
Of course!

216
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,300
Just!

217
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,840
Wow! Lucky!

218
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,020
Which one should I get?

219
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,560
Oh, this is cool!

220
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,260
This and this, which is better?

221
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,360
Wait a minute!

222
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,640
Isn't it weird?

223
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,580
I don't want it!

224
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,520
It's not weird at all.

225
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,260
No, no, no, no.

226
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,500
It's too suspicious that Ryotsu would lend money for free.

227
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,620
That's true. The money witch is so strange.

228
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,600
There must be some trap.

229
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,680
It's strange that there is an ocean here.

230
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,340
No!

231
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,960
It's the last one.

232
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,260
Please.

233
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,060
I can't get in that hand.

234
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:23,980
It's a trap.

235
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,200
It's a trap.

236
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,320
Damn it. They are very sharp.

237
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,440
Okay, it's the next one.

238
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:58,280
It's hot even though it's a mountain.

239
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,380
It's good to experience nature,

240
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,160
but...

241
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,260
I wanted to follow them around.

242
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,080
It's over 40 degrees.

243
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,680
What?

244
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,740
Senpai, you don't have to do this much.

245
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,080
Shut up.

246
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,560
You can choose your way at this moment.

247
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,300
I can't do this anymore.

248
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,560
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,100
I was wrong about the ocean.

250
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,000
Hooray!

251
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,360
What?

252
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,840
What?

253
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,700
It's hot!

254
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,520
It's hot!

255
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,060
The ocean is great.

256
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,660
When it's hot, I'll go to the ocean.

257
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,920
I can only think about the ocean.

258
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't believe you.

259
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,620
I can't be bothered anymore.

260
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,140
Over.

261
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,220
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,480
Oh.

263
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,640
I'm really wrong...

264
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,400
Ah!

265
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,720
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,740
Hooray!

267
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,260
Still, I can't get in that sea!

268
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,200
Oh, my goodness.

269
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,660
If only they didn't come here.

270
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,000
What?

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,920
If I get in that sea,

272
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,320
I don't know what he's thinking.

273
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,420
Oh, I'm at my limit.

274
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,660
I'm going to swim.

275
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,240
I'm going to swim, too.

276
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,700
No, I'm in trouble.

277
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,880
I'm in trouble.

278
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,060
Welcome.

279
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,640
Please choose your favorite swimsuit.

280
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,360
I don't care if it's hot.

281
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,420
No, no, no.

282
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,340
Don't come.

283
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,780
No way.

284
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,520
Why, senpai?

285
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,440
Shut up.

286
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,820
This is a women's only.

287
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,520
You can't enter.

288
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,120
What a way to get angry.

289
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,020
It's not normal.

290
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,800
That's why I said so.

291
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,640
You can probably wear a transparent swimsuit.

292
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,240
No.

293
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,240
It's dangerous to get close.

294
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,280
This is the same as the ant hell.

295
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,060
Hey, everyone.

296
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,000
Come on.

297
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,200
Damn.

298
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,520
It's just a normal day, so I don't trust you at all.

299
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,020
Ryo-sama.

300
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,940
I'm going to wear this.

301
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,300
Um?

302
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,120
I was thinking about the harmony with the ungrateful people.

303
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,160
I was thinking about the harmony with the ungrateful people.

304
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,780
But I won't betray you.

305
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,760
But I won't betray you.

306
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,280
I'll make you happy and let you go into the sea.

307
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,540
I'll make you happy and let you go into the sea.

308
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,200
I see.

309
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,340
Maria was still with me.

310
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,220
Maria is a man, but she's ungrateful.

311
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,320
And she's a woman.

312
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,700
Ryo-sama.

313
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,820
Do you think it will suit me?

314
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,960
It's perfect.

315
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,360
You look like a model.

316
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,600
I hate it.

317
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,460
You're embarrassing me.

318
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,740
That's right.

319
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,200
Let's take a picture, Maria.

320
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,120
Please pose.

321
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,900
All right.

322
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:17,980
Is this enough?

323
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,460
Is that okay, Ryo-sama?

324
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,000
Okay, okay!

325
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,400
I'll take it then.

326
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,880
Here's your cheese!

327
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,220
Ryo-sama!

328
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,800
Th-they're all for the sake of the year.

329
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,380
We're at our limit!

330
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,020
Let's make it the sea.

331
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,200
We're going to the sea now!

332
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,140
Yay!

333
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,000
Huh?

334
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,260
What?

335
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,460
Are we going somewhere?

336
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,720
It seems that the amount of the sea has changed.

337
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,780
What?!

338
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,700
Hey, you guys!

339
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,180
The sea is right in front of us!

340
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,020
I'm sorry for swimming in such a suspicious sea.

341
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,060
Oh, Ryo-sama.

342
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,380
See you later.

343
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,300
You're completely an insect, damn it!

344
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,940
But, as a result, we're going to the sea,

345
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,840
so it's all good.

346
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,140
Let's go!

347
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,080
What?!

348
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,360
What did you say?!

349
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,120
What's wrong, Naoko?

350
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,800
Ryo-san! Ryo-san!

351
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,500
I just got a call from the second car.

352
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,420
Wait for me.

353
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,160
I'll take a picture of you in a suspicious swimsuit soon.

354
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,840
What?!

355
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,920
Ryo-chan did that?!

356
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,880
That's what I was after.

357
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,920
I'm sure they're going to sell it to someone.

358
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,220
What are you going to do, Reiko-san?

359
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:44,500
Yeah.

360
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,800
I have a bad feeling.

361
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,180
But we can't wait to get on the sea!

362
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,260
You sure can't help it.

363
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,480
Let's go to another beach.

364
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,080
Let's leave first!

365
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,400
Let's go!

366
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,160
Let's go to that beach!

367
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,700
I don't want to swim under the sea faster than that,

368
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:17,960
but I'm serious.

369
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,220
I'm out of here.

370
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:22,660
Why???

371
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,340
There is a person of men who wants to sell a photo of his swim trotter.

372
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,040
So I will give it to my girlfriend.

373
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,480
Why are you looking at me at once?

374
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,480
I didn't intend to do that.

375
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,180
You suspect me, don't you?

376
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,800
Damn it, it's like a criminal case.

377
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,880
I didn't do anything wrong.

378
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,340
I didn't do anything like that!

379
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,340
I'm sorry, Ryo-san!

380
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,440
He said he'd be a senior soon.

381
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,000
I have a message from the entire community.

382
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,360
Don't take pictures of Ryo, Tsukan, and Kichi!

383
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,020
That's all.

384
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,060
Damn, he even covered his eyes.

385
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,800
Yes!

386
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,260
That's it!

387
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,540
Ah, it feels so good!

388
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,780
The ocean is really nice after all.

389
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,500
It's the best!

390
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,940
But, as expected of Reiko-san.

391
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,920
She even made a fence.

392
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,780
Her opponent is Ryo-chan.

393
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,900
I have to do this much.

394
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,800
This looks fun.

395
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,820
It's like a bathhouse.

396
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,600
Hey, everyone!

397
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm not even going to take a picture of you.

398
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,760
How did you know?

399
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,560
Aren't you stupid?

400
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,020
It's obvious.

401
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,260
What a pervert!

402
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,140
Yes!

403
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,480
That's it!

404
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,540
I got it!

405
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,540
I'll take it!

406
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,040
Huh?

407
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,820
It's obvious!

408
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,560
I'll take it!

409
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,120
I'll take it!

410
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,140
I'll take it!

411
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,340
But I'll take it!

412
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:26,840
Oh, no!

413
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,240
It's me!

414
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,700
Yeah, it's me, isn't it?

415
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,000
What the.

416
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,240
It's not easy for me.

417
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,580
sachiko!

418
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,360
You are not qualify to take on me.

419
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:44,480
Huh...

420
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,500
My man!

421
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:44,860
Ugh!

422
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,420
It's too much to think that it's a wave-generating device.

423
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,840
No, it doesn't matter. My life is at stake.

424
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,220
-Sara? -What's this?

425
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,680
-The salt is dripping. -It's weird.

426
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,620
To be able to go down the road so fast.

427
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,680
-What? -What?

428
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,500
This time, I'll get it right.

429
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,520
No, it's not there. What?

430
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,540
-I'm sorry. -Stop giving up.

431
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,800
-I'll get it. -Gee.

432
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,780
That's no good. This is no good either.

433
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,300
I'm going to be unhappy for the rest of my life.

434
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,260
Senpai, don't lose your temper.

435
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,620
I'll introduce you to a good onmyoji who will pay for your curse.

436
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,660
No! It's not a joke to be unhappy for the rest of my life.

437
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,800
It's not as dangerous as saying it's not.

438
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,200
-I don't want it! -You're too good, Ryo-chan.

439
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,380
I'm thinking stupidly about selling our swimsuit pictures.

440
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,880
That's why it's like this.

441
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,900
That's right. I'll never forgive you this time.

442
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,740
I'll talk to the president of Tonda and get you fired.

443
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,180
Everyone, wait a minute.

444
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,580
Actually, there's a reason for this.

445
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,480
I don't know if you can believe it,

446
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,760
but Senpai's camera is a cursed camera.

447
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,320
So, if you don't take a picture of Fukie's swimsuit, you'll be unhappy.

448
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,700
Nakagawa-san!

449
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,340
No matter how much you lie,

450
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,260
-you're covering up for Ryo-chan and Kancho. -That's right.

451
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,680
It's strange to say, "believe."

452
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,180
Senpai!

453
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,400
Senpai!

454
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,120
I can't believe it!

455
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,600
Did you believe me!

456
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,720
There is no seed or trap.

457
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,000
It really seems like a curse is on you.

458
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,940
Well, I'm asking you...

459
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,860
Can you take a picture of everyone's swimsuits?

460
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,520
Why are you doing this to me?

461
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,700
"I'm not sure about this."

462
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,500
"It's okay. I'll make sure you get it this time."

463
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,160
"That's great, senpai!"

464
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,060
"Here's the cheese."

465
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,600
"Now we have 100 pieces."

466
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,320
"It disappeared!"

467
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,660
"I did it! Now I'm free!"

468
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,300
"I'm so happy!"

469
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,140
"That's great, senpai!"

470
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,040
"If you'd told me honestly from the start, I wouldn't have to go through all that trouble."

471
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
"But it's normal to be normal."

472
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,740
"Even if I told you honestly, I wouldn't have believed you."

473
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,140
"You're right."

474
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,320
"But you were able to get 100 pieces of Fukie's swimsuit."

475
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,700
"That's a strange curse."

476
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,120
"What on earth was that camera?"

477
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,360
"I did it! I did it!"

478
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,780
"You're pretty good at taking pictures of Ryotsu, aren't you?"

479
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
"No, no, no."

480
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,560
"This is a punishment from the Chief of the Underworld Security Department who is trying to make Ryotsu Kan-Kichi angry."

481
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,480
"Ryotsu will also become a human being trusted by the public with this."

482
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,500
"I'll have to work a little harder."

483
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:54,940
"Chh."

484
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,640
"Heh, but to my surprise, it's not a bad punishment."

485
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,080
"Ah, summer is here again this year."

486
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,620
"It's here! It's here! It's here!"

487
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,800
"Ah, summer is here again this year."

488
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,000
"It's here! It's here! It's here!"

489
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:54,400
Big, small, small, small, small, small, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big

490
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:06,220
big, big, small, small, small, small, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big-big, big, big

491
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,980
big, big, small,

492
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,240
big,

493
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:12,880
big,

494
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,300
tight,

495
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:14,720
tight,

496
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:14,780
tight,

497
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:14,820
tight,

498
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,000
tight,

499
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,260
tight,

500
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,220
tight,

501
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,220
tight,

502
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,680
It's a long time!

503
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
"Hashijyo Onsen"

504
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,140
"Hashijyo Onsen"

505
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,600
Yay! It's a hot spring!

506
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,240
I was digging a well behind the hot spring and a hot spring appeared!

507
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,340
This is a great deal!

508
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,840
The name is "Hashijyo Onsen"!

509
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,800
Wait, I'd rather build a large hot spring, Leijer Land!

510
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,420
Next time, "Hashijyo Onsen" is a good idea!

511
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,280
Please watch!

512
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,060
"Hashijyo Onsen"

513
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,480
"Hashijyo Onsen"

514
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,820
Thank you!
