1
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,440
in such a boring love novel

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,100
One day, a beautiful woman

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,440
noticed a beautiful guy

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,020
when the boy told her

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,300
to throw up, he even balanced out his poop

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:32,240
I wonder if I'm going to be a tycoon who has been saving money

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,080
I was laughed at as it was

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,540
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,920
There is a bad boy and a bad girl

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape that hasn't changed a bit is strangely gentle

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:03,980
From the main street of Tongari-boshi to Taishakuten

12
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,080
The sunset falls

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,380
Tomorrow will end like this

14
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,900
Katsushika

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm happy again

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,720
I realized that I lost

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,300
Because I'm stupid

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,820
"Burning Camp Spirit"

19
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,620
RV cars are very popular

20
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,460
By the way, I often run in the city these days

21
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,460
The number of RV cars is increasing

22
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,820
Camping cars are also hitting a large

23
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,380
Japanese outdoor leisure has become like America

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,380
There are many RV cars in the United States

25
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,440
It's the real thing

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,160
There are a lot of types

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,760
This is completely a house

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,720
Yes, it's called mobile home

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,740
You can move with a car on the ground

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,400
I'm going to camp with my whole house

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,660
I think it's a home

32
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,540
I think that "Crayon" is "Colise" of Shiratori Reiji

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,960
What?

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,720
Hello, poor people.

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,260
It's been a long time.

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,040
What's this?

37
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,360
As you can see, it's a camping car.

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
It's the idea of Narikin.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,980
Is it rare that there is only one Porsche custom made camping car in the world of super rich Shiratori Reiji?

40
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,720
I'm over the word "rare".

41
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,720
Don't praise me so much.

42
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,320
I'm not praising you.

43
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,300
I feel good.

44
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,620
It's a greeting.

45
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:42,780
It's a greeting.

46
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,200
Poor Hiroi.

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,400
Huh?

48
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,200
You always get caught in the same thing.

49
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,260
It's probably a child's bank account again.

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Oh, Ryo.

51
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,420
This is real, Senpai.

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,780
Didn't you only carry a card when you were super rich?

53
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,620
Don't think I'm just a super rich person.

54
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,160
Because...

55
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,740
You may have forgotten.

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,620
You had a hard time paying 25 yen with a card.

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,480
You decided to carry both from now on.

58
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,100
In other words, I'm a super rich person who learns.

59
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,420
Well, that's...

60
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,020
You finally got used to it.

61
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,300
Don't say that.

62
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,520
It's hard to say that Japan is still a perfect card society.

63
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,100
Yotsu, you have to pay back all the money you picked up.

64
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,380
What?

65
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,460
Hey, super rich person.

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,420
Buy that camping car.

67
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:35,960
Yeah.

68
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,860
The engine is a 16-cylinder twin turbo 512 horsepower.

69
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,480
Super poor.

70
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,980
I think you know the value of this Porsche genuine camping car.

71
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,480
You're so stupid.

72
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,540
Rage and Reiko?

73
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,480
Oh, why is my name?

74
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,900
That's...

75
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,600
Reiko!

76
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,160
It's a super special camping car that's only for you and me to go to the auto camp.

77
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,200
Now, Reiko.

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,600
Please sign the first step to our super camping car.

79
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,440
But...

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,080
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

81
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,420
The first step is small.

82
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,880
But small steps will be a great step in our history.

83
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,700
It seems that Ryo-chan has already made a big step.

84
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,860
The car is so spacious.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,300
Ten people can get in.

86
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,180
I can get in too.

87
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,000
No way!

88
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,320
This car can be used by two people.

89
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,740
It's so spacious.

90
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,460
Yes.

91
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,040
That's why super poor people use a big space with two people.

92
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,820
If you really want to get in...

93
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,820
No way!

94
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,380
Damn.

95
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,660
Damn.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,480
Damn.

97
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,560
I hate the city below.

98
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,340
I'm thinking about getting in the electric carrier.

99
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,180
Forget it.

100
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,860
I'll go with another camping car.

101
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,460
Reiko.

102
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,300
I feel sorry for you.

103
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,100
Go with me.

104
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:51,740
What?

105
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,000
You can make a camping car in Nakagawa, can't you?

106
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,100
Yes.

107
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,060
I'm a custom maid at Nakagawa Motors.

108
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,080
Okay.

109
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,280
We'll go with that.

110
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,200
Chief.

111
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,720
Let's go on a vacation next time.

112
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
That's a good idea for Ryo-chan.

113
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,300
Yay!

114
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,540
Camping is great.

115
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,680
Senpai.

116
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,300
So what?

117
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,680
What?

118
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,780
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,100
I'm a little late.

120
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,060
What do you think?

121
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,120
It's the fastest camping car based on Ferrari.

122
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,780
Did you hear that?

123
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,260
This is amazing.

124
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,080
It's so flashy.

125
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,420
It's a brand new Hoya Hoya.

126
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,100
What a great car.

127
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,880
Let's go.

128
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,480
Don't be stupid and let's go.

129
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,400
But...

130
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,260
It's okay.

131
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,400
We don't know where it's going.

132
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,200
Let's meet over there.

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Here's Reiko.

134
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,880
Oh my.

135
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,380
You're not driving?

136
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,180
Of course not.

137
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,740
I've been drinking wine all day.

138
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,800
Please sit down and fasten your seat belt.

139
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,080
We're leaving.

140
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,440
Oh, no.

141
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,000
Please pull the seat belt hard.

142
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,920
Do we need the side mirror?

143
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,400
It's okay.

144
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,800
There's a monitor inside.

145
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:00,980
Uh?

146
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,960
Porsche is starting to move.

147
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,160
"Porsche"

148
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:04,720
"Side mirror"

149
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:04,980
What?

150
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,420
He has a lot of horsepower!

151
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,900
He made me spin the wheel!

152
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,020
When did he start driving?

153
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,380
I don't need this!

154
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,320
Chief! Terai! Get in!

155
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,960
Don't take the back!

156
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,620
Nakagawa! Let's go!

157
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,860
Y-Yes, sir!

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,900
I won't let you get away!

159
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,500
I'm relieved.

160
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,660
You hired a professional driver this time.

161
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,220
You're better than me.

162
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,580
That's why I said so.

163
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,460
To enjoy wine with Reiko.

164
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,560
To your eyes, cheers.

165
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,080
Ferrari is approaching!

166
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,480
What? Don't let them pass!

167
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,080
As expected of Diablo.

168
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,320
I can see cars around him.

169
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,540
Great!

170
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,500
What? He got overtaken in the shopping center.

171
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,380
It feels like Porsche and Ferrari got overtaken from the powered 오� here.

172
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,280
Boobs.

173
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,040
Hey! Be faster!

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm at my limits on this circuit.

175
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,780
Suratoni, use a professional driver.

176
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,600
Nakagawa, don't you bend forward.

177
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,960
He is taking side-winds seriously.

178
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,000
It's not good any more.

179
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,080
I'm sorry I said you.

180
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,460
I don't need brakes.

181
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,800
Please don't force yourself.

182
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,260
Don't get in my way.

183
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,720
Arrgh~!

184
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,360
Shit! He got away

185
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,600
How 'bout "got away"?

186
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,360
Shiradori!

187
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,280
Build another Twin Engine in our next drive-in

188
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,100
What!

189
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,440
It's not a prank call!

190
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,220
I'm the associate president of Shiradori TAct!

191
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,720
Hey, shut up!

192
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,180
Just let him do as he's told!

193
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,680
Even if it costs a thousand dollars

194
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,900
AAAAH!

195
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,160
Senpai! Porsche is coming for us.

196
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,420
What?!

197
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,760
Nakaga! Speed up!

198
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,880
You have the right speed at the control.

199
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,500
Wha..what?!

200
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,900
It seems that the engine has been replaced.

201
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,520
Now, the car behind me is going to be a little annoying.

202
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,720
Alright, this one is also an engine replacement.

203
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,580
We are at a big campsite.

204
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,920
What kind of camp is it if we lose to Porsche?

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,320
I have never played such a game with a camper.

206
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,680
Is there a turbo switch somewhere?

207
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,720
No, there isn't.

208
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,720
Chief, we have escaped.

209
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
What is it? Are you taking the admission fee?

210
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,740
It's the Porsche of Shirazuri.

211
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,000
Stop it at its nose.

212
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,420
Alright!

213
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,720
What are you doing?

214
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Senior, you're in danger.

215
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,900
Ryo-chan!

216
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,780
You idiot!

217
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,300
Ryo-san!

218
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,440
Don't you dare!

219
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,940
We have arrived at the auto campsite!

220
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,120
We are camping!

221
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,660
What?

222
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,060
There are so many camping cars!

223
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,500
There are so many camping cars!

224
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,760
What a mess!

225
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,440
It's like a beach on summer vacation.

226
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,420
Convenience store, restaurant, coin laundry, rental of camping equipment, and a game center.

227
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,100
It's a video store.

228
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,140
Moreover, they are lending their deck and BS TV.

229
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,480
There are also lighter facilities.

230
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,340
It's more serious than those baseball courts.

231
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,220
Look! It's a brand-name store.

232
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,000
It's like a duty-free store.

233
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,340
It's full of many things.

234
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,920
I don't feel like I'm camping here.

235
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,800
Alright! Let's go further into the mountains.

236
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,060
What?

237
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
We are camping only when we are in nature.

238
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,600
That's right!

239
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,080
In nature, camping cars are the real thing.

240
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,760
Shirazuri, you are so excited for the first time.

241
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,900
It's more fun to go on a date in a secluded place.

242
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,340
You bastard!

243
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,600
How could you be so mean?

244
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,980
It's a simple course.

245
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,400
The engine is powerful.

246
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,080
Ferrari's delicate engine is no good.

247
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,060
Senpai, I'll bite you.

248
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,600
You'll be in the mountains.

249
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,120
What if you bite me?

250
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,860
You'll be fine.

251
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,900
I can't guarantee it.

252
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,640
I'm not going to lose to that idiot.

253
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,540
Give up.

254
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,180
Give it back to me.

255
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,760
Give it back!

256
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
How's this?

257
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,460
That's right, Reiko-san. This is nature itself.

258
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,280
Right. But it's more like the threat of nature itself.

259
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,460
Alright, we're here. How's that? It's nature itself!

260
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,940
Hey, Shiratori. You're not supposed to use the same point.

261
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,200
You're persistent.

262
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,700
Alright, when we get to the camp, we'll start cooking. Let's start cooking.

263
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,660
What?

264
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,820
Um, Senpai, we're in a bit of a hurry, so let's take a break.

265
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,520
Ehh...

266
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,020
We can't help it.

267
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,360
Then, we'll just take a break.

268
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,940
Alright, the food's ready.

269
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,700
What? Ryo-tsu is cooking?

270
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,420
Yeah.

271
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,620
I said I'd help, but he said he'd cook it himself.

272
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,940
It's like a curry.

273
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,440
I have a bad feeling about this.

274
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,460
Hey, Oichi!

275
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,120
There's a skin on this onion.

276
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,720
Carrots have leaves.

277
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,040
Potatoes have skins, too.

278
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,100
What are you talking about?

279
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,980
It's only natural to enjoy nature with a skin.

280
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,800
Don't hold back and eat!

281
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,900
I want to hold back.

282
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,860
Me too.

283
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,620
Senpai, there's a potato's eye on it.

284
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,100
I'll see if I can get it.

285
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,860
In nature, French cuisine really does have its own charm, doesn't it?

286
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,640
Well then, Reiko. That's the best situation, isn't it?

287
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,740
I never thought that even Chef would agree...

288
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,620
Darn it.

289
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,280
What do you think?

290
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,280
That's because I have super-money.

291
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,380
What are you saying?

292
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,840
Curry and soba are the best for camping!

293
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,740
French cuisine, huh?

294
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,080
Huh?

295
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,540
It's a treasure with a life.

296
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,040
Shut up!

297
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,480
I'm not being honest.

298
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,800
You traitor.

299
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,820
Outdoor dinners and music are the best.

300
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:11,280
Sorry to keep you waiting.

301
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,600
The song is for the world, the world is for the song.

302
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,820
Ryo and Kankichi will act the sadness of a man.

303
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,340
The karaoke is for the nature.

304
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,280
This is the moment of Outdoor Dinners.

305
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,700
How poor are they?

306
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,280
This is the latest all genre,

307
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,980
Laser Karaoke that has been sold from hit charts to summer songs.

308
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,380
Let's have a duet until the morning, Reiko.

309
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,860
There is such a song.

310
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,080
I will be the lion.

311
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,780
Well, 98's X's 8000.

312
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,300
Uh, first-rate...

313
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,200
After all, the TV game is the best.

314
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,580
If I have to do it, the game center!

315
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,600
The new leader is the Red Chief.

316
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,560
Let's start the operation.

317
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,260
Red Chief, copy that.

318
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,300
The movie is the best.

319
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,460
my gosh,

320
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,000
I think I'm in big trouble! It's time for

321
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,760
an Electrical Parade! What are you talking

322
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,460
about? Don't underestimate a

323
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,420
movie to watch outdoors! Why are you so

324
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,480
dazzled?! I saw the future!

325
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,200
Damn it!

326
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,480
The output is up!

327
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,180
What?

328
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,500
The output is 120%!

329
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,840
That's right!

330
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,700
What?

331
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,780
Not yet!

332
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,060
How about this?

333
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,220
What happened?

334
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,680
The engine is not working.

335
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,920
The battery is dead.

336
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,220
It's not working.

337
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,860
Can't you call for help?

338
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,220
The cell phone is out of service.

339
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,080
It's a parking lot.

340
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,100
Do something, Ryo-tsu.

341
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,040
The cloud is getting more and more suspicious.

342
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,140
Will it rain?

343
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,980
It's raining!

344
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,620
Get in the car!

345
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,180
The candle light is a trap.

346
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,240
It's a trap.

347
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,140
Shiratori, why are you here?

348
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,080
Super poor people don't care about that.

349
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,660
I care.

350
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,800
It's raining.

351
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,700
It's not going to stop.

352
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,740
I'm scared if there's a thunder.

353
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,580
It's the weather in the mountains.

354
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,960
It's too cold!

355
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,240
There's a lot of natural electricity.

356
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,240
Ryo, charge it.

357
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,540
There's no way I can do that.

358
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,680
Guys, the air conditioner is working.

359
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,720
Ah, my Porsche!

360
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,220
Dumbass, don't worry about the people inside the car.

361
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,380
It's fine.

362
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,420
The people inside are all fine.

363
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,780
Anyway, it's the custom-made camper of the super- épure Shirazuri.

364
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,420
It's an air bag with a guide system...

365
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,140
It must have been equipped with a guide system.

366
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,180
Of course.

367
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,420
Of course, it's on!

368
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,820
It's a funeral!

369
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,900
We must find a place to hide!

370
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,760
There's a cave over there!

371
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,540
That's great!

372
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
It's an old fishing bridge.

373
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,260
This bridge is rotten.

374
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,040
Be careful.

375
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,560
We must cross it or we'll fall.

376
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
We might fall.

377
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,740
Let's pay for it!

378
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,880
That's all?

379
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,540
Let me go first!

380
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,620
I'll do that.

381
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,280
Stop it!

382
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,480
Watch out!

383
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,440
What are they doing?

384
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,940
Senpai!

385
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,640
You're not going to pay?

386
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,360
Don't kill me!

387
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,860
Hurry up!

388
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,720
I'll pay for it!

389
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,880
What should we do?

390
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,200
I can't believe what I said is true.

391
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,620
It's a coincidence.

392
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,400
If you're curious, try thinking about the positive side.

393
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,960
Nobody knows that we're camping in the middle of the mountain.

394
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,960
Even if we're saved, we're afraid of a second wave.

395
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,760
What's the positive side?

396
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,060
But it's cold.

397
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,800
I'm hungry.

398
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,020
I'm hungry.

399
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,220
I can't think of anything fun.

400
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,360
A barbecue party with a fire is good.

401
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,300
I'll pay for it.

402
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,960
Someone buy me some ingredients.

403
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,580
I'm hungry.

404
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,400
Hold on.

405
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,040
If you put it in your mouth, you'll have to pay more.

406
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,920
There's a can here.

407
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,960
And two of them.

408
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,140
It's huge.

409
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,160
Ryo!

410
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,840
As expected of Senpai!

411
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,660
Ryo, you're good!

412
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,380
Well, I'll enjoy it alone.

413
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:27,520
I wonder if I can enjoy it alone.

414
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,580
You're...

415
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,080
Ryo!

416
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,080
Senpai, you're mean.

417
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,400
Huh?

418
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,680
Who's mean?

419
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,260
You betrayed me.

420
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,520
I made a curry with all my heart.

421
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,020
I took a French dish from a chicken.

422
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,660
I won't give it to people like that.

423
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,160
It's good.

424
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,880
You shouldn't be so mean now, Ryo.

425
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,860
That's right.

426
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,020
It's okay to pour it into water and pour it all over, so please share it with everyone, Senpai.

427
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,480
No way.

428
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,220
I'm going to be full.

429
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,320
But I can't help it.

430
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,380
I'll have another one.

431
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,160
Well, how can I eat it?

432
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,440
Ryo.

433
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,320
Hey, Shiratori.

434
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,560
I have a bad feeling about this.

435
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,800
How much do you want it?

436
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,000
There are 20 small sardines in the can.

437
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,560
It's 20,000 yen for one.

438
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,020
It's 20,000 yen for one.

439
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,480
It's a big profit with a can of 350 yen.

440
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,440
All right, I bought it.

441
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,400
How about 1 million yen?

442
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,500
All right, I sold it.

443
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,380
1 million yen.

444
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,280
Now, Ryo.

445
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,020
Shiratori and Reiji, the super rich, have kept the can.

446
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,480
You two...

447
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,340
Shiratori.

448
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,660
Thank you.

449
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,940
I won't forget this.

450
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,100
Thank you very much.

451
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:49,840
Huh?

452
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,840
What?

453
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,320
What?

454
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,540
What?

455
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,920
What?

456
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,660
Excuse me!

457
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,320
Isn't that a big deal?

458
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,400
Isn't that a big deal?

459
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
A衡 Aquarius, huh?

460
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,260
Now, let's eat it together.

461
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,600
Okay, got it.

462
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,940
Where did Ryo go?

463
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:09,740
Huh?

464
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,540
Senior.

465
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,160
Ryo?

466
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,900
Come on.

467
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,400
What's with you? Come on!

468
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,080
Whatever you want! Give me a change!

469
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:55,640
Hey!

470
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,160
That was big, Ryo-tsu!

471
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,560
He bought food for everyone!

472
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,700
He's a police officer's mirror!

473
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,440
Then he should be coming to help us!

474
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:17,760
What?

475
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,960
Huh? He didn't contact us?

476
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,400
No way! He went to the store on the foot of the hill and-

477
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,000
Shut up! He didn't contact us!

478
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,560
What?!

479
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,300
Alright!

480
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
He's got all these supplies.

481
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,980
He'll be alright in a few months!

482
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,920
Huh...

483
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,780
He's lost his shine at once...

484
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,140
But, well, he's doing it for Ryo-san's sake.

485
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,160
Idiot!

486
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,900
You think you can get people's efforts with your actions?

487
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,460
No way!

488
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,500
So, the wonderful product here is a dictionary.

489
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,420
"A stand-up bar. A place where you can't get what you want."

490
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,600
"This is the right of the people!"

491
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,380
Huh?

492
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,120
"The first thing you need is this washing machine and a towel."

493
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,420
"Now you can even use this toothbrush set!"

494
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,480
I want one! But it's expensive...

495
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,400
Don't worry! I'll buy it!

496
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,800
One million yen is fine!

497
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,220
If you don't have anyone else to buy it with, it's fine!

498
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,320
But the water is on sale separately.

499
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,880
One will be about two million yen.

500
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,560
Ugh!

501
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,700
It's fine!

502
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,680
I'll buy one for three million yen!

503
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,480
Give me three!

504
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,520
Here!

505
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,500
Here!

506
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,460
He's talking about the dictionary, but he's actually putting in the price himself.

507
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,520
Yeah, the target's obvious.

508
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,160
The one who's not paying attention is also Shiratori-san.

509
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,380
Can I have five million yen for the milk and bread over there?

510
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:27,980
Yes!

511
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,240
One roll of toilet paper is about ten million yen.

512
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,100
Cheap! Cheap!

513
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,580
About thirty million yen is fair!

514
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,860
A cup noodle for lunch! Five thousand yen!

515
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,680
A snack for three is a castella can!

516
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,560
One hundred million yen!

517
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,160
Ryo-san, I'm going to raise all of Shiratori-san's money.

518
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,880
Two hundred million yen!

519
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,520
It's a good bet for both of them.

520
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,280
How much is that two of them complaining about?

521
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,880
This much!

522
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:59,600
I'm saved!

523
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,540
Now I can go home!

524
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,540
This is all the money I have!

525
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,380
I'll take the soy sauce and miso with this!

526
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:08,820
It's fine.

527
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,840
If you don't have the money, your products won't sell.

528
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,840
Chief, what should we do with those two?

529
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,500
It's fine if they have that much food.

530
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,660
Leave them alone for a while.

531
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,560
I feel sorry for them.

532
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,120
What?

533
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,000
If we can protect Japan's peace, they'll be happy, right?

534
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,380
Caramel!

535
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,700
How about this JAPAX gold card?

536
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:40,960
Sure!

537
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,840
I'll rate it at three hundred million yen.

538
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,020
Your chocolate is a bloody platinum card!

539
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,380
Five million yen!

540
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,420
Potato chips?

541
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,540
Potato chips are Orca's hyper card!

542
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,680
Alright!

543
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,540
One hundred million yen!

544
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,620
And then...

545
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,120
I still haven't got it!

546
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,760
I'll give you this one!

547
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,720
That's still a billion yen!

548
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,380
One hundred million yen!

549
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,320
One hundred million yen!

550
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,640
One hundred million yen!

551
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,980
One hundred million yen!

552
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,000
One hundred million yen!

553
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,300
What's with Jagger?

554
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,100
It's tea time!

555
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,020
He's dressed up as a Japanese in England,

556
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,760
and he doesn't admit his mistakes.

557
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,040
He hates losing.

558
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,320
What?

559
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:15,980
It's a duel!

560
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,940
Let's take it!

561
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,940
Next time on Fierce Professor!

562
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,440
Let's go!

563
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:39,240
To be continued

564
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,000
I want to ride a bike on the desert

565
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,180
I want to be free more than a bird

566
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,460
A lady's dream that changes at the speed of a full moon

567
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:15,320
I'm sorry, I lost my love

568
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,920
The brightness of the future in the panorama

569
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:26,560
You know it, right?

570
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm sorry, I lost my love
