19

What is this!?

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,460
Where am I!?

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,860
Have you noticed?

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,840
"Promo-Ya Ozaki"?

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,080
And the one at the store...

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,260
No way!

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,720
I don't have money!

26
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,100
I promised to give you a bonus for the first time!

27
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,600
And you're suddenly copying me!

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,080
Stop copying me!

29
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,600
No, I'm not talking about the bonus today.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,340
I want you to lend me your power somehow.

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,100
My power?

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,820
Come to Kameari Shopping Street!

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,100
You want to borrow my power?

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,620
What do you mean!?

35
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,280
Look at this.

36
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,180
What?

37
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,160
This is...

38
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,540
The sales of Kameari Shopping Street in the last few months.

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,900
Hmm, this is a surprisingly good right-hand drive in Mt. Fuji again.

40
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,220
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,560
I'm busy with my life.

42
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,080
I know the cause.

43
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,280
This is it.

44
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,820
It's a large shopping mall built in the next town.

45
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,740
Most of my customers have taken it.

46
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,120
Thanks to that, Kameari Shopping Street has been completely empty...

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,520
It's daytime...

48
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,200
But the customers and passers-by don't come.

49
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,360
But it can't be helped.

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,380
It's cheaper there, and there are cinemas and bowling courses, so it's natural for customers to choose that place.

51
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,440
I know...

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,260
I know, but we can't back down here.

53
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,920
Please, Ryo-san, lend us your power!

54
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,740
Ryo-san!

55
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,740
Please bring the customers back to Kameari Shopping Street!

56
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,580
No, no, no, no, no!

57
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,920
Hey, that's our own business effort.

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,900
We're just trying to get things done!

59
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,100
We sold a lot of things.

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,180
We sold flyers...

61
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,940
We sold Ad Balloons...

62
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,280
But it didn't work at all.

63
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,720
If we don't do anything, the shopping mall will be destroyed!

64
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,780
So what does that have to do with me?

65
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,200
If it's business, it's Ryo-san.

66
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,620
You've succeeded many times with your power, guts, and ideas.

67
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:47,900
I want you to lend me your power, guts, and ideas at Kameari Shopping Street!

68
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,040
Please, Ryo-san!

69
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,280
I have no choice but to rely on you to win that shopping mall!

70
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,860
Please help us!

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,860
Even if you say that, I have a job too.

72
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,700
I see.

73
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,800
That's too bad.

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,720
I thought I'd be able to repay you for the sales.

75
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,360
Repay?

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,920
I thought I'd be able to repay you for the sales.

77
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,600
I thought I'd be able to repay you for the sales.

78
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,180
What?

79
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,580
I thought I'd be able to repay you for the sales.

80
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,520
I thought I'd be able to repay you for the sales.

81
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,100
Bonus?

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,540
Ryo-san!

83
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,140
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

84
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,520
I'll leave everything to you!

85
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,460
The secret to success in business.

86
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,640
First, you have to do research on the enemy.

87
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,060
You have to look at the price and the service contents,

88
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,840
and you have to think about the service that goes up.

89
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,260
Otherwise, the customer will not be able to call you back.

90
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,740
I see.

91
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,700
Well said.

92
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,540
You're a great person.

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,640
Look at this radish.

94
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,500
All of them are much cheaper than those in the shopping mall.

95
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,620
Not only that.

96
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,060
Look at the arrangement of those products.

97
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,080
We have many customers here!

98
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,220
That's how they call in customers

99
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,640
that sell new products.

100
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,000
The same goes for the home appliances. This video is half the price of the shopping mall.

101
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,840
If you're going to sell at that price, you're selling at a fairly low price.

102
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,260
That's not all.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,040
Welcome! Welcome!

104
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,640
By keeping the same business partner by your side, you're making them compete with each other.

105
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,060
I see. Even though they're in the same shopping mall, they're rivals.

106
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,260
They're rivals?

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,100
They're 20% cheaper than any other shopping mall.

108
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,160
They're stronger than I thought.

109
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,360
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,960
Welcome!

111
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,460
This is one way to attract customers!

112
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,360
I see.

113
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,540
Good morning!

114
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,780
What?

115
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,080
The question is how to attract customers.

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,360
Did you learn something new by eating something weird?

117
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,640
You idiot! I'm a genius!

118
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,180
Oh, right, Nakagawa. I need to talk to you.

119
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,100
I see.

120
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,000
General! The time has finally come!

121
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,160
The customers are coming from that disgusting shopping mall.

122
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,980
To get back their customers, the time has finally come!

123
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,340
I've been thinking of various ways to do it.

124
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,960
If I do as I say, I'll recover my business, and I'll make a big comeback!

125
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,060
So, I decided to start with the development of this shopping mall.

126
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,900
Look at this!

127
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,060
What?

128
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,360
What?

129
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,040
It's a shopping mall.

130
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:06,860
Shopping mall?

131
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,460
Huh?

132
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,140
Ryo-san, this is the wrong location.

133
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,960
The next shop is a fish shop.

134
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,780
We're next to the Sangen!

135
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,200
No, you're not wrong.

136
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,580
From today, everyone will be moved to the place written here.

137
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,860
What?

138
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,100
What do you mean, Ryo-san?

139
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,280
Listen, sales can vary greatly depending on the location of the store.

140
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,960
What?

141
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,660
So, I decided to move the shop from a high-selling store to a place that stands out.

142
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,120
What does that mean?

143
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,900
Even though we're both friends of the same shopping mall, we're rivals in business.

144
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,020
If we're just friends, we can't do it for the sake of the shopping mall!

145
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,180
No way!

146
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,620
Shut up!

147
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,900
The people who are great are saying it, but without reform and growth, this is a decisive event!

148
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,480
What is this?

149
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:55,840
What is this?

150
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:08,500
What is this?

151
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,780
I wonder if it's okay to do this.

152
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,320
If this happens, we won't have time to move, right?

153
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,480
If you're frustrated, the sales will increase!

154
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,240
Work hard for the business!

155
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,620
Senior!

156
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,520
We've finished moving the shop!

157
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,140
Okay!

158
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,740
Then, let's continue with the second reform plan!

159
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,060
R-Ryo-san, what is this?

160
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:37,920
Can't you tell?

161
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,580
It's an old TV, video, and air conditioner.

162
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,640
That's not it.

163
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,320
I'm asking why you brought me here.

164
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,600
Of course I know.

165
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,780
From now on, you're going to make new sales using what you have here.

166
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,660
What?

167
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,440
If you choose the materials from here, it won't cost you anything, so the ultimate cost is down.

168
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:08,320
For example, TV-type rice cooker, cooler-type rice cooker, washing machine-type rice cooker.

169
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,380
You can't buy these anywhere.

170
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,660
Will they sell?

171
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,600
Anyway, make and make original electronic products!

172
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,260
That's ridiculous.

173
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,900
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,680
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:20,940
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,060
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,120
Ryo-san, let's go home!

179
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,020
We can't do this anymore!

180
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,360
Idiot!

181
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,760
If you don't catch fish here, you won't sell anymore!

182
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,140
B-But...

183
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,020
Stop talking gibberish and fish!

184
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,040
See!

185
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,120
This is the new costume for Kameari Shopping street.

186
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,060
Wow!

187
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,600
From now on, you'll wear this to attract customers.

188
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,300
Men will definitely be in line!

189
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,360
Are we going to wear it?

190
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,880
Welcome!

191
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,780
Idiot! Who told you to wear it?

192
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,100
It's for the girls at the part-time job!

193
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,900
It's for the girls at the part-time job!

194
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,640
It's almost done.

195
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,700
Are you sure it's going to work?

196
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,020
It's fine. Believe me.

197
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,780
Once it's done, we'll be able to go around the shopping mall.

198
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,260
What the hell is this?

199
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,980
What happened? Why aren't any customers coming?

200
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,460
What happened?

201
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,620
T-Tenjo, this is bad!

202
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,280
What's wrong?

203
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,540
Look at this! The Kameari Shopping Mall is in a terrible state!

204
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,740
What?

205
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,180
I can't believe it! It's so intense!

206
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,280
Welcome!

207
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,460
It's cheap! It's cheap!

208
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,380
All 5,000 yen each!

209
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,560
This is the original, with a refrigerator!

210
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,340
It's a set with a DVD with an electronic range!

211
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,340
It's a great deal!

212
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,320
Ma'am, this is amazing!

213
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,240
The Kameari Shopping Mall with ear cleaning!

214
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,680
We have a washing machine that can wash plates!

215
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,060
We have the cheapest store!

216
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:25,900
Welcome!

217
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,020
The traditional sweets are delicious!

218
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,840
Welcome!

219
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,560
The legendary taiga!

220
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,000
Welcome!

221
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,560
Idiot! It's impossible!

222
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,620
It's cheaper than ours!

223
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:37,700
For unlearning

224
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,180
What are you talking about?

225
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,180
Yes, I didn't say it!

226
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,600
I hope I can remember it well!

227
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:47,980
Welcome!

228
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,520
The Kameari Shopping Mall!

229
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,620
Welcome!

230
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,080
Great!

231
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:54,780
The Kameari Shopping Mall with ear cleaning!

232
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,060
The Kameari Shopping Mall with ear cleaning!

233
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,360
Welcome!

234
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,980
This is the Kameari Shopping Mall!

235
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,540
I'll look further and more EAT!

236
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,060
How did the shopping street that was in danger get so busy?

237
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,600
I want to get to know the secret of that.

238
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,780
Then, let's ask Mr. Ryo-tsu Kankichi who planned this renewal.

239
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,020
Mr. Ryo-tsu, what was the secret of success?

240
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Well, it's a company secret, so I can't answer it.

241
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,720
This time I will tell you a special secret.

242
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,020
That is...

243
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,960
1. A bright smile for people.

244
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
2. A good business effort.

245
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,180
3. A response to everyone's hope.

246
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,180
4. A really cheap item.

247
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,780
5. Always by your side.

248
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,320
You too, let's go to the Kameyari Shopping Street!

249
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,820
Um, this...

250
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,540
He is the candidate for our Kameyari Shopping Street.

251
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,720
He is fighting day and night to protect the peace of the earth and develop the shopping street.

252
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,000
He is fighting day and night to protect the peace of the earth and develop the shopping street.

253
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,300
He is fighting day and night to protect the peace of the earth and develop the shopping street.

254
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,620
I see. So he is the popular local hero.

255
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,580
Exactly.

256
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,480
He is doing different attractions every day so we can't get bored.

257
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,380
Shopping street that make us want to come again and again.

258
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,840
This is my ideal shopping street!

259
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,920
I understand.

260
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,200
With Mr. Ryo-tsu's bold and wonderful idea, Kameyari Shopping Street is reborn.

261
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,040
That's right.

262
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,560
Everyone watching TV,

263
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,200
Kameyari Shopping Street is waiting for you.

264
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,740
Kameyari Shopping Street is waiting for you.

265
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,660
Kameyari Shopping Street is waiting for you.

266
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,620
Kameyari Shopping Street is waiting for you.

267
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,160
Kameyari Shopping Street is waiting for you.

268
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,880
Pramoya Ozaki, your shop's sales are back.

269
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,140
What's going on?

270
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,100
Well, I was a little sick last week...

271
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,560
No need to say.

272
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,980
Pramoya is moving to the next to the public toilet.

273
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,240
W-wait!

274
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,460
This week will be full of sales.

275
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,240
Please give me a little more time...

276
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,240
Wooooaah!

277
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,740
Wagashiya and Sakane are on sale, so they'll be next to the public toilet.

278
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,620
Futonya is in good condition.

279
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,900
Hana and Kamputsuya are moving to the end of street one by one.

280
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,040
Mr. Ryo, this is too much.

281
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,580
That's right, the things we sell are different.

282
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,180
Idiot!

283
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,880
You are the one who make a plan!

284
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,120
If you want to survive, use your head a little bit more.

285
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,000
Okay?

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,140
I understand.

287
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,860
You're so cocky.

288
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,680
You're so generous.

289
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,760
What are you doing?

290
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,720
What's the answer?

291
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,260
Yes, sir!

292
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,760
Now we have a lot of money and a lot of bonuses.

293
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,180
No!

294
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,180
It's terrible!

295
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,320
What? What's wrong?

296
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,020
Come on!

297
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,600
What's wrong?

298
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,040
What's going on?

299
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,100
I don't know.

300
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,840
Why did he suddenly disappear?

301
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,140
Mr. Ryo, I know.

302
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,060
The shopping mall people are...

303
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,760
What?

304
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,020
What?

305
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,920
Well, well, thanks to your daily support,

306
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,000
we're holding a Super-Fukubi-ki.

307
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,040
You can get a 1,000 yen discount

308
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,860
and get a car that you like from Genki-Washizukami.

309
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,380
Genki-Washizukami?

310
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,040
A car that you like?

311
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,780
What are you going to do, Ryo-san?

312
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,800
We have a customer who came back,

313
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,500
but he was taken away again.

314
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,680
You're right.

315
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,920
Mr. Ryo is usually careless.

316
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,380
That's right.

317
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,440
He was in a good mood

318
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,100
because the customer came back.

319
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,440
What?

320
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,660
Is it my fault?

321
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:50,900
Anyway,

322
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,260
we have to think about

323
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:52,360
how to make a bonus

324
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,920
or how to make a bonus.

325
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,200
As soon as you guys got in a pinch,

326
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,040
you suddenly gave me a hand.

327
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,100
I got it.

328
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,740
I'll definitely get the customer back!

329
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:02,940
I'll get the customer back!

330
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,300
What should I do?

331
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,960
Should I run away?

332
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,840
No, I can't.

333
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
If I run away here,

334
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,140
the guy will throw me out.

335
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,260
However,

336
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,900
I don't have any other choice.

337
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,800
I can't prepare

338
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,760
a luxurious product

339
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,540
to compete with the same Fukubi-ki.

340
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,180
In general,

341
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,420
there is no such thing as a normal Fukubi-ki.

342
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,040
Hmm?

343
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,060
This is it!

344
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,160
What's up, Mr. Ryo?

345
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,620
You called everyone.

346
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,280
You guys

347
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,380
want to rebuild this shopping street, right?

348
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,180
Yes.

349
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,100
Well,

350
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,780
you want to make it a shopping street

351
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:52,880
that has a lot of customers

352
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,260
and makes a lot of money, right?

353
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
That's right, but...

354
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,860
Are you prepared

355
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,840
to do anything for that?

356
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,520
What are you talking about?

357
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,500
That's obvious.

358
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,900
All right,

359
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,640
don't forget that word.

360
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,240
This is the next strategy.

361
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,040
What's that?

362
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,920
It's the same as that.

363
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,860
You're so naive.

364
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,520
There's no way

365
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,320
I'm going to make a Fukubi-ki

366
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,160
that can be found anywhere.

367
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,480
What do you mean?

368
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,640
In other words,

369
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,060
this is what I mean.

370
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,140
What?

371
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,620
What?

372
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,320
This is the one.

373
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,460
Isn't it enough?

374
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,040
You see this?

375
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,180
With this lottery machine,

376
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,700
the Raspberry Ghost Game is complete.

377
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,680
Our customers will return immediately.

378
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
But...

379
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,040
With only this...

380
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,420
Right...

381
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,140
After all,

382
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,540
we should decide about the winning item.

383
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,580
You've left me no choice.

384
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,940
I'll let you win

385
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,720
that luxurious prize

386
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,200
that won't let you get lost over there.

387
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,720
Listen closely.

388
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,540
Massage, massage, massage.

389
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,160
Hey!

390
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,040
It ain't a joke.

391
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,820
Who would do such a thing!

392
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,100
You said you'd do anything for it.

393
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,560
I told you so!

394
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,660
You'll keep your promise!

395
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,400
Don't worry! We'll win!

396
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,600
Again!

397
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,340
Hi, Mezamashii Investigation Team!

398
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,920
Today we're at Kameari Shopping Street, where a huge lottery is held.

399
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,280
We're at Kameari Shopping Street, where a huge lottery is held.

400
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,660
Now, I'd like to talk to the general producer, Mr. Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

401
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,820
Mr. Ryo-tsu, you've come up with an amazing idea!

402
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,660
Of course! It's my job to think for the customers!

403
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,080
I see. But I've heard that you just increased the lottery.

404
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:52,920
Don't worry! A huge lottery is important, no matter what you say!

405
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
I've prepared a special prize for you!

406
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,460
And that prize is...

407
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,060
This!

408
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,300
In this lottery, the shopkeeper will receive a ball,

409
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,920
and when the ball comes out, they'll give you all the products of the shop!

410
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,260
I didn't know you had such a big plan!

411
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,240
You're a real man, Mr. Ryo-tsu!

412
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,040
I'll do it when I'm playing the game, Mr. Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

413
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,840
I'll do it when I'm playing the game, Mr. Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

414
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,340
I can't hear you.

415
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,200
Now, let's get started!

416
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,580
The shopkeeper, please enter the lottery machine!

417
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,260
Stop!

418
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,060
I told you to remember!

419
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,600
Now, the Kameari Shopping Street Super Lottery Competition will begin!

420
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,560
Here's the first customer!

421
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,260
Thank you very much!

422
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,920
Please pull the lever!

423
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,760
Okay!

424
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:04,980
Oh, what a shame!

425
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,380
I'll give you a pocket tissue and a discount ticket!

426
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,280
Okay, next customer, please come to the lever!

427
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,380
Congratulations!

428
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,560
Congratulations!

429
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,420
Please take the sashimi!

430
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,980
We still have a lot of products!

431
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,480
Oh, no! The light!

432
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,800
Are you okay?

433
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,180
No! The ramen shop this time!

434
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,320
Don't fall! Do your best!

435
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,440
Damn it! Why do I have to do this?

436
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:40,700
You have to do this!

437
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,680
Oh, I can't believe I'm going to be like Mr. Ryo-san!

438
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,620
That's right! I'll survive after all!

439
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,440
Yes!

440
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,760
Here's the package and discount!

441
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,620
What? You said you'll get all the products at the shop, but you're not coming at all!

442
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,920
I'm sorry!

443
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm afraid they won't come out soon.

444
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,540
What are you thinking?

445
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,540
If no one is coming out, it's like a scam.

446
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,620
Alright, if you're going to do it, I have an idea!

447
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,560
Now is the time for the reverse turn!

448
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,100
Turn to the other side!

449
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,660
Whoa! It's a reverse turn!

450
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,820
Don't fall! Be careful!

451
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,280
Next is the high speed turn!

452
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,940
Turn at full speed!

453
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,460
Turn at full speed!

454
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,880
Stop!

455
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,000
Damn you, Ryo!

456
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,900
You can't beat me!

457
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,980
I'll help you.

458
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,900
Come on.

459
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,180
Come on!

460
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,780
If you're going out alone, you have to trust the customers!

461
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,300
I won't let you get out!

462
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,020
What's wrong?

463
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,080
What's wrong?

464
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,220
This doesn't belong here!

465
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:21,640
What's wrong?

466
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,080
I lost half my time!

467
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,080
Enough!

468
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,200
Next is the reverse turn!

469
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,640
Turn!

470
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,240
Mentally weak!

471
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,280
Don't waste your energy!

472
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,500
I don't want to do it again!

473
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,900
That's right.

474
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,840
Wh... What?

475
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,600
Agh! Run!

476
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,220
Please take a look. The super large generator has collapsed and the Kameari shopping street has become a city of ruins.

477
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,300
That's...

478
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,480
Ryo-san!

479
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,560
What are you doing? Aren't you crazy?

480
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,060
Originally, Ryo-san was thinking strange things.

481
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,440
That's right! That's right! I should have done it normally from the beginning.

482
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,000
What? Is it all my fault? These ignorant people!

483
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,920
Shut up! Securit!

484
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,380
You were doing well until the middle, right?

485
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,300
It doesn't make sense until the middle!

486
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,720
I'll double the money you've earned so far!

487
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,240
I don't like it!

488
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,460
After the rain, like someone is calling me

489
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,560
I walked while looking back

490
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,640
I reached out to my mother

491
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,960
I felt a strange feeling at that time

492
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,180
That's why I tried to walk on the black side of the Akedogai's rail

493
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,340
Everyone was a child at one time

494
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,500
But everyone has forgotten

495
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,380
A politician with a great face

496
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,980
And a blue aunt above their eyes

497
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,360
Turn around and look at that corner

498
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,980
You'll see everyone

499
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,180
Let's go!

500
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,960
There's a Kameari over there

501
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,940
There must be a Kameari

502
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,700
Everyone, come to our town

503
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,900
Let's go!

504
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,080
There's a Kameari over there

505
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,080
There must be a Kameari

506
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,940
Everyone, come to our town

507
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,940
Thank you!

508
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,100
What? You're going to leave me with a new store?

509
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,520
Good! I'll do it!

510
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,260
I'll go to the Kameari!

511
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:27,360
You're so old!

512
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,040
Let's go to my town!

513
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,040
If you don't come, I'll leave!

514
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,060
I'll do it!

515
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,400
Let's go!

516
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,460
Everyone, come to my town!

517
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,260
Let's go, children!

518
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,800
Let's go!

519
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,320
Everyone, come to my town!

520
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,840
Everyone, come to our town!

521
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,580
Let's go!

522
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:50,840
Thank you!
