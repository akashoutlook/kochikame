1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,680
I looked at the sunset floating in the middle of the river

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,460
I kicked a pebble and flew to the end

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,220
I was laughing at the taiko singer who was jogging

5
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:37,860
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can only get angry

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,180
The cityscape that never changes is kinder than the evil

7
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,440
The moon is setting because the crows are crying

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,920
I'm a yakitori hobari

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm a yakitori hobari

10
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,980
I'm a yakitori hobari

11
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,860
I'm a yakitori hobari

12
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:02,880
o

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,820
The sunset falls

14
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,820
Tomorrow will end soon

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,580
But, I'm happy again

16
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,140
I'm relieved because I'm an idiot

17
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,580
Papa is the young captain of the camp

18
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,240
What?

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,560
What?

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,900
Don't be so surprised

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm joking, Tera-i

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,920
Tera-i is an out-door?

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,200
Nakagawa is a newbie

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,800
Camp is a game

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,920
Outdoor is a game

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,520
You can also do auto-camp

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,300
Tera-i seems serious

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,620
Of course I'm serious

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,660
Because I made a promise with the children

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,920
I will send Tera-i to the mountain

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,480
In these mountains, the mobile phone is not connected

32
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,160
I can't play games on TV

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,100
Is it ok?

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,140
Yeah

35
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,300
It's so much fun

36
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,740
I caught so many fishes

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,320
Enjoying camping in nature

38
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,920
It was a family family

39
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,180
The appearance of a parent and child

40
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,440
My friend said,

41
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,620
I'm going to the eggplant campsite with my family

42
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,160
Camp? We're not going anywhere for summer vacation again, are we?

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,460
I guess we should write a diary.

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,980
I don't mind if you write one. I'll do the same.

45
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,120
I'll take you to camp.

46
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,420
Really?

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,140
Let's go to camp and make memories of summer vacation.

48
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,780
Make memories!

49
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,000
Making memories of summer vacation.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,520
Making memories of summer vacation.

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,340
I thought I'd show my father's will to this opportunity and make the kids see it again.

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,760
Mr. Terai, have you ever been to a camp?

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,900
Not at all.

54
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,780
But kids can't show their bad sides, right?

55
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,180
Actually, I was trying to get Ryo to tell me a lot of things.

56
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,580
What's your father's will to see people?

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,980
It's a shame to spoil the children's mood.

58
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,800
Stop it.

59
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,660
Ryo.

60
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,120
Don't be mean.

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,380
You should teach him.

62
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,500
That's right, Senpai.

63
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,240
You want me to give him the knowledge of Outreger I've been teaching for years for free?

64
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm not kidding.

65
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,140
Ryo's knowledge is not about Reger, but about survival.

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,460
It's not good.

67
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,280
It's the result of my blood, sweat, and hunger.

68
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,340
Of course, I'm thinking about it.

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,560
I'm thinking about the life of a sender.

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,120
At the expense of Omi's will, I can't over것

71
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
I can't even think about giving gratitude.

72
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,080
How about you bring my wife's lunch for ten days.

73
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,040
That's the idea.

74
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,220
Of course.

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,500
It's great some time, Ryo.

76
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,100
A lunch console is always a good thing.

77
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,740
Well, you're good, but your lunch is good.

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,360
Then, how about you bring me a dish for ten days?

79
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,120
By the way, do you own a car yet?

80
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,680
My car?

81
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,860
It's a Subaru R2.

82
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,260
You have to be careful.

83
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,260
Your car is over 40 years old.

84
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,580
And it's a K!

85
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,620
It's a lot of luggage.

86
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
Four people in a family...

87
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,820
I don't think it's possible.

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
At least it's a four-wheel drive.

89
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,540
Is it a new car?

90
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,040
If you're a man, buy it!

91
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,800
What?

92
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,720
That's amazing.

93
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:42,960
That's amazing.

94
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,600
Four families.

95
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,400
That's a lot of space.

96
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,120
Yes, the kitchen is big.

97
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,500
There are toilets and showers.

98
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,560
It's cool.

99
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,660
The children will be happy.

100
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,120
The father's shares will rise.

101
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,460
It's a deal.

102
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,600
That's right.

103
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,360
So how much is it?

104
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,360
Yes.

105
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,320
It's 13 million yen at the current discount price.

106
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,780
What?

107
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,240
13 million yen?

108
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
I'm taking a loan for 30 years.

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,540
I'll take it for 30 years.

110
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,260
30 years of loan?

111
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,960
Please wait a moment.

112
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,540
I didn't think we'd be making a 30-year loan for a camp.

113
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,580
I didn't think we'd be making a 30-year loan for a camp.

114
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,180
I didn't think we'd be making a 30-year loan for a camp.

115
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,000
Then give up the auto camp.

116
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,580
If you want to run away, now is the time.

117
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
I'm working hard on this...

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,920
But I have to pay the loan.

119
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,820
But the monthly payment will increase a little.

120
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,380
But if it's a 30-year loan, I'll do my best.

121
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,700
I keep asking for it.

122
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,360
The loan for the life-saving band that collapsed still remains!

123
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,800
Life-saving band?

124
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,540
Ah, the one I named "Your Cruiser"!

125
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,580
It collapsed after riding on the top of the Gansho in the first public show, right?

126
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,100
I can't! I can't buy such a high car after all!

127
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,400
Then, give up auto camping, and have a barbecue in your yard.

128
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

129
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry, but I still have a loan...

130
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,900
Well then, how about the rental car?

131
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,960
What, there's a rental car?!

132
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,680
Sure. This one.

133
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,560
These RVs here are very popular too, and it's called by a very long-term deal.

134
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,140
That sounds nice. My kids must be really happy to have one of this!

135
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,120
Okay! I can take it!

136
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,240
Very boring.

137
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,280
Wait, Ryo-san!

138
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,200
In the end, we have to buy a cheap and cheap family camping set after all!

139
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:39,980
Right!

140
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,700
I don't need it.

141
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,720
The car is rental, but the camping supplies are going to be given out one by one.

142
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,920
I'm going to put them all together.

143
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,020
I'm begging you, Ryo-san.

144
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,240
Then, please pay for dinner.

145
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,940
I see.

146
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,240
Are we really going to camp?

147
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,140
Of course, I'm not lying.

148
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,980
It's a camp!

149
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,880
Write it in the summer vacation diary.

150
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,740
I will write it.

151
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,080
Now, you two, go take a bath.

152
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,080
Yes!

153
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,180
Now, even if the kids go up from the bath, don't let them in this room.

154
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,580
What are you going to do?

155
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,880
It's a rehearsal.

156
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,940
Apparently, there are many fathers who go to the campsite and then go to bed.

157
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,820
Ryo-san, how about you?

158
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,940
I'll take care of Yamamori.

159
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,640
Yes, yes.

160
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,340
But, if it's so big, I can't go home.

161
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,500
Ryo-san, please.

162
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,700
Thank you.

163
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,760
There's a lot of miso soup, so I'll take it.

164
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,380
I see.

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,640
If I said that I would treat everyone to dinner in the world,

166
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,400
they would say that I could earn one seat with the high-class kappo.

167
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,960
I often say that I would pay three times more for a large serving of rice.

168
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,400
It's still the same.

169
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,780
I thought it would be more difficult to set up a tent,

170
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,820
but recently it's so easy that I'm surprised.

171
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,780
That's good, Terai-san.

172
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,280
I didn't expect to be taken care of by Ryo-san.

173
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,880
You're so naive.

174
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
The inside of the house and the camp site are different.

175
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,880
If you are careless, you will be in trouble.

176
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,560
I know.

177
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,640
I'm going to try fishing with my sons.

178
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,960
I'll fish and fish and fish.

179
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,160
I'm going to do it.

180
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm going to catch fish just by watching the fishing video.

181
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,380
I want to be happy.

182
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,560
There are no tuna or tuna in the river.

183
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,420
I know.

184
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,820
I'll grill the fish I caught with salt and eat it with my children.

185
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,040
I'll grill the fish I caught with salt and eat it with my children.

186
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,720
I'll grill the fish I caught with salt and eat it with my children.

187
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,520
It must be delicious.

188
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,080
Terai-san is a good father.

189
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,520
I'm sorry to stab you in the water,

190
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,020
but it may rain in the afternoon around the camp site where Terai-san goes.

191
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,520
It may be a storm.

192
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,980
Oh, my God.

193
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,300
I'm sorry, Terai.

194
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,260
It's okay.

195
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,960
The weather forecast I saw this morning said that the chance of a flood was 50% and that the storm could be stopped.

196
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,740
Is it really okay?

197
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:04,920
I wonder if it's okay.

198
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,500
What do you think, Senpai?

199
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,680
Leave it alone.

200
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,900
I don't know if it's a good sign.

201
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,980
Ryo-chan, don't say that.

202
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,980
It's okay.

203
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,120
Don't worry because the storm will blow it away with its spirit.

204
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,200
That's it.

205
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,680
It's a camp.

206
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,380
It's a camp.

207
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,160
I'm happy.

208
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,020
It's a camp.

209
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,040
It's a camp.

210
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,200
I'm okay?

211
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,300
Don't talk to me now.

212
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,680
We'll talk in the next service area for 15 minutes.

213
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,340
I've spent a lot of time on taking care of my cómo.

214
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,620
If we don't move on according to our schedule, our plans won't get results.

215
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,420
All right.

216
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,380
We need to follow the schedule.

217
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:54,260
It's a camp.

218
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm happy.

219
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,240
I'm thirsty.

220
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,620
How's the tea?

221
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,440
The next service area will serve tea.

222
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,460
Please like or subscribe!

223
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,180
Alright, it's finished!

224
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,700
Wow!

225
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,360
You did great, Dad!

226
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,440
You bet I did!

227
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,940
I should have practice more, too.

228
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,720
Sssh.

229
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,340
The End

230
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:32,920
Daddy, I'm hungry.

231
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,680
Then, let's go fishing for the dinner.

232
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,280
What? Are we going now?

233
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,920
I'm already tired.

234
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,560
Tired? You just came here.

235
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,080
Besides, you're doing everything on your own at the camp.

236
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,060
Let's go, Kenji and Koji.

237
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,640
Yes.

238
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,760
Be careful.

239
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,940
Damn, I taught you so hard, but you're going in a different direction.

240
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,460
Mr. Ryoichi?

241
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,380
Did you follow me because you were worried about the temple?

242
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,420
Daddy, I'm going to catch it.

243
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,460
It's dangerous to slip, so watch me catch it from behind.

244
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,780
I don't mind just curry rice.

245
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,620
Daddy, can you really catch it?

246
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,760
Of course.

247
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,600
I trained myself so hard to catch it today.

248
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,180
I'll catch it for sure.

249
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,580
Here it is.

250
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,980
Daddy, you're amazing.

251
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,180
I'm going to catch it, too.

252
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,920
Me, too.

253
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,920
Okay. I'm going to catch it.

254
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:49,940
Yes.

255
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,760
I feel it now.

256
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,280
The...the fishing rod...

257
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,660
I...the fishing rod...

258
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
It can't be helped.

259
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,500
I'll get it for you.

260
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,560
Hold it, please.

261
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,340
Okay.

262
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,820
Kenji, you're going to catch it, okay?

263
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,620
Yes, Daddy. Be careful, too.

264
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,620
Okay, it didn't come out.

265
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,260
What?

266
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:20,960
It's shallow.

267
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:30,180
Phew, you saved me!

268
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,640
Oh, I did it! I caught another one!

269
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,060
Papa, you're amazing!

270
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,980
I did it! I caught it with my rod!

271
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,820
Let's say Koji caught this one!

272
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,360
Yes! I caught it! I caught it!

273
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,280
It's shallow! It's so shallow!

274
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,600
I caught it with my rod.

275
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,080
You didn't notice it yet.

276
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,940
You should catch it as soon as possible.

277
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,300
You're amazing, Papa! You're good at fishing!

278
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,100
It seems so.

279
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Papa, I got a pull!

280
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,340
All right, pull the line slowly.

281
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh, Papa, me too!

282
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,980
Oh, that's a lot today!

283
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,680
I'll do my best too!

284
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
Look, look, Papa! I caught another one!

285
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,440
Wow, this is the tenth one!

286
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,840
All right!

287
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,780
I caught a big one today!

288
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,560
I caught it!

289
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,640
Papa, you caught a lot, didn't you?

290
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,920
Yes! Let's stop fishing and go back to the tent.

291
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,600
Mama will be surprised when she sees this!

292
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,400
That's right! There's a lot of fish!

293
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,460
They're going to fish so hard.

294
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,960
Are they going to do something at the fish shop?

295
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,940
But the fish we caught are also very big.

296
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,980
This is the headquarters.

297
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,800
Ryo, can you hear me?

298
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,980
Yes, this is the river fishing area.

299
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,620
Over!

300
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,740
Senpai, Bulba, thank you for your hard work.

301
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,640
It's really hard!

302
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,260
I caught all the fish I caught.

303
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
Go back quickly and have some coffee.

304
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,920
Roger!

305
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,980
It seems that the weather will be just right for this.

306
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,520
I wonder if the new year of the Terai Papa has won the storm.

307
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,860
That's right. Oh, the children have come back!

308
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,420
Mama, we caught a lot of fish!

309
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,640
Isn't that great?

310
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,100
Senpai, the children of the Terai-san,

311
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,460
we're very happy!

312
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,760
Fish are good for the long haul.

313
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,660
Me too.

314
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,400
It's strange, I can't see the Terai-san.

315
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,060
Ah, there he is!

316
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,300
I wonder what he's doing.

317
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,100
Ryo-chan, come back quickly.

318
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,700
The Terai-san has started something again.

319
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,320
What is this?

320
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,380
It's a stove.

321
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,780
You cook the rice here.

322
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,800
The rice cooked in the stove is very delicious.

323
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:39,980
I'm confident.

324
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,920
All that's left is to light the fire on the firewood.

325
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,340
I'm confident.

326
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,820
Now, I'm ready.

327
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,840
Now, I'm ready.

328
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,340
All I have to do is cook with the stove.

329
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,940
Oh, you're going to fall.

330
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,040
Are you okay?

331
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,580
I'm okay.

332
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,020
I'm about to light the fire.

333
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,620
I'm about to light the fire.

334
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,640
It's broken!

335
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,680
It's broken!

336
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,640
Mama, I'm hungry!

337
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,760
W-wait a minute!

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,740
Papa is making a stove right now.

339
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,780
Mama, I'm hungry!

340
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,840
Oh, that's not good.

341
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,100
It's not a stove, so you have to open the direction of the wind and go around the rest of the way.

342
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,020
Oh, I can't look at it.

343
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,600
At this rate, when will we be able to eat?

344
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,920
Can you make it with a stove?

345
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,420
It's a basic basic.

346
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,640
Oh, the children are eating grass.

347
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:28,960
Oh, my God!

348
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,040
Look, over there, my wife is making cup ramen.

349
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,260
What are you going to do, Terai?

350
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,500
The Terai-san is suddenly trying to light the fire on the firewood.

351
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:37,880
I'm trying to light it.

352
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,920
Can you light it?

353
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,860
I can't.

354
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,780
Terai, didn't you buy a solid fuel?

355
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,280
No, I should have brought a solid fuel and charcoal.

356
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,360
Then why don't you use it?

357
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,720
I've been up and down and forgotten.

358
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,740
I'm sure.

359
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,360
I was persistent about buying a cartridge gas burner that is easy to handle even for beginners.

360
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,120
But the Terai guy said, "It's impossible for beginners, so make it a stove."

361
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,620
But I'm going to camp, so I'll make a stove with a stove made of stone.

362
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,500
I want to show the children where to light the firewood.

363
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,980
Even if it looks like that, it's more stubborn than Chief Ohara.

364
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,940
It's hard.

365
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,900
What?

366
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,960
What's wrong?

367
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,360
It seems that gasoline and charcoal were put in the furnace together.

368
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,700
That idiot has a degree in ad-lib.

369
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,840
It's an SOS signal from the wife.

370
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,900
Where is the fire extinguisher?

371
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,060
I have to call number 119.

372
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,680
Wait, I'm sure this car is also a hose.

373
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,960
I'm sorry.

374
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,120
I didn't mean to put you all in danger.

375
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,820
I'm just a child.

376
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,020
You, be strong.

377
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,500
Hurry up and light the firewood.

378
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

379
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,540
As it is, move up 30 degrees.

380
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,540
OK.

381
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,720
OK, pump OK.

382
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,800
Roger.

383
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,420
Mr. Golub, ready.

384
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:01,980
Roger.

385
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,860
Maximum output, fire.

386
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:06,980
Honey.

387
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,020
It's raining.

388
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,680
It's disappearing.

389
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,580
Senior, it's OK.

390
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,960
Please pull the pump up.

391
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,540
Roger.

392
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,460
No.

393
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,820
Mr. Golub, the operation is over.

394
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,040
Go.

395
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,800
The ingredients are...

396
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,040
I'm almost done.

397
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,140
Let's eat cup ramen, honey.

398
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,320
I love cup ramen.

399
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,620
Don't you, Koji?

400
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,340
Yes.

401
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,440
I didn't want to eat curry so much.

402
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:45,880
Honey.

403
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:46,860
Papa.

404
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,060
The fish I caught are gone.

405
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,600
I'm such a hopeless, unreliable father.

406
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,940
Mr. Terae is moaning.

407
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,500
Poor thing.

408
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,580
I'm just thankful that I didn't get a mountain bite.

409
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,220
I'm just thankful that I didn't get a mountain bite.

410
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,620
It smells good like curry.

411
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,400
I also made curry for dinner.

412
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,020
Oh, curry.

413
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,380
Wow, looks delicious.

414
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,220
That's the same pot as Mr. Terae's.

415
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,060
It's a recommendation from Ryo.

416
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,340
I was sold one too.

417
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,580
Are you making a fortune by selling a pot that was purchased at a low price somewhere else?

418
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,780
Don't say anything bad about it.

419
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,280
That's right.

420
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,560
I thought of something good.

421
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,700
What?

422
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,420
What is it?

423
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,900
It's called "The Animal of the Forest."

424
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,100
Honey, let's eat cup ramen.

425
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,680
Yes.

426
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,800
What is it?

427
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,920
A bear!

428
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,040
A gorilla!

429
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,940
No, this is my home.

430
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,680
Hey!

431
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,920
Don't let my family touch my finger!

432
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,240
I'm going to eat you!

433
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm going to eat you!

434
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,500
Honey, run away!

435
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,720
The animal's stomach is bad.

436
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,240
If you can eat it, try it!

437
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:06,900
Dad!

438
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,300
Honey, stop it!

439
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,780
Mr. Terae's wife.

440
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,580
Dad!

441
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Ms. Reiko!

442
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,040
It's curry.

443
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,380
Everyone, please eat it.

444
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,260
Well, maybe that too.

445
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,260
Yes.

446
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,840
Thank you.

447
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,860
I'll be happy to eat it.

448
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,820
I did it!

449
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:26,920
I did it!

450
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,580
I did it!

451
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,200
Dad!

452
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,480
Dorya!

453
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,040
Ouch!

454
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,560
It's gone!

455
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:38,760
It's gone!

456
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,240
Mr. Volvo.

457
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,180
Curry's replacement has succeeded.

458
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,040
Hey!

459
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,860
Mr. Volvo.

460
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,060
I'm bleeding.

461
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,480
I won!

462
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,680
To the gorilla and the bear!

463
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,700
I won!

464
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,140
To the gorilla and the bear!

465
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:54,620
Dad!

466
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,380
Dad!

467
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:56,800
Dad!

468
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,640
Good, you're safe!

469
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,700
Where's mom?

470
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,980
Over there.

471
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,400
Here you go.

472
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,700
It's curry!

473
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,860
I got have a cold, and I'm hungry.

474
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,300
Eh?

475
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,740
I remember the curry's

476
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,360
that had just...

477
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,880
Oh?

478
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,620
Look.

479
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,060
The star that has the most stars.

480
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,440
Wow!

481
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,880
... Really?

482
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,400
Wow, the star with the most stars!

483
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,020
Damn, Terai really hit it!

484
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,620
It's done.

485
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,280
Thanks to Terai, dinner is instant.

486
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,780
Try it. It's a military meal, but you can eat a lot.

487
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,480
It seems that Terai and the others are also calm.

488
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,400
How is it? I'm glad I came to the camp.

489
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,700
Yeah.

490
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,000
Dad, Mom, thank you.

491
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,900
No, it's not that much.

492
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,860
Dad, it's getting red.

493
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,100
That's not true.

494
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,520
I have nothing to forget.

495
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,060
Okay, let's go.

496
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,920
Dad, I want to play more.

497
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,620
The road will be jammed if you get late, and you have to return the car by 5 p.m.

498
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,760
So get on the car quickly.

499
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,520
Yes.

500
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,560
Mom, will you look over there?

501
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,440
Yes.

502
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,440
You're only 5 cm away.

503
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,580
What?

504
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,980
Damn it.

505
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,500
Your tires are about to fall.

506
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,260
It's okay.

507
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,100
You have to go back once.

508
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,260
I know.

509
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,160
It's okay.

510
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,020
Watch out!

511
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,080
Hey!

512
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,000
Protector!

513
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,260
You're there, too!

514
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,880
What?

515
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,560
Th-that is...

516
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:07,800
Ryo!

517
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,440
Ryo!

518
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,280
Everyone!

519
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,000
They found us.

520
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,300
Well, it's very troublesome.

521
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,020
I recommend you to carry it on this way.

522
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,120
I'll take you to the north, so be quiet!

523
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,800
Thank you, Ryo! I'm glad you came by!

524
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,340
Wow! They're flying!

525
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,220
They didn't find out about yesterday.

526
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,240
I'd rather let them know everything.

527
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,100
Let's hurry! The car will be back by 5 o'clock.

528
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,980
The Diary of the Children

529
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,740
Yes. The Diary of the Children's summer vacation is back.

530
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,060
Is there a problem?

531
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,560
It's about fishing a lot of fish.

532
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,940
The fire went out in the middle of the stove.

533
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,660
The Sigma and the Gorilla were thrown away.

534
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,620
The helicopter was hit by a bell.

535
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
It's a fun Diary of the Children, isn't it?

536
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,080
It's a fun Diary of the Children, isn't it?

537
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,760
But look at this.

538
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,700
The teacher commented, "Let's stop lying!"

539
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,600
It's true that all the episodes are fake.

540
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
But they're all true.

541
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,060
That's right. At least we did the last episode of the car.

542
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,860
That's right. But the children are sorry that we wrote it as a lie.

543
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,840
Well, Terai, how about this next?

544
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,840
What?

545
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,780
I'll write a Diary of the Children's summer vacation.

546
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,760
I'll become Santa and bring the Sola and the Toecai to that summer vacation.

I play the tunnel every day.

When I run and escape, I take a picture.

That makes me so happy.

"Welcome home to my town!"

574
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,740
And certainly...

575
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,200
I just have to keep working.

Chief, do you want to go golfing?

588

Then leave it to me

589
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,000
I'll let you play real golf

590
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,180
Play with your life in the nature

591
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,660
This is golf, isn't it?

592

Oh, Chief, it's dangerous
