1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,180
When you're watching TV, keep your room bright and keep an eye out for enemies.

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,960
Those who have no money, come to me!

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,140
I don't have any, but I'm worried.

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:32,080
See the blue sky and white clouds

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,180
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

6
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,980
Do you understand? I understand, I understand

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,760
If you understand, come to me quietly

8
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,620
I'm sure there is a turtle there

9
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,120
There must be a turtle

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,220
It's autumn

11
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,020
Hey Ebisu

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,420
Oh

13
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,620
It's been a long time since I've seen Ebisu

14
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,480
Yotsu senpai

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,680
Why are you laughing?

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,860
Is there something good?

17
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,700
Actually, I'm currently on leave of absence

18
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,260
What?

19
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,760
I was so depressed that I wondered what to do

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,340
Don't be depressed while laughing

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,700
I'm sorry

22
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,780
You're still laughing as usual

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,820
Stop it

24
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,940
By the way, I said I quit the police

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,880
Didn't you get scouted by the special police department after that?

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,700
So it was like this

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,160
You don't have to cry

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,920
Guys!

29
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,060
What are you doing?

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,820
Yeah

31
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,140
Don't cry

32
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,620
It's the way that I am

33
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,140
De persone

34
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,800
Did you make a great deal of money last year?

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,080
Hey, I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,060
I'm sure you're going to come out, too.

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,720
Hey, I'm not going to be able to get out, either.

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,580
Hey, I'm not going to be able to get out, either.

39
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,920
There's a cat and a cat.

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,120
There's a cat and a cat.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,540
There's a cat and a cat.

42
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,420
There's a cat and a cat.

43
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,740
There's a cat and a cat.

44
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:30,800
There's a cat and a cat.

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,260
There's a cat and a cat.

46
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,020
There's a cat and a cat.

47
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,720
There's a cat and a cat.

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:32,900
There's a cat and a cat.

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,780
There's a cat and a cat.

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,380
There's a cat and a cat.

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,140
There's a cat and a cat.

52
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,500
There's a cat and a cat.

53
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,040
Hey, you're not laughing, either!

54
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,980
But he's a model!

55
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,340
He's being laughed at by his host!

56
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:55,920
Now!

57
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,600
I, Kai Pandeka, am back!

58
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,960
You did well, Owarai Deka.

59
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,240
Yes!

60
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,100
You're not Owarai Deka.

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:15,640
You're not Owarai Deka.

62
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:15,760
That's a pretty good name!

63
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,340
I was quite fond of your name.

64
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,240
So, you didn't think you could quit.

65
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,640
It's ok if I quit at the scene.

66
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:24,780
It's ok if I quit at the scene.

67
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,400
What?

68
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,900
I have to keep in touch with those insiders every day.

69
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,400
I have to keep in touch with those insiders every day.

70
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,460
I have to keep in touch with those insiders every day.

71
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,180
I wash my face great every day,

72
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,600
and my belly button shrinks too much,

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,660
and then I have to go to the hospital again and again.

74
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,400
and then I have to go to the hospital again and again.

75
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,600
and then I have to go to the hospital again and again.

76
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,260
No, you can't.

77
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,760
I don't wanna eat any of your food.

78
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:44,940
You can't.

79
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,060
Oh, Senpai, this is my house. Would you like to have some tea?

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,040
What? The original Ebisu Shrine?

81
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,940
Your house was a shrine?

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,740
Yes! It was built by Tokugawa Ieyasu,

83
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
and it's a shrine that the Ebisu family protected for generations.

84
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,340
Huh?

85
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,140
Whoa! What's this huge statue?

86
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,220
What statue?

87
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,100
These are all statues of Lord Ebisu.

88
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,040
They're a collection that our ancestors collected from time to time.

89
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,960
Some of them are designated as important cultural relics,

90
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,980
but there are also some that aren't.

91
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,640
The big gold one in the middle?

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,640
That's my grandfather's, but it's a Mecchi.

93
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,380
Huh?

94
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,820
I'll go get some tea.

95
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,880
Oh, sorry about that.

96
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,980
Huh? This is the Mecchi.

97
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,620
So which one is the important cultural relic-type Lord Ebisu?

98
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,460
Hmm...

99
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,360
Oh, this one?

100
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,460
Oh?

101
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,300
He seems chubby, but the look on his face says he's not one.

102
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,040
He seems like he'll show a turn of bench cabin again…

103
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,080
Ah! Ah! A-a-a-a...

104
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,680
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a--

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,520
It—it—it's so bad.

106
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,760
Oh no, this is bad.

107
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,120
I guess I'll have to take it back for repair.

108
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,920
Huh?

109
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,560
This is all that's left.

110
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,280
We'll need to kill them.

111
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,840
I guess he won't notice anyway.

112
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,660
Senpai!

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,160
Huh?

114
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,960
What are you doing?

115
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,360
No, no, no.

116
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,880
Ebisu-sama is a god who calls good fortune, right?

117
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,740
I was trying to get some help from you, so I was just doing my best.

118
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,820
Haha, you did?

119
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,720
You even stepped on the god, but you still got what you wanted.

120
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,520
Hahaha...

121
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,840
Hey, don't laugh!

122
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,940
S-sorry, senpai.

123
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,560
I'll have some tea.

124
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,300
Ah, sorry.

125
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,400
I just remembered some work.

126
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,980
I'm going home.

127
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,900
What?

128
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,120
Senpai is working?

129
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,720
Hahaha...

130
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,180
That's so funny!

131
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,600
Hahaha...

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,140
Let's go home quietly for today.

133
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,020
Let's see...

134
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,080
Like this...

135
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,560
I guess I can fool him somehow.

136
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,260
I just need to leave him alone.

137
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,420
Huh?

138
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,820
W-what's with that crowd?

139
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,520
What's going on?

140
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,720
What happened?

141
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,800
It seems that Ebisu-sama's statue has been stolen.

142
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,580
What?

143
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,680
Ryotsu-senpai!

144
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,180
Giku!

145
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,920
Senpai!

146
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,440
No, I didn't steal it!

147
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,320
Huh?

148
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,060
Hahahaha, what are you talking about?

149
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,460
There's no way you can steal 100 statues of Ebisu-sama by yourself, right?

150
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,240
Hahaha, I don't want to do this anymore.

151
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,540
What, did you steal that whole thing?

152
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,960
Yes, I did but I lost it.

153
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,380
That's so funny!

154
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm sorry!

155
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,060
Hahaha...

156
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,440
Well, for now, I won't tell you about the statue I broke.

157
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,460
That was also a disaster for Ebisu-san.

158
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
But it's strange.

159
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,460
Hmm...

160
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,900
There was a safe nearby,

161
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,500
but it wasn't there at all.

162
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,220
Then, the only statue that was stolen was the Ebisu statue?

163
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,380
That's true, it's strange.

164
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,360
The culprit is a thief who specializes in statues and art.

165
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,580
Hmm...

166
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,220
Oh?

167
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,640
The stolen statue of Ebisu-sama seems to have been found at the time of the fire.

168
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,900
What did you say?

169
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,740
The stolen statue of Ebisu-sama seems to have been found at the time of the fire.

170
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,200
The stolen statue of Ebisu-sama seems to have been found at the time of the fire.

171
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,400
What is it?

172
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,720
Hahaha, I'm not mistaken!

173
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,880
They are all my statues of Ebisu-sama!

174
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,220
Hmm, I don't understand at all.

175
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,200
There are millions of pure gold statues and important statues inside.

176
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,780
There are also things like cultural relics.

177
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,000
Why did the culprit throw them away?

178
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,100
Well, more than that,

179
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,520
Senpai, why do you have bananas?

180
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,080
I was eating them on the way.

181
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:50,820
Oh?

182
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,180
What's wrong, Reiko-san?

183
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,220
Look at this.

184
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,780
There's a hole in it.

185
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:56,900
What?

186
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,900
What did you say?

187
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,520
It's true.

188
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,280
Everything is carved and there's a hole in it.

189
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,980
What does this mean?

190
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,020
Haha, what is it?

191
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,620
It's strange.

192
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,440
Hmm.

193
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,780
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

194
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,080
Hmm...

195
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,440
I feel like I'm being watched by someone.

196
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,000
I guess it's just my imagination.

197
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,600
What?

198
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,360
Hmm...

199
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,300
What's up?

200
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,780
I'm so glad to have an important Ebisu-sama back.

201
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,580
That man is so careless!

202
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,980
Oh no!

203
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,860
I should have just left it in the bush.

204
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,180
What's this?

205
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
I found it!

206
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,460
Oh, this is an old map.

207
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,620
What is it?

208
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,980
"When the water of the waterfall disappears, the key to the Uraedo Castle will not be opened."

209
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,140
What is this?

210
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,180
How is it, Nakagawa?

211
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,920
I have no idea.

212
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,680
When the water of the waterfall disappears, is it a metaphor?

213
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,200
Is there a time when the water of the waterfall disappears?

214
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,560
Besides, what is the Uraedo Castle?

215
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,540
Do you know anything about it?

216
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,560
I don't know.

217
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,560
I've never heard of it.

218
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,160
I see.

219
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,520
If it's Nakagawa or Reiko, do you know anything about it?

220
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,600
I thought I knew something about it.

221
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,020
Then, why don't you ask Mr. Daemon, the fourth chapter?

222
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,240
Oh, that's a good idea.

223
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,740
Mr. Daemon is famous as a common historian, so he might know something.

224
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,600
This is a great discovery!

225
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,980
Don't make a loud voice all of a sudden.

226
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,160
What is a great discovery?

227
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,840
This is a drawing of Ieyasu.

228
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,060
What?

229
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,440
Look.

230
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,400
The letters and faces are Ieyasu's.

231
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,500
No way.

232
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,040
It's true.

233
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,820
There is a picture of Ieyasu's letter to his vassal.

234
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,440
It's exactly the same as the face of Ieyasu.

235
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,680
Look.

236
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,340
Which one?

237
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,140
Hey, isn't this a photograph of Haruka Iyama?

238
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,080
What?

239
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,680
I...I mistook it.

240
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,100
This is it.

241
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,880
Don't put it together.

242
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:27,640
Look.

243
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,380
It's exactly the same.

244
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,840
No way.

245
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,260
This is for sure the drawing of Ieyasu himself.

246
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,160
By the way, what is in this map was the statue of Lord Ebisu.

247
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,300
The original Ebisu Shrine which kept this is the only correct Shrine built by Ieyasu.

248
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,940
I see.

249
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,140
Yeah.

250
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,300
This might be a treasure map.

251
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,380
What? A treasure?

252
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,880
This is my theory.

253
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,920
Ieyasu defeated Shizuoka in the battle of Sekigahara,

254
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,300
After the battle of Hara, you also know that the winter and summer people of Osaka destroyed the Toyotomi family.

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,540
I've seen it in the movie and the drama.

256
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,000
So Ieyasu secretly carried his treasure from Edo Castle.

257
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,840
Wait wait wait! Could it be...

258
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,320
Tokugawa's manatee that Shigesato Itoi was looking for on TV?

259
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,580
Probably.

260
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,820
So how much do you think it is?

261
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,040
Right.

262
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,240
It's a military fund that will take back the country.

263
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,520
So when you calculate that amount,

264
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,580
it could be about one trillion yen.

265
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,780
One trillion yen?

266
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,980
One trillion yen per day?

267
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,400
5 yen!?

268
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,580
Where on earth is that hidden?

269
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,640
It's not just this map.

270
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,260
Maybe there are several maps, and they're not all in one.

271
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,280
The treasure must be sleeping here.

272
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,740
It's not that simple.

273
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,540
If it's like that, it's hard for Sato Ito and Shige Sato.

274
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,580
What are you doing?

275
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,200
Hand over that map and the Ebisu statue.

276
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,440
If you hand it over, I'll save your life.

277
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,100
What?

278
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,620
Who's going to hand it over, you idiot?

279
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,160
Yamuoe, it seems you have no choice but to take it with force.

280
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,100
Hand it over quietly.

281
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,000
You're so naive.

282
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,720
You bastard!

283
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,040
What?

284
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,560
You bastard!

285
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,060
What's this?

286
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,620
What?

287
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,240
If you think it's a history book, it's all idol photo books.

288
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,680
Stop it!

289
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,720
It's my collection!

290
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,860
What are you looking at?

291
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,180
Hurry up and do it!

292
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,240
Stop it!

293
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,580
Stop it!

294
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,280
Stop it!

295
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,300
Stop it!

296
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,380
It's a photo book I worked hard to collect!

297
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,380
That's...

298
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,920
Stop it!

299
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,660
It's a photo book I worked hard to collect!

300
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:12,720
It's a premium product.

301
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,260
This is...

302
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,340
That's...

303
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,680
That's...

304
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,520
It's so nice!

305
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,000
It's so nice!

306
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,820
Bastard!

307
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,560
Go after them!

308
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,180
Go after them!

309
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,860
One trillion yen goes to me!

310
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,100
Yes!

311
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,200
Yes!

312
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,400
It's the biggest!

313
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:35,620
It's the biggest!

314
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,680
A-A lot...

315
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,780
Hey, he looks like a ninja.

316
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,380
As Sasuke-bei said, he's a tough opponent.

317
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,740
Yes.

318
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,440
Listen, collect his data immediately.

319
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,160
Understood.

320
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,240
One... One trillion yen?!

321
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,500
Is that money really being buried?

322
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,640
There's no doubt about it.

323
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,860
The mysterious ninja corps is aiming for the buried gold.

324
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,340
They're aiming for their lives.

325
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,180
But how are we going to find this map and Lord Ebisu?

326
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,400
Don't worry. I'm sure of it.

327
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,180
We'll start action tomorrow.

328
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,220
Please wait a minute, senpai.

329
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,040
What?

330
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,420
What are you going to do about your work?

331
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,660
Idiot!

332
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,760
You're scared of the money, so you're looking for the buried gold?!

333
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,120
No way...

334
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,720
The day you succeed,

335
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,480
you'll get 10 billion yen.

336
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,280
One trillion yen each.

337
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,820
Huh?

338
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Even if you say that,

339
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,200
the amount is too big to be noticed.

340
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,280
Oh, come on.

341
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,380
You're all so poor.

342
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,180
Listen.

343
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,820
If you have one trillion yen,

344
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,740
you can buy a whole company that makes your favorite documentaries.

345
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,300
What?

346
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,360
You can be the president right away.

347
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,600
You can rewrite the scenario of the documentaries as you like.

348
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,260
You can do this and that with Saori.

349
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,320
What?

350
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,480
You can do this and that with Saori.

351
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,120
Saori?!

352
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:03,980
These things are...

353
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,200
Volvo.

354
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,880
Take half a trillion yen to Captain Buck.

355
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,700
Then, your marriage with Jody can be immediately accepted.

356
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,920
What?

357
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,080
If that's the case,

358
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,880
you can do this and that with Jody every night!

359
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,720
Things like this and that with Jody?

360
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,780
Oh, no!

361
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,440
Urgh!

362
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,720
-Honda. -What?

363
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,740
You can buy a lot of expensive bikes like Do-Cutty and Ben-Bay you've always wanted.

364
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,320
Really? That's amazing.

365
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,900
Senpai, what kind of things do I have?

366
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,400
You'll figure it out yourself.

367
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,660
I knew it.

368
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:57,920
You're so smart.

369
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,040
Anyway, you can say goodbye to your everyday work.

370
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,460
You'll do it with me, right?

371
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,800
Why are you dressed like that?

372
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,780
The enemy is a ninja, so this is a ninja team.

373
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,980
There's something I want to ask you.

374
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,540
What is it?

375
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,800
Are there any other shrines with a temple like this?

376
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,580
What?

377
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,780
Yes. There are six other shrines in Kanto, such as the Ganso Banzaiten Shrine and the Ganso Fukurokuju Shrine.

378
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,780
Do you know where they are?

379
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,240
Yes, I know.

380
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,800
These are the seven shrines that include my house.

381
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,060
The closest one is here.

382
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,480
Here.

383
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,060
Ganso Banzaiten Shrine.

384
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,020
Let's go.

385
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,820
No need to go there.

386
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,260
What are you?

387
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,020
I'm Haruka Bente, the only daughter of the Ganso Banzaiten Shrine.

388
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:04,980
What?

389
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,760
Nice to meet you.

390
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,780
I'm Haruka Bente, the only daughter of the Ganso Banzaiten Shrine.

391
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,380
You're quite the type.

392
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,880
I'm Haruka Bente, the only daughter of the Ganso Banzaiten Shrine.

393
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,340
What's that?

394
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,100
Senpai, what's this?

395
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,780
Can you show me that?

396
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,580
Sure.

397
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,580
It looks like the statue of Lord Ebisu.

398
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,100
There's a hole in there.

399
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,100
There's a hole in there.

400
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,260
There's no hole in there.

401
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,840
Hey, didn't you find an old map in here?

402
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Yeah, but I couldn't get it.

403
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,200
Yeah, but I couldn't get it.

404
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,060
Oh, I knew it.

405
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:41,860
Show me.

406
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,400
You're the type.

407
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,140
Oh, it has the same face.

408
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,560
What?

409
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,820
When the seven shrines are gathered, the door to the back of the Edo Castle will open.

410
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,300
The back of the Edo Castle again?

411
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,140
Yes.

412
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,020
What's that?

413
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,080
It has nothing to do with you.

414
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,220
Don't put your head in there.

415
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,140
You're already done.

416
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,440
You can go home.

417
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,460
What?

418
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,100
Go home now.

419
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,740
Sh! Sh!

420
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,240
Yes, yes, I got it.

421
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,780
Did that cute girl go to the Ganso Banzaiten Shrine?

422
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,180
Well, I guess she did.

423
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,280
Oh, did Haruka go there?

424
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,460
Yes.

425
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,380
Hey, can you lend me this Bente and the map for a while?

426
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:23,720
No.

427
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:24,800
Huh?

428
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,380
It's unfair to lock Tokugawa Ieyasu's buried gold alone.

429
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,040
I don't know.

430
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,200
Why do you know?

431
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,480
There's the face of the real Ieyasu, so if you think about it, anyone can understand.

432
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,740
I see.

433
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,380
I found the map in this a week ago and looked into it.

434
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,620
You're so smart.

435
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,360
Maybe the uncles have the same map and know it.

436
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,100
I'm a lucky person, so I thought there were six more.

437
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,880
Well, you've gone too far.

438
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,840
I thought so, so I came here.

439
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,880
Hey, I want to be a friend.

440
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,420
Please.

441
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,340
I can't help it.

442
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,680
I'm a little short on money, but I think it's better to join hands at this time.

443
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,920
Are you all right?

444
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,220
Yes.

445
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,420
I did it!

446
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,600
Now, let's go to the next Ganso Bishamonten Shrine.

447
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,300
Yes, yes.

448
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,500
Hey, hey.

449
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,500
She's a bad girl.

450
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,020
Let's go!

451
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:29,940
What?

452
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,960
Were you stolen?

453
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,080
I was forced to go to Ichidan, where I saw a suspicious ninja three days ago.

454
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,920
So I was taken to the Bishamonten Shrine in front of you.

455
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,320
It's them.

456
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,580
They're the ones who started it.

457
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,000
Do you know them?

458
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,900
I was about to be taken to Ebisu-sama, too.

459
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,260
I see.

460
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,440
It can't be helped.

461
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,600
Then let's go to the next Ganso Bishamonten Shrine.

462
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,120
That's a waste of time.

463
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,020
In the Shrine where the seven-worshipped people worship,

464
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,020
other than the Bishamonten Shrine and Daikokuten Shrine,

465
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,640
five of them have been stolen within a week.

466
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,920
What did you say?

467
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,440
There are two of them in Ebisu and Bishamonten.

468
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,600
The enemies are Bishamonten, Bishamonten Bishamonten,

469
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,320
Bishamonten Bishamonten, Bishamonten Bishamonten,

470
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,400
Bishamonten Bishamonten, Bishamonten Bishamonten,

471
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,700
and Bishamonten Bishamonten.

472
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,240
What should we do?

473
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,880
It seems that Daikokuten is still safe,

474
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,560
so let's go to the original Daikokuten Shrine.

475
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,700
Then, give me the map that Ebisu gave me.

476
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,600
Yes.

477
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,180
I did it.

478
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,660
Here it is!

479
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,540
What is this?

480
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,940
It's just a luxury house.

481
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,120
I don't know why.

482
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,040
Is there a shrine in this place?

483
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,020
That's it.

484
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,720
Huh?

485
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,620
What is this?

486
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,520
It's not a shrine, right?

487
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,600
The owner of the original Daikokuten Shrine was just worshipping the great god of business.

488
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,300
He was a businessman.

489
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,920
He made a lot of money by selling his shares and land.

490
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,940
He abandoned the shrine five years ago.

491
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,340
What did you say?

492
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,720
Ha ha ha ha ha!

493
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,720
07.

494
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,260
So...

495
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,120
I thought I might be able to take a little of Lord Daikokuten's statue...

496
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,880
I refuse!

497
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,680
Huh?

498
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,960
I can't lend it to a man like you who doesn't know where the horse's bones are!

499
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,500
Eh?

500
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,460
I'll do something about it!

501
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,480
You're useless!

502
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,600
Go home!

503
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,200
What?

504
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,660
What's that for?

505
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:37,860
Hey.

506
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,300
I said I wouldn't lend it to you.

507
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,000
If you're wrong, don't come steal it!

508
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,060
To be honest,

509
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,160
Actually, last night, a suspicious guy sneaked into our house,

510
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,020
but I made him a pawn in our security system!

511
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,500
I ran away with them, with my tail wrapped around my neck!

512
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,160
Damn it!

513
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,140
How did it go, Senpai?

514
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,120
No good. I can't take it at all.

515
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,060
What are you going to do, Ryotsu?

516
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,240
Well then, what should I do?

517
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,400
Hmm...

518
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,960
So, Senpai, what are you going to do?

519
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,920
First, we'll use the hang glider to get into the sky.

520
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,300
That's illegal entry!

521
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,520
We'll blow the door with the main grenade.

522
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,340
We'll destroy the Kibutsu!

523
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,580
We'll put the country to sleep with the sleep gas.

524
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,880
That's a crime!

525
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,040
I'll just borrow it for a bit.

526
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:31,820
No!

527
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,960
Huh?

528
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,860
What?

529
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,960
What are you doing?

530
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,000
a ninja!

531
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,100
Those guys?

532
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,460
Who are you?

533
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,840
What a rough bunch of people.

534
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,480
We flung out the flag!

535
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,360
Now, we will take the flag by itself!

536
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,940
We'll take the flag, my dear.

537
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,000
Senpai!

538
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:15,700
Go!

539
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,640
Closh, Closh,

540
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,160
Are you alright?

541
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,280
Senpai!

542
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,120
That hurts!

543
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,460
Ooh! That door!

544
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,560
It's open!

545
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,360
Close the door!

546
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:27,800
Enter!

547
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,300
This is bad!

548
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,540
Be quiet!

549
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,960
We are policemen on the scene!

550
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,680
Leave them alone!

551
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:34,800
I'll get you!

552
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,340
That's convenient.

553
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,420
Let's go!

554
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,300
Yes!

555
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,180
What's wrong?

556
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,520
The ninjas are gone.

557
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,240
You did a good job.

558
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,760
Wait, we're the police.

559
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,280
We heard the noise and ran.

560
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,560
There's no such police officer!

561
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,580
Go!

562
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,440
The

563
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,860
It's a mess outside.

564
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,440
Good evening.

565
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,140
What?

566
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:23,780
It's a mess outside.

567
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,340
Good evening.

568
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,180
It's a mess outside.

569
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:28,840
Good evening.

570
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,620
What?

571
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:31,760
It's here.

572
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:32,940
What?

573
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,560
What on earth did you do?

574
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,260
In the midst of all that noise, I met Daikoku by chance.

575
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,880
I asked him to lend it to me, and he did.

576
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,740
N-No way!

577
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,740
That old man.

578
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,240
What did we do?

579
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,640
Anyway, we got the statue.

580
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,200
Now the treasure is ours.

581
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,040
That's not good.

582
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,140
You did a good job.

583
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,980
Now we can go back to the Shishi.

584
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,360
We have all the statues.

585
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,540
Damn it!

586
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,160
How cowardly!

587
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,240
I'm sorry, but I'll take the hostage so you don't get in the way.

588
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,560
Why am I the hostage?

589
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,040
Honda! Haruka!

590
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,580
I'll help you!

591
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,620
Senpai!

592
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,460
Damn it!

593
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,720
Don't panic.

594
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,000
What?

595
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,380
I put a transmitter on Honda.

596
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,160
Really?

597
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,420
As expected of the former Greenberry.

598
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,020
This rope and all.

599
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,720
Okay, let's follow him!

600
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,140
There are seven maps, but the mystery won't be solved.

601
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,760
What does it mean to have a star at the end of the seven stars in the old temple that came out of this Daikoku Temple?

602
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,320
Isn't that it?

603
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,180
Hokuto Shichise.

604
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,660
What?

605
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,740
I see.

606
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,080
Let's put them together in the shape of Hokuto Shichise.

607
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,580
That's not good.

608
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,680
You should give the enemy a hint.

609
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,300
I'm sorry.

610
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,680
The six maps are connected.

611
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,680
This shape matches the position of the Shichifukujin Shrine.

612
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,820
Then, the star at the end of the seven stars is...

613
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,060
That's the North Pole!

614
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,180
Oh!

615
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,660
I see.

616
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,120
The last one is the North Pole.

617
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,500
I'm sorry.

618
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,260
The North Pole is five times the height of the two stars at the end of the North Pole Shichise.

619
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,280
The position of this star is...

620
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,960
Chuzenzhiko!

621
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,160
The mystery has been solved.

622
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,680
Then, this map shows the Keigun waterfall.

623
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,540
I see.

624
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,920
When the water of the waterfall stops, the key to the Uraedo Castle opens.

625
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,120
What?

626
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:54,940
What?

627
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,200
What?

628
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,680
What?

629
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,400
What!

630
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,840
Wait, Don.

631
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,260
P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P

632
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,160
What?

633
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,040
What's the matter!

634
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,760
So, Konji!

635
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,800
Bowler-san!

636
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,240
Y-You bastards!

637
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,820
The people outside have defeated everyone.

638
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,300
Well?

639
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,440
Give us the scent of the treasure!

640
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,780
That's what I should do?

641
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:17,860
Go!

642
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,660
Yes!

643
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,060
Minpo, give me this flower!

644
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,680
Damn! The treasure map disappeared!

645
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,620
I think they went to the Ke-Gon waterfall!

646
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,040
Ke-Gon waterfall?

647
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,680
Oh, I see.

648
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,780
Was it a repair accident that the lake in the library was like that lake?

649
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,800
Then we will look for the inside of the lake.

650
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:43,620
What?

651
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,220
What they took is fake.

652
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,420
The real key is in the lake.

653
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,900
I'm not good at flying.

654
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,040
I'm sorry, Nakagawa.

655
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,340
No, the good guy's treasure is romantic.

656
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,080
Senior, it's Ke-Gon waterfall.

657
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,240
They are trying to stop the waterfall water as the book says.

658
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,540
It's useless.

659
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,440
Senior, how is it?

660
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,000
Oh, it's right at the bottom of the lake.

661
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,220
What is this?

662
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,900
This is Aoi's treasure.

663
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,980
It belongs to the Tokugawa family.

664
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,320
I did it! I finally found it!

665
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,120
This is the hidden treasure.

666
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,180
The key to open the top of the lake.

667
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,060
Alright.

668
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,980
The treasure.

669
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,900
One trillion yen.

670
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:56,920
Kiii!

671
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,740
What?

672
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,080
Oh, no!

673
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,900
Oh, no!

674
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,020
Oh, no!

675
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,740
I'm going to be sucked in!

676
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,640
Senior, what happened?

677
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,860
The line at the bottom of the lake is missing.

678
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,620
What?

679
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,340
Look!

680
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,060
What's that?

681
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,400
The water from the lake is missing.

682
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,620
What for?

683
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,100
It's to move something with the power of the current.

684
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,320
The waterfall water has stopped.

685
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,700
Senior, this is bad.

686
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,600
The water from the lake has stopped.

687
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,660
The waterfall has stopped.

688
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,240
What?

689
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,920
This is the water from the lake.

690
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,580
When this is stopped, the key to the top of the lake will also be unlocked.

691
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,740
The waterfall water has stopped.

692
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,700
The waterfall water has stopped.

693
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,360
The water from the lake has stopped.

694
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:14,640
The one around the back of the lake won't open.

695
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:40,500
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

696
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,900
oh! The water is completely out!

697
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,880
No way, they really were trying to get rid of the water in the palatines?

698
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,680
But it's strange. Nothing happens.

699
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,040
Orai Dojo doesn't appear either.

700
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,160
Yes, Ryo.

701
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
Oh, Ryo.

702
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,500
Oh no!

703
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,060
The Golden Castle appeared in Odaiba!

704
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,060
What?

705
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,980
What on earth is going on?

706
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,640
I didn't know such a castle would appear from the underground.

707
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:33,440
What is that?

708
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,660
It's a ninja!

709
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,300
Could it be that it attacked Ryo-chan?

710
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,340
Yes.

711
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,140
Hurry! They'll get ahead of us!

712
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,400
Ryo-sama!

713
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,640
What's going on? What are they doing?

714
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,360
Th- that's...

715
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,260
Okay, start the engine!

716
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,500
Go!

717
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,080
The treasure is ours!

718
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,260
W- who are you?

719
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,120
I am Kirigakure Saizo's grandson, grandson, grandson, grandson,

720
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,120
Kirigakure Komatta!

721
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,380
I knew it!

722
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,660
Hmm, Kirigakure Komatta.

723
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,420
Speaking of Kirigakure Saizo,

724
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,400
He is one of the descendants of Sanada Yukimura, who died in the Osaka summer camp.

725
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,040
He is one of the descendants of Sanada Yukimura, who died in the Osaka summer camp.

726
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,920
I knew it!

727
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:58,260
Our secret weapon, Ieyasu, will not go a step further until we take back the treasure stolen from Toyotomi family.

728
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,360
Don't talk to me, old man!

729
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,760
I won't let you touch my treasure!

730
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,920
Hehe, how naive of you.

731
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,080
Limpo!

732
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,740
Tsunami Jutsu!

733
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,620
Huh?

734
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,600
Where is the tsunami? Is it Sasanami Jani?

735
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,000
Hey, I'm going to be fooled!

736
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,440
Hey, I'm going to be fooled!

737
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,800
Oh, no!

738
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,580
No!

739
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,000
Gunman

740
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,440
I know it's impossible.

741
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,480
What are you saying!?

742
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,340
Love the sea and protect justice.

743
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,720
Who called this? Poseidon.

744
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,400
I'll put you in the bag, and you'll get a pair.

745
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,960
I'll go to the beach. If it's about the sea, leave it to me.

746
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,580
I'm sorry. The Yashinoki Cut is the trademark.

747
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,420
It's Dolphin Deka!

748
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,620
Oh! Dolphin Deka!

749
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,460
Ryotsu, I've been here for a long time.

750
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,020
I'll get rid of this.

751
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,320
Oh, please!

752
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,080
Dolphin, come on!

753
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,900
Oh, there are more dolphins!

754
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,600
I imitated Morning Musume and added more.

755
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,580
What? Just a few dolphins?

756
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,040
They're not my opponents.

757
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,800
What did you say?

758
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,700
Dolphins, you have to teach those mean old men a lesson!

759
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:42,960
Go!

760
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,720
Take the mask!

761
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,300
I mean, the dolphin!

762
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,880
Take that! Take that! Take that!

763
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,000
Natchi!

764
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,180
Natchi?

765
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,880
Gomaki! Gago!

766
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,300
Give us the dolphins! Give us Natchi!

767
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,020
It has a name too.

768
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,520
Are you okay, Natchi, Gomaki, Gago?

769
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:23,680
I'm sorry about today.

770
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,060
Farewell!

771
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,500
Let's change the end!

772
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,300
It's a jet bike!

773
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,240
This is it!

774
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,660
Now, get on!

775
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,640
Honda, drive!

776
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,420
Yes, yes, yes.

777
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,300
All right!

778
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,600
You two, hold on tight!

779
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,020
All right!

780
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,820
Let's go!

781
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,360
io

782
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,260
No problem!

783
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:57,280
What's that?

784
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,380
Ninja Martial Art!

785
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,000
Tsunami Jutsu!

786
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,940
Now you two understand!

787
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,000
What?

788
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,700
You shouldn't read my name!

789
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,960
Qin Long Live!

790
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,040
Let's go!

791
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,600
Ugh!

792
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,960
Alright!

793
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,640
We're here, Master Ryo!

794
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,720
Good work!

795
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,500
That was scary...

796
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,220
W-what's with this guy?

797
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,820
When you hold the handle of a bike, you change into a person.

798
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,840
Now, we're finally at the Uraido Castle!

799
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,360
Let's find the treasure!

800
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,160
What on earth is going on?

801
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,460
Who is that woman behind Master Ryo?

802
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,160
What? Is the gold coin just outside?

803
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,180
Where's the treasure?

804
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,280
Is it really the Angel Kingdom?

805
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,120
Anyway, let's head up!

806
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,720
Yes!

807
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,640
Huh? Who are you?

808
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,500
Nyan Paralitto, right?

809
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,920
I am...

810
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,500
the grandson of Sarutobi Sasuke,

811
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,220
and will always be his grandson!

812
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,740
Sarutobi Sasukebe!

813
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,620
Sarutobi Sa...

814
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,560
Sasukebe?

815
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,240
Sa!

816
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:29,920
Not Sasukebe!

817
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,320
Sasukebe!

818
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,340
Prepare yourself!

819
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,200
What?!

820
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,560
Who is that guy?!

821
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,240
What?

822
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,040
What's going on?

823
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,060
Oh!

824
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,320
Master Moon!

825
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,580
It's not only a flurry of magic!

826
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
The moon's energy is running through my back!

827
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,700
The stick of justice, Yamiyosaku!

828
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,100
If it's a sky incident, I'll leave it to you!

829
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,960
The master of the moon,

830
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,980
Gekko-Deka!

831
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,660
I'm back!

832
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,160
Same goes for Minas-Deka!

833
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,740
Hey, Gekko-Deka!

834
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,820
I've been waiting for you!

835
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:18,980
Damn!

836
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,200
Teach me the sweetness of modern weapons!

837
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,140
Fun!

838
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,860
I-It disappeared!

839
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
Ah? What's that?

840
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,520
What?

841
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,440
Ah?

842
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,440
What?

843
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,780
Take this!

844
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,520
Uri!

845
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,640
P-P-Pinas!

846
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,440
No, no, no! I don't need it!

847
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,200
Don't be so rude!

848
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,660
No, no, no! I'm being respectful!

849
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,220
Here!

850
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,380
We've been getting less and less paid lately.

851
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,260
Ah?

852
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,200
We only get specials for free!

853
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,760
Really?

854
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,320
Ah, what?

855
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,000
That's right!

856
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:04,880
Does he have appeal to me?

857
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,180
Oh, my.

858
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,260
Hey, you're the one who's not paying any attention to him!

859
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,360
The hell!

860
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,920
You silly artist!

861
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,080
You're not paying any attention to me!

862
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,060
Don't touch the rope!

863
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,540
Hey, you just better have your revenge!

864
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,340
Do you have to be so friendly?

865
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,140
You bastard!

866
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,980
Whatever!

867
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,040
Huh?

868
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,520
It's working!

869
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,280
Oh, no.

870
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,020
What's wrong with Ryotsu and the others?

871
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,240
I don't know.

872
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:45,200
What was that just now?

873
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,140
I don't know.

874
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,060
W-What was that?

875
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,480
It's huge!

876
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:54,920
Huge!

877
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,300
It's the same guy who stole from us!

878
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,040
I-I'll ask them first!

879
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,420
Who are you, you bastard?

880
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,500
I am the grandchild of the gramophone player from Omiyoshi Seikaidarumaru's grandchild

881
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,100
Kyousuke Mikoto of Omiyoshi Seikaidarumaru!

882
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,600
Sen-senpai!

883
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,480
Dang it.

884
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,600
To think that from the beginning,

885
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
I have no idea when I'm gonna be here.

886
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,280
Who?

887
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,240
Look, here it comes!

888
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,660
This isn't just a 5-pan mukkori.

889
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,520
When an incident happens on land,

890
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,660
you can solve it with just one Kaipan.

891
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,120
The leader of the special police and the Zambagalas.

892
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,900
Kaipan Deka.

893
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,980
I'm home!

894
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,240
You know,

895
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,240
you don't have to come out for nothing because you're a special!

896
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,440
Seba!

897
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:54,960
Hmph!

898
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,980
You're going to pay for this!

899
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,600
Ryo!

900
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,300
Ryo!

901
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,460
Who is that woman?!

902
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:16,800
Ryo!

903
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,040
Even though you're my friend,

904
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,280
you won't let another woman get away with this!

905
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,820
No!

906
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,960
Maria, you're mistaken!

907
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,980
Your intention is wrong!

908
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,580
You are the daughter of the Seven Furos of the Shrine!

909
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,940
You just used me as a help!

910
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,160
Is that true?

911
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,600
I'm serious, I'm serious!

912
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,540
Is that so, Mr. Honda?

913
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,480
Yes, well, usually when money comes to you,

914
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,080
you'd be less interested in those personal matters.

915
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,620
I'm sorry, Lord Ryo.

916
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,480
I was misunderstanding you.

917
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,140
If you understand, it's fine!

918
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,380
If you understand-

919
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,180
Ryo, that's kind!

920
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:52,660
So kind!

921
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,940
Oh, this is always the case.

922
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,500
Anyway, thanks to Maria, I was saved.

923
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,000
Now, let's go!

924
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,620
Yeah!

925
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,180
No, I won't scare them.

926
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,780
I won't give you the treasure!

927
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,880
Why are you here?

928
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,760
I've taken care of all three old men!

929
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,540
N-No way!

930
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,260
Everyone, get them!

931
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,380
Yes, sir!

932
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,560
I won't forgive anyone who does anything to you!

933
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:45,100
You're amazing, Maria.

934
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,880
If it's for you, even if it's just fire or water.

935
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,220
I should have put you in the team from the start.

936
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,200
That's right.

937
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,400
Let's go!

938
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,360
Is this the entrance to the treasure room?

939
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,180
Humph!

940
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,740
Humph!

941
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,220
Humph!

942
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,280
Humph!

943
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,040
Humph!

944
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,340
Humph!

945
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,120
Humph!

946
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,760
No!

947
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,160
I won't be scared, no matter how I push or pull.

948
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,820
This is a gift, isn't it?

949
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,000
Damn it!

950
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,980
You came all the way here!

951
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,980
Ryo-sama, is this...

952
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,380
Huh?

953
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,740
I'm Iyoko.

954
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,820
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

955
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,200
What are you doing?

956
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:21,700
Make it even more intense!

957
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:23,700
Ah!

958
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,420
Ah!

959
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:25,620
Ah!

960
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:25,680
Ah!

961
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:25,860
Ah!

962
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,420
Ah!

963
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,180
Ah!

964
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,460
Senior!

965
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,320
What's this?

966
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:31,780
What's this?

967
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,140
I-It's definitely...

968
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,620
It's Tokugawa Ieyasu's one trillion yen treasure!

969
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,120
You've done a great job.

970
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,280
What?

971
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,340
Senior!

972
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:42,660
Ah!

973
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,040
H-Honda!

974
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:44,920
Mr. Honda!

975
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,760
Huh?

976
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,120
Don't move at all!

977
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,820
If you move, this guy's life will be gone.

978
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,200
Ah!

979
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:51,900
Ah!

980
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,140
Mr. Honda!

981
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,220
Damn it!

982
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,700
You guys are still here!

983
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,440
Ow!

984
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,240
Honda!

985
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,120
What?

986
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,020
You're Haruka!

987
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:09,900
That's right.

988
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,240
I'm the leader of the ninja army, Haruka Sanada.

989
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,300
S-Sanada?

990
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,700
Are you the descendant of Yukimura Sanada?

991
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,400
That's right.

992
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,940
We are the Sanada clan.

993
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,400
I've been looking for Ieyasu's treasure for generations.

994
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,600
Damn it!

995
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,740
What's with you?

996
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,280
You're so busy!

997
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,360
Huh?

998
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,240
Senior!

999
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,520
I just remembered.

1000
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,040
There's no daughter in the original Benzaiten Shrine.

1001
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,120
It's my son!

1002
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,040
Ah!

1003
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,960
Even if you remember now, it's too late!

1004
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,820
Now, if you want this guy's life, give him the treasure.

1005
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,440
Ah!

1006
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,240
I understand!

1007
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,100
I've never been so lucky to have a treasure like this!

1008
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:51,940
I'll give it to you!

1009
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,200
What's with you?

1010
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:54,960
What?

1011
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:55,820
I did it!

1012
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,180
I'll get the treasure!

1013
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,860
Yes!

1014
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,180
Hey!

1015
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,500
Again!

1016
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,980
Why is there someone waiting when I'm told to wait?

1017
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,000
I'm sorry!

1018
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,080
You've been imitating me.

1019
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,360
Damn it!

1020
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,880
Give me the treasure!

1021
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,580
Ah!

1022
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:20,320
What's with you?

1023
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,160
I've been looking for Ieyasu's treasure for generations.

1024
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,540
Wow!

1025
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,460
That's amazing!

1026
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:27,920
It's a million yen treasure!

1027
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,340
Who will give it to me?

1028
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,540
Ah!

1029
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:33,460
Ah!

1030
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,080
Ah!

1031
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,500
Ah!

1032
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,460
Ah!

1033
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:39,400
No!

1034
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,440
No!

1035
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:40,820
No!

1036
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,260
Oh, my!

1037
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:42,980
No!

1038
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:43,640
No!

1039
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:43,940
No!

1040
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:43,960
No!

1041
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,060
No!

1042
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:44,940
I do it!

1043
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,220
I do it!

1044
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:45,860
I do it!

1045
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,180
I'm not going anywhere!

1046
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:46,980
Run!

1047
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,640
Don't think you can run away!

1048
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,840
Ryo!

1049
00:45:59,240 --> 00:45:59,920
Senpai!

1050
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,700
The shuriken was broken from the start.

1051
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,080
Mitsuri!

1052
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,220
Mitsuri!

1053
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,100
You just have to hand over the treasure quietly.

1054
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,960
Prepare yourself!

1055
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,660
Ryo!

1056
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,180
The treasure!

1057
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,800
What's this?

1058
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:39,780
Bamboo horse?

1059
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,900
Denden daiko?

1060
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,840
Bamboo bamboo stick on rice?

1061
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:43,900
What's this?

1062
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,060
It's all children's toys, isn't it?

1063
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,800
No way!

1064
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,740
Good work, the rest of the Toyotomi family.

1065
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,320
I was a hostage in the Imagawa family when I was young.

1066
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,080
So I rarely played with children's toys.

1067
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,420
After I left, I tried playing with them for the first time.

1068
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,800
I've never played with children's toys so much.

1069
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:07,240
I thought it was fun.

1070
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,280
But when my friends saw me playing with them,

1071
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,660
I lost the will of the Shogun.

1072
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,420
So I secretly built a castle in the back of the castle

1073
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,440
and decided to play with them here.

1074
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:21,780
What?

1075
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,300
Hand it over!

1076
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,160
The Toyotomi family's treasure was used for construction costs

1077
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:27,860
and to build a castle in the back of the castle

1078
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,700
or to make it sink.

1079
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,040
I used it all to make a big deal.

1080
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,360
I'm sorry.

1081
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,540
Oh, that's not funny.

1082
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,120
Don't be silly!

1083
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,620
Ryu-san!

1084
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,820
Senpai!

1085
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,460
You're more tired than a bone!

1086
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:54,480
The castle is going to collapse!

1087
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,740
Was that an important pillar?

1088
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:57,660
Run away!

1089
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,120
Come on!

1090
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,140
I got it!

1091
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,460
It's too bad, Ryotsu!

1092
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,360
What treasure is Tokugawa?

1093
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,580
Wait.

1094
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,640
I'll build that castle that was made of gold!

1095
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,960
That was a pickaxe.

1096
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,140
That's what I heard.

1097
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,160
What?

1098
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,700
No way!

1099
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,380
And then, as usual, Fuji TV is asking you to pay for the broken car.

1100
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,240
Damn!

1101
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,600
I'm going to fall again!

1102
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,380
It's too funny to be a senior!

1103
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,560
Shut up!

1104
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,560
It's raining like someone's calling me.

1105
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,060
I walked while looking back.

1106
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,900
My mother was holding my hand.

1107
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:20,320
I felt a strange feeling at that time.

1108
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,140
So I walked on the black roadside of the arcade.

1109
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,980
I saw it.

1110
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,000
Everyone was a child once, but everyone has forgotten it.

1111
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:47,480
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above their eyes.

1112
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:52,800
Turn around and see that corner.

1113
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,580
You can see everyone.

1114
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,420
There is a camera over there.

1115
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,060
There must be a camera.

1116
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,240
Everyone, come to our town.

1117
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,360
Thank you!
