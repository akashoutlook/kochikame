1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,180
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,900
Inside the river slope

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,880
I've been gazing to some day

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,760
When I kicked the pebble

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,720
They came up from high

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,600
I wonder if I'm going to save money

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:38,960
I was laughed at as it was

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,540
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,500
There is only a single bad habit

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,900
The cityscape that doesn't change even one bad habit

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,720
It's strangely kind

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,380
From the fountain of the "Tongari-boshi"

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,940
To the taishakuten

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,940
The sun sets

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,500
Tomorrow is over already

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,180
I lost my happiness because of the number of times I spent

17
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,800
I realized

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,380
I'm such an idiot

19
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,700
I'm such an idiot

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,560
The First Love Story of Asakusa

21
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,480
Oh, Ryou!

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,240
Ryo, you're so stylish. What's wrong?

23
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,960
Well, I'm a little...

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,640
Ryo! What are you doing?

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
It's okay. Just a little.

26
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,440
This is a cream for removing hair.

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,000
Isn't this a mousse or something?

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,020
No. I'm going to use it for other people.

29
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,620
Senpai, you're going to meet someone you've never met before.

30
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,220
You're going to meet someone you've never met before?

31
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,420
Ryo?

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,700
Yeah. I have one or two memories of my first love.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,960
Oh? Hey, let me ask you something, Ryo.

34
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,760
What kind of person is your first love?

35
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,340
Where did you meet her?

36
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,400
I met her in Asakusa, where I was a kid.

37
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,960
The zaver who burned up the community building in the end of the war will revive.

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,240
Sensoji, Horaku Center. New World.

39
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,840
Jintan Island 12th Floor.

40
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,620
Asakusa, where Hanayashiki is located, was exquisite.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,080
At that time, the Hanayashiki was free.

42
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,140
It was like our backyard.

43
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,700
I knew it! The coasters have such a good thrill to them!

44
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,540
Urgh!

45
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:48,640
That's right!

46
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,800
Compe! That was just a blip!

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,100
You're so mean!

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,280
I'm not mean!

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,300
Let's ride the Spitfire next time.

50
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,080
Oh, there she comes again.

51
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:08,420
What's she doing alone?

52
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,040
She's studying.

53
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,720
I heard she's an actor of a rock band.

54
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,980
Actor? Really?

55
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,340
That's so cool!

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,360
Huh?

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,700
No! No!

58
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,080
No!

59
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,560
How many times do I have to tell you?

60
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,300
How can you be an actor?

61
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,300
Why can't you just act like a real person?

62
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,500
I'll change the way you stand.

63
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,120
Huh?

64
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,720
I'll change the way you come to work.

65
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,360
Boss!

66
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,240
Can you do it again?

67
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,720
I'll do it one more time!

68
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,080
You're doing your best, aren't you, Kotone?

69
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,720
Move!

70
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,340
You're my daughter, aren't you?

71
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,200
Actors and the stage don't have parents and children!

72
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm always ready to help you.

73
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,700
I don't know who you are, but thank you for your friendliness.

74
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
At least, at least, tell me your name.

75
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,580
I'm Kan-Kichi Ryosu!

76
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,260
What are you doing here?

77
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,880
Wow!

78
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
Look at this!

79
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,720
It's a real script!

80
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,700
The rumor is true that you're an actor of the Rock Band!

81
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,120
Yeah!

82
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,800
You've been here...

83
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,660
Go over there!

84
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,020
Go over there!

85
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,420
Let's go, Kankichi.

86
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,580
I can't talk to great actors.

87
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,100
But, they're the same age as us, and they're actors.

88
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,600
I've never seen a play script before!

89
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:03,960
Wait!

90
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,520
Wait, I'm an actor, so I called you?

91
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,720
It's not a joke.

92
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,020
We're meeting a real actor for the first time, so I thought we could talk.

93
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,140
Right?

94
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,500
Yeah!

95
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,440
But I'm not a real actor yet.

96
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,320
I'm not good at acting, and I'm always scolded.

97
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,420
We're scolded at school every day.

98
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,300
Right?

99
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,600
Yeah!

100
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,500
I'm Ryotsu Kankichi!

101
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,860
I'm Tachibana Kotone.

102
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,300
You're so cute!

103
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,100
And sometimes you're evil!

104
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,140
What are you talking?

105
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,040
Are you understerreichize or something?

106
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,860
Haha!

107
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,680
I read as "kyu" in my man field.

108
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,240
Oh!

109
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,180
Hey, show us the example.

110
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,100
Miss, you can't do that.

111
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,440
Sometimes you have to be gentle.

112
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,120
Let me handle it.

113
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,280
You should leave.

114
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,760
I-is this too foolish?

115
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,180
Hello.

116
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,540
Wow!

117
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,580
That's cool!

118
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,220
Kotone-chan is like Okawa Hashizo!

119
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,480
Look! This is it!

120
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,020
Kotone-chan will become as handsome as Hashizo someday!

121
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:33,060
That's cool, Otoneemon!

122
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,380
G-g-gah...

123
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,260
I guess it was bad luck for you, Kankichi Nosuke!

124
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,880
I'm on my way!

125
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,280
I 다니!

126
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,180
I guess it was bad luck for you, Kankichi Nosuke!

127
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm on my way!

128
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,480
You two wait, you wait!

129
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,540
Wait, Kankichi! Kotone!

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,400
Huh? Where did they go?

131
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,920
This way!

132
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,280
Hey, Kankichi! Don't steal!

133
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,340
Run away!

134
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,740
There!

135
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,240
Yeah!

136
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,720
I got you!

137
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,500
You're amazing, Kotone!

138
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,160
What do you want to be?

139
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,900
The best actor in Japan!

140
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,760
My dream is to become the best actor in Japan and play the whole country at once.

141
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,860
Kotone, you can do it!

142
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,820
Yeah, I'll try! What about yours, Kankichi?

143
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,840
I love arts, so I want to be an athlete.

144
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,740
An athlete?

145
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,820
Not really. I want to be an airplane pilot!

146
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,500
You're amazing! An airplane pilot!

147
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,100
Not really. I want to be a director of "Katsubo Shashin"!

148
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,460
I want to be a cartoonist!

149
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,260
I don't know which one!

150
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,640
Sounds like you, Kankichi!

151
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,900
By the way, where are Chin-Kichi and Tonpei?

152
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,340
Those two are staying at the school.

153
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,760
Because they're stupid.

154
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,840
Damn it!

155
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,620
Remember that, Kankichi!

156
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,060
I'm not stupid!

157
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,700
You're my type, so I'm embarrassed to be alone with you.

158
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,280
I also like you, Kankichi.

159
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,220
You like me?

160
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,640
You're so annoying!

161
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,980
Kankichi, watch out!

162
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,400
A samurai!

163
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,640
I don't know who you are,

164
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,080
but I'm sorry for your trouble.

165
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,420
I'm sorry for your trouble.

166
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,600
You're very honest.

167
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,060
You're a true hero.

168
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,880
You're a true hero.

169
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,440
I'm glad I made good friends.

170
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm glad I made good friends.

171
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,400
I'm glad I made good friends.

172
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,240
I'm glad I made good friends.

173
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,080
Kankichi!

174
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,620
Kotone!

175
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,540
Kotone!

176
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,920
My dad said I could be on the stage next week!

177
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,300
Kotone!

178
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,820
Kotone!

179
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,880
I'll be in the front row!

180
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,460
I'll do my best!

181
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,560
I'll be in the front row!

182
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,820
This is...

183
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,640
New vehicle!

184
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:20,060
It's great to see an artificial satellite fifty meters apart from Tokyo at the same time.

185
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:20,820
It's great to see an artificial satellite fifty meters apart from Tokyo at the same time.

186
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,720
You have to get here with us as soon as it's completed.

187
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,720
You have to get here with us as soon as it's completed.

188
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,240
Let's do this!

189
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,920
Kankichi...

190
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,860
Kankichi,

191
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,140
You'll be fine.

192
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,700
It's okay. Come here, Kotone-chan.

193
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,700
The satellite is already ready.

194
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,220
Because the stars are stars, let's make a reservation for this gondola.

195
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,760
I secretly signed the reservation.

196
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,760
Oh, Gosunkuni.

197
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,400
Kan-kichi-ta.

198
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,660
No one will notice if it's here.

199
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,040
Then lend me too.

200
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,320
I'll lend you.

201
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,400
I changed the umbrella.

202
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,200
It's a waste.

203
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,640
Don't be shy if someone sees us.

204
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,680
Hey!

205
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,640
You can't enter the warehouse.

206
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,660
Run away!

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,980
They look good.

208
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,720
Yes.

209
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,720
It's too late, Kotone-chan.

210
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,620
Is it over today?

211
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,720
But, but, the show is scheduled until next month.

212
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,820
As long as the owner of the park said it's over, we have to obey him.

213
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,780
If you're a person of this world, you know what's going on.

214
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,600
No way.

215
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,560
If the opponent is Bunji, it's impossible.

216
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,260
I'm not going to do the show suddenly because I'm recovered.

217
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,240
I'm not worried about the popularity index.

218
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,380
I felt sorry for Kotone-ojo.

219
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,540
I was so happy to be on the stage in Asakusa.

220
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,580
I have to stand here tomorrow morning.

221
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,760
I can't.

222
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,020
I can't.

223
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,480
Kan-kichi-kun.

224
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,200
...Kotone-chan...

225
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,500
Chapter 2: The End

226
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,920
Episode 1: The End

227
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,680
K-Kotone-chan... are you leaving?

228
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,900
You're always like this...

229
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,120
Even though we became friends...

230
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,480
Even though we were able to perform on stage thanks to you, Kankichi-kun...

231
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,920
Even though I thought you would watch my plays...

232
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,620
You're always... always...

233
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,400
Kotone-chan...

234
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,100
I don't want to travel anymore!

235
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,280
I want to stay here forever!

236
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,180
I want to stay in Asakusa!

237
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,900
But... then you can't become the best star in Japan!

238
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,680
Is Kankichi-kun okay?

239
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,960
Even if I say that...

240
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,440
You idiot!

241
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,240
Kotone-chan!

242
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,680
...

243
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,080
I...

244
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,300
I don't want you to go either!

245
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,600
Why did you leave?

246
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,920
Even though we became friends!

247
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:49,080
K-Kotone-chan...

248
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,580
K-Kotone-chan...

249
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,160
Kankichi-kun...

250
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,860
K-Kotone-chan...

251
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,000
H-hah...

252
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,760
Let's ride together!

253
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,580
I'm looking forward to it!

254
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,680
- - Since

255
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,000
we have to go to Kyoto by the end of the day... let

256
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,620
's hurry. - Yes.

257
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,640
- Kotone, let's go.

258
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,980
Kotone...

259
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,440
How long are you going to keep this up?

260
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,960
Enough. Stop it until you're tired.

261
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,760
Kotone!

262
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,500
Kankichi!

263
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,660
What's wrong, Kankichi? You're so dirty.

264
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,480
Mister, please!

265
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,980
Give me some time!

266
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,820
I really want to show Kotone something!

267
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,700
Please!

268
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,880
Hey, Kankichi, what do you want to show me?

269
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,280
It's almost time.

270
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,180
Kankichi!

271
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,700
I like you too, Kankichi.

272
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,580
I like you, too.

273
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,860
I love you, too.

274
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,280
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:13,960
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,100
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,400
I promised to ride with you at the beginning.

278
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,500
Kankichi...

279
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,580
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,340
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:36,820
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,400
K-Kankichi...

283
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,200
It's been so long.

284
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:44,960
Once I hit him with my machine gun...

285
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,600
I'm worried about his inauspicious state.

286
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,440
HanKichi!

287
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,460
You know...

288
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,920
When I was a little kid...

289
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,300
I was worried that Kankichi was yourself.

290
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,200
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

291
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,700
Right in front of you is Sumida River!

292
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,020
The big building in front of Azumabashi is Matsuya Department Store!

293
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,940
There's the Asakusa Park over there!

294
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,460
Next to Sensoji, there's the Hanayashiki Ferris Wheel and the airport!

295
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,660
The artificial satellite will soon reach the summit!

296
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,460
Ah, Asahina was there!

297
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,440
That stupid Kankichi! Make it better!

298
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,000
K-Kotone...

299
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,540
I'll never forget you...

300
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,140
The Asakusa River, and Kankichi...

301
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,560
Kotone! So far, I've brought you here...

302
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,220
You're the only one left!

303
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,340
KanKichi-kun...

304
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,980
You will definitely become the best star!

305
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,720
Kozune-chan, I will always support you!

306
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,780
Goodbye.

307
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,740
Goodbye.

308
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,860
Goodbye.

309
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,480
Hang in there, Masane-chan!

310
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,540
Goodbye!

311
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,200
Goodbye!

312
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,500
Goodbye!

313
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,980
Goodbye!

314
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,060
Goodbye!

315
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,560
Goodbye!

316
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,120
The next day

317
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,840
What about the satellite tower?

318
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,440
It was replaced by that Beater.

319
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,620
Ryo-chan, you had such a first love, didn't you?

320
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,420
It's not like that.

321
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,080
I'm not embarrassed.

322
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,660
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

323
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,300
Well, I had a boyish era, too.

324
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,300
Kankichi-kun?

325
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,900
Kankichi-kun, isn't it?

326
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,880
K-Kotone-chan?

327
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,740
Yes.

328
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,220
I knew it!

329
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,300
Kotone-chan!

330
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,440
Long time no see, Kankichi-kun.

331
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,340
How do you feel?

332
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,960
Are you disappointed to be an old lady?

333
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,420
Yes, I feel beautiful.

334
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,500
No, I mean, I'm surprised to be an adult.

335
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,540
Kankichi-kun is the same as before.

336
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,800
He hasn't changed at all.

337
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,760
Ichizawa is very popular in Kansai.

338
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
It's all thanks to Kankichi-kun.

339
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,860
For the play he sent me,

340
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,120
Shin-Kichi and Tonpei can't come to work, so...

341
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,720
I brought my colleagues to work.

342
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,860
Hello.

343
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,440
Asakusa has changed a lot, hasn't it?

344
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,940
Of course.

345
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,280
There's no manpower now,

346
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,400
and nothing is the same as before.

347
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,260
Oh, there is!

348
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,040
What?

349
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,220
There is!

350
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
The satellite from back then!

351
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,820
He's gone.

352
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:12,820
Yeah.

353
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,720
All right.

354
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,060
I'm going to put the satellite down!

355
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,020
All right.

356
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,860
Be careful.

357
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,720
Be careful.

358
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,660
Wait a minute, Kankichi!

359
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,360
Shouldn't we put another rope on it?

360
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,180
All right.

361
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,500
Let's put it inside.

362
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,120
My eyes are spinning!

363
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,280
We're going to need a rope.

364
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,380
How many times do I have to tell you that?

365
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,340
None of your business!

366
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,000
So, even now,

367
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,320
you've got criminals to shoot!

368
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,800
All right, work!

369
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,980
It's a senior-like ending.

370
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,960
Really?

371
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,560
Thanks to you, I was able to get the tension before the main show.

372
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,660
You're really my savior.

373
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,740
Thank you.

374
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,920
This is enough for breakfast.

375
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,360
Kankichi.

376
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:31,840
Yes.

377
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,140
Then I'll go back to the theater a little earlier.

378
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,980
It's a dream national park.

379
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,800
Do your best, boss.

380
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,960
I'm very nervous when I think that Kankichi is watching me.

381
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,080
No!

382
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,920
If Mr. Osamu...

383
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,900
If Mr. Kotone was here all the time,

384
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,460
I wonder if he would have become Ryo-chan's wife by now.

385
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,560
Well, I wonder what happened.

386
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,520
Even if you lose, there are times when you get into trouble.

387
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,800
Well, leave this to me.

389
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,060
Let's go.

390
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,420
Let's go!

391
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,740
I got the money!

392
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,840
Hey, Kotone-chan!

393
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,500
Let's go to Japan!

394
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,480
Let's go!

395
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,700
Let's go!

396
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,420
Let's go!

397
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:44,940
Let's go!

398
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,700
Let's go!

399
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,120
Hey, Sakonji!

400
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,840
Why are you listening to the way to capture Doki-Memo?

401
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,540
Why are you listening to the way to capture Doki-Memo?

402
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,320
You were an expert at fighting game, weren't you?

403
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,320
Huh?

404
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,960
Anyway, you got caught to the game!

405
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,620
You can't hide it!

406
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,240
Hey, which child does you like it?

407
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,660
Next time on Doki Gamer Sakonji!

408
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,400
Good luck!

409
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:31,200
Next time on Doki Gamer Sakonji!

410
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,620
The story of a woman who can't fall in love

411
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,780
The story of a woman who can't fall in love

412
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,020
But I have a lot of things I want to do

413
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:46,280
I want to ride on a bike in the desert

414
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:57,200
I want to be more free than birds

415
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,320
I want to be a lady who changes at the speed of a mangue

416
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,520
Love heart, I'm sorry, wait

417
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:22,200
The future of the panorama is a dazzling light

418
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,520
You understand, right?

419
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,180
I want to be a lady who changes at the speed of a mangue

420
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,280
Love heart, I'm sorry, wait
