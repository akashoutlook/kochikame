1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,480
"If you want to watch TV, keep your room bright and watch it from afar!"

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,680
"If you want to watch TV, keep your room bright and watch it from afar!"

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,120
"Come to me, you moneyless fool!"

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,580
"Even though I'm not here, I worry."

5
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:35,920
Look at the blue sky, the white clouds

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:42,840
I'm sure it'll be all right eventually

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,240
Come to me, you jobless one

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,540
I'm not here, but don't worry

9
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:12,020
Look, the red cloud is burning

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,180
I'm sure it'll be all right eventually

11
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,480
I know, I know, I know

12
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,760
If you know, just keep quiet and follow me

13
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
The Modification Project

14
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,160
The mayor is a wind?

15
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,660
That's right. So, I have a consultation with Mr. Ryo.

16
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,220
With me?

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,140
I wonder what it is.

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,680
Why don't you come and see?

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,560
Yeah, I'd like to.

20
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,820
Ouch!

21
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,940
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

22
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,740
Here it is.

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,540
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,420
Oh, Mr. Ryo.

25
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,120
It's the wind.

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,740
Let me get up.

27
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,060
What?

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,500
You want to talk to me?

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,740
Hey, Mr. Ryo.

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,440
You're here.

31
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,320
Come on, just sleep.

32
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,740
Actually, it's about the festival at the town council.

33
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,240
Oh, the festival.

34
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,860
That's right. It's almost there.

35
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,020
Mr. Ryo is good at organizing festivals, right?

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,700
Will you take care of it for me?

37
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:39,980
What?

38
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,840
Leave it to me.

39
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,700
I'll do a festival that everyone will be happy with.

40
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,820
I was saved.

41
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,080
Actually, only half of the donation money for the festival has been collected yet.

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,340
What? Half?

43
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,580
Please do something, Mr. Ryo.

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,080
Only Mr. Ryo can organize this southern area, even if it's Hiroshi Kameari.

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,660
So, do you want me to help you?

46
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,720
It's the perfect job for you, a life-saving bandist.

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,680
Oh, here's the first thing.

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,160
I'll help you.

49
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,700
Sorry to bother you.

50
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,300
You're welcome.

51
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,500
Oh, what's up with Grandma today?

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,920
She's going to a festival with the neighbors.

53
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,100
Oh, is it her Harajuku?

54
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,700
Oh, is it a gift for the festival?

55
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,560
Yes, please.

56
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,040
Well, thank you.

57
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,360
Thank you for your cooperation.

58
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,300
Thank you very much.

59
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,520
Thank you for your cooperation.

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,840
No problem.

61
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,060
I'll give you 100,000 yen for ten of them.

62
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,220
It's a very good deal.

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
All right.

64
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,100
So, I'll start from where the money's coming in.

65
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,540
What?

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,740
Hey, Mr. Ryo.

67
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,780
What are you going to do?

68
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,540
Are you the mayor of this town?

69
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,060
Yes.

70
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm here, President Daiko.

71
00:03:59,340 --> 00:03:59,840
Okay.

72
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,900
I'm tired.

73
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,140
I'll help you.

74
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,920
Mr. Ryo!

75
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,020
Kiyo-san!

76
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm the branch manager. What can I do for you?

77
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm here to ask for a donation for the festival.

78
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,020
I-I'm fine with just a little bit.

79
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,700
A donation?

80
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,740
Then, here you are.

81
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,540
Huh? What is this?

82
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,380
What do you mean, a donation?

83
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,440
It's only 10,000 yen!

84
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,820
Everyone, listen up!

85
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,400
A bank like this only costs 10,000 yen!

86
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,080
I-I was wrong! It was 20,000 yen!

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,400
Wait a minute!

88
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,760
The festival is a great opportunity to meet local residents.

89
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,880
Or is what's written on this poster different from what it really is?

90
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,500
It's ridiculous! That's the motto of my bank!

91
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,420
Then, I'll give you 50,000 yen.

92
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,700
I'll give you a lot!

93
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,200
A donation of 1 million yen!

94
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,060
1 million yen! That's ridiculous!

95
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,260
Kiyo-san, I can't believe it's 1 million yen.

96
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,700
Terai, do you have a bank account in this bank?

97
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,120
Eh? I-I do.

98
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
Then, go back to another bank today.

99
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:08,880
Okay?

100
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,100
That's...

101
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,600
Everyone, stop thinking about banks that don't understand this kind of thing.

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,140
And transfer your bank accounts to the bank next door!

103
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,720
I'll pay! I'll pay!

104
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,880
1 million yen!

105
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,120
Really? You're overreacting, aren't you?

106
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,920
It's just a sign that you want to show your gratitude to the locals.

107
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,760
It's just a sign that you want to show your gratitude to the locals.

108
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,740
Please let me pay with pleasure!

109
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,620
Please!

110
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,240
You have to do that.

111
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,360
Huh? The Zakuro Bank is donating 5 million yen?

112
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,080
But...

113
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,860
Ryo-san, it's not 5 million yen.

114
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:47,960
Hmm?

115
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,960
It's good that you're happy!

116
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,360
It's a bank that everyone can meet.

117
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,560
Let's happily pay it out!

118
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,340
I'm just watching you cry.

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,360
Just that.

120
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,820
You know, your bank accounts are doing a good job.

121
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,600
Everyone, just think that you want to transfer your bank accounts to the bank next door.

122
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,060
Okay, what do you wanna do?

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,980
Let's pay it out!

124
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,360
That's a goal!

125
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Let's come back at 5 million yen for sure!

126
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,800
It'll be awesome!

127
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,720
What?

128
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,030
What?

129
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,820
What did you say?

130
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,500
Ryosu is collecting a lot of donations?

131
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,880
He said he collected 7 million yen for the festival.

132
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,420
My senior forced me into an apartment in the town, so I got 500,000 yen.

133
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,900
500,000 yen?

134
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,980
I'm a member of the Kameyari Town Council.

135
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,920
He's so crazy.

136
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,260
He's going to make the shrine a gorgeous speciality.

137
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,900
What's he thinking?

138
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,220
Amazing.

139
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,000
Just look at the seating.

140
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,520
People are all glittering.

141
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,720
He wants to make it look greedy, so he's just taking the risk.

142
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,400
He's got a new nahi.

143
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,180
- Let's go! - Let's go!

144
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,760
- Let's go! - Let's go!

145
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,620
The Tamagotamatsuri!

146
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,080
These guys are like a fish in water.

147
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,600
They drink from the roots.

148
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,180
He loves festivals.

149
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,160
Alright, let's go!

150
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,760
But festivals are nice.

151
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,620
The more people, the more fun it is.

152
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,960
Well, well.

153
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,840
Cheers!

154
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,340
Thank you, Ryo. It was a great success.

155
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,720
As expected of Ryo.

156
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,600
The more people gather in this way, the more I appreciate the shopping district.

157
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,920
Would you like to think of something else that will make you want to come back?

158
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,480
Make me want to come back?

159
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,820
Yes! We will plan a festival from now to the next.

160
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,960
That's good! A festival from now to the next!

161
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,360
A festival throughout the year?

162
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,460
It's going to be a hot topic!

163
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,580
Alright! Then, let's see what comes next!

164
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,420
A donation?

165
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,960
There's another festival?

166
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,480
The one from last year.

167
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,620
The Tanabota Festival.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,880
The one from this year.

169
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,320
The Kameari Neboke Festival.

170
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,020
No way! We just started the festival.

171
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,100
From now on, we're going to have festivals every week!

172
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,800
The next week is the Don Taku Festival.

173
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,460
Then, the Samba Carnival.

174
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,760
Then, the Hada Ka Yaro.

175
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,960
This year, we're going to have the Special Thanks Festival!

176
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,500
Every week?

177
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,440
As expected, every week is a lot of money.

178
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,280
Even if it's only 300 yen per month, it's nothing.

179
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,420
Alright! Let's get the tax!

180
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,840
Tax?

181
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,040
Are you serious, Senpai?

182
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,180
I'm serious about it!

183
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,100
There's national tax and national tax.

184
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,660
It doesn't matter if there's a tax on the government.

185
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,960
There's something we can't pay if it's the government's tax.

186
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,040
I'll make them pay it as a tax!

187
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,860
But, we can't raise the price.

188
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,300
I've thought about that too.

189
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,060
How do we get the government's tax?

190
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,840
We can bet on anything.

191
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,600
But, will everyone pay it honestly?

192
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,880
That's why the currency is not a coin.

193
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,080
It's a hectopascal.

194
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,960
100 hectopascal is 10,000 tons, so it's 112.5 yen.

195
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,220
This is cheap.

196
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,220
It's a pain in the ass to calculate.

197
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,060
Everyone pays for it because they don't know what it is.

198
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,060
How cunning!

199
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,440
First, we'll get the tax from the small house in the town.

200
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,540
It's a tax of 1,000 hectopascal per year.

201
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,460
100 hectopascal is 10,112.5 yen, so it's 11,125 yen.

202
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,580
It's a bit expensive.

203
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
We'll get the house as well.

204
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,860
1,000 hectopascal.

205
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,300
Plus, we'll get the tax for pets.

206
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,720
500 per month for the lottery.

207
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,540
100 per month for the magazine.

208
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,400
How's that?

209
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,340
It's cheap, isn't it?

210
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,040
We'll get the tax from the children too.

211
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,880
It's 100 hectopascal for the game.

212
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,120
Plus, we'll get the tax from the bus and the patrol car.

213
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,920
The tax-man.

214
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,980
That's still too much.

215
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,940
That's right.

216
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,160
Nakagawa, you're a good man.

217
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,720
The highest tax is 3,000 hectopascal.

218
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,980
A good man?

219
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,280
Good men have a lot of benefits in the world.

220
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,060
So, we have to pay a lot of taxes.

221
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,240
I see.

222
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,640
Plus, the model body tax is 180 cm or more.

223
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,720
Plus, the playboy tax is 9,800 hectopascal.

224
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,520
That's too much.

225
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,520
Reiko!

226
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,300
Reiko has 3,000 beautiful tax.

227
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,140
Plus, the model body tax, breast milk tax, seduction tax,

228
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,120
and breast milk tax.

229
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,700
That's too much!

230
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,420
We'll get the tax from the children too.

231
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,800
Are you kidding?

232
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,020
I don't live in this town.

233
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
If you step into this town,

234
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,600
you'll have to abide by this law.

235
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,440
Do I have to pay the tax?

236
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,540
You don't have to.

237
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,140
It's in the basic construction.

238
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,880
I guess I'll get the tax from the children.

239
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,520
What are you talking about?

240
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,720
Chief.

241
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,920
Chief! Congratulations!

242
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,180
What's the matter?

243
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,160
The chief is in a bad situation.

244
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,120
The tax is coming back.

245
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,460
The tax is coming back?

246
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,340
I'm so glad.

247
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,140
The annual tax is 2,000 hectopascal.

248
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,180
I'll pay the tax more and more.

249
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,020
You guys are so hardworking.

250
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,780
Here's the tax.

251
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,660
95 hectopascal.

252
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,940
The tax?

253
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,020
It's for the city.

254
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,640
Is that possible?

255
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,380
It's to make the next Kameyari.

256
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,340
Get it out of here.

257
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,380
You guys are so hardworking.

258
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,840
I'll take the 68 hectopascal for the breast milk tax.

259
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,440
What?

260
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,960
What are you talking about?

261
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,100
Here's the 111 hectopascal for the cell phone tax.

262
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,800
Don't mess with me.

263
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,000
The tax for the mouthwash tax and the tobacco tax.

264
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,200
Pay it now.

265
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,780
I'll pay the tax.

266
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,720
Okay.

267
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,920
Stop!

268
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,280
I'll get the breast milk tax from now on.

269
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,520
But we live over there.

270
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,980
This is the station.

271
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,540
If you take the dog, you'll get the pet tax.

272
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,360
This is enough for the next sleepwalking festival.

273
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,060
No, not yet.

274
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,340
We don't have enough money for the construction of the new building.

275
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,040
The new building?

276
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,740
Weren't you waiting for me at the festival?

277
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,420
The time is already the 21st century.

278
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,820
Can you build a 21st century town in a place like Nagaya that looks like this?

279
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,640
For the 21st century, you need a suitable building for the 21st century.

280
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,700
That's the new building.

281
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,580
The festival is after that.

282
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,540
Is that so?

283
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,560
I'll collect the tax.

284
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,780
It's nice to have a place to look down on people.

285
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,820
I'll decide the production at this height.

286
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,060
Ryo, come down here.

287
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,100
Do you think you can build a building like this with 50 million yen?

288
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,840
Who are you talking to, chief?

289
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,860
I'm the temporary chairman of the council, who has been appointed to the full power.

290
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,480
I want you to keep your mouth shut on everything I do.

291
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,560
But you're doing too much.

292
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:30,920
That's not enough.

293
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,760
I'm going to change Japan from a turtle.

294
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,800
Senior!

295
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,340
Ryo!

296
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,240
Ryo!

297
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,240
Building a new building was bad.

298
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,700
The lecture call was all over the place.

299
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:39,800
What?

300
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,260
The tax is too high.

301
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,440
More and more people are leaving the town.

302
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,200
There are no more people in the shopping street.

303
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,380
It's becoming a ghost town.

304
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,380
The Hekto Pascal of the shopping street is in a big trouble.

305
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,580
What?

306
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,860
Look at the sky.

307
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,960
What is a ghost town?

308
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,480
There are so many people.

309
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,380
It's a ghost town!

310
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,740
That's the people who treat you like a senior.

311
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,880
What?

312
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:07,960
Ryo!

313
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,560
Now, you can have fun here.

314
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,760
And the chief and the baton are not here.

315
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,400
No, they're not.

316
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,480
What are you doing?

317
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,260
Ryo!

318
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:21,900
Ryo!

319
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,060
Ryo!

320
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,320
Ryo!

321
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,120
Ryo!

322
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,760
Ryo!

323
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,020
Ryo!

324
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,100
Ryo!

325
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,260
Ryo!

326
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,020
Ryo!

327
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,060
The chief got hurt?

328
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,500
I know.

329
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,780
He was fixing the roof then slipped from the responsibility ladder.

330
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,280
Because he's not used to it.

331
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,020
Ryo, did you visit him?

332
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,220
Really?

333
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,400
Excuse me.

334
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,200
Huh?

335
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,740
Hey, Ryo-san.

336
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,720
You got hurt, huh? I'll take care of it.

337
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,900
Hey, how's it going?

338
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,340
You're back at the super-unit again!

339
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,600
No, I'm not. That was a bad news, right?

340
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,400
I'm just a visitor. I fell off the ladder.

341
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,340
I see. You're very sharp when you think about the super-unit.

342
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,720
Give it to me.

343
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,600
What about the super-unit?

344
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,560
I want to find something unique about this super-unit.

345
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,260
A city with UFOs, dinosaurs, and a city with an iron fence.

346
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,700
I see. So you want to gather people and create a city like that.

347
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,220
Okay, leave it to me.

348
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,140
Wait, Ryo-san!

349
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,380
I'm not good at making money like I was before!

350
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,760
I know, but there's no way to do it right.

351
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,420
But it's a city with a lot of old people.

352
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,780
Where's grandma?

353
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,980
Huh?

354
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,540
I don't know.

355
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,640
I'm going to visit the old people and the old people.

356
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,460
Oh, so you're going to visit grandma's old city.

357
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,080
The young people are going to visit the old city, the old people are going to visit the old city, and the old people are going to visit the old city.

358
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,560
Ryo-san, wait!

359
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,420
I left everything to you the other day!

360
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,620
That's right! We're going to make the Kamihari your old city!

361
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,460
Leave it to me!

362
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,460
Hey, Ryo-san!

363
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,020
Ryo-san, what are you going to do next?

364
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,400
Well, look at this.

365
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,260
What?

366
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,300
Grandpa's Harajuku?

367
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,580
Now, the old people have no place to play with money.

368
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,660
I'll gather old people from all over the country here.

369
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,360
How?

370
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,460
For example, in the front.

371
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,920
The tiles are all made of iron.

372
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
And the wall is a paradise.

373
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,580
There's a karaoke room in the public hall.

374
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,240
The front is the world's most destroyed city, Daimihon-ichi.

375
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,420
Blood pressure is measured everywhere in the shopping street.

376
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,640
We hold a handmade diabetes medicine class.

377
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,800
In addition, the park is the hero of the old people's world, the statue of Mito Komon.

378
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,440
With this much, there's no doubt that the old people will leave and come to visit.

379
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,680
Why?

380
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,260
I don't know.

381
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,260
Why are you here?

382
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,880
I don't know at all!

383
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,440
The gap between the old man Ryo-chan and the real old man seems to be too big.

384
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,240
Isn't it best to ask the elderly, old people?

385
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,620
Hmm...

386
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,040
Oh, that old friend...

387
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,940
Hmm...

388
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,220
Ah...

389
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,540
I have an unpleasant face.

390
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,240
I just thought of something.

391
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,960
What's that face?

392
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,680
Is it real?

393
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,240
Oh, it's Ryo-chan's grandfather.

394
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,160
Ryo-chan is a good-for-nothing.

395
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,060
He's a good-for-nothing, but he's a good-for-nothing.

396
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,960
That's perfect.

397
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,040
Why don't you ask your grandfather?

398
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,880
That's right, Ryo-chan.

399
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,520
He says he's older than a turtle.

400
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,580
He says he's older than a turtle.

401
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,680
Is it really going well?

402
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,480
Israel is a failure.

403
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,740
It's for the sake of cute grandchildren.

404
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,460
I'm worried about that lightness.

405
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,240
I haven't lived for 104 years.

406
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,660
I have the know-how to meet the needs of my grandparents.

407
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,020
My employee's average age is 88 years old.

408
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,320
What?

409
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,440
He's a designer of beautiful girl characters.

410
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,480
His name is Adam.

411
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,920
He's 92 years old.

412
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,660
He was also at Mr. Shigeru Sugiura's place.

413
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,860
The gap between characters is amazing.

414
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,500
He's 87 years old.

415
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,680
He's in charge of robot mecha design.

416
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,940
Robots are also like now.

417
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,360
Now, he's developing a fighting game for the elderly.

418
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,380
Fighting game?

419
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,960
Does your grandfather play fighting games?

420
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,800
In games, even my grandfather can be a superman.

421
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,600
He's a great guy who can beat up young people instead of himself.

422
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,680
Lord Butsumi X 3

423
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,520
All the players have a strong and powerful mind.

424
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,940
What's better than your grandfather?

425
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,480
I'm thinking about getting him to stand on that major stage.

426
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,120
That is the most difficult question.

427
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,960
Is it OK?

428
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,680
Your grandfather has a strong mind, that's why.

429
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,840
You have a strong mind?

430
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,640
Yes.

431
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,680
Is that a match?

432
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,380
A match?

433
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,980
Don't you think it's a game?

434
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,140
I would be fine.

435
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,880
You're looking for a match.

436
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,260
That's right. Leave it to me.

437
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,360
First, the battle is...

438
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,720
Bandai has young and beautiful women.

439
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,820
They wear a big TV with a swimsuit instead of a mask.

440
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,060
At the public hall, they have a concert with the old men in a band.

441
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,600
At the square in front of the station, there is a para-para classroom.

442
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,580
At the shopping street, there is a silver plicke.

443
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,620
You can also take a two-shot with Harase Tsuko and Beatrix.

444
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,260
And there is a beam center for old men.

445
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,580
Go away, old woman.

446
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,500
At the movie theater, they have a high blood pressure ojingerion, a super-large SF movie.

447
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,460
Damn it, young man.

448
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,760
High blood pressure beam.

449
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,580
Next, Ojingerion.

450
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,420
They also have a convenience store for old men.

451
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,600
This is great.

452
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,240
If they are all together, they will be able to push the old man away.

453
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,140
Wow, they are amazing.

454
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,600
They are all old men, whether they look to the right or left.

455
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,500
The Kameari Ojingerion project is a great success.

456
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,380
Ryo, this time it is a great success.

457
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,760
Sales have increased by 50%.

458
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,800
Our shop has also increased by 35%.

459
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,040
We are also growing.

460
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,640
Let's do this.

461
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,420
The Kameari is the most popular one in Japan now.

462
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,820
The most popular one in Japan...

463
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,500
We are the best, right?

464
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:06,880
Great!

465
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,980
Next, this one.

466
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,120
Senior!

467
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,420
What's this?

468
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,980
You are doing the old man's woodstock?

469
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,600
You know what?

470
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:20,220
We will gather old men all over the world and hold a big event in Kameari.

471
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,560
That's great.

472
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,680
Use the internet to call the old men all over the world.

473
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,280
I see.

474
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,840
Hurry up!

475
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,220
Make an airport in the river in Arakawa,

476
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,100
and take the old man from the world by direct flight!

477
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,320
The old man is back on his feet again,

478
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,700
and he's started something?

479
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,740
Yes, it's an international airport for the old man.

480
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,520
He's going to gather the old man from the world in Kameari.

481
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,000
And he's going to make a new hotel,

482
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,260
for the old man.

483
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,140
I don't know where to stay,

484
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,480
that idiot.

485
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,780
Let's go to Kameari!

486
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,340
Kameari is over there!

487
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,400
Let's go to Kameari!

488
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:27,020
Let's go to Kameari!

489
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,520
Kameari!

490
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,860
It's Kameari!

491
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,540
Kameari is here, Kankichi!

492
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,920
I did it!

493
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,980
I did it!

494
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,620
It was a big success!

495
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,340
It was a big success!

496
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,820
It was a big success!

497
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,460
Too many idiots gathered.

498
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,000
Did we get too close?

499
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,280
Ryo, do something!

500
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,520
With this, the

501
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,460
The old man is overflowing and the shopping street will be broken!

502
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,180
But, that's true...

503
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,860
Here it comes again!

504
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,860
I'm not dead!

505
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,480
Everyone, to the death of the half-dead!

506
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,400
-Nyaaah! -Nyaaah!

507
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:13,900
Huh?

508
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
-Nyaaah! -Nyaaah!

509
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,480
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

510
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,320
Then, the rest is up to the veteran chairman...

511
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,800
Again, that hand!

512
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,180
-Nyaaah! -Nyaaah!

513
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,340
-Nyaaah! -Nyaaah!

514
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:26,860
Damn it!

515
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,240
Nyaaah!

516
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,020
-Nyaaah! -Nyaaah!

517
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,900
Whoa! I'm being swallowed by the old man's waves!

518
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,220
-Nyaaah! -Nyaaah!

519
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,440
-Nyaaah! -Nyaaah!

520
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,760
-Nyaaah! -Nyaaah!

521
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,700
-Nyaaah! -Nyaaah!

522
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,900
-Nyaaah! -Nyaaah!

523
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:42,940
Nyaaah!

524
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,720
The chairman is the second chairman?

525
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,200
That's right.

526
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,580
There were many things that hurt my stomach and my stomach.

527
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,740
Ryo, why don't you go visit him?

528
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,480
Hmm...

529
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,440
That's right.

530
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,840
That's what I'll do.

531
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,480
I'll visit him, huh?

532
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,400
Huh?

533
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,660
You don't have to come!

534
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
Huh?

535
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:55,840
