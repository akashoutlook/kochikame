Hm?

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,640
What's wrong, young lady?

27
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,620
I'm hungry.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,460
You haven't eaten lunch yet?

29
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,200
No.

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,060
What about Mama?

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,360
I'm busy right now, so I'll leave you to it.

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,480
I'm busy right now, so I'll leave you to it.

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,320
I'm busy right now, so I'll leave you to it.

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,260
What are you doing?

35
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,460
Don't let me eat lunch with this cute young lady.

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,280
Aren't you her mother?

37
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,740
You're a big burden.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,580
What right do you have to get in my way?

39
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,820
It has nothing to do with you, right?

40
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:37,500
No!

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,840
Let me go.

42
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm really sorry.

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,260
I won't leave my daughter alone again.

44
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,420
I won't leave my daughter alone again.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,600
Mariko, let's go eat.

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,880
Okay.

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,560
Thank you.

48
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,400
Thank you.

49
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,760
Thank you.

50
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,380
Thank you.

51
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,880
I'm feeling a little now.

52
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,260
I feel like I'm having a little fun.

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,400
Got it.

54
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,040
I feel like I'm having a little fun.

55
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,660
I feel like I'm having a little fun.

56
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,400
Isn't that a good ones?

57
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,760
I don't want this kind of flower.

58
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,940
You're the perfect woman for my Porsche's passenger seat.

59
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,460
This kind of rose is only good for a newbie.

60
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,620
I-Is that so?

61
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,020
How about we drive to Yokohama from now on?

62
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,140
We can have dinner at a fancy restaurant and watch the sunset.

63
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,860
But we're still on duty.

64
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,720
Pearl White's Porsche is unusual.

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,760
Hm?

66
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,380
Pearl White's Porsche is unusual.

67
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,140
Pearl White's Porsche is unusual.

68
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,160
He's very careful.

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,960
I'm glad to meet a girl who knows the unique model of the first-class.

70
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,180
Mademoiselle...

71
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,680
Do you mean Mademoiselle?

72
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,940
That's right. You are my ideal Madom... Madom...

73
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,560
Madomazel.

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,520
In other words, this car's passenger seat is prepared for you.

75
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,540
Why don't you drive to Yokohama?

76
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,860
Sorry, but I prefer the driver's seat to the passenger seat.

77
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,260
Besides, I shouldn't use words that I'm not used to.

78
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,600
You shouldn't use words that you're not used to.

79
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,660
Miss, I'm super rich Shiratori Reiji.

80
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,780
I want to know where I come from.

81
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,300
Of course, I want to know where I come from.

82
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,380
I haven't heard of it.

83
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,600
Let's go.

84
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,960
Where is my home?

85
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,360
Of course, I'm a power tycoon.

86
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,420
I have 150 plots of land.

87
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,200
What? You're super rich?

88
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,940
It's not a big deal.

89
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,680
You always brag about yourself like that.

90
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,680
You should pay the fine.

91
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,540
I don't want to hear any bad words.

92
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,120
Miss, I have a Porsche.

93
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,220
You can't get away from me.

94
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,360
I'll catch up with him.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,540
He'll catch up with you.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,920
Don't worry.

97
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,780
He won't catch up with you.

98
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,700
Damn it!

99
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,460
Why can't you follow my fast shifting?

100
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,580
I heard that there are more women with Pachinko addiction.

101
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,500
I heard that there are more women with Pachinko addiction.

102
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,800
I didn't know you had a mother like that.

103
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,020
It's a big social problem.

104
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,440
What?

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,200
What?

106
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,020
What's wrong?

107
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,360
I heard you say it's a big social problem.

108
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,800
Ryotsu, it's good to be interested in social problems.

109
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,900
Really?

110
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,660
I can't get paid because there are more female customers.

111
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,620
I can't get paid because there are more female customers.

112
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,660
I have to do something about it.

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,040
Idiot!

114
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,680
You're not a man.

115
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,840
Manager Kim!

116
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,700
What's this sound?

117
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,900
I knew it.

118
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,380
I'm in trouble.

119
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,700
Reiko, what's wrong?

120
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,880
The man in the Porsche is getting angry.

121
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,220
He's getting angry.

122
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,660
Finally, he's getting angry.

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,040
Porsche will cry if he hears that.

124
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,200
Damn it!

125
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,060
Why did you stop?

126
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:17,780
You're a bad driver.

127
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,420
Who are you?

128
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,700
The diamond Rollax with diamond shining on the soil!

129
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,720
A jacket and coat by Karyo Mani!

130
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,800
The ostentatious Fantix!

131
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,120
The Możuвиhan is a spectrums the konkretint!

132
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,860
The whole body, 1,000,000 yen!

133
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,580
My name is Sir. Super Money-Buy thì Sir.

134
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,560
You're a descendant of the super Saiyan?

135
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,760
No, I'm not!

136
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,420
It's just a moronic.

137
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,860
Let's come back!

138
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,460
Hey!

139
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,340
What?

140
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,720
You're so brave to ignore me.

141
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,880
I'll praise you.

142
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,800
Don't come in here without permission!

143
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,620
You're no use.

144
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,240
Get out of my way.

145
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,340
What I'm interested in is...

146
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,240
You.

147
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,240
I hate you for making me fall in love with this Shiratori Reiji.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,080
I'm busy today. See you later.

149
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,440
No, no.

150
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,440
You can't run away from me anymore.

151
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,820
You're a lucky man who can ride my Porsche.

152
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,380
I don't want to ride your Enst Corp Porsche.

153
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,720
I stopped at that place.

154
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,060
I'm not Enst, no matter what.

155
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,080
I got it. Don't lie to me.

156
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,160
Miss, let's go for a drive with my Porsche.

157
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,220
I'm on a business trip, so I can't.

158
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,240
How about a meal after work?

159
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,800
There's a restaurant in Ginza.

160
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,380
I have something to do tonight.

161
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,340
What? Where's my house?

162
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,420
It's 150 pcs of lotus root soup.

163
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,920
I just came here.

164
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,760
I see.

165
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,060
Huh? My father?

166
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,380
He's talking to himself.

167
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,300
He's the president of Shiratori Railways.

168
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,180
I'm going to be the president in the future.

169
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,240
Isn't that great?

170
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,440
I told you not to run away, didn't I?

171
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,680
Shiratori Railways is a top-notch company.

172
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,020
That is a TV commercial.

173
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,900
Oh, you mean the person who talks with his parents out on the beach.

174
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,520
Do you know that, poor people?

175
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,500
He is stubborn and stubborn-headed.

176
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,660
That's because he deals with iron.

177
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,920
He's had a life of his life.

178
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,800
Ha! Ha!

179
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Ha! Ha!

180
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,760
Ha! Ha!

181
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,020
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

182
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,400
The Shiratoritekkojo

183
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,840
My father is in that commercial.

184
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,440
How is it?

185
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,120
I get the impression that he is feeling cold.

186
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,660
Shut up!

187
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,700
You've been complaining about it for a while.

188
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,580
I don't like super poor people because of this.

189
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,980
Reiko, you have to move to the right of him to escape.

190
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,360
Okay.

191
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,560
You don't know the difficulties of the family.

192
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:08,760
You don't know the difficulties of the family.

193
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,920
Stop being so grumpy.

194
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,680
Huh?

195
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,460
How many times do I have to tell you?

196
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,060
Hey, you!

197
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,260
Hey, you!

198
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:23,740
Hey, you! What?

199
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,380
Hey, you! What?

200
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:24,700
Damn!

201
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,260
Don't underestimate me!

202
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:36,560
I-I will never give up!

203
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,520
I will never give up!

204
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:38,540
I will never give up!

205
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,980
I will forgive him!

206
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,960
He's still grueling.

207
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,640
Lilan, wait a minute!

208
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
Lilan, wait a minute!

209
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,300
Lilan, wait a minute!

210
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,780
And what about that Shiratori guy?

211
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,780
He might still be hospitalized.

212
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,740
But he's still like that.

213
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,420
He's got the same money, but he's not like Reiko or Nakagawa.

214
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,220
That Shiratori guy.

215
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,180
Maybe that's because of his father.

216
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,100
What? You know him?

217
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,360
Shiratori Steelworks is a sub-company of my father's company.

218
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,500
Oh, really?

219
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,860
What? You don't know the lady from the parent company?

220
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,220
You're so dumb.

221
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,860
If you say something, I'll do it.

222
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,660
I'm gonna rip you apart, you idiot!

223
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,440
Man, don't you have to be so poor in the station!

224
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,200
Can you pay me?

225
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,620
I've had to pay you every day.

226
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,820
We're not far.

227
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,640
Be quiet!

228
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,440
This is not Enst!

229
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,640
We're trying to stop you!

230
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,260
Why?

231
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,160
Do you swear?

232
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,720
How dare you!

233
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:06,920
You're a tough one.

234
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,100
Miss, I'm going to drive you today.

235
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm going to be an enlist soon, so I don't want to.

236
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,740
Shut up!

237
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,040
You shouldn't push yourself to drive a Porsche.

238
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,940
I'm a loser!

239
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,120
You!

240
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,180
You're quite handsome.

241
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,700
Are you her lover?

242
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,480
Yes.

243
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,300
Even if you're a lover, you can't win.

244
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,160
Because I'm a man.

245
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,700
I'm a man.

246
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,120
I'm a man.

247
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:50,540
And I have a white Porsche.

248
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
Stop it!

249
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,660
You're a loser!

250
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,060
You're a loser!

251
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,120
Damn it!

252
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,060
You're a loser!

253
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't want to wait here.

254
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,140
I'm a loser!

255
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,880
Shut up!

256
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,520
I'm a loser!

257
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,540
I'm a loser!

258
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,280
You're a loser!

259
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:20,040
If you look at the camera, you'll get a backache.

260
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,420
You hit me with a bullet?

261
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,800
I don't know how to do it.

262
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,640
You're a loser!

263
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,040
How much is your salary?

264
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,300
About 220,000 yen.

265
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,260
You'll pay the same amount for one pair of shoes.

266
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,860
Only one shoe will be paid for my salary?

267
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,140
I feel so miserable.

268
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,660
How much do you want?

269
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,120
I don't care.

270
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,100
About 700 million yen.

271
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,580
You can't pay the same amount for Lorax's annointing gold modeling mirror.

272
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,080
Damn it!

273
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,260
I did it again.

274
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,900
Don't underestimate a super rich shiratorireiji.

275
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,520
Don't underestimate us!

276
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,680
Now you know the difference between super poor and super rich!

277
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,380
Hahaha, now I know.

278
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,860
Now, if you're with such poor people, you'll become poor.

279
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,540
Let's go to a rich meal together.

280
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,600
Stop it!

281
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,180
Oh no, Reiko is out!

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,380
I've been telling you!

283
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,620
Stop it, Reiko!

284
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,900
Let go of me, Ryo-chan!

285
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,560
Calm down, Reiko!

286
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,360
Aren't you frustrated that he said that?

287
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,180
Ryo-chan is always completely out of control!

288
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,780
That's true, but that kind of man doesn't know what to do if he's being too proud.

289
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,320
Go out with him right away.

290
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,840
Huh?

291
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,260
Of course, you're not alone.

292
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,260
Your work is almost done.

293
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,340
Nagagawa and I will go with you to the bodyguard.

294
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,460
What?

295
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,880
You're not alone.

296
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Are you trying to get to the table?

297
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm just a bodyguard.

298
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,860
I see.

299
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,300
Well, if you're with me.

300
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,780
Okay, deal.

301
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,080
Why do I have to treat them like that?

302
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,680
Did you say something?

303
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,060
Well, I said that I thought it would be nice to treat poor people and rich people together.

304
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
I said that it would be nice to treat them like that.

305
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,580
My Ferrari can carry four people.

306
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,760
If you follow him in a Ferrari, his pride will be hurt.

307
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,760
He'll be pampered and fed.

308
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,520
So, Reiko is a food.

309
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,740
As expected!

310
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,920
Super poor man's thinking is amazing!

311
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,220
But he can't do anything about that driving.

312
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,220
This will open up the world.

313
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,960
I've been running in the road all the time.

314
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,940
Reiko Akimoto.

315
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,940
What a nice name.

316
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,700
So, where do you live?

317
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,020
I live in Hiro.

318
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,120
Oh, it's a luxury residential area next to the garden.

319
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
Huh? With your parents?

320
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,360
No, I live alone.

321
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,420
Oh, that's a one-room apartment.

322
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,280
It's a 4LDK apartment.

323
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,080
Oh, really?

324
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,860
Then, the rent must be expensive.

325
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,480
My father bought it for me, so I don't pay rent.

326
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,660
You were quite rich.

327
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,980
So, what about your family?

328
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,220
I'm from Ashiya.

329
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,500
You're the head of the power plant in Kansai.

330
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,160
Then, how much is your land?

331
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,560
About 150 square meters?

332
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,400
A little more than that.

333
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,200
200 square meters?

334
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,300
A little more.

335
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,120
Then, 300 square meters?

336
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,320
Maybe 500 square meters.

337
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,400
500 square meters!

338
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,880
Idiot, he's acting again.

339
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,160
Don't worry, Reiji.

340
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,840
Even if it's 500 square meters, it's definitely a mountain without Ashiya.

341
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,080
By the way, I'm a royal family.

342
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,020
Where's your university from?

343
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,300
It's a luxury university.

344
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,740
I won!

345
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,200
It's a good university for young girls.

346
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,180
I heard you can enter it with an escalator from kindergarten.

347
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,340
I'm from a university.

348
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,980
Until then, it was a high school in St. Paul's University.

349
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,400
I don't know such a university.

350
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,600
It's a very strict school for all students.

351
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,660
Do you know it?

352
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,620
I know it.

353
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,320
I think it was in Chiba.

354
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,780
It's Switzerland.

355
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,720
Switzerland!

356
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,220
Siratori, shall we change the driver?

357
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,320
It's okay.

358
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,540
But there's a huge traffic jam behind us.

359
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,760
Idiot, you can't get out if you get stuck!

360
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,040
I know!

361
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,660
Hurry up!

362
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,040
Oh, Reiko's changed!

363
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,440
Reiko has her A-class license.

364
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,400
Driver, please follow them so you don't lose sight of them.

365
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,780
Okay.

366
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:14,540
That's too good!

367
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,300
Episode 1: The

368
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,620
I come to this shop often, but I can't help it.

369
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,060
Ah, this is Akimoto-sama.

370
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,340
Ah, so you're here with Nakagawa-sama.

371
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,520
Welcome.

372
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,520
Hello.

373
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,320
Come, this way.

374
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,340
Hey! Why didn't you greet me?

375
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,980
Excuse me, but who are you?

376
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,300
I'm Shiratori Reiji, the one who made an appointment.

377
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,160
I'll pay for the meal.

378
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,400
Excuse me.

379
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,140
I made an appointment with two people.

380
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,800
I'll show you the table of four people.

381
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,400
Come, this way.

382
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
But Reiko-san, anyway,

383
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,120
I didn't expect you to come to such a high-class restaurant.

384
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,960
No, I didn't.

385
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,580
I came here once or twice.

386
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,240
What? You've only come once or twice?

387
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,860
Don't surprise me.

388
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,760
Hahaha.

389
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,740
Every week, though.

390
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,180
Hey, super rich man.

391
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:22,720
Don't lose.

392
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,500
Hmph.

393
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,520
It's not the number of times.

394
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,340
It's how much money you spend at once.

395
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,220
You can order anything you want.

396
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,520
As expected, super rich people have different tickets.

397
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,940
Yes. As expected, super rich people have different tickets.

398
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,100
Really?

399
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,040
Hahaha.

400
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,560
Hmm...

401
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,120
I've been looking at the voting date map,

402
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,800
but it's so common.

403
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,440
I've been looking at the voting date map, but it's so common.

404
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,760
Sir, have you made your order?

405
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,520
Oh, I've made my order.

406
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,740
Well...

407
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,120
Oh, I've made my order.

408
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,300
Oh, I've made my order.

409
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,980
I'll write it all down in French.

410
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,640
Hey, what are you doing?

411
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,980
Well, all the dishes here are delicious.

412
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,660
I'm just wondering.

413
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,380
What's going on?

414
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,280
Well, I'm going to go top of the list when I get here.

415
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,080
Won't it be better to leave it to Chef No. 20?

416
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,540
Huh?

417
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,400
Well, that's too bad.

418
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,180
I meant to do the same as you did.

419
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,520
Well, all of us super rich people have a good taste.

420
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,780
Hahaha.

421
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,960
I'll do the same.

422
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,100
I'll do the same.

423
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,060
Yes, sir.

424
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,840
I'm free.

425
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,620
That seems quite internacional.

426
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,120
Lord Nakagawa?

427
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,580
This one is fine.

428
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,480
Welcome.

429
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,660
If you'd like, we have a VIP room available.

430
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,200
Oh, I see.

431
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,240
I wonder if I've been found out by the vice president of Shiratori Tekko.

432
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,500
I'll be in your care.

433
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,960
I'm fine here.

434
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,800
Good-bye.

435
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,260
Oh, wait!

436
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,240
I told you I was going!

437
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,660
Damn it!

438
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,240
Well, well, I'm a super rich guy.

439
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,460
Don't worry about it!

440
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,380
Ah, ah, ah!

441
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,720
I always wanted to try at the government office.

442
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,920
Can I order some steak?

443
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,620
Please, please!

444
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,220
Excuse me, I'd like an extra steak.

445
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,980
Oh, Ryo-chan...

446
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,260
If I'm in your care, I'd like an 82-year-old Bordeaux steak.

447
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,940
I think an 83-year-old steak is better than an 82-year-old steak.

448
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,880
You're really a well-versed man, Lord Nakagawa.

449
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,480
Hey!

450
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,440
The super rich guy is the one who pays for the money!

451
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,200
It's me! Why didn't you ask me!?

452
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,600
Huh?

453
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,580
You don't ask him about me, do you?

454
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,560
Why, why do you all ignore me?

455
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,420
Hey, Meiji!

456
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:49,880
Huh?

457
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,060
Father!

458
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,440
Oh, Mr. President's son?

459
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,060
Yeah. Wait a minute.

460
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,280
So you came too?

461
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,020
Father is as lively as ever.

462
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,940
It's a secret from your mother.

463
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,580
Huh?

464
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,240
Huh?

465
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,320
Huh?

466
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,660
Hey, you're a good boy.

467
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,640
Where did you get this?

468
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,760
I don't like it.

469
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,460
Unlike my father, I'm not as good as my sister.

470
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,520
But I'll show her right away.

471
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

472
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,100
Let me introduce you.

473
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,640
Here.

474
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,860
Good evening, Mr. President.

475
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,580
No!

476
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,400
Huh? Do you know him?

477
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,640
You!

478
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,260
You're so annoying!

479
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:33,920
You're so annoying!

480
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,320
You're such a fool from the Akimoto organization!

481
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,260
You're such a dirty bastard!

482
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,820
I'm very sorry to make you mess with me!

483
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,620
M-Mr. President!

484
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,060
You don't have to do that!

485
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,780
Why the hell do you say that!?

486
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,140
I'm a friend of Akimoto's organization!

487
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,280
Th-th-that's enough!

488
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,520
I'm his father, you know.

489
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,180
Tell me what's wrong!

490
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,100
It's okay.

491
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,020
Super Kame Mochi has a good personality.

492
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,380
Huh?

493
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:01,820
Yeah.

494
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,280
What's Kaori doing here?

495
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,940
I did something bad to him.

496
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,180
You don't have any responsibility.

497
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,860
He's the one who called us.

498
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,400
But...

499
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,840
Hello, everyone.

500
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,240
Who are you?

501
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,180
Mr. Shiratori.

502
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,400
What's wrong with your outfit?

503
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,560
My father was impressed by me after that,

504
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,120
and I became a super poor person.

505
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,260
I'm really sorry.

506
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,700
Don't worry.

507
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,120
I'll grow up soon

508
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,220
and become a super rich person.

509
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,160
Goodbye.

510
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,420
He's a tough guy.

511
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,960
Be a super rich person and

512
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,020
treat me to a feast.

513
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,460
I'm a super rich person!

514
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,040
Next time

515
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,460
Why am I digging a tunnel?

516
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,660
It's in the movie, isn't it?

517
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,380
I'm running away.

518
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,940
The chief locked me in a cage,

519
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,460
so I'm trying to dig a hole and escape.

520
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,120
Please wait for me, chief.

521
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,240
I'm going to revenge.

522
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,300
