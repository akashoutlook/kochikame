1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
They say lives.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,820
They say more lives.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,300
They say more people.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,200
When you watch TV,

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,640
brighten up your room,

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,840
and take a look from a distance.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,940
The people who don't have money,

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,700
come to me.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,360
I'm not here,

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,900
but I'm worried.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:35,880
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,880
It will be alright somehow

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,560
It will be alright somehow

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,060
Come to me if you don't have a job

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,480
I don't have one, but don't worry

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,120
Look, it's burning

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,140
The red cloud

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,540
It will be alright somehow

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,300
Do you understand?

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,460
Do you understand? Do you understand?

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,640
If you understand, then quietly follow me!

22
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,660
Bonus Soda Battle Seven

23
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,380
Bonus Soda Battle Seven

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,080
Bonus Soda Battle Seven

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,640
Bonus Soda Battle Seven

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,600
Bonus Soda Battle Seven

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:05,260
Now, we will start the 35th Ryoutsu-Kankichi Bonus Soda Battle Strategy Meeting.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,300
This year's strategy...

29
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,520
This year's strategy...

Hm?

62
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,080
Then, let's start the operation!

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,400
We are the ones who will win this year!

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,260
Yeah!

65
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,720
That's dangerous!

66
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,100
Ryo-san took a day off yesterday, and he's going somewhere!

67
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,780
What?!

68
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,860
What?!

69
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,820
The public in the store is probably very frustrated by now.

70
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,020
With these, they will be able to get bonuses anywhere in the country.

71
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,400
Then, you'll be able to keep up with them.

72
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,720
Momo

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,020
I was on a vacation before I knew it.

74
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,200
I borrowed money from you two days ago...

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,100
You're so stubborn.

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,280
Ryo, you're not stupid either.

77
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,080
We predicted that you would come again this year,

78
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,640
and we were in a hurry.

79
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,460
I-Is that so?

80
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,880
Damn it!

81
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,280
Ryo, you're so stubborn about things like this!

82
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,800
What are you going to do, Kuramo?

83
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,020
If this goes on, I'll lose the bonus battle without doing anything!

84
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,000
Mom!

85
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,720
Takashi! Takashi!

86
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,660
Thanks to the viewers' cooperation,

87
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,880
the mother and child who had been separated from their parents

88
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,680
are finally reunited!

89
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,560
Thank you so much!

90
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,140
We are sending you a live broadcast of the TV release investigation.

91
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:49,880
We have recruited a client.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,940
Your request will be sent to us right now.

93
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,440
This is it!

94
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,620
What's wrong, Kuramo?

95
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,560
We will change the strategy for this year!

96
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
The name is...

97
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,760
"Give me your tears! The strategy of the Great King of the Land!"

98
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,120
"Give me your tears! The strategy of the Great King of the Land!"

99
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,420
I will never let you escape, Ryo!

100
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,600
What should we do now?

101
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,000
I have borrowed money from the inside,

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,480
so I won't be able to drink and eat for a while.

103
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:30,860
What?

104
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,980
Isn't that him?

105
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm sure it's him.

106
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,620
I should contact him.

107
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,040
What?

108
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,560
Is there something on my face?

109
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,700
Huh?

110
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,380
Ah!

111
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,460
Ah!

112
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,160
Huh?

113
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,920
What's going on?

114
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,320
What's going on?

115
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,200
What's going on?

116
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,560
Huh?

117
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,020
What?

118
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,180
What's going on?

119
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,240
Why is my face on TV?

120
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,920
His name is Ryo Tsukankichi.

121
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,720
He is the benefactor of the client Ozaki's life.

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,960
What?

123
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,860
I want to thank him with my eyes.

124
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,780
Please!

125
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,020
Everyone in the country, please find Ryo!

126
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,840
Please!

127
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,740
He's a bad actor!

128
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,720
Hello?

129
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,660
I was watching TV just now.

130
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,680
I saw Ryo Tsukankichi here.

131
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,080
What?

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,980
Don't report him!

133
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,260
I was watching TV just now.

134
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,740
I saw Ryo Tsukankichi here.

135
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:25,940
Stop it!

136
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,620
Hello?

137
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,600
I saw him on TV.

138
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,140
I saw Ryo Tsukankichi here.

139
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,860
Yes, he's here.

140
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:33,800
Hello?

141
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,180
Ah!

142
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,760
Oh, no!

143
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,080
He'll find out I'm here!

144
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,040
Hey, wait for me!

145
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,280
Please let me in!

146
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,060
I want to meet him, Ryo!

147
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,640
Stop it!

148
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,180
It's dangerous!

149
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,500
Kill him!

150
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,160
I'll eat something.

151
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,400
Ryo!

152
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,880
Ryo!

153
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,200
What?

154
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,020
Mr. Tsukankichi Ryo!

155
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,380
We have a guest of honor to help us out!

156
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,500
I'd like to ask for your cooperation.

157
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,960
Huh?

158
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,660
F-fine!

159
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,420
Ugh!

160
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,700
See ya!

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,100
Everyone in the country, please!

162
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,900
Please find Ryo!

163
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,360
Please find Ryo!

164
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,800
Mr. Ryo!

165
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400
Mahjong projester: Yes Yes!

166
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,120
Mr. Ryo!

167
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,660
No way!

168
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,080
Damn it, there are too many people in the city.

169
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,920
I have to go somewhere where there are no people.

170
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,220
Sugii, more and more information is gathering.

171
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,080
It seems that we can find it surprisingly quickly.

172
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,220
No, the opponent is Ryo-san. I can not be careless.

173
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,220
Use the newspaper and the Internet fully.

174
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,900
Use anything that can be used.

175
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,460
We will be the winners this year!

176
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,400
We are the winners!

177
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,900
The game is over.

178
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,520
I will be the winner.

179
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,740
I came to a very strange place while avoiding the eyes of the people.

180
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,580
I came to a very strange place while avoiding the eyes of the people.

181
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,320
That is...

182
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,860
That is...

183
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,460
That is...

184
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,680
The police station, huh?

185
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,440
The police station, huh?

186
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,940
The police station, huh?

187
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,420
There is no one here?

188
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,220
There is no trace of people for many years.

189
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,200
It hurts!

190
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,360
Hey, sir.

191
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,360
What is it?

192
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,320
Hey, sir.

193
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,780
Hey, sir.

194
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,160
Sir, do not eat.

195
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,100
Hey, sir.

196
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,960
Hey, sir.

197
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,120
Well done!

198
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,700
Finally, a policeman has come to this village!

199
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:26,820
What?

200
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,140
What's wrong?

201
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,720
After the before deputy chief died at the age of 95 ten years ago.

202
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,380
Since then, there has been no policeman in this village.

203
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,960
He finally came here.

204
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,500
Oh, no! No!

205
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,280
I'm not here because I didn't recognize him.

206
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,220
I mean, he did not recognize me.

207
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,640
Everyone!

208
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,880
A policeman has come!

209
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,200
They're here!

210
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,240
Hey! Wait! Listen to me!

211
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,660
Ugh, shit.

212
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,420
Hey, everyone!

213
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,440
The people of our village are here!

214
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,520
Before they report us...

215
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,340
I have to get out of here somehow...

216
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,400
Hoi!

217
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,660
Hey!

218
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,380
Hey!

219
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,840
What's going on?

220
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,400
Huh?

221
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,720
It's just the old men and women.

222
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,220
We're going to prepare for the welcome party soon.

223
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,180
Wait for us.

224
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,260
Huh?

225
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,460
Come on, come on.

226
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,420
Let's drink.

227
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,480
There's a lot of food.

228
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,140
Don't hold back and eat.

229
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,700
Here.

230
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,000
Ah, ah.

231
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,520
Huh?

232
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,380
They're so flashy on TV that I can't recognize them.

233
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,360
Come to think of it, there's no TV in this room.

234
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,460
Hey, you guys.

235
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,460
Don't you watch TV much?

236
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,460
No, I don't.

237
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,480
I watch it properly.

238
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,500
I see.

239
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,160
Once a year, we all watch Kohaku.

240
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,120
What?

241
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,740
Just once a year?

242
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,760
That's enough.

243
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,040
By the way,

244
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,780
how many TVs do you have in the village?

245
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,860
There's only one that's as good as the public.

246
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,460
And it's color.

247
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,100
It's amazing.

248
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,580
Oh, I see.

249
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,140
Hmm...

250
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,160
Huh?

251
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,640
Then, until you get a bonus,

252
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,720
it's not a bad idea to hide here.

253
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,160
Okay.

254
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,720
If that's the case, I'll drink it.

255
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,980
It's delicious.

256
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,640
It's our local sake.

257
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,900
Come on, eat your food.

258
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,740
This is delicious.

259
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,560
I'll bring it tomorrow.

260
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,600
You don't have to worry about food while you're in this village,

261
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,800
Mr. Surrounder.

262
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,880
Really?

263
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,700
Yay!

264
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,980
Instead, stay here all the time,

265
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,800
Mr. Surrounder.

266
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,260
Yeah, I'm here.

267
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,180
I'll bring it to you.

268
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,700
Mr. Surrounder,

269
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,240
let's eat breakfast.

270
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,680
Oh, sorry.

271
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,360
Huh?

272
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,420
Oh, this looks delicious again.

273
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,560
I got everything from this village.

274
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,780
Mr. Surrounder,

275
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,380
a terrible thing happened.

276
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,520
Come here.

277
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,660
What?

278
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,520
An accident?

279
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,640
This way, this way.

280
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:35,760
Mr. Surrounder,

281
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,520
hurry up.

282
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,800
I didn't expect an accident in the middle of the mountain.

283
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,020
The chicken bird suddenly fell.

284
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,580
Why do you call me?

285
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,880
I'm not a guard.

286
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,360
Mr. Surrounder,

287
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,940
you saw me.

288
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,940
Is there someone at home?

289
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,200
No,

290
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,180
everyone in the house is out.

291
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,720
Then, are you a thief?

292
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,900
No way.

293
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,140
Idiot.

294
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,880
There's no one here who does such ill deeds.

295
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,060
There's someone here, after all.

296
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,340
I'm in the kitchen.

297
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,060
Don't move!

298
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,500
You're a cow's nose.

299
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,320
What?

300
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,800
What was that?

301
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,980
It was Hanataro who used to live in my house.

302
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,160
One day he suddenly jumped out of my house and started to fight with his friends in the village.

303
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,180
What a cow!

304
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,960
You were supposed to be fainted!

305
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,200
Damn it!

306
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,900
Did you get away?

307
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,380
Hanako!

308
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,140
He was also fainted.

309
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,900
What happened?

310
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,940
Hanako was on the path of evil!

311
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,640
Sir, please do something.

312
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,040
I'm not a health center.

313
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,720
You guys do something.

314
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,640
I should have closed the door.

315
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,320
I was beaten.

316
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,680
Did they do it?

317
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,300
I even brought a game and a plastic model to kill time.

318
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,940
Keep up with me.

319
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,760
All right.

320
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,300
Tomo!

321
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,900
Good night, Tomo!

322
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,920
I'm feeling so good!

323
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,760
Good night!

324
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,720
I understand your feeling.

325
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,000
Taro?

326
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,800
Yes?

327
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,020
You're so cute.

328
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,120
I'm Durchu.

329
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,300
What's wrong with you?

330
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,960
Don't think you can get away with this by making me angry!

331
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,940
There, there, there!

332
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,660
Idiot! You got caught!

333
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,360
You can't beat a human after all!

334
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,960
Oh, thank you, thank you!

335
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,180
You caught Hanataro so easily!

336
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,800
You're really something, Omawari-san!

337
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,780
Please stay in the village for a day at least.

338
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,160
If you keep standing here,

339
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,440
you'll end up with steak, tonkatsu, and roast chicken!

340
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,180
What's going on?

341
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,660
I thought I'd get a bonus the day after tomorrow,

342
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,960
but I can't get any information about Ryo-san.

343
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,900
He must have run away overseas!

344
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,120
He must have gone to Kukoya Port,

345
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:00,560
and if he goes to Kukoya Port,

346
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,140
he'll definitely catch the eye of someone!

347
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,360
He's disguised.

348
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,920
Even if he's disguised,

349
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,560
he can't hide his connected eyebrows!

350
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,100
Ryo-san's face has its own features.

351
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,500
Then where is Ryo-san now?

352
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,040
He's hiding somewhere in the countryside,

353
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,840
somewhere where the TV doesn't work.

354
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
That's it!

355
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,020
This is the last sighting information.

356
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,180
Should I set up a net in Ichikabachika?

357
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,580
What?

358
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,400
It seems like he got killed by the autumn typhoon.

359
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,720
He won't watch TV anyway, right?

360
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,940
But I can't let him get better by the new year.

361
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,400
The villagers will all watch Kohaku.

362
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,560
Oh well.

363
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,220
How's that?

364
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,300
Did you get it?

365
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,400
Oh! It's perfect!

366
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,300
About what he just said,

367
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,040
Akimoto-sensei is...

368
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,880
It's been a while since I watched TV.

369
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,000
It's been a while since I watched TV.

370
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,460
Today you've won a civil service educational bonus.

371
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,860
What?

372
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,480
That means you've forgotten something important...

373
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,580
Oh! You want me to have my bonus today, too?

374
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,060
This is not the time for this!

375
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,480
This is terrible!

376
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,920
Those boys are coming for you!

377
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,400
Damn, you're not coming for a while.

378
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,740
I'll borrow a tractor from the village.

379
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,900
Sir.

380
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,940
Yeah, that's just right.

381
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,620
Where are you going, sir?

382
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,380
Where?

383
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,460
I was thinking about something.

384
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,700
You'll stay here forever, won't you?

385
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,920
You're not going to take a break, are you?

386
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,700
No, I'm just going out for a bit.

387
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,080
I'll be back soon.

388
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,980
You're right.

389
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,300
You're the village's resident, aren't you?

390
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,280
You'll stay here forever, won't you?

391
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,780
If you need me,

392
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,720
I'll go to you.

393
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,400
Actually, I received an order from the main city.

394
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,440
I'm going back to Tokyo.

395
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,820
I've been doing all sorts of things.

396
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,600
You're not going to abandon us, are you?

397
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,300
You're not making a promise.

398
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:53,720
No, I'm going to be a prisoner of the village until I die.

399
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,760
No, I'm going to be a prisoner of the village until I die.

400
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,380
No, I'm going to be a prisoner of the village until I die.

401
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,380
No, I'm going to be a prisoner of the village until I die.

402
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,700
It's not the end.

403
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:06,760
Hey, you bastard.

404
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,500
Oh, you're it!

405
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,560
It was nice getting around.

406
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm not done yet.

407
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,640
"The

408
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,360
tunnel is too far away."

409
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,220
"Huh?"

410
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,780
"Ugh!"

411
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,180
"What? Are you going to dig a tunnel?"

412
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,840
"Ugh!"

413
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,040
"Ugh!"

414
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,900
"Ugh!"

415
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,260
"Ugh!"

416
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,300
"Ugh!"

417
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,600
"Ugh!"

418
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,960
"Alright! We got out of here successfully!"

419
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,320
"Let's go to the bank!"

420
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,800
"Ugh..."

421
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,040
"Ugh... The roundabout..."

422
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,320
"I'm in trouble..."

423
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,700
"Huh?"

424
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,360
"Ugh!"

425
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,400
"Ugh!"

426
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,340
"Ugh!"

427
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,680
"W-What was that?"

428
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,900
"It was the sound of someone knocking on my door..."

429
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,360
"I got it!

430
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,940
"I got it! It's a bonus!"

431
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,920
"It's a bonus!"

432
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:37,900
"It's a bonus!"

433
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,600
"You can get money in any bank, you know."

434
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,320
"You can get money in any bank, you know."

435
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,580
"It's become convenient."

436
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,100
This voice is...

437
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,200
Hand over the bonus to us!

438
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,020
Why are you guys where I am?

439
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,840
Based on the sighting information, we analyzed your movements.

440
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,340
Damn it!

441
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,840
You're being obsessive, Ryo-san.

442
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,660
Now, hand over the bonus.

443
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,420
Bonus?

444
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:13,800
No!

445
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,040
The pig got the bonus?

446
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,740
Hey, that's my bonus! Give it back!

447
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,380
Hey, wait!

448
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,980
We're going after him, too!

449
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,620
I won't let you get away!

450
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,140
Why would a pig run away with Ryo-san's bonus?

451
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,560
Ryo-san's bonus is...

452
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,420
What's that supposed to mean by "what's he doing?"

453
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,740
Hold it right here!

454
00:21:50,320 --> 00:22:02,980
This isn't going to end well!

455
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,640
Is it time to wait for someone else?

456
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,940
Does that sound about right?

457
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,200
Hold it right here!

458
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,120
W-What's this voice?

459
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,340
It's Mr. Omawari!

460
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,320
It's over!

461
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,660
It's all over now!

462
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,760
Wait up!!

463
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,680
What the?!

464
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,680
Wait!

465
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,760
Digan!

466
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,600
The trash can...

467
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,480
My house is...

468
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,460
My garden is...

469
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,840
What are you doing…?

470
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,780
The hot springs are...

471
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:10,600
Ow!

472
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,940
Ouch! What's going on here?!

473
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,000
Oh no! It's a cow!

474
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,300
Nice!

475
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,020
Crap! No way!

476
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,540
The cow ate the bonus!

477
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,080
The bonus was eaten!

478
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,120
The village is in a mess!

479
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,120
I knew it. I'm glad that the neighbor came back.

480
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,100
Yeah.

481
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,020
Damn it! I couldn't win this year either!

482
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,140
You're going to lose!

483
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,120
The bonus...

484
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,340
My bonus...

485
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,180
My bonus is...

486
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:17,420
To be continued...

487
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,500
So I walked around the black street of Ake-do-gai

488
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:52,680
Everyone was a child once, but they all forget

489
00:24:53,540 --> 00:25:00,600
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above their eyes

490
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,960
Turn around and look at that corner

491
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,660
You'll see everyone

492
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,160
There's a wall over there, there's definitely a wall

493
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,000
Everyone come to our town

494
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,420
Thank you!

495
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,640
What? The land of Minokishi-ji's inheritance sold for 100 million yen?

496
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,260
This is a piece of sand from a sandstone, a piece of clay from a shelf, and a wet hand

497
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,840
This 100 million yen, I'll use it big!

498
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,280
Next time, 100 million yen from a sandstone!

499
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,860
Thank you!

500
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,600
There's a wall over there, there's definitely a wall

501
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,760
Everyone come to our town

502
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:00,900
Thank you!
