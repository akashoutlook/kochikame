1
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,220
There's a courier on the river bank

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,920
If you pick up the pebble

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,080
You can fly into the water

4
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,060
From the tapestry of a cap,

5
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,940
to the taishakuten,

6
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,120
the sunset falls.

7
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,460
Tomorrow will end like this.

8
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,400
Katsushika and Shiba are happy again.

9
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,400
I realized a stupid habit.

10
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,620
The Same-Sense Age of Volvo

11
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:46,900
The Same-Sense Age of Volvo

12
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,940
Oh, now I'm in peace.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,760
It's really peaceful, isn't it?

14
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,740
It's not a big deal. Here, tea.

15
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,200
Now that I think about it, I can still remember that day when the Eight-Minute Island was spinning.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,460
Is that so? You said it was already a mess.

17
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,740
What's wrong?

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,600
A strange man is approaching us.

19
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,360
A strange man?

20
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,440
That's...

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,440
What? Isn't that Volvo?

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,600
What?

23
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,360
Hey, Volvo!

24
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,940
You're still as arrogant as ever.

25
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,760
I don't know when I'll be attacked from behind.

26
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,640
Japan is not such a dangerous place.

27
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,760
When? In Japan?

28
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,780
And that uniform...

29
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,680
Volvo Saigo. From today, I will be working as a instructor at the Katsushika-cho Shooting Training Institute.

30
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,660
I see.

31
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,060
So you two are friends.

32
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,440
Yes. Please take care of me from now on.

33
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,400
Kakushiju.

34
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,500
You still wear that kind of armor in Japan.

35
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,080
No, that's all I have.

36
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,040
Really?

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,600
Yes, that's true.

38
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,860
Then I'll investigate.

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,640
See? There's so much of it.

40
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,660
But, as a policeman, this amount of equipment...

41
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:16,920
This is...

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,200
This is not a New York or some other place.

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,600
Look, look. This is a sniper rifle.

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,260
It's like a Zatoichi.

45
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,620
It really feels like a weapon department.

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,500
No, it's just a small piece of equipment.

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
What are you talking about? I'm here to protect the citizens as a policeman.

48
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,240
No, they're all weapons to protect yourself.

49
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,480
There's a policeman who has a full-auto model in every corner of the world.

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,840
But...

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,620
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,620
No, what are you talking about?

53
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,900
Stop getting close to my back!

54
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,540
Your guns are all here.

55
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,120
Ah, that's right. When the people were coming from behind, it was just...

56
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
That's why you're so narrow-minded.

57
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,720
Anyway, this evening is your welcome party, right, Volvo-san?

58
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,720
I agree! I agree!

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,840
I have to teach you Japanese common sense.

60
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,300
I'll have to teach you something about the rules.

61
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,540
Ryo-chan?

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,600
Nya!

63
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,160
Well, thank you for coming.

64
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,420
Thanks for coming.

65
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,740
Oh, where's Ryo-chan?

66
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,760
She's gone to sleep.

67
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,160
Oh, well.

68
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,440
Well, see you tomorrow.

69
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,280
Good night.

70
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,160
The End

71
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,560
Time's up.

72
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,320
What's going on?

73
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,780
Who's there?

74
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,140
He's gone!

75
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,240
Where are you going?

76
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,040
What's with that helicopter?

77
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,220
It took 20 seconds to defend.

78
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,680
Mr. Bakuryuta!

79
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,480
If you attack at this time, you're dead.

80
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,960
Don't attack at this time of night!

81
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,300
What are you doing in Japan?

82
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,100
My daughter, Jody, likes Saigo.

83
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,680
What? Me?

84
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,120
Really?

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,800
I heard that Saigo doesn't like women

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,960
because she lost to her daughter in the Aramco candidate battle.

87
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,400
Oh my!

88
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:14,920
No!

89
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,600
Chance!

90
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,840
I won!

91
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,420
She says she really wants to fight again.

92
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,780
That's impossible.

93
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,140
We'll lose again.

94
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,780
That's why you should stay with your daughter so you can get used to her.

95
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,300
Then you will have to fight again.

96
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,860
To fight...

97
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,980
As Jody and Bulborou?

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,940
Hey, Jody!

99
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,780
Hi, long time no see.

100
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,400
While Carl Vinson is staying in Yokosuka,

101
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,740
I'm going to live with my wonderful roommate, Mr. Volvo.

102
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,120
Wonderful?

103
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,060
Oh, I'll carry the luggage.

104
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,000
Thank you.

105
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,560
Are you really going to make us live together?

106
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
We're roommates. We're just living together.

107
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,780
You're just a roommate, Volvo.

108
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,800
Don't think of weird things.

109
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,440
I know, you're a bad boy.

110
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,200
I don't want to marry a man who loses to a girl, Daddy.

111
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,940
So let's fight under the condition that you're a thug.

112
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,180
I-I'm getting married.

113
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,780
Hey, Volvo, shut up.

114
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,300
I'll give you a shower.

115
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,320
A shower?

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,720
The shower's next door.

117
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,300
Right, thanks.

118
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,560
Hey hey, don't take off your clothes.

119
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,720
Oh, it's nothing, you know?

120
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,360
Of course not. Just get changed there.

121
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,140
scolded

122
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,680
I see.

123
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,380
You're too bold, your daughter.

124
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,580
Because of her open-mindedness,

125
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,640
she sometimes passes in front of me naked.

126
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,260
Butter! My nose!

127
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,220
Balbo, be strong!

128
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,380
My daughter has 100% mother's blood.

129
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,860
By the way, this is her wife.

130
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,200
Isn't she beautiful?

131
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,960
Her cooking is the best in the world.

132
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,280
She's a great cook.

133
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
She's the best in the world.

134
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,320
Don't brag about your family like that.

135
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,100
Japan and America have completely different cultures.

136
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,760
It's even worse when you live together.

137
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,540
I got married to my wife, so I know.

138
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,920
What if Saigo and my daughter get married?

139
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,180
I don't know about that.

140
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,080
You're saying it's not supposed to be like this?

141
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,120
It's too late to tell each other.

142
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,100
So, the best way to know each other is to be roommates.

143
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,360
Even if you live with a man,

144
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:37,860
you can be his father.

145
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,340
Is that okay?

146
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,240
It's my daughter's decision.

147
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,880
Jody has been independent since she was 15.

148
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,160
She lives alone.

149
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,640
Even college students don't have parents in Japan.

150
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,440
That's why the culture is different.

151
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,300
They're independent.

152
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,880
That's why.

153
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,980
Do you understand?

154
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,240
I finally got it.

155
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,140
Can I borrow your bath towel?

156
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,260
Can I borrow your bath towel?

157
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,300
Can I borrow your bath towel?

158
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,860
Take this towel with you.

159
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,560
Thank you.

160
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,340
I'm...

161
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,820
I'm going home.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,020
I'm going home.

163
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,040
What are you doing?

164
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,680
I don't know.

165
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,080
This is really cold.

166
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,060
This is really cold.

167
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,020
It's so cold.

168
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,480
Please take it easy.

169
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,960
It's terribly disturbing to the father at 3:30 in the morning.

170
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,180
Are you okay, Borubo?

171
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,620
It appears that he is curvatureally anxious.

172
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,240
That was a great bath.

173
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,700
Hey, Borubo.

174
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,120
Go out by changing clothes!

175
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,740
I don't really care.

176
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,740
I can't stop talking!

177
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,920
So, you came back in the morning?

178
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,320
I can't keep up with you.

179
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,480
A man who never held a woman's hand suddenly lives with a woman.

180
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,640
And he's got a lot of money.

181
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,020
That's a big gap.

182
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:10,800
Isn't it?

183
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,120
I wonder if your father is worried.

184
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,060
It's perfect legalism.

185
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,320
And Jody is a flight attendant for Carbinson.

186
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,700
He lives in a soldier's room like a wrestler.

187
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,200
So he's got a more manly character than a man.

188
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,880
You're right.

189
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,760
When they're awake, let's go see what's going on.

190
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,040
Is he going to be all right?

191
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,760
He's got a lot of blood in his nose and he's dead.

192
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,180
It's scary that there's no possibility.

193
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,000
You're right.

194
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,140
Oh, is that Mr.Volvo?

195
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,040
Yeah, that's right. It's Mr.Volvo.

196
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,540
He's sleeping outside, being careful of Jody.

197
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,380
He's like an insect.

198
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,680
I'm going to have to take care of him.

199
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,680
You're awake?

200
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,760
Nakagawa and Reiko have been worried about you.

201
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,880
What do you mean?

202
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,300
Don't you dare lie down there.

203
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,440
Hurry up and put him in.

204
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,540
All right.

205
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,740
Oh no.

206
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,400
Mr. Jody.

207
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,380
Something's wrong.

208
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,780
Oh, oh, oh.

209
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,840
Oh, you're naked.

210
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,100
No, it's not.

211
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,860
I got hot in the middle of the night and took it off.

212
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,460
It's the same thing.

213
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,780
Hurry up and get dressed.

214
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,680
Because if you're going to put on women's immunity,

215
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,280
You'd better show them your usual life.

216
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,620
Mr.Volvo's immunity is like a junior high school student.

217
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,440
Think about it a little and act.

218
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,720
Oh, it's really troublesome.

219
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,880
Mr.Volvo, are you okay?

220
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,420
Mr.Volvo!

221
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:15,500
Mr.Volvo!

222
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,280
Oh, I almost looked at you.

223
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,320
You must have been in a lot of trouble.

224
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,820
What a bad couple.

225
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,040
.

226
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,220
.

227
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,420
What's going on?

228
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,300
.

229
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,780
.

230
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,160
.

231
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,560
The next morning

232
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,380
I told you to come to the morning meal.

233
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,960
These are all canned food for the army.

234
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,980
As I thought. It's very delicious.

235
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,100
Bobby will be happy to eat.

236
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,660
No...

237
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,600
Bobby? You're going to show off your newly married life soon.

238
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,460
No, it's not that...

239
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,560
It's like a late-night meal. Let's eat.

240
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,620
I'm not good at cooking other than canned food.

241
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,100
Oh, you can.

242
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,580
Really?

243
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,280
It's a dish made by wild boars and bears.

244
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,560
What?

245
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,380
I was the best at survival training.

246
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,900
Hang what you want to catch with a rope.

247
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,220
First, peel the skin.

248
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,580
Then pull out the organs and eat it from the bones.

249
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,700
It's delicious.

250
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,060
Oh, the brain is delicious, too.

251
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,580
It's like chicken.

252
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,280
Especially the thighs.

253
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,320
It looks delicious.

254
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,300
If you have a chance next time, please try it.

255
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,160
Well, it's time to go home.

256
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,860
That's right. I'm sorry to bother you.

257
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,980
Well, Paul. You have to do it well.

258
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,720
See you.

259
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,440
Good night.

260
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,340
Are you really going home?

261
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,700
Please stay until morning.

262
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,960
I'm going to see the Drift Grand Final in the All Night.

263
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,620
No way.

264
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,860
Bye-bye.

265
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,060
You have to live with Jody.

266
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,700
That's right. I'm a roommate.

267
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,100
That's right, Bobby.

268
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,520
Only 5 days until the flight of the aircraft carrier.

269
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,840
You have to overcome Bobby's female phobia.

270
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,540
I will do my best.

271
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,520
See you.

272
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,600
Thank you for coming.

273
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,840
Bye-bye.

274
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,200
Bye-bye.

275
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,880
Oh, he left.

276
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,480
Hey, I have to go.

277
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,780
I have to do something about you, Volvo.

278
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,640
That's right.

279
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,840
I love you so much.

280
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,620
Oh, I'm alone with two people.

281
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,520
I know.

282
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,580
Oh, I'm alone with two people.

283
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,360
Jody.

284
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,220
Bobby, you don't have to push yourself too much.

285
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

287
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,200
I said you only had 5 days.

288
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,300
But if you think about it, you have 5 days left.

289
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,700
So, let's go to bed.

290
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,760
I'll go to bed.

291
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,960
Of course, separately.

292
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,140
I see.

293
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,640
This is good.

294
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,040
I agree.

295
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,060
Good night, Bobby.

296
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,060
Good night.

297
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,620
Let's go to bed.

298
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,260
Let's go to bed.

299
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:47,540
Okay.

300
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,120
And my key is in the mental health room.

301
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,200
Good night.

302
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,440
Jessie.

303
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,740
You called me.

304
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,300
Huh?

305
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
The sound of sleep...

306
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,680
The sleeping face is beautiful...

307
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,380
Bobby...

308
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,680
I love you...

309
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,860
Be a man...

310
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,840
Be a man...

311
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,420
Be a man...

312
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,100
Okay...

313
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,300
I'll do my best...

314
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,240
I'll overcome the fear of women...

315
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,040
I'll win against Jody...

316
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,680
I'll win against Jody...

317
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,240
I'll win against Jody...

318
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,840
I almost died...

319
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,160
But I won't lose!

320
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,840
But I won't lose!

321
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,060
What? You want to do special training?

322
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,880
I knew something happened last night.

323
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
At this rate, I won't be able to hold my body.

324
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,900
Don't worry. I'll think of a way.

325
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,440
I'll definitely modify the Volvo.

326
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,340
Please.

327
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,020
This woman and judo...

328
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,080
They're the bad guys from the Yudansha.

329
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,580
And this!

330
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,040
What is this?

331
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,160
It's a machine that can tell the Volvo's balance and strength at a glance.

332
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,440
What do you think, Kagawa?

333
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,980
Yes. It's almost done.

334
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,660
Good!

335
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,740
It's done.

336
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,420
Good! Everyone, don't hold back and come to the Volvo!

337
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,620
Yes!

338
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,160
Now!

339
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,100
There!

340
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,680
My balance is getting disturbed.

341
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:23,860
What?

342
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,580
That!

343
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,520
It feels like one force is enough.

344
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,340
Don't be so naive, Volvo!

345
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,940
There's no difference between men and women in this game!

346
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,580
Do you think you can beat Jyonei with that?

347
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,960
Boss!

348
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,880
Oh! He's recovered!

349
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,720
Jyonei!

350
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,280
I... I feel...

351
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,020
I can't wait for this!

352
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,460
I'm going to come back from the basics!

353
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,660
Everyone, today, this man is going to be good friends with everyone.

354
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,920
Yes!

355
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,480
Basically from our kindergarten?

356
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,820
You can complain after you get the results.

357
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,220
Uncle! Let's dance! Let's dance!

358
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,040
Your level of peace has been halved!

359
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,900
Don't let your heart be disturbed by the fact that your child held your hand!

360
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,560
O-Okay!

361
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,520
You've improved, haven't you?

362
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,120
Not yet!

363
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,660
Barbarian, dance more passionately!

364
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,820
More passionately?

365
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,160
I can't! I can't!

366
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,580
He's not here!

367
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,420
He's 100% recovered!

368
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,380
Of course! He's a kindergarten kid!

369
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,220
Okay, Barbarian! You've leveled up in elementary school!

370
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,160
Ranked!

371
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,520
He's amazing!

372
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,040
Uncle, you're so cool!

373
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,540
Hang in there, Barbarian!

374
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,980
Alright! Now, it's time to battle with the girls' high school students!

375
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,940
So, you're going to use the cross key to set the frame, right?

376
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,280
Y-Yes!

377
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,740
How is it?

378
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,080
The balance between 50% and 80% is shaking violently!

379
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,680
You're quite upset, aren't you?

380
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,900
Well, you have to come closer, right?

381
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:40,960
Yes!

382
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,140
Okay, pose!

383
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,520
No way! Really?!

384
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,960
Whoa!

385
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,580
What?!

386
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,920
What's going on?!

387
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,900
That's a shame!

388
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,380
As expected, the girls' high school students have lost...

389
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,640
As expected, this kind of manly space is calming.

390
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,300
What?!

391
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,460
Barbarian, you're making the wrong impression.

392
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,160
Anyway, let's go to the last training today.

393
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,200
Let's go!

394
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,360
Hang in there, Barbarian!

395
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,220
I'm a man this time.

396
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,220
I'm back!

397
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,400
Woman!

398
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,600
Man!

399
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,660
Woman!

400
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:33,960
Man!

401
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:34,980
Woman!

402
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,840
Man!

403
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,720
Woman!

404
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,720
Man!

405
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,700
Woman!

406
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,460
Man!

407
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,140
Woman!

408
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,920
Man!

409
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,480
Man!

410
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,520
Man!

411
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,640
Woman!

412
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,440
Woman!

413
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,780
Woman!

414
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,800
Woman!

415
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,140
Woman!

416
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,300
Woman!

417
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,480
Woman!

418
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,640
Woman!

419
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,240
Woman!

420
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,300
Woman!

421
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,500
Woman!

422
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:53,740
Woman!

423
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,880
Woman!

424
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,500
Woman!

425
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,040
Woman!

426
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,920
The match begins!

427
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,080
Don't give up, Bobby!

428
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,620
I hope so!

429
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,020
They're fighting!

430
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,920
How's Palmo doing?

431
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,160
He's in good shape, and his stamina is at 100%.

432
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,340
Alright, here I go, Palmo!

433
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,100
He's in good shape!

434
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,640
Hang in there, Palmo!

435
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,780
Palmo, you can't hold your breath!

436
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,800
Focus on the next move!

437
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,160
Don't give up!

438
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,780
3 seconds of wall-ins and you win.

439
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,940
The şimdi-stressing level is decreasing.

440
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:54,840
Keys?

441
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,740
Palmo, do your best!

442
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,200
Oh no.

443
00:22:59,640 --> 00:22:59,740
Huh?

444
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,200
Huh?

445
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,180
Maruma!

446
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,160
Huh?

447
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,100
Oh, yeah!

448
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,940
Huh?

449
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,340
Huh?

450
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:07,680
Huh?

451
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,520
Oh!

452
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,580
My body and mind are at zero!

453
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,920
Huh?

454
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,900
Huh?

455
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,460
Huh?

456
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,380
Maruma!

457
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,820
One, two, three!

458
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,980
Yeah!

459
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,300
You idiot!

460
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,400
You can't get married.

461
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,220
Your daughter is too much of a pain in the ass!

462
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,520
It's today!

463
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,700
You can't do anything bad!

464
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,700
What was that hellish five days?

465
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,840
This is making me sick!

466
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,600
I guess so.

467
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,040
You look happy.

468
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,800
What?

469
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,600
I'm sorry, Bobby.

470
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,840
I won again.

471
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,960
I'm sorry, Bobby.

472
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,520
Bobby!

473
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,260
Be strong!

474
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,640
Huh?

475
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:06,880
Boss, what's with this car?

476
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,620
Is this a robot car made of human brain?

477
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,540
And it's a better class than me.

478
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,960
Why do you make me work for you as your boss?

479
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,300
I don't understand!

480
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,260
See you later, Kamikaze.

481
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,600
I'll let you have your way.

482
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,160
And then they all come together and fly away

483
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,360
They have the most amazing power

484
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,080
Everyone, gather around

485
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,680
Come here

486
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,380
It's like a dream

487
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,560
The final energy

488
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,000
Look at tomorrow, yesterday, Shinjuku, and the universe

489
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,880
If you stand on the ground, the planet Kameari will turn into a circle

490
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,020
I drew a circle

491
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,900
Isn't this good?

492
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,700
There's no reason to be good!
