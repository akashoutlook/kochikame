00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,240
《One Seventh Girl》

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,480
Melody

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,100
Te, te, terebi wo miru toki wa~ When you watch the TV

00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,960
Heya-wa garukku shite hanare te mite ne- Try to be in your room and leave it

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:29,980
Nakagawa ni ukabu naru hi wo megakete Swim across the river and catch the sunset

6
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,960
It's so kind.

7
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,200
From the tapestry of a capricious hat

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,460
To the taishakuten, the sunset falls.

9
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,020
Tomorrow will end like this, won't it?

10
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,560
If you're a Katsushika, you'll be happy again.

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,840
I realized it after losing you.

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,680
I'm such a fool.

13
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,860
Kankichi did a good job, didn't he?

14
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,480
Exactly, Kikichi.

15
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,880
He made the school go crazy and the thief followed him.

16
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,140
Everyone is happy to be with me.

17
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:10,960
Of course.

18
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,380
Kankichi, you got scolded by the principal, right?

19
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,940
Yes, the temporary teacher.

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Kankichi is really into it.

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,720
Ah!

22
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,840
You guys were like that, too.

23
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,420
Thank you, teacher Yoko!

24
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,200
Ah, I remember.

25
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,340
You opened the door to the new place.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,580
Yes, but that was in junior high school.

27
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,820
I only remember good things.

28
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,980
It's been a long time since we've seen each other.

29
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,620
Don't you have any good memories?

30
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,420
No.

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,920
The only memories with Kankichi are

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,240
when you were scolded or scolded.

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,980
You're so bad!

34
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,380
I'm so sick of him.

35
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,540
Here we go.

36
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,960
Oh, no!

37
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,280
You don't have toственно either.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm not!

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,300
Do you know the reason why Kankichi's so hard?

40
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,100
I mean, he was that big,

41
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,020
and he was so big!

42
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,020
He even slept on his back when he fell asleep.

43
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,280
régnement,

44
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,020
you know.

45
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,280
One day, he opened the city gates,

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:19,800
and he was like this.

47
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,020
I don't remember his face,

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,180
because he's so silly.

49
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,100
Oh, yeah! What was the name of that movie theater?

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,660
Hey, Kankichi!

51
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,440
What happened to Ken-chan?

52
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,160
Shinkichi, why are you so quiet?

53
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
You didn't know because you were a police officer?

54
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,800
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,160
He was arrested.

56
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,320
Huh?

57
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,680
That's a joke, right?

58
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,040
That's not the kind of thing Ken-chan who studied the most would do.

59
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,640
He was a police officer.

60
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
I was on the train for a while.

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,820
Why would Ken-chan do that?

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,380
He was a Yakuza officer.

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,800
What?

64
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,900
Ken-chan?

65
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,720
I'm going home. I won't come back.

66
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,260
Hey!

67
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,720
Kankichi!

68
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,140
Ryo-chan!

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,000
Didn't you go to class?

70
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,740
Yes. Do you have any news from yesterday?

71
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,820
If it's a full-pub, it's next to the stream.

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:45,980
Ken-chan.

73
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,420
Did something happen to the police?

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,700
Why?

75
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,160
I don't know.

76
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,260
I go to class.

77
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,640
Ryotsu!

78
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,540
Chief.

79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,160
I thought I was arrested in my office, but Ken...

80
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,760
Murase is...

81
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,580
I think he was transferred to Asakusa

82
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,360
who's responsible for the cooking case.

83
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,680
Ryotsu!

84
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,260
What's wrong, Senpai?

85
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,280
It's different than usual.

86
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,340
Ken-chan!

87
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,820
Kacchan!

88
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,240
Kacchan!

89
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:03,900
What's wrong?

90
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,580
Let's go.

91
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,040
Ken-chan!

92
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,680
Ken-chan, why?

93
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,200
You...

94
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,560
I don't know!

95
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,060
Hey, stop it!

96
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,740
Are you alright, Ryotsu?

97
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,020
Get in!

98
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,320
I know.

99
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,000
Ken-chan!

100
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,080
Wait for me!

101
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,300
Ken-chan!

102
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,720
Ken-chan!

103
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,460
Ken-chan!

104
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,360
Hey, can I try one?

105
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,580
Of course.

106
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,500
Ken-chan!

107
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,800
Ken-chan!

108
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:14,940
Ken-chan!

109
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,320
a illegal idea.

110
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,420
I have a question.

111
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,920
I asked the police, but he was working in a group with the Odaiba gang.

112
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,320
The police said he was hiding his hidden face.

113
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,140
The Yakuza now don't have the same kind of personality as they used to.

114
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,540
Yeah.

115
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,240
Ryotsu, you may have been a good friend, but the Yakuza are Yakuza.

116
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,760
The world we live in is different.

117
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,560
Just forget that you didn't see them.

118
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,620
That's right.

119
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,700
It's not like you and I are friends.

120
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,160
We're not friends.

121
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,460
He wasn't like that before.

122
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,020
He was rich and smart, but he was strange.

123
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,560
I wonder when he was.

124
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,480
He was scolded by his father, and he left home.

125
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,680
Kaonkichi!

126
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,860
Are you still going to the Edo?

127
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,780
I'll eat you alive!

128
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,600
You're so good at drinking.

129
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:25,280
I'll ask Mom if she has been drinking.

130
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,060
Our world was no different.

131
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:43,060
Mom, you were beaten down by your left hand.

132
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,680
What happened to you?

133
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,000
-It hurts! -Come on!

134
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,380
-Come on! -Come on!

135
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,000
-Come on! -Come on!

136
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,440
Ken-chan.

137
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,720
What's wrong, Ken-chan?

138
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,960
Did the food not suit your taste?

139
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,280
No.

140
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,960
I'm envious of Kan-chan.

141
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,840
Me? I'm joking.

142
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,500
We live in such a big house,

143
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,560
and we have to take care of the car.

144
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,700
My house is like this.

145
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,500
Dad is a violent person.

146
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,500
Mom is a mischievous person.

147
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,980
No, no, no.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,120
Ken-chan is better than me.

149
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,580
No, no.

150
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,620
I've never had such a fun meal with my family.

151
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,540
What? Why?

152
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,120
It's not a big deal.

153
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,540
Anyway, Ken-chan.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,480
Come to my house whenever you feel lonely.

155
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,780
What? Really?

156
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,940
I don't have any tips, but I'm very welcome to your house.

157
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,480
Thank you, auntie.

158
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,860
Uncle, this is the way, right?

159
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,020
It's a good meal. I like it.

160
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,320
Let's have a drink.

161
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,100
You!

162
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,320
You!

163
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,360
You!

164
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,740
He was a good guy who knew the customs of the city.

165
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,940
Where did he come from?

166
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,820
I went to the station to pay for the drinks.

167
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,180
I'll check the cook.

168
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,140
What? Murase has escaped?

169
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,000
Nakagawa, wait.

170
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,780
I this is Ohara.

171
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,140
Yes, sir.

172
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,100
Yes, sir.

173
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,300
I understand.

174
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,660
The Katsushika office has requested for an investigation.

175
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,840
Nakagawa, let's go.

176
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,420
Yes, sir.

177
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,040
I'm coming with you.

178
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,380
It's a secret. You're good.

179
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,160
I'm coming.

180
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,720
You might hit your friend in the hand.

181
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,840
I'm a police officer.

182
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,180
Ryotsu.

183
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,800
I understand.

184
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,940
Change into your uniform.

185
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,120
Yes, sir.

186
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,720
Murase has strong potential to escape to the police office where he betrayed himself.

187
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,600
Firmly surround the Asakusa police office and its surroundings.

188
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,380
30 people from the Katsushika office have come to support you.

189
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,920
Yes, thank you.

190
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,940
The culprit has taken the gun and is running away.

191
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,020
Please be careful.

192
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,800
So what is Murase's clue?

193
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,880
He will appear at this place where the police office is located.

194
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,640
You can't catch him at all.

195
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,320
Yes, sir.

196
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,860
There.

197
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,120
Senior!

198
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,040
If you're Asakusa, you should know the name of the island.

199
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,960
I can't find it.

200
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,620
Wait for me in the police office.

201
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,120
There's a man.

202
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,640
He's a police officer.

203
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,560
Watch out for him.

204
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,120
Ryotsu...

205
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,340
You are familiar with me, aren't you?

206
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,380
Ken-chan

207
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,300
Shut up.

208
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,840
Don't come closer to me.

209
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,180
Ken-chan.

210
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,900
You used to play with demons around here, didn't you?

211
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,520
Can't you hear me?

212
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,680
If you come any more closer, I'll shoot you!

213
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,820
You're playing with the gun.

214
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,680
How nostalgic.

215
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,200
Come on.

216
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,620
It's not me. I'll shoot.

217
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,700
I hear a gunshot!

218
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,700
What?

219
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,560
Over there!

220
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,300
Hurry, Nakagawa. It's definitely Murase.

221
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,300
I'm sure it's Murase.

222
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,660
You're pretty good.

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,100
Now let's play some pro wrestling.

224
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,500
You're kidding!

225
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,760
That was a good punch.

226
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,240
Are you trying to get in my way?

227
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,060
Of course!

228
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,560
Get him!

229
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,780
Get him!

230
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,240
Damn it!

231
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,720
Don't move, Ken!

232
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,340
I don't know what happened, but you're the one who lost when you lost your life!

233
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,940
Shut up!

234
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,640
You idiot!

235
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,940
You're still fighting like before.

236
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,400
Well, I guess.

237
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,160
Captain, let's arrest him.

238
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,280
Wait.

239
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:58,840
What?

240
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,580
Leave it to him.

241
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,880
Ken.

242
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,020
Why did you become a yakuza?

243
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,120
Why did you become a yakuza?

244
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,100
Why did you become a yakuza?

245
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,280
Why did you become a yakuza?

246
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,640
Well, I'm sorry.

247
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,620
As Junior High school He is a slipper.

248
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,540
I'm young, but I'm in a different league.

249
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,560
I wanted to come here to see my mom.

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,560
My father wouldn't let me go.

251
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,280
And my father was drinking at the well during Junior High.

252
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,340
He was in a famous college of New school.

253
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,080
I was famous in high school, but I was bullied by my father.

254
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,640
I couldn't stand it and sent him to the hospital.

255
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,960
The rest is a life of falling down like a picture.

256
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,420
When I realized it, I was a gold badge.

257
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,560
Don't be so greedy!

258
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,500
Don't blame your life on others!

259
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:08,920
Don't blame others!

260
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,840
Your life depends on yourself!

261
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,720
Did you forget about the "Beigoma"?

262
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,100
"Beigoma"?

263
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,360
That's a lot!

264
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,300
Kanchan, can I have one?

265
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,800
No, no!

266
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,500
This is my treasure that I bought at the market.

267
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,400
You can get better at it if you want.

268
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,020
But I don't like "Beigoma"...

269
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,980
I'll make it for you!

270
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:38,660
Really?

271
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,040
I can't do it...

272
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,480
You have to be more energetic!

273
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,180
One more time!

274
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,500
Okay...

275
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,880
That's right! Be energetic!

276
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,580
Be energetic! Be energetic!

277
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,080
Listen, don't blame others!

278
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,300
Yes!

279
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
Of course!

280
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,920
Do it, Esuke!

281
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,700
Begin!

282
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,480
Ten-chan won!

283
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,900
I did it!

284
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,580
She's strong and weak, and she's strong!

285
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,100
Damn it! Remember that!

286
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,780
I'll be your opponent anytime!

287
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,460
Look, Kanchan!

288
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,520
The "Beigoma" that I won has grown so much!

289
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,880
One, two, three!

290
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,440
Yeah, it's amazing!

291
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,660
Kanchan's "Beigoma" is a special "Beigoma" that has a large size!

292
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,260
Also, it's a left-handed, so you can't lose!

293
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,420
Really?

294
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,420
Yeah!

295
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,660
I have 100 of them!

296
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,180
What? 100?

297
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,740
That's a lot more than me!

298
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,820
Wow!

299
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,700
I used to have only one "Beigoma"!

300
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,200
If you can't beat me, you're out of the town!

301
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,320
Tomorrow, let's go on a trip to the next town!

302
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,580
Yeah!

303
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,240
The smile you gave me when you won with your own strength!

304
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,300
It was the best!

305
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,020
By the way, something happened.

306
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,320
Do you remember where that "Beigoma" was?

307
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,420
No.

308
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,540
I still remember it.

309
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,520
That was the day before you moved to Shibuya.

310
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,740
I'll give you the "Beigoma" that you've won so far.

311
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,760
Really?

312
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,600
To enter the private junior high school.

313
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,220
I have to go to the cram school to get it, so I can't play with it.

314
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,680
We've gathered 100 of them, but it's a man's military record!

315
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,320
This "Beigoma" is...

316
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,860
Yeah, but if I find it, I'll be thrown away.

317
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,520
That's right!

318
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,560
I have a good idea!

319
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,420
Let's bury it under this tree as our treasure!

320
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,780
Then we can put it out whenever we want to use it!

321
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,860
I see! Tan-chan is smart!

322
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:01,940
Brother!

323
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,060
Brother!

324
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,020
This is it!

325
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,980
Hey, I heard you took the "Beigoma" from your brother.

326
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,600
I didn't take it, I was playing a game!

327
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,500
Shut up!

328
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,040
That's it! Give it back!

329
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,000
It hurts!

330
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,960
Hey, stop! Let go of my hand!

331
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
You're a naughty kid!

332
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,960
Kan-chan!

333
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,960
You were naughty and bad!

334
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,620
You're a big, thin beast!

335
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,080
What?

336
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,100
Brother!

337
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,580
Brother!

338
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,700
You're back!

339
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
You're really strong, Kan-chan!

340
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,100
You defeated the sixth-year students!

341
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,400
I won't lose to you if you fight!

342
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,420
With your strength, even if you become a villain, I'll become a lawyer and help you!

343
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,820
You're tough, Ken-chan.

344
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,760
I said that, but I became a yakuza, and you became a police officer.

345
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,280
The world doesn't work as you think, Kan-chan.

346
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,160
If you say so, I'm the Prime Minister!

347
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,420
That's not true.

348
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,760
I don't care about the beating.

349
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,260
I'll do as you say, Kan-chan.

350
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,400
I see.

351
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,400
You have a good head.

352
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,600
You can start over.

353
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,800
I guess I'm starting way too late.

354
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,940
Hey, the police are over there!

355
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,640
I know.

356
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,640
I want to stop by.

357
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,260
I'll definitely take action before the sun sets.

358
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,660
Can you let me go, Kan-chan?

359
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,780
You finally called me like you used to.

360
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,560
I got it.

361
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,140
Thank you.

362
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,300
I'll be waiting in the office!

363
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,980
Senpai!

364
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,320
Nakagawa!

365
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,900
Senpai, are you sure you want to let me go?

366
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,460
Why didn't you arrest me?

367
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,040
I'll take action.

368
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,260
I'll take action.

369
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,060
What? You believed him?

370
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,820
It's okay, Nakagawa.

371
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,520
Chief!

372
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,600
Ryotsu, you've shortened the distance between us, right?

373
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,540
Yes.

374
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,260
Senpai, it's almost sunset.

375
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,140
Senpai!

376
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,100
You're so noisy.

377
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,220
Don't worry.

378
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,480
I'll go on my own.

379
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,660
But...

380
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,140
Are you a kid?

381
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,580
You took back your gun.

382
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,180
Why didn't you arrest me?

383
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,780
I'm Yakuza.

384
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,620
If Murase doesn't come on his own,

385
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,940
I'll have you take full responsibility.

386
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,700
I understand.

387
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,020
Wait!

388
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,700
Ryotsu.

389
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,220
Yes?

390
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,020
It's okay.

391
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,360
You can trust Murase.

392
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,540
But...

393
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,540
Thanks to you, I'm used to writing self-criticism.

394
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,960
Chief...

395
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,000
The sun's already set.

396
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,260
Looks like you can't write well.

397
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,660
Hooray!

398
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,440
Ryo will definitely come on.

399
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,400
O...

400
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,720
Ohara...

401
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,340
Why were you there?

402
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm very sorry to have ruined your reputation

403
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,340
after wishing you the best luck in my life.

404
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,180
It's nothing.

405
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,780
Why?

406
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080
Why do you're coming back?

407
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,180
Genki...

408
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,140
I'll send my kind to Asakusa

409
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,220
to make you sit on work.

410
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,200
The city is yours now.

411
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,420
Let's go apologize to the chief of the Japanese Ministry of Justice.

412
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,460
Senpai, look!

413
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,000
Huh?

414
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,500
Ken-chan!

415
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,540
Kan-chan!

416
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,140
You're late!

417
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,100
You're worrying me!

418
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,640
Sorry. It's been 30 years since I last came here, so I got lost.

419
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,380
I must have gone the wrong way.

420
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,960
Kan-chan.

421
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,380
You idiot.

422
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,560
How could you blame someone who came here to help you?

423
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,940
Let's go.

424
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,660
Chief...

425
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,120
Yeah.

426
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,380
I think it was around here.

427
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
It's after I dug it up.

428
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,980
Found it!

429
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,260
A letter?

430
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,360
It's about the good-for-nothing Kan-chan.

431
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,520
I'm sure Kan-chan will come here too.

432
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Thanks to meeting Kan-chan, I regained my heart from 30 years ago.

433
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,540
I'll borrow a 100-person bagel bar for a while.

434
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,140
It's my pride.

435
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,920
2001 may not be possible, but I'll make sure to get better the next time I see you.

436
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,580
I look forward to that time.

437
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,100
Kenji.

438
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,740
That guy.

439
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,720
Let's open this treasure together when the 21st century comes.

440
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,440
Yeah.

441
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,780
What will Kan-chan do in the 21st century?

442
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:18,880
Yeah.

443
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,380
I wonder what he'll become.

444
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,020
Of course, I'm the Prime Minister.

445
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,740
Ken-chan is smart, so he'll be a lawyer.

446
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,120
Yeah.

447
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,360
Kan-chan, don't forget to move.

448
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,740
We'll be friends forever.

449
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,980
Of course.

450
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,260
I'll never forget it.

451
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,400
Yeah.

452
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,080
I can't wait to meet you here again in 2001.

453
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,420
Okay.

454
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,380
Let's dig deeper.

455
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,580
Don't let us find you.

456
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,780
Let's dig deeper.

457
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,260
Let's dig deeper.

458
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,600
Well.

459
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:47,800
Well.

460
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,800
Since we're in Asakusa,

461
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,180
you want to come to my place?

462
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,440
Yeah.

463
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,120
Well.

464
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,960
Well.

465
00:23:59,340 --> 00:23:59,800
Well.

466
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,060
Well.

467
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,960
Well.

468
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,400
Well.

469
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,760
Well.

470
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,920
Well.

471
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,360
Well.

472
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,540
Well.

473
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:15,880
Well.

474
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,020
Well.

475
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:47,000
They're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they

476
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:15,900
they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together, and they're all together,

477
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,120
The End

478
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,580
What? My younger brother Kinjiro is getting married?

479
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,260
I didn't hear anything at all!

480
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,400
And he's invited to Nakagawa for the wedding,

481
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,140
but he didn't even send me my brother's invitation!

482
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,740
What the hell is going on?

483
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,800
Next time, "As a Brother!"

484
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,260
Hey, Kinjiro!
