Ryo-chan.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,640
This is the udon bowl with instant udon on top of rice.

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,600
Udon bowl?

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,960
The nutrition is not balanced.

36
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,760
But it's good for the price.

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,840
Do you think I like it?

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,900
I have no choice but to do this.

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,680
I can't stand it.

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,140
Stop it, Ryo-san.

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,540
Feel my pain.

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,040
You lost.

43
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,860
Is it a horse?

44
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:56,900
No.

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,720
Ryo-san is honest.

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,820
I was a fool to be on my father's side.

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,060
Ryo-chan.

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,880
Ryo-san, you idiot.

49
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,320
Did you do something again?

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
Say it.

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,080
Say it quietly.

52
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,960
What did you do?

53
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,720
Calm down, Bu-chan.

54
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,020
Tell me honestly.

55
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,560
What did you do?

56
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,560
You won't remember it even if I told you.

57
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,900
What did you do?

58
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,200
The inspector called you.

59
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,020
What?

60
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,540
The inspector called you?

61
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,360
The inspector?

62
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,620
Your name makes me shiver.

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,540
What did you do, Ryo-chan?

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,060
Do you remember?

65
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,900
Did you find out that I drew the general's face on the Batocard?

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,400
What did you do?

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,420
Or maybe that.

68
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,100
Ah, maybe that.

69
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,940
That much?

70
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,880
What should I do? My heart is pounding.

71
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,700
It doesn't matter.

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,940
But...

73
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,920
Anyway, come with me.

74
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,440
I'll cut your nose off at any cost.

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,140
I don't want to cut your nose.

76
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,400
I'll cut your nose off at any cost.

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,420
Director, this is Ohara. I've brought Ryotsu here.

78
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,220
Come in.

79
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,000
Y-Yes.

80
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,800
Excuse me.

81
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,240
I'm truly sorry about this.

82
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,400
It was all thanks to my director's bad manners.

83
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,160
Please forgive me.

84
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,600
Please forgive me.

85
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,240
Please.

86
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,320
Please.

87
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,680
Raise your head, Ohara.

88
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,420
Actually, Ohara.

89
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,000
I came here today to thank you for your words of praise.

90
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,820
The general himself came to see me.

91
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,200
I see.

92
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,980
Let me explain.

93
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,680
Director Ryotsu.

94
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,460
You must have saved an old man who fell off a bicycle the other day.

95
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,520
Director Ryotsu. You must have saved an old man who fell off a bicycle the other day.

96
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,480
An old man?

97
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,520
Oh, I see!

98
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,880
Director Ryotsu.

99
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,740
Ouch!

100
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,460
Director Ryotsu.

101
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:35,740
Ouch!

102
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,640
I'm fine.

103
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,860
See you later.

104
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,700
I fell off again.

105
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,760
Ah!

106
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,180
Help me! Help me!

107
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,760
Who's laughing?

108
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:51,940
Who's laughing?

109
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,020
Who's laughing?

110
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,780
Who's laughing?

111
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,400
Are you alright, old man?

112
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,740
I hit my back.

113
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,120
I can't get up.

114
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,160
Stay strong.

115
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,620
Alright.

116
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,480
Here.

117
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,100
My back hurts.

118
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,760
This isn't good, Akira!

119
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,260
Stay strong!

120
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,260
Stay strong!

121
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,580
Go away.

122
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,100
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,720
That's enough.

124
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,340
Don't say that.

125
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:38,600
Well, I guess I was once often told to stay here.

126
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,900
Do you have any regrets?

127
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,160
You said so many things to me, but I didn't say nothing.

128
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,200
That piece of paper!

129
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,500
It hit right in front of me!

130
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,900
That piece of paper!

131
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,380
Why?

132
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,380
Hm? I've got some business in the Edo area.

133
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,160
I'm going home with my father.

134
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,940
Oh, so you're the same as your father.

135
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,440
Well, if you say so.

136
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,040
I'm a policeman who is close to the free trade.

137
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,880
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,420
Thanks to you, I was saved.

139
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,600
I see.

140
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,440
You're getting old, so don't overdo it.

141
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,860
By the way, may I ask your name?

142
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,940
It's not that important.

143
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,080
My name is Ryozu Kankichi.

144
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,280
See you.

145
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,540
This old man is the richest man in Japan.

146
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,580
He's a rich man.

147
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,960
A rich man?

148
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,840
No, he's just a poor old man.

149
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,860
A wealthy man is dressed like that when he visits his company with no money.

150
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,660
Don't judge him just by his appearance.

151
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,500
I see.

152
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,260
A wealthy man is very impressed with your performance.

153
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,600
He's said he will be a sponsor of a commercial to recruit more policemen like you to become a policeman.

154
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,920
I see.

155
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,500
So, I'll take your recommendation.

156
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,060
You become the sponsor.

157
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,060
I'm going to be in a movie.

158
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,300
Ryo...Ryotsuga?

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,660
That's right.

160
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,880
I'll be the role model for all the police officers.

161
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,400
I'll be counting on you.

162
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,560
Ha ha.

163
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,260
I got it.

164
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,080
If that's the case, I'll take responsibility.

165
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:31,920
I'll do it.

166
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,020
Speaking of money,

167
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,140
He's the one who built that honest group.

168
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,240
He's the one who built that honest group.

169
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,800
Do you have a relationship with the Nagagawa concert?

170
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,480
Of course.

171
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,560
You must know my father, too.

172
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,380
You must know my father, too.

173
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,400
I don't know him at all.

174
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,500
Of course.

175
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,700
So, what kind of person is he?

176
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,180
I don't know much about it.

177
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,920
But he's a business man.

178
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,320
He's a business man.

179
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,620
He doesn't have a wife or kids.

180
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,920
I heard that he'll donate all his assets to the facility.

181
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,420
I heard that he'll donate all his assets to the facility.

182
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,180
How much is his assets?

183
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,520
How much is his assets?

184
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,720
I don't think it's one or two trillion yen.

185
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:11,660
I don't think it's one or two trillion yen.

186
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,680
I don't think it's one or two trillion yen.

187
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,280
If it's that big, it's no big deal.

188
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,980
If it's that big, it's no big deal.

189
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,800
One or two trillion is more exciting.

190
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,380
One or two trillion is more exciting.

191
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,660
Listen, Ryotsu.

192
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,740
Don't let him get away with it.

193
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,560
Don't let him get away with it.

194
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:28,600
I know.

195
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:29,680
I know.

196
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,300
Listen.

197
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Don't be so stubborn.

198
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,240
Don't be so stubborn.

199
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,020
Hey, old man.

200
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,880
Are you okay with your waist?

201
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,460
Don't call me old man for a reason.

202
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,400
Thank you for the trouble.

203
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,960
It's okay.

204
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,560
We're almost at the real thing.

205
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,080
That's right.

206
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,240
Do it well.

207
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,480
Do it well.

208
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,640
Don't yawn!

209
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,260
Don't yawn!

210
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,360
Let's start the real thing!

211
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,500
3, 2...

212
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,600
Shut up!

213
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,540
Don't draw the head!

214
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,300
You can't draw properly, you idiot!

215
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,880
Ugh, you're so noisy!

216
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,780
Leave me alone, you big-eyed old man!

217
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,340
Huh?

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,760
What do you mean, "big-eyed old man"?

219
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,900
I said "big-eyed old man" because you're a big-eyed old man!

220
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,360
What?!

221
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,120
It's because you don't draw properly!

222
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,880
That's because you're always so "gami-gami", "gami-gami", "gami-gami",

223
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,800
I get so motivated when you say that!

224
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,580
-I see. -You can't say that!

225
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,620
-Alright! -I said "gami-gami"!

226
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,560
-Pull the camera! -I said "gami-gami"!

227
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,340
-Take those two! -I said it!

228
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,080
You said it, you big-eyed old man!

229
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,200
You always worry about me!

230
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,380
That's the problem!

231
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,580
I'm already a great adult!

232
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,160
What?

233
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,760
You really don't want your parents to know that!

234
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,520
It's okay! Just leave me alone!

235
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,300
So, you're going to appear in the movie?

236
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,300
No, the director liked my acting,

237
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,560
so...

238
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,640
I changed the script right away.

239
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,240
If you're the director,

240
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,640
you can just do what you normally do in the office.

241
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,480
Well, okay.

242
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,780
Oh, it's time for the commercial.

243
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,100
Yeah.

244
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,780
Oh, this is it!

245
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,140
It's well-made!

246
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,120
You split the paper!

247
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,780
Shut up!

248
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,480
Oh, the director's here too!

249
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,320
Wow, it's pretty good for a TV show!

250
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,960
Amazing!

251
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,560
I can't believe you two are acting!

252
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,700
It's okay.

253
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,020
You always worry about me,

254
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,800
so I'm already a great adult!

255
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,720
What?

256
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,500
Are you okay?

257
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,340
Are you okay?

258
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,180
I'm okay!

259
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,500
What?

260
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,020
Wow!

261
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,900
-Your smile is amazing! -It's a great commercial!

262
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,900
-Really! -I'm looking for a police officer.

263
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,260
What?

264
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,460
What?

265
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,560
Are the director and I parents?

266
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,460
I-it's not a joke.

267
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,560
Who would be the father of such a fool?

268
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,160
I'm not joking either!

269
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,840
But why did it turn out like this?

270
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,400
I don't know.

271
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,500
It's usually you.

272
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,420
No, it's the director.

273
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,980
I hope nothing happens to him.

274
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,360
I have a bad feeling about this.

275
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,800
I know.

276
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,980
Then, there's nothing at all to say.

277
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,320
"You two can leave. Bye."

278
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,020
If you two will become real parents,

279
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,220
That's ridiculous.

280
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,240
Who did such a thing to us?

281
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,840
I want to ask,

282
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,060
what did you...

283
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,540
What?

284
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,260
You two worked really hard.

285
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,500
But...

286
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,220
Why are you always back on your word?

287
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,360
I decided to tell you.

288
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,000
It's not time to lie.

289
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,260
It's time for the fire to cool down.

290
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,580
You can lie, Ohara-kun.

291
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,540
But, to lie is...

292
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,620
If the police finds out about this,

293
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,420
the police's trust will be in shambles.

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,220
Then, you'll be held responsible.

295
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,640
You understand, Ohara-kun?

296
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,040
Y-yes.

297
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,320
That's good.

298
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,640
Then, there's one more troublesome thing.

299
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,700
What is it?

300
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,880
The rich man wants to invite you two to his home.

301
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,920
You're not his parents.

302
00:12:50,500 --> 00:13:02,740
R-really, Ryotsu?

303
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,300
I don't understand.

304
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,160
If you go through this gate,

305
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,600
you'll be with your father and child.

306
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,780
It's not a relationship between you and Ryotsu.

307
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,460
I understand, Taro.

308
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,020
Pa-Papa...

309
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,000
K-Kankichi...

310
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
You must be having a bad dream.

311
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,280
Well, this rich man is honest.

312
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,760
When he saw you two at first sight, he was convinced.

313
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,660
This is the true father and child.

314
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,520
There's a bond between parents and children that no one can hide.

315
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,680
Y-yes.

316
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,880
So charming.

317
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,000
R-right.

318
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,280
Oh, Ryo-kun...

319
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,620
Well, I'm deeply moved by what you said...

320
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,840
This is our great family.

321
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,520
I only have my hoe, but I should be careful.

322
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,740
My home.

323
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,140
K-Kankichi...

324
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,880
O-ok!

325
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,160
What do you mean?

326
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,920
The house where all parents live.

327
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,280
Oh, I was going to ask you a question.

328
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,220
What do you mean?

329
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,940
they will think I am their home and let me be.

330
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,760
I see.

331
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,720
This or that is hard.

332
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,360
Hey, Ryotsu, you are a way too dirty mimicry.

333
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,480
But, sir…

334
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,380
Ryotsu, sir?

335
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,220
No, Ryo…

336
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,200
you must use both hands.

337
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,660
We have to use our hands.

338
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,860
Yes, yes, yes.

339
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,780
You can't do anything bad, K-K-Kichi.

340
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,820
But, but, but, but...

341
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,440
This Yuno-mi has a 200,000 yen banknote.

342
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,000
What?

343
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,540
There's a banknote on everything.

344
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,480
Even for tropical fish.

345
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:45,620
What are you talking about?

346
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,620
We always give you a discount so that you can tell the value of things.

347
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,680
Is this really the price for everything?

348
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,080
Of course. It's all fair.

349
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,340
They've been living a business life, and they don't have a wife or children.

350
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,500
I heard that if they die, they'll donate all their wealth to the facility.

351
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,860
There are no children.

352
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,600
The money will rot.

353
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,260
If you do it right, I'll be the one to get the money.

354
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,420
You idiot!

355
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,300
What if 250,000 yen is broken?

356
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,260
It's 200,000 yen.

357
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,880
Hurry up and blow it up.

358
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,720
This carpet is worth 10 million yen.

359
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,300
No, no, no.

360
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,480
You've been raising K-Kichi for so long.

361
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,840
You must be really tired.

362
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,880
Well, that's right.

363
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,700
This idiot son of a bitch is really struggling.

364
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,840
I can't hide my feelings even if I say it on my face.

365
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,260
These two have been going to the Beigawa River these days.

366
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,360
The Beigawa? No!

367
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,800
You know what?

368
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,440
These two went to the Beigawa River the other day.

369
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,080
This is why I heard the police made a consequence against them.

370
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,240
I see.

371
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,300
The Beigawa and Ryotsu have gone to be걸 a rubber was in the field again.

372
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,560
This is bad.

373
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,120
They're strong enough.

374
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,280
If my grandpa found out about the school, how would he feel then?

375
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,160
What kind of child was Kankichi?

376
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,460
He was the best at school, and always in the class.

377
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,860
That's good, but who would be the best at the sports festival?

378
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,400
There was a frog.

379
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,060
Oh, a frog!

380
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,660
There was a fly.

381
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:41,900
There was a fly.

382
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,100
A fly?

383
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,980
Because flies are fast.

384
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,480
There was a bee, papa.

385
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,220
A bee...

386
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,180
Because it's hard to get stung by a bee.

387
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,760
How kind of you to say that.

388
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,140
Of course, papa.

389
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,880
Thank you, Kankichi.

390
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,680
You're welcome, papa.

391
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,700
Kankichi...

392
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,480
Kankichi...

393
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,080
You're a beautiful boy.

394
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,940
Kankichi...

395
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,280
I'm so happy to see my father in Japan.

396
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,620
Let's go to the bath together!

397
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,580
To the bath?

398
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,400
Why the bath?

399
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,600
The bath is the origin of my father.

400
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,620
He's naked like this.

401
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,480
He's still a baby, but he doesn't hide anything.

402
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,440
This is the ideal for me, to talk with my son and grandchildren.

403
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,700
Papa, papa.

404
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,080
I'm going to wash your back.

405
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,760
Oh, sure.

406
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,940
Then, I'm going to wash Kanemojita's back.

407
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,140
I see...

408
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,120
Papa, you have a big back.

409
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,900
That's a bad thing.

410
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,540
As a man with a big heart like this,

411
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,740
I'm a good boy, so I don't mind small things.

412
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Oh, I see.

413
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,920
So you're saying that you want me to forget that Ryotsu went to the church.

414
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,360
That's not good.

415
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,640
Hey, Kanemochida-san.

416
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,000
If a child does something wrong,

417
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,380
it's natural for a parent to scold him, right?

418
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,500
Of course, that's right.

419
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,100
Right?

420
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,800
For example, during work...

421
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,740
No, no, no!

422
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,560
Hey, do it stronger!

423
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,300
Yeah!

424
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,000
I got it, papa!

425
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,960
Let's change, Kanchichi.

426
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,480
You like hot hot water, don't you?

427
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,020
I'm dying!

428
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,340
없어!

429
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,320
You're going to get cold if you don't remove my shoulder!

430
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,560
You should stop like this for the best of the best!

431
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,660
Wow!

432
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,560
I got it wrong!

433
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,540
You're going to get cold if you don't move!

434
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,700
Kanchichi!

435
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,620
I'm telling you, I'm seriously attracted to you!

436
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,540
You're not?

437
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,440
You're so mean!

438
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,000
Now, let's have a drink after the bath.

439
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,220
- A drink? - No!

440
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,140
If there's any alcohol in the bath...

441
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,740
That's a good feeling.

442
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,340
- Let's have another drink. - Let's go!

443
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,740
I feel so good when I see you.

444
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,780
I wish I had a son like you.

445
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,580
"Honest Life"

446
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,140
This is the motto I've lived for 80 years.

447
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,820
Honesty is the best.

448
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll never forgive anyone who lies.

449
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,340
"Honest Life"

450
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,820
This is a word without a meaning.

451
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,860
But...

452
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,640
What do you think of me?

453
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,460
You can lie, Ohara.

454
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,340
If the police find out about this,

455
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,880
they'll be shocked.

456
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,300
Then you'll be responsible for this!

457
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,160
Actually, Mr. Money.

458
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,140
What?

459
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
Speaking of my father,

460
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,300
there's an old man named Ohara at the police station.

461
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,280
This old man is so noisy.

462
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,220
He's a fool.

463
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,220
And he's a fool.

464
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,940
He's annoying me every day.

465
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,860
What?

466
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,240
That's not good.

467
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,740
You can call a fool a fool.

468
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,120
I can do whatever I want.

469
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:09,800
You think so?

470
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,340
You're so smart, old man.

471
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,580
Hey, Ryo.

472
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,700
No, Kankichi.

473
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,080
You don't have to call me that.

474
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,400
OK.

475
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,620
But,

476
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,940
I won't say it,

477
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,240
but I need to thank him.

478
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,640
He's a fool and I love him a lot.

479
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,940
He's like my father.

480
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,460
Like his father's words.

481
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,540
To be honest, I'm not a very good policeman.

482
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,120
I have a lot of work to do, and I also play pachinko and horse racing while I'm working.

483
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,720
But every time I hear him say that he's stupid, I remember my father here.

484
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,420
Look, my father always says, "Don't lie even if you get a mochi."

485
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,920
"Be honest more than a man-eating chicken!"

486
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,440
So I shoot him without hiding anything.

487
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,800
That's great.

488
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,640
What a honest man.

489
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,520
Father, can't you let me have Kankichi as a servant?

490
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,700
A servant?

491
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,480
I refuse.

492
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,440
I have a responsibility to take care of this papa.

493
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,360
I like it more and more.

494
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,060
Please, please, please.

495
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,420
I did it! The plan was a success!

496
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,060
Please raise your head, Kanemochida.

497
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,820
I'm the one who has to lower my head.

498
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,440
I'm truly sorry.

499
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,000
I did something wrong.

500
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,960
Everyone was lying.

501
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,800
P-P-P-Papa!

502
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
That's enough, Ryotsu.

503
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,900
I don't have any family with this man.

504
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,240
I'm not a parent or anything.

505
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,140
I'm a stranger to the red.

506
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,840
What do you mean, papa?

507
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,440
I'm the boss that this man was talking to.

508
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,440
I've been playing a fake parent and child for the sake of the police.

509
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,020
Wh-Wh-What?

510
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,840
You're wrong! You're wrong!

511
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,860
Papa has a habit of saying things that make no sense.

512
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,180
You see, he looks just like me.

513
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,740
Hm? Hm? Hm?

514
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,560
I was an idiot.

515
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,180
I don't want to be called an idiot.

516
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,360
I was taught how to act like an idiot by this man, so I woke up.

517
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,420
Papa!

518
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,160
That's enough!

519
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,020
This trip was a great help.

520
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,920
I'm the red stranger.

521
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,700
I'm so sorry.

522
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,860
I'm sorry.

523
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,760
I'm so sorry.

524
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,140
I'm sorry.

525
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,760
I'm so sorry.

526
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,200
I'm so sorry.

527
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,160
After the rain, someone called me

528
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,340
I looked back and walked

529
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,620
I reached out to my mother

530
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:11,280
I felt a strange feeling at that time

531
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,020
So I walked on the black road

532
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,760
I walked on the black road

533
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,500
I walked on the black road

534
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:29,960
I was a child once, but I forgot

535
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,420
A politician with a great face

536
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,020
A blue lady in front of me

537
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,120
Look up at that corner

538
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,860
Look up at that corner

539
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,760
I can see everyone

540
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,840
There is a camera over there

541
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,500
I'm sure there is a camera

542
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,760
Come to our town

543
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,340
There is a camera over there

544
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,720
I'm sure there is a camera

545
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,480
Come to our town

546
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,420
To the town of the old man

547
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:16,960
Thank you!

548
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,140
To the town of the old man

549
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,220
The young people in the town are lecturing me?

550
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,720
Do you think I'm that old?

551
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,200
Do you think I'm that old?

552
