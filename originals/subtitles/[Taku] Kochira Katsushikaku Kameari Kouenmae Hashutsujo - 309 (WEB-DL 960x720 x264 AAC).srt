42
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:02,960
...

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,560
I can't do this kind of secret work!

44
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,300
Damn it! I failed the second act, too!

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,400
Nakagawa-kun!

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,820
What is it?

47
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,460

Hey, Reiko-chan!

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,060
What's wrong with your disgusting voice, Ryo-chan?

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,580
...

54
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,740
Don't catch people with your own hands.

55
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,040
You have to do it yourself.

56
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,280
...

57
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,460
I can't get over it.

58
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,360
...

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,980

60
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,560

61
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,820

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,480
...

63
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:53,980
...

64
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,240
...

65
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,480
...

66
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:55,660
...

67
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,420
...

68
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,200
...

69
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,140
My room's dirty, so I can't concentrate.

70
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,160
That's right!

71
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:15,760
...

72
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,700
I'm sure!

73
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,840
Alright, give it to me.

74
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,500
Here you go.

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,100
Here you go.

76
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,340
Here you go.

77
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,260
Here you go.

78
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,420
Alright.

79
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,280
No, I don't think this is my room.

80
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,200
Alright, I'll do the report with this momentum.

81
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,720
Here you go.

82
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,580
Here you go.

83
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,800
I've cleaned up the mess.

84
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

85
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,340
I think it's better to be messy like this.

86
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,180
I feel like I'm working.

87
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,620
The atmosphere is important.

88
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,400
The atmosphere.

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,920
Oh, yeah.

90
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,120
I thought something wasn't enough, so I'll have a late-night snack.

91
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,660
Let's eat and do it quickly.

92
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,880
It's Ryotsu-special instant ramen.

93
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,080
It's just vegetables.

94
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,820
What else?

95
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,680
Oh, char siu, menma, and Naruto.

96
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,660
It's quite a lot if you look for it.

97
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,100
It's tuna.

98
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,020
It's tuna.

99
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,260
Let's put this in.

100
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,900
I'll put it in.

101
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,220
It's pepper to finish with.

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,720
What are you doing, senpai?

103
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,380
It's a good place.

104
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,180
Do you want to eat?

105
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,800
I'm fine.

106
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,480
Really? Then I'll eat it.

107
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,020
It's good. As expected of me.

108
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,780
As expected, he's so different from a human.

109
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,000
Maybe I should have made it a little more voluminous.

110
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,820
I forgot!

111
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:38,960
I forgot!

112
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,120
Come to think of it, I haven't washed for a while.

113
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,780
I've been eating so much.

114
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,060
Wash, wash, wash, and then all at once.

115
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:07,120
All right, well...

116
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,120
I have to clean up the storage room.

117
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,820
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

118
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,080
I'm a boy, aren't I?

119
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,980
I was going to put it in the resource collection garbage.

120
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,280
Whenever I read it, the other side is interesting.

121
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,580
Oh, no, no, I have to get to work soon.

122
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,320
Clean up, clean up.

123
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,100
Oh, this is...

124
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,720
Model gun.

125
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,860
Colt Python 357 Magnum 4-inch.

126
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,380
I'm always in love with this mirror.

127
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
It's a little rusty.

128
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,680
I'll do it, I'll do it.

129
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,060
Oh, I was in the middle of cleaning up.

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,160
Oh, nostalgic.

131
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,540
I got it at the fast-food competition in the shopping street.

132
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,860
My arm isn't weak.

133
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,780
It's a jigsaw.

134
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,180
It's a masterpiece of an illusion.

135
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,340
It's a rakuda that breaks through the Sahara Desert.

136
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,520
The ultimate 12,000-piece.

137
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,520
I bought it when I was busy with puzzles.

138
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,020
It's nostalgic, it's nostalgic.

139
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,100
Here, here, here.

140
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,480
This is difficult.

141
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,880
This is here.

142
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,540
All right.

143
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,880
All right.

144
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,060
I did it!

145
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,580
Oh, my God.

146
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,460
Oh, my God.

147
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,740
Oh, my God.

148
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,060
Oh, my God.

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,240
Oh, my God.

150
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,320
Oh, my God.

151
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,920
Oh, my God.

152
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,580
Oh, my God.

153
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,820
Oh, my God.

154
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,740
oh, my God.

155
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,400
oh, my God.

156
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,800
Oh, my God.

157
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,200
oh, my God.

158
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,100
oh, my God.

159
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll do it.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,800
So, after this is over, I'll do it.

161
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,380
I don't like it, Ryo-chan. Did you start something again?

162
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,100
Oh, Reiko, well, if you notice it, this escape room is pretty dirty.

163
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,920
Eh? What are you saying to the super-man who always messes with things?

164
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,540
Get out of here. Get out of here. I don't want to write a report.

165
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm sorry. Here, too.

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,580
Good morning.

167
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,780
What's going on?

168
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,800
Oh, Chief.

169
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
Ryo-chan, today...

170
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,900
Ah! Come to think of it, the front wall...

171
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,260
Wall?

172
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,640
No, this...

173
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,960
What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

174
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,980
I haven't written my report yet.

175
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,900
You're forcing yourself to find another job and do it later, aren't you?

176
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:52,740
What?

177
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,920
What?

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,220
A little...

179
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,320
200...

180
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,980
Let's do something about this!

181
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,940
Yes, yes.

182
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,740
How about this every day?

183
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,140
Wait.

184
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,140
If you don't like the paper work, then you can always give them paper work.

185
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,500
Wouldn't it be possible to keep this condition always?

186
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,560
Okay, perfect!

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,940
You're still here?

188
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,800
Ryo-san, what's the list like so far?

189
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,420
Uh...

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,800
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

191
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,700
Ah, by the way...

192
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,660
I knew it.

193
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,460
The list is...

194
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:43,700
Start!

195
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,720
Good, good.

196
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,440
Good, good, good.

197
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,580
Just like I thought.

198
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,780
As long as I give you the document, Ryo-tsu will work.

199
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,540
Ryo-tsu!

200
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,560
You're clean now.

201
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,300
Well, that's fine.

202
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,440
Because the report is full today.

203
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,140
And I'll take this one, too.

204
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
And this one, too.

205
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,200
And then,

206
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,560
I'll give you the report you need to finish tomorrow.

207
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,100
Gah!

208
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,060
Gah!

209
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,280
All right!

210
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,160
I get it, Ryo-tsu!

211
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,960
Then, I'm counting on you.

212
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
I'm going to the office.

213
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,140
Damn it!

214
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,540
Ouch!

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,060
You're going, too?

216
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,720
Yeah, to the patrol.

217
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,580
Then, Ryo-chan,

218
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,780
get on your feet!

219
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,520
Well, bye-bye!

220
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,240
I'm off!

221
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,540
Do you want to keep this?

222
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,700
Yeah, Ryo-san.

223
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,500
I'm going to the police station.

224
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,880
You don't want to go in there with a full face, do you?

225
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,240
This doesn't "the police station."

226
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,100
So just keep the collar on your head.

227
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,600
Ah, wow.

228
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:02,980
Oh.

229
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,820
Hey!

230
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,320
I'll just give it a try and start with the new one.

231
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,260
Hm?

232
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,260
A survey?

233
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,140
Huh?

234
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,560
An application for a baseball tournament?

235
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,140
An old people's association?

236
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,660
A primary school student?

237
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,660
What is this?

238
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,400
I got it, Mr. Ohara!

239
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:37,440
Oh, Mr. Ohara! You prepared something like this to make me clean up, didn't you?

240
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,500
Damn it!

241
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,220
Did you write down the documents properly?

242
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,060
I wonder. I think he's into cleaning.

243
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,200
Well, I guess he's a good-for-nothing, but I can't believe he's a clean-up.

244
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:55,920
Huh?

245
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,180
What?

246
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,120
Ahem.

247
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,480
Chief, look! I've cleaned up everything so nicely!

248
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,240
What?

249
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,000
What's this?

250
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,740
You wanted me to clean up, didn't you?

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,300
So I've organized the entire station by material!

252
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,960
Good job!

253
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,020
Idiot!

254
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,940
Because you started it first, didn't you?

255
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,940
I didn't do it after all.

256
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,400
Please believe in me!

257
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,020
The friend of justice, Mr. Ryo!

258
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,860
Ugh, I don't have any money!

259
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,460
If this goes on like this, I'll have to find a new part-time job.

260
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,620
Ryo, you're here again?

261
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,880
Senpai, it hasn't even been a week since the day you got paid.

262
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,220
Oh, there you are. Mr. Ryo.

263
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,240
Huh? All my neighbors.

264
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,440
Ah, actually, I was looking at Mr. Ryo, so I couldn't talk to you.

265
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,600
I'm busy.

266
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,480
It's a job that only Ryo-san can do.

267
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,520
Huh?

268
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,440
A job?

269
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,840
Come with us for a bit!

270
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,780
What a great tree!

271
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,280
I didn't know there was a tree like this.

272
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,820
It's been over 180 years.

273
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,360
In the past, this place was like a paradise for children.

274
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,140
But...

275
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,420
The number of children who play here has decreased, and the land is being sold.

276
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,120
Finally, this tree has become the only one.

277
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,980
I'm really sad.

278
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,160
Huh?

279
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,900
Then, let's enjoy the land until we feel like it.

280
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,380
Ryo-san!

281
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,140
Don't go back!

282
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,900
It has nothing to do with me.

283
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,040
It's Ryo-san's job from now on.

284
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,940
This land has been taken over by the strongholds.

285
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,120
It's Ryo-san's job from now on.

286
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,140
It's Ryo-san's job from now on.

287
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,080
That's why the company is trying to cut down this tree.

288
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,360
Ryo-san, that's a terrible story!

289
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,920
Hmm...

290
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,340
It's a disturbing tree, so shouldn't we cut it down?

291
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,100
Uwaaah!

292
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,620
What the hell!

293
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,380
It's a treasure for us!

294
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,240
Oh, really?

295
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,760
Ryo-san!

296
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,300
If you protect it, we'll give you a reward!

297
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,500
So, how much is it?

298
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,040
30,000 yen per day!

299
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,320
Hmm...

300
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,640
Uwaaah!

301
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,000
What a happy neighbor!

302
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,820
If I were not here, this huge tree would be...

303
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,060
Thank you, Ryo-san!

304
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,900
So, how do we protect it?

305
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,180
We should watch over it on the tree and get the construction workers back.

306
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,620
Okay!

307
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,580
Listen to me!

308
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,860
Ryo-san!

309
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,040
It's not good to be in uniform!

310
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,980
It's not good to be in uniform!

311
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,300
Ahaha!

312
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,840
You can't be a policeman in uniform!

313
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,520
I knew it!

314
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,060
This is what a good-for-nothing does!

315
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,960
Hehehe...

316
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,200
Hmm...

317
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,220
If you dress like this, people will think you're joking!

318
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,880
Huh?

319
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,320
This is what a good-for-nothing does!

320
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,960
Awakening equipment, helmet, and a life jacket are perfect!

321
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,020
Oh, I knew it!

322
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,400
I knew it!

323
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,680
I knew it!

324
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,040
I knew it!

325
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm counting on you, Ryo-san!

326
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,080
Just leave it to me!

327
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,060
This is quite a relief.

328
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,060
I'm sure you'll be fine!

329
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,840
I found a good part-time job!

330
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,040
Hehe, I found a good part-time job!

331
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,020
*Sigh*

332
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,300
*Sigh*

333
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,380
*Sigh*

334
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,400
*Sigh*

335
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,060
*Sigh*

336
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,700
*Sigh*

337
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,120
*Sigh*

338
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,200
*Sigh*

339
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,900
*Sigh*

340
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,260
*Sigh*

341
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,560
*Sigh*

342
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,220
Hey, don't cut the tree!

343
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,640
Oh, what's that?

344
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,960
Go home!

345
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,860
Go home, you guys!

346
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,660
What is it, Ryo?

347
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,520
It's okay.

348
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,300
Let's get to work for now.

349
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,240
Damn it, it's an insect!

350
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,220
Okay, if this happens...

351
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,240
Ouch...

352
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,880
*Sigh*

353
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,380
You guys!

354
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,660
If you cut it, you won't be able to go home!

355
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,960
If you don't go home quickly, I'll keep on shouting!

356
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,120
Be prepared!

357
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,360
Dad!

358
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,300
Your own family is going to die!

359
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,380
What stuff did you just eat?

360
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,520
I was about to go home to heal myself, but I was a mess.

361
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,160
It's you Heidou!

362
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,820
He wanted to wash his pocket!

363
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,940
You!

364
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,860
Oh, wait there.

365
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,560
Hey, Tatsumi!

366
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:48,740
He's back!

367
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,100
Tatsumi!

368
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,640
Sorry for being late. Eat more.

369
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,600
It's a special bento made by everyone in the school.

370
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,440
There's also tea and juice.

371
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,540
Wow, so much. I did it!

372
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,900
Let's eat.

373
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,820
I heard Ryo-san's voice chasing them away.

374
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,300
Oh, I see. It's useful, isn't it?

375
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,200
It was the right thing to ask Ryo-san.

376
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,100
Then, do your best.

377
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,380
If you want anything, just say it.

378
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,320
Three meals and snacks.

379
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,120
I'm going to do a part-time job like this.

380
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,020
You're here again. Go home.

381
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,440
You please get off.

382
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,620
The permit for harvest is out.

383
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,680
Get off and shut up.

384
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,480
We're taking care of our lives.

385
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,880
Life?

386
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,260
Our lives are also taken care of.

387
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,240
Here, here.

388
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,740
Here, in the complete residential area of Katsushika,

389
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,120
the locals work.

390
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,400
We're trying to cut down the trees that we love very much.

391
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,420
TV? Okay.

392
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,860
Everyone in the country!

393
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,260
These cruel people are trying to cut down the trees.

394
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,060
Can this be forgiven?

395
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,320
Look.

396
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,820
To protect the trees, the allies of justice are doing their best.

397
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,200
Those with common sense.

398
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,120
Justice will always win.

399
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,040
Let's go!

400
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:25,560
Wow, this is amazing!

401
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,900
What's going on?

402
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,840
This is Ryo-san's gift.

403
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,400
We've been receiving support gifts from all over the country.

404
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,700
We did it!

405
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,700
I didn't know we'd get this much for free.

406
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,920
Keep up the good work, Ryo-san.

407
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,080
Yes, yes.

408
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,520
Here's something for you.

409
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:54,540
This feels like a secret base.

410
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,320
Things have been increasing and my life has flourished.

411
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,040
Alright.

412
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,960
Let's appeal to the allies of justice.

413
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,920
Increase the number of things we can bring.

414
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll be the one to protect this tree!

415
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,780
Let's go!

416
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,380
I won't lose!

417
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,840
I'll be the one to fight alone!

418
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,820
I'll be the one to support you!

419
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,100
I'm here to help!

420
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,260
Where did you bring that costume from?

421
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:38,900
I brought it from the library!

422
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,820
He seems to be a senior at demanding things.

423
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,540
My friends of justice! Here's your gift!

424
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,060
Good work!

425
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,720
It's really growing.

426
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,820
There's no space to put it anymore.

427
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,100
This branch is in the way.

428
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,440
It's a big tree, so I cut it a little.

429
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,340
I don't know if it's because of the bottom.

430
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,540
It's getting wider.

431
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,200
I'll spread the floor as well.

432
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,120
If you distribute it from here,

433
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,860
the electricity will be okay.

434
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,360
Ryo-san, it's over.

435
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,440
Good work!

436
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,260
What?

437
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,980
This tree was helpful.

438
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,960
Thank you.

439
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,200
You're so stupid.

440
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,120
But if I'm gone,

441
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,220
they'll come for sure!

442
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,900
This morning,

443
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,920
there was a notification of the construction stop.

444
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,080
You can't believe it.

445
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,740
That's their trick.

446
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,680
No way.

447
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,440
It's not coming anymore.

448
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,500
No.

449
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,940
This is the mountain range.

450
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,460
I can't go down there yet.

451
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,540
Ryo-san!

452
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,220
Then bring me some rice.

453
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,460
50 kilos.

454
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,480
There's no water,

455
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,920
so 100 liters of mineral water,

456
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,020
please.

457
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,460
Please!

458
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,320
Hmm.

459
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,360
Hmm..

460
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,400
Hmm..

461
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,100
Hmm..

462
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,540
I think we're screwed.

463
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,300
It's getting harder to get through Ryo-san.

464
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,660
It looks like a devil's tree.

465
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,520
Let's watch this tree.

466
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,220
If the workers don't come,

467
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,080
we'll stop our part-time jobs.

468
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,540
They're going to watch us.

469
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,860
It seems they really gave up on the workers.

470
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,360
They're so clueless.

471
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,780
If we don't do something about it,

472
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,120
they'll end up getting fired.

473
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,880
I'll use that trick.

474
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,760
I'll use that trick.

475
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,000
Get out of my way!

476
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,420
Get out of my way!

477
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:42,820
I won't let you cut it!

478
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,840
If you don't cut it,

479
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,140
then cut me!

480
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,460
What?

481
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,700
What?

482
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,140
I'll cut you!

483
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,660
You're not getting away!

484
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,440
I'll cut you!

485
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,000
I'll cut you!

486
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,260
I'll cut you!

487
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,100
I can't let you go.

488
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,780
I'll get you out of here today.

489
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,600
I really got a job.

490
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,260
I got a job.

491
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:01,740
You're protecting the tree

492
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,240
with your whole body.

493
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,480
Hmm.

494
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:03,900
Hmm.

495
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,360
Good job.

496
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,180
Good job.

497
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,860
One for 3,000 yen each.

498
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,720
One for 3,000 yen each.

499
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:10,740
Yes.

500
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,480
Thank you.

501
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,700
You can be a little more rough.

502
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,980
You can be a little more rough.

503
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,400
Yes.

504
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,520
See you tomorrow.

505
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,240
See you tomorrow.

506
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:26,480
The pay after work is a special one.

507
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:26,880
The pay after work is a special one.

508
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,960
I can't believe I quit this easy part-time job.

509
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,480
300,000 on the 10th,

510
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,720
600,000 on the 2nd,

511
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,680
900,000 if I work for a month.

512
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,480
900,000 if I work for a month.

513
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:33,660
900,000 if I work for a month.

514
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,060
All the money I've earned

515
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,680
will be spent on this job.

516
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,500
You're a goodством guy.

517
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:49,820
Is this part of this job a working-day job?

518
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,040
Since you're very busy,

519
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,120
The flame!

520
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,960
No no no no!

521
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,680
This way too!

522
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,060
That's a waste of gas.

523
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,600
That's the mineral water, though!

524
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,300
I can't do this anymore!

525
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,860
Get out of here!

526
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,080
I...I realize the threat...

527
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,880
I...I realize the threat...

528
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,340
Not me! It's you!

529
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,480
You're an accident!

530
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,960
Hey, Ryōsan!

531
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,920
You're original,

532
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,340
What's wrong?

533
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,260
You cancelled your part-time job?

534
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,680
I told you at 8am

535
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,680
I'm paying you for three thousand yen

536
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,560
I'm paying you for three thousand yen

537
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,680
I mean, that...

538
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,720
Ryo!

539
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,900
I mean, get out of here!

540
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,580
We'll wait!

541
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:02,860
Help me!

542
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:10,640
It must have been a strange feeling

543
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,540
That I felt at that time

544
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,620
So...

545
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,240
I climbed up the

546
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,840
A-G-D Gai'sνaddile

547
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,040
And I walked around

548
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,500
Everyone was a kid once

549
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,860
But they forget

550
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,540
That they were girls

551
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,380
A politician with a big face

552
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,960
And a blue aunt above his eyes

553
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,400
Turn and look at that corner

554
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,980
You'll see everyone

555
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,780
There's a camera over there

556
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,520
Ah, there's definitely a camera

557
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,740
Come on everyone, let's go to our town

558
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,020
There's a camera over there

559
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,700
Ah, there's definitely a camera

560
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,000
Come on everyone, let's go to our town

561
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,940
Thank you!

562
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,300
Damn it! Naoko!

563
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,720
How dare you post my embarrassing photo

564
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,280
on the newspaper!

565
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,420
Thanks to you, I'm a funny guy!

566
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,660
If this happens, I'll take a picture of Naoko's embarrassing photo

567
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:32,960
on the newspaper!

568
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,740
Next time, "Naoko's Unexpected Day"

569
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,040
Please watch it!

570
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,820
There's a camera over there

571
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,520
Ah, there's definitely a camera

572
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,740
Come on everyone, let's go to our town

573
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,800
Thank you!
