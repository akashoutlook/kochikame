1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,400
"I am a little surprised"

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,440
"My little secret friend"

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,080
"When you watch TV, make your room bright and look away."

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,800
"I am a little surprised"

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,400
"My little secret friend"

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,980
"My little secret friend"

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,180
"My little secret friend"

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,740
The poor man, come to me!

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,920
I am not here, but I'm worried.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,920
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,080
I wonder what will happen in the meantime.

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,700
I have no job.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,180
The poor man, come to me!

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,660
I have no job.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,680
I have no job.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,980
I have no job.

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,200
I have no job.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,560
I have no job.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,680
I have no job.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:08,700
I have no job.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,840
I have no job.

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,040
I have no job.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,700
I have no job.

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,240
I have no job.

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,260
I have no job.

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,740
I have no job.

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,700
I have no job.

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,720
I am sorry!

29
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,340
I am sorry!

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,100
I have no job.

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,300
I know. I know, I know!

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,700
If you know, be quiet and follow me!

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,920
Fly! Magic carpet!

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,040
Shoot!

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,780
Eh? Did you put patrol on the terai again?

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,860
Yeah.

37
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,220
I'm busy making the air gun or gas gun.

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,080
Ryo-chan, you're going to tell the chief.

39
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,000
That's right.

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,560
Let's get the chief to drop the lightning sometimes.

41
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,960
As soon as the exhaust pipe is blown,

42
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,700
"Dogan" one shot!

43
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,960
"Dogan" one shot!

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:22,760
Ryo-chan!

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
I, it's not my fault.

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,980
Senior, where are you?

47
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,500
Ryo-chan, if you're alive, give me a reply.

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,680
What's going on? Ryo-san is broken!

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,680
Idiot! That's just a hand of a traffic safety doll!

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,220
Eh?

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,500
Ah, it's true.

52
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,420
I'm here!

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,980
You're safe, Senior!

54
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,440
What happened?

55
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,720
Well, I was playing with a new air gun.

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,900
But he ate a lot of gas, so I used it all in a flash.

57
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,400
So I thought I should use propane gas.

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,920
So I thought I should use propane gas.

59
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,260
Since the power is soources, I'll just take that one last shot.

60
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,340
He's used propane gas.

61
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,600
I told the dean what to do.

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,940
That's right!

63
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,960
That's what I was doing!

64
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,400
You have to catch him!

65
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,580
He's trying to trick us?

66
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,160
He's trying to trick us?

67
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,240
Of course!

68
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,360
If it's not something tough, we'll use it!

69
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,480
How about running away?

70
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,380
Oh my!

71
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,040
No, don't!

72
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,460
This is Ryou-tsu.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,740
I'm sorry, chief! I didn't mean to! I won't do it again!

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,280
Nagagawa, Reiko, Terai, you guys should all apologize!

75
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,380
But that person is...

76
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,780
Chief Ohara, that's not him.

77
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,340
You're still doing all the crazy things.

78
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,440
Huh? The magician's old man?

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,460
It's been a while.

80
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,560
You're still pretty, Reiko.

81
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,540
You're way too old for that.

82
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,740
As you can see, I'm getting a hold of you.

83
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,800
Go home if you don't have anything to do, you old fart!

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,940
Huh? That's not a nice way to say it.

85
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,680
Honza-rakka-fai!

86
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,340
Bui.

87
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,580
Buii!

88
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,440
Bui-bui-bui-bui-bui-bui-bui-bui-bui-bui!

89
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,820
If you want me to go back, you have to repent!

90
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,600
Bui.

91
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,180
Good.

92
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,740
Honza-rakka-fai!

93
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,520
Bui-bui-bui-bui-bui-bui-bui-bui-bui-bui!

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,700
That was awful.

95
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,840
So can't you get to the exit door with that magic?

96
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,040
Of course, it's easy, but...

97
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,680
I'm going to listen.

98
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,040
Hey, Ryo broke it, so please do it properly.

99
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,000
I know.

100
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,460
Perhaps, with your magic, you could bring the exit to normal?

101
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,280
I think that old fart was talking about something earlier.

102
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,360
"What? Who would do such a thing?"

103
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,960
"You're the one who's the best!"

104
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,940
"What did you say?"

105
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,220
"Ryo-san said that!"

106
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,780
"You can't think of anyone else but Ryo-chan, can you?"

107
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,940
"I'm sorry! I was lost in thought and lost myself!"

108
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,400
"Please take care of me!"

109
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,380
"As usual, right?"

110
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,800
"Well, whatever."

111
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,980
"Then, let's go!"

112
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,980
"Oh, he's back!"

113
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,660
"What are you doing here, old fart?"

114
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,400
"If you're done, go home!"

115
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,880
"Um, senpai..."

116
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,420
"What?"

117
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,260
"It's pretty small..."

118
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,360
"Can you make it as big as it used to be?"

119
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,640
"But how about old fart?"

120
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,160
"You're the one who's the best!"

121
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,340
"That's why Ryo-san said that!"

122
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,180
"Don't make me do the same thing, Ryo-chan!"

123
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,260
"I'm sorry! I was lost in thought and lost myself again!"

124
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,740
"Please take care of me, too!"

125
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,940
"I can't do any work with this!"

126
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,100
"I can't refuse Ryo-san's request!"

127
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,900
"Then, here you go!"

128
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,980
"I'm back at last!"

129
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,020
"What the hell are you doing here, old fart?"

130
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,800
"If you're done, go home!"

131
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,280
"Um, senpai..."

132
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,920
"What?"

133
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,160
"Huh? What?"

134
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,520
"Ah! You made it big this time!"

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,540
"No, senpai!"

136
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,200
"Huh?"

137
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,540
"Senpai is getting smaller!"

138
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,960
"What? Ugh!"

139
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,960
"If you're so cheeky, you'll get crushed!"

140
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
"I was wrong!"

141
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,620
"You're so mean!"

142
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,880
"You're a fool!"

143
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,700
"Thank goodness!"

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,940
"I'm glad you're fine!"

145
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,500
"Of course!"

146
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,500
"Now I won't get scolded by the chief!"

147
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,980
"You're right!"

148
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,140
"I see..."

149
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,980
"By the way, what did you come here for, old fart?"

150
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,080
"I got a magic carpet, and I've been trying it out!"

151
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,200
"Magic carpet?"

152
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,240
"Here you go!"

153
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,840
"Okay!"

154
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,700
"Fly!"

155
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,940
"Huh? Magic carpet flying in the sky?"

156
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,040
"It's the world of Arabian Nights, right?"

157
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,000
"But the pattern is in the style of the Japanese guerra."

158
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,340
"That's just my taste."

159
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,760
"Hmm."

160
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,740
"Hey, give me some!"

161
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,300
"Hm?"

162
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,960
"It's soft."

163
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,060
"Why is this carpet dirty?"

164
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,640
Get off!

165
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,560
Don't drop it so suddenly!

166
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,140
How about you, Reiko?

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,460
Huh? Is that okay?

168
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,680
A beauty is supposed to be happy.

169
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,600
Hold on tight.

170
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,120
Fly!

171
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
It's so beautiful!

172
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,900
It feels good.

173
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,280
It looks great.

174
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,960
There's no traffic jam in the sky.

175
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,740
Hold on.

176
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,740
If I use that well, I might make some money.

177
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,040
Well then, I'll be going now.

178
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,800
Thank you so much.

179
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,080
I can't thank you enough.

180
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,900
Huh? Where's Ryo?

181
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,900
Hey, wait a minute.

182
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,780
What?

183
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,980
Please let me thank you.

184
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,780
Thank you?

185
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,500
You're planning something again, aren't you?

186
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,640
What are you talking about?

187
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:01,880
I'm not.

188
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,540
I was able to get my first letter back.

189
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm sure it's natural for a person to thank someone.

190
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,800
Reiko, are you going to put a magic carpet on it and return it without even thanking me?

191
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,700
W-Well...

192
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,340
Here you go.

193
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,700
I couldn't prepare much, though.

194
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,700
Oh, this is the legendary Kameyari hot pot!

195
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,820
Come on, the glass.

196
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,560
Oh, it's boring.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,720
Senpai, what about the sake while you're working?

198
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,480
This is not for me.

199
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,620
Now, I want to drink it.

200
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,780
You can drink the sake in the 점� camera.

201
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,480
No way!

202
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,020
This is probably my best.

203
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,480
Come on, let's eat, shall we?

204
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,500
Well, then, I'll get going.

205
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,300
Yeah, come on, rate your sake!

206
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:00,700
Yes, sir!

207
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,760
Hehe. You're drunk as expected.

208
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,660
He's weak to me, who likes alcohol.

209
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,700
You're asleep. What are you going to do?

210
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm a servant of the station.

211
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,660
Let's have a rest here.

212
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,860
Then, the futon...

213
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,660
I'll do it. You guys go back to work.

214
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,320
You're going to drink the remaining alcohol, aren't you?

215
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:21,960
No way!

216
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,480
I'm the one who needs it.

217
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,280
The magic futon! Go!

218
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,420
I have to float first.

219
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,000
Senpai, what was that sound?

220
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,320
Are you okay?

221
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,360
No good.

222
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,880
Go!

223
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,120
Fly! Full speed!

224
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,400
You're too fast! Stop! Stop!

225
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
I have to do it now!

226
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,280
It's so dirty!

227
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,140
Sherpa!

228
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,860
I can't really während it.

229
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,060
noisy.

230
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,000
The normal thing.

231
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,520
I'm going to the toilet.

232
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:26,620
Vent.

233
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,880
Let's go.

234
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:29,920
One at a time.

235
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,480
Damn, I'm in trouble.

236
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:45,880
Hmm, but once I get used to it, it's quite comfortable.

237
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,300
I guess I should start my business.

238
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,560
Well, well, if you're in a hurry, come and have a look.

239
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,280
It's a magic carpet that's rare in the world.

240
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,180
If you think it's a lie, have a look.

241
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,660
Get on the carpet!

242
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,800
Whoa!

243
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,040
What's going on?

244
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,160
Isn't it a poem?

245
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:07,940
Isn't it?

246
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,760
There is no seed or mechanism.

247
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,080
It's a real magic carpet.

248
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,940
How about flying in the sky in Tokyo on a magic carpet?

249
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,400
At the moment, it's a great service.

250
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
It's an hour and 10,000 yen for opening.

251
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,960
Hey, bro.

252
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,980
What do you think of our first date in a carpet flying around the world?

253
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,280
It's a great souvenir.

254
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,120
It's the first time in the world.

255
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,440
Isn't it wonderful to have a date in the sky?

256
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,100
Let's get on it.

257
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,040
Yeah, right.

258
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,480
Thank you every time.

259
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,540
Here, get on it.

260
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,200
Excuse me.

261
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Well, let's go.

262
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,500
Chichin, pui, pui, fly the carpet!

263
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,780
Oh!

264
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,300
Yahoo!

265
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,620
Wow!

266
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,680
Wow!

267
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,560
Wow!

268
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,520
Wow!

269
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,340
Wow!

270
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:12,360
Wow!

271
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,880
What a beautiful view!

272
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,100
Please don't get on it too much.

273
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,320
I'll get angry.

274
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,520
Huh?

275
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,840
Isn't this Honda?

276
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,120
I'll take a detour.

277
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,060
What?

278
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,140
Wow!

279
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,580
Where did Hata-kun take off?

280
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,060
I think so, too.

281
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,400
What did you do?

282
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,160
Oh!

283
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,460
What's your name?

284
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,200
You say it was OK.

285
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:47,760
Yuki!

286
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,600
This is so great.

287
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,480
Thank you very much.

288
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,160
We landed in the sky!

289
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,940
I made a great about the beautiful sky.

290
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,100
By the way,

291
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,120
Yuki,

292
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,260
How did this happen?

293
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:16,780
I'm sorry, but please drive that car back!

294
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,160
Roger that!

295
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,800
You already drove that car back before!

296
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,420
Big bro, this is bad!

297
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,580
A white horse is flying in the sky and chasing us!

298
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,960
What? Are you kidding me?

299
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,020
A bike can't fly in the sky!

300
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,880
It's true! Look!

301
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,400
Don't dream about it!

302
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,440
Idiot!

303
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,600
Look closely! That's not a white horse flying!

304
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,320
It's just a white horse on a flying carpet!

305
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,140
Oh, that's true!

306
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,480
A flying carpet!?

307
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,620
BYE Couldn't we give it a break?

308
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,480
BYE

309
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:13,880
Let's go home.

310
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,660
The white horse is going to get something, and so are we!

311
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,640
Ahhh!

312
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,060
Damn it!

313
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,740
We pressed it!

314
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,100
A white horse is flying again!?

315
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,580
I'm going to...

316
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,540
...run away!

317
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:40,760
It looks like the white horse is gone.

318
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,380
Hey, you!

319
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,260
I'm not going to get caught by a white horse!

320
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,500
You're right!

321
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,780
Stop the car quietly!

322
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,340
Stop it?

323
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,740
There's no one who can stop Snow!

324
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,960
Ow!

325
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,580
Damn it! Get off the car!

326
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,280
Stop the car!

327
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,120
I got it!

328
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,620
Those fools!

329
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,740
Hey, Honda! I got you!

330
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,800
Hm?

331
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,320
What happened to the people in the back?

332
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,300
Did you kill them halfway?

333
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,780
Huh?

334
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,080
When did you...

335
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,380
Damn, I lost a lot of money!

336
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,660
Hahaha!

337
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,280
Ah!

338
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:39,820
Damn it!

339
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,160
Hey, I'm going to the bathroom.

340
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,320
Look after the carpet.

341
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,080
Leave it to me.

342
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,140
Have a good trip!

343
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,280
Hmm?

344
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,680
Oh? It's a little messy here.

345
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,200
Hmm...

346
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,200
Oh! Are you selling sewing tools?

347
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,640
Oh! Are you selling sewing tools?

348
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,040
Oh! There's a carpet here.

349
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,240
You're mistaken for trash.

350
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,860
You're mistaken for trash.

351
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,840
I'll take it with me.

352
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,120
Oh, it's so clean!

353
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,020
Oh, it's so clean!

354
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,500
Let's go!

355
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,820
Hmm...

356
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,960
Huh?

357
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,140
Where are the carpet and Honda?

358
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,440
Where did Honda go?

359
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,440
Senpai!

360
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,940
Honda! Where did the magic carpet go?

361
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,200
It's gone!

362
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,460
It's gone!

363
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,980
It's gone!

364
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,520
What? I told you to look!

365
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,160
Look for it!

366
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,140
It may have been blown away by the wind!

367
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,880
Y-Yes!

368
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,340
Hmm...

369
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,000
Huh?

370
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,440
Hmm?

371
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,180
Oh?

372
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,580
Huh?

373
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,020
Eh?

374
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,520
Senior Baba...

375
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,480
What is it?

376
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,920
I found an ominous sign...

377
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,660
Yes?

378
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,460
I found an ominous sign...

379
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,540
Yes?

380
00:17:59,540 --> 00:17:59,920
Yes?

381
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,300
You found the carpet!?

382
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,060
You found the carpet?

383
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,520
Yes!

384
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,840
You found the carpet?

385
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,660
Thank you.

386
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,980
Yes.

387
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,460
Where's the magic carpet?

388
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,780
Over there!

389
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,680
Yes.

390
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,100
What are you doing?

391
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,080
Are you alright?

392
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,280
Is the carpet safe?

393
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,100
It's burnt black!

394
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,900
It's still in shape, but...

395
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:49,460
What's going on?

396
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,640
The magic carpet is...

397
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,800
Senpai, don't get distracted.

398
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,500
Even if I tell you to fly, you can't.

399
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,540
What?

400
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,800
Stop!

401
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,420
Come back!

402
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,640
What's going on?

403
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,000
Maybe the magic power is still in the carpet.

404
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,740
Let's get rid of this carpet.

405
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,620
Carefully!

406
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,520
Carpet?

407
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,940
We have come to ask you one last favor.

408
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,480
Fly, fly, fly, Yuichi!

409
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,480
Tomorrow's election will be held by the representative of the citizens,

410
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,020
Fly, fly, fly, Yuichi!

411
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,720
Thank you!

412
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,060
Yes, of course!

413
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,000
What?

414
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,680
Then please, come back.

415
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,680
So we can fly.

416
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,020
Yes, of course.

417
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,260
Let's fly!

418
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,600
I'll fly, I'll fly!

419
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,500
Hey, what are you doing?

420
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,700
We're going to the next level.

421
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,380
It's not like we have any choice.

422
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:04,660
I guess so.

423
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,660
I've become nothing but a fool.

424
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,480
Oh no! The wizard's old man!

425
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,220
Give me back my magic carpet!

426
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,260
I said, give it back now or you'll be forgiven!

427
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,620
Give it back, Ryo!

428
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,620
What the hell is all this?

429
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,160
What are you going to do, senpai?

430
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,300
The magic carpet is all burned out!

431
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,640
At times like this, you've got to run away!

432
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,580
What are you doing?

433
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,660
If I do this right, I'll be able to fly!

434
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,760
I'll leave the rest in my pocket.

435
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,540
Hold on tight, you two!

436
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,840
All right, fly!

437
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,260
Hey, wait!

438
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,580
I'm waiting!

439
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,860
What is this?

440
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,500
Ryo!

441
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,560
Ryo!

442
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,800
What's going on?

443
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,720
I've been wondering...

444
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,160
What's wrong, Kei?

445
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,900
You were carrying the magic carpet, weren't you?

446
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,520
Why are you flying in white?

447
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,800
That makes sense.

448
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,760
Did you hide it somewhere?

449
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,540
No way.

450
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:28,840
That can't be.

451
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,260
And he's flying on a bike.

452
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,640
Could it be that he's my precious magic gun?!

453
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,260
What are you doing?!

454
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,680
Drop me!

455
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,040
Be patient!

456
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,620
And...

457
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,380
You're in my way!

458
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,840
Did you forget that I have magic power?!

459
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,260
The magic carpet is...

460
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,220
Fly, everyone!

461
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,080
Fly, the bird of justice!

462
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,820
Fly, fly, fly!

463
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:23,900
Fly, anything and everything!

464
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,540
Fly, everyone!

465
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,040
Fly, the election!

466
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,280
Please, fly!

467
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,560
Fly, fly, fly!

468
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,280
Fly, fly, fly!

469
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,980
Please, fly!

470
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,860
Yuuichi is really flying!

471
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,600
Fly, fly, fly!

472
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,520
Now it's my turn!

473
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,300
Fly!

474
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,180
Fly!

475
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,100
Fly!

476
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,320
Fly!

477
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,600
Fly, fly, fly!

478
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:13,520
Fly, fly, fly, fly!

479
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,860
Successfully explained!

480
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,260
Ryo, what's going to happen?

481
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,640
Don't worry. I'll take you to Heaven.

482
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,640
I finally stopped.

483
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,480
Chii-senpai...

484
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,260
All of you are completely surrounded!

485
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,480
It's a serious matter to enter Heaven!

486
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,020
Please proceed honestly!

487
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,720
By the way, a hellish investigation is waiting for you!

488
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,160
I can't believe it!

489
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,860
What's going to happen if we're going to taste Hell in Heaven?

490
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,900
Damn it! I hate magic carpet!

491
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,020
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

492
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,780
I don't want to be a fool that3

493
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,000
continues to compete for its luxury!

494
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,620
If I spend my life with a crooked path

495
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,720
the moon will fly away!

496
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,680
This is not the end!

497
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,440
It's too late to be normal.

498
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,760
Even if you lie or cheat a little

499
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,720
Sometimes you're saving someone

500
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,560
Baby, do you know me?

501
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm heading for tomorrow

502
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,820
Nice breathing

503
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,300
Don't be rotten

504
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,820
I'll do what I have to do

505
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,580
Cute breathing

506
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,980
It's hard to understand

507
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,400
I want to show you

508
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,720
It's better than looking back

509
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,200
Na na na na

510
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,700
What? An international pianist was arrested for murdering a recorder?

511
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,040
Donabe-type UFO alien

512
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,960
was found to be a victim of a murder

513
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,080
He asked for 1980 yen

514
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,260
What's going on?

515
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,940
We're just eating hot pot

516
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,480
Next time

517
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,660
Dema calls Dema

518
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,700
We're counting on you

519
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,920
There is a wall over there

520
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,660
There must be a wall

521
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,800
Come to our town

522
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,840
Thank you!
