Welcome, Honda.

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,020
Hello.

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,500
What do you want, Honda?

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,300
Well, I went to a bookstore earlier

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,720
I said I bought you because I was going to spare you on "Weekly Sapphire".

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,420
What do you think? Let me see.

33
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,020
Let me see. What is my Chief of Robodeca?

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,360
Have you still been practicing, Ryo?

35
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,980
Of course, I have.

36
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,780
My Chief of Robodeca is set up for "Canban Manga".

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,540
What?

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,540
I don't have my Robodeca Pancho.

39
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,060
No!

40
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,180
It's not on anywhere!

41
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,420
Don't tell me you forgot to give it back?

42
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,960
That's not true.

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,440
I sent it the week before.

44
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,440
Ahh!

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,940
Senpai!

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,100
Look here!

47
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,060
Hmm?

48
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:13,900
What?

49
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,240
Ryo Churyu: Manga Jyuku

50
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,400
*Drum roll*

51
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,720
*Drum roll*

52
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,960
You're a Ryu-senshi, you bastard!

53
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,540
You just randomly cut my manga out!

54
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,820
I'll never forgive you!

55
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,740
Get out of here, Honda!

56
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:32,660
*Drum roll*

57
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,260
*Drum roll*

58
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:33,760
*Drum roll*

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,340
*Drum roll*

60
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,000
*Drum roll*

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,020
*Drum roll*

62
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,060
*Drum roll*

63
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,900
Yo, Ryu-senshi!

64
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,000
What the hell is going on here?!

65
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,680
H-hello, Patricia Kanco-sensei.

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,920
Let me ask you a question.

67
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,060
Y-yes.

68
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,120
What are you doing here?

69
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm going to the royal office.

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,360
Yeah. So?

71
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,200
First of all...

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,580
*Drum roll*

73
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,900
Take a look at this.

74
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,620
What?

75
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,600
This is...

76
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,560
The results of the last week's readers' survey.

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
Wow! Nana-chan's "Medhead" is the first place!

78
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,100
Yay!

79
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,120
My "Robodeca" is...

80
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
Huh?

81
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,240
It's resumed!

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,040
Wait, it hasn't even been one second.

83
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,080
B-but...

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,620
Even if it was resumed once...

85
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,640
No, it's not just once.

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,360
This is a 100-page survey.

87
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,180
Is that okay?

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,440
Yes, it is.

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,660
Please take a closer look at the results.

90
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,140
*Drum roll*

91
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,440
*Drum roll*

92
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:28,520
Huh?

93
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,640
*Drum roll*

94
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,120
This is crazy.

95
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:31,900
I can't believe it's resumed.

96
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,780
*Drum roll*

97
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,360
*Drum roll*

98
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,720
*Drum roll*

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,000
As you can see,

100
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,480
The "Robodeca" is the 100th place in a row.

101
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,400
B-but...

102
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,120
Well, it's fine if it's not popular.

103
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,040
*Drum roll*

104
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,620
*Drum roll*

105
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:50,980
An odd-looking thing...

106
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,480
B-but I don't know if you're all right.

107
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,340
It's the fact that you're now in the middle of a bright new ro-

108
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,180
Oh, do you have a book you want to sell?

109
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,520
So have that book.

110
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,800
*Drum roll*

111
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,460
Awww, that's--

112
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,540
*Drum roll*

113
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,760
Awww, that's--

114
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,700
Awww, that's--

115
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,320
The "Robodeca" is still a little big.

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,260
Listen, I heard it.

117
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,680
Oh.

118
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,340
What's the matter?

119
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:16,700
You not have one?

120
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,640
It's all in here...

121
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,280
What?

122
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,100
Actually, I thought the boss of this place was a complete mess.

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
At this time, let's stop it quickly.

124
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,680
Is that so? I'm glad you understand.

125
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,680
Instead, let's start a new series.

126
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,580
New series!

127
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,000
Finished.

128
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,600
Fast! Write it in 5 minutes!

129
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,400
Try reading it.

130
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,420
What kind of manga is it?

131
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,880
This time, Robodeca is going to change the style of the work and spread the Minato Yokohama stage.

132
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,940
It's a drama, hard-boiled gag action.

133
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,540
Hajiki is calling me.

134
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Hard-boiled drama gag.

135
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,800
The work is James Ryotsu.

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,340
This is the amount.

137
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,480
Let's buy it for 1 billion yen.

138
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,960
We're both bad.

139
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,580
The boss has a problem.

140
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,020
That's right, Kintaro Ikano.

141
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,720
Jari.

142
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:17,560
What?

143
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,780
That's right.

144
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,580
This is the drug-faced Tondobayashi Joe.

145
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,540
Call me Joe with two guns.

146
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,520
It's not Dandy of Pyokkori Pyotanjima.

147
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
Boss, this is a big deal.

148
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,620
Guys, kill Joe.

149
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,420
Take a shot of Joe's green.

150
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,600
This is the weekly Sapphire?

151
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,060
It's fun and my jaw will come off.

152
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,800
Especially the last is the best.

153
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,460
Last?

154
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:45,520
Last?

155
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,400
If you don't wear a vest, you'll be fooled.

156
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,500
I don't care.

157
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,020
Tondobayashi, this is not a drug, but a udon.

158
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,120
What?

159
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,260
Gabin.

160
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,660
That's why I said it's wrong.

161
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,280
I just bought a udon at 1 billion yen.

162
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,660
Oh, Tondobayashi, what's going on?

163
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,200
Excuse me.

164
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,760
Sui, sui, sui, da da da da, sui, kan.

165
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,220
How about a unexpected Don Dengaishi?

166
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,440
It's a house that even a top writer can't come up with.

167
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,300
But why do people who aren't criminals have a machine gun?

168
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,620
That's a lie.

169
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,100
No, that's a coincidence.

170
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,640
A machine gun fell in the harbor warehouse.

171
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,940
When I picked it up, the main character appeared.

172
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,600
The main character is killing the other person.

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
No, that's right.

174
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,340
The other person was wearing a bulletproof vest by chance.

175
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,460
So it's a weapon.

176
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,180
Everyone is shot in the head.

177
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,240
So I'm wearing a bulletproof wig.

178
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,140
It's unnatural to buy a simple udon at such a high price.

179
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,360
Yeah, yeah.

180
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,200
Why would you go to the harbor and do this?

181
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,000
And why do you think it's a bad idea to buy udon?

182
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,360
It's noisy every day.

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,780
It's a gag manga, so leave the details alone.

184
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,540
Either way, it's not a manga for Weekly Sapphire.

185
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,280
This manga cannot be published.

186
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,500
I'll somehow get it out of the way.

187
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,780
No, you can't.

188
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,640
Anyway, Ryo-chan's manga will never be on Weekly Sapphire.

189
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,440
This is the final decision at the editorial meeting.

190
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,560
Damn it, Ryusenshi!

191
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,520
It seems like a bad thing is a bad thing, so you give up so easily.

192
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,880
What are you talking about?

193
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,700
It's that easy?

194
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,740
Huh?

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,040
Stop it, Honda!

196
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,740
What's wrong, Ryo-chan's husband?

197
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,840
Look, there.

198
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,620
Oh, you've thrown away a lot of books.

199
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,360
This is the head of Sekine Shippan.

200
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,900
It's my father's.

201
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,740
Why are there so many books?

202
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,740
They're still new.

203
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,020
They're not thrown away.

204
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
What's wrong, father?

205
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,880
This is a book that has been returned.

206
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,000
All of them?

207
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,560
Not just the outside.

208
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,040
There are so many of them.

209
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,180
That's a lot.

210
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,940
Because it's not published yet.

211
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,920
What kind of book did you make?

212
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,380
The world's pen tip?

213
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,360
The world of the wonderful Bolt and Nat?

214
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,100
There's no way a book like this will sell!

215
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,680
Is that so?

216
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,680
It will never sell!

217
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,940
I guarantee it.

218
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,920
I knew it.

219
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,260
I have to make a book that will sell here.

220
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,940
If I don't do it, I'll be a father.

221
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,360
Hmm, a book that will sell, a book that will sell...

222
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,020
Hm? Then it's a manga!

223
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,300
Manga?

224
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,920
That's right, you can make a manga magazine.

225
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,340
You're small, but you're the president of a publishing company!

226
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Among these published books, the only thing that sells is manga!

227
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,260
Manga is read widely by young people, from children to adults.

228
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,420
And it's cheap, you can read it anytime, anywhere, and the contents are interesting!

229
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,780
If you publish a manga magazine, you can overcome your father's crisis!

230
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,060
I see!

231
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,940
But it's impossible.

232
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,920
Huh?

233
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,800
I don't have a know-how for manga magazines, and I don't know any manga artists either.

234
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,160
If that's the case, don't worry! Leave everything to me!

235
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,680
Huh?

236
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,660
The popular manga artist's serialization is just about to end, and my hands are empty!

237
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,260
Ah!

238
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,360
Senpai, are you going to serialize your own manga?

239
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,200
Of course!

240
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,240
I knew it.

241
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,060
Yes! I'm done!

242
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,720
F-faster! This time it's 4 minutes!

243
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,940
This is my masterpiece!

244
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,960
How is it, Honda?

245
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,400
This is...

246
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,840
"Robo-Deka Bancho R"!

247
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,120
R?

248
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,960
It's a sequel to "Robo-Deka Bancho", which ended in a huge hit!

249
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,760
Speaking of "Robo-Deka Bancho", it's also a TV anime and is extremely famous.

250
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,440
It's a waste to let it end like that, so I decided to re-release it in a new magazine!

251
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,300
Huh...

252
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,700
But, Senpai, what about other manga artists other than you?

253
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,260
What should I do?

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,920
You should ask the publisher!

255
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,840
Hello?

256
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,140
Is this the weekly step editorial department?

257
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,080
Who is the most popular manga artist in your area?

258
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,640
Hoshi Hikaru?

259
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,220
Yes!

260
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
Tell me his phone number!

261
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,600
Reason?

262
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,320
Of course, to have it written in my magazine!

263
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,760
Huh?

264
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,300
Huh?

265
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:24,620
Huh?

266
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,660
Damn it!

267
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,840
You cut it suddenly!

268
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,440
You're rude!

269
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,700
I'm the rude one!

270
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,080
You're the rude one, Senpai!

271
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,120
What?

272
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,180
For the publisher, a popular manga artist is a property.

273
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,060
The information of a manga artist is a top secret.

274
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,100
Damn it!

275
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,640
Ryo-san, it's impossible after all...

276
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,920
Don't give up!

277
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,380
You have to re-release the manga magazine no matter what!

278
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,500
But how?

279
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,720
There should be something.

280
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,380
Something?

281
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,440
Huh?

282
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,560
Right!

283
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,720
If you can make a manga artist who is as good as a famous writer,

284
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,900
why not Replicas?

285
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,360
Huh?

286
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,900
Hey, Ryo-san.

287
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,120
Isn't it bad if a manga artist is as good as a famous writer?

288
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,920
There should be something called Replicas in manga, right?

289
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,760
It should be good even if it's a manga.

290
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,940
I feel that manga is something different from manga in manga...

291
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,040
Besides, what if a professional manga artist complains about it?

292
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,320
Don't worry.

293
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,100
That's what I'm good at.

294
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,340
I'm confident that the person who complains about it will say that he copied it.

295
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,380
I have the confidence to tell you that I have it.

296
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,080
But how do you get good people to draw?

297
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,140
I have an idea.

298
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,600
Is it a manga school?

299
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,980
Students are asked to write a manuscript as a task and publish it in a magazine.

300
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,580
That doesn't cost any money.

301
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,060
If you convert the tuition fee and teaching expenses of the school into a manuscript printing fee, you can make a free book.

302
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,620
I see. That's great.

303
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
This is the magic business method.

304
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,820
But are the students going to get together?

305
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,340
That's okay.

306
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,720
We have a special instructor.

307
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,340
What?

308
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,780
Mr. Jacky Ponchi, Mr. Kazuyoshi Horori, and Nana-chan.

309
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,540
No, no.

310
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,660
Take a good look.

311
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,340
What?

312
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,360
Mr. Nomiko Nobunaga's ex-boyfriend...

313
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,320
What? Are you talking about me?

314
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,180
Ping pong!

315
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,780
I'm not joking!

316
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,940
I can't draw a manga.

317
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,460
Besides, we're still dating.

318
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,460
We're not old friends!

319
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,200
Don't worry about that.

320
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,240
Then maybe it's someone else, too...

321
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,120
Mr. Jacky Ponchi's ex-husband, Mr. Horori Kazuyoshi's ex-fiance.

322
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,040
Aino Sensei's main character...

323
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,940
is here...

324
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,060
The teacher is here!

325
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,700
I wonder if Aino Sensei will come!

326
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,980
I want my autograph!

327
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,600
You've gathered well, Ryo-san!

328
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,700
The special instructor has come, right?

329
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,700
Now, we will perform the special instructor's lecture.

330
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,820
I've been waiting!

331
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,160
It's Aino Sensei!

332
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,840
He's here!

333
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,000
He's here!

334
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,200
What's this?

335
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,680
Is Aino Sensei a man?

336
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,480
Well...

337
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,160
Aino Miko Sensei's main character is Nana-chan, the sound princess.

338
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,280
And this is...

339
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,440
a picture we took together.

340
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,580
And this is...

341
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,700
a picture of the time we went on a touring.

342
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,960
He's a different man than before.

343
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,820
He really is.

344
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,980
He's a different man than before.

345
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,460
That's all.

346
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,020
What is it?

347
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,440
What did you want to say?

348
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,860
In other words,

349
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,220
Aino Sensei's main character is Nana, the sound princess.

350
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,920
And she's dating two men, right?

351
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,360
I'm glad you thought that.

352
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,740
You're doing great.

353
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,460
Leave the rest to me!

354
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,000
Leave the rest to me!

355
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,220
Hello, everyone!

356
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,580
I'm a special instructor, John Ryo-tsu.

357
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,180
Nice to meet you!

358
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,160
Um...

359
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,240
If you enter this school, you'll be able to become a professional.

360
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,460
It's okay!

361
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,400
If I do what I say,

362
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,100
I can debut 100% as a professional.

363
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,300
Really?

364
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,280
That's great.

365
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,700
That's the right idea.

366
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,420
Because I'm here,

367
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,000
You guys should be in a big room.

368
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,420
Then, let's start the class.

369
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,460
First, prepare the paper.

370
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,040
I brought it.

371
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,180
Me too.

372
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,900
What?

373
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,340
No, not this paper!

374
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,640
Use the paper that is designated for the school properly!

375
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,540
If you want to be a professional, use good paper!

376
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,320
Otherwise, don't write good manga!

377
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,680
Understood?

378
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:00,820
I got it!

379
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,280
500 yen per sheet.

380
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,640
It's like a 10 yen paper.

381
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,600
458!

382
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,260
Then, everyone should buy a textbook.

383
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's absolutely necessary to be a professional.

384
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,840
It's expensive.

385
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,200
80,000 yen.

386
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,180
One pencil is 1,000 yen.

387
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,100
Will you use a pen?

388
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,340
And a driver.

389
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,180
I chose only wonderful things.

390
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,980
100 yen for a screen tone.

391
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,020
Teacher, you can buy a cheap tone.

392
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,500
That's right.

393
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,660
It's a student's tone.

394
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:30,960
It's a special point.

395
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,680
Then, please give me 10 sheets of No. 61.

396
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,940
Me too.

397
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,200
20 sheets for this one.

398
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,420
Yes, 10 sheets.

399
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,900
Is it so small?

400
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,600
Paste it on a small part.

401
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,640
It's like a cut.

402
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,520
I prepared the necessary materials as a professional.

403
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,060
Be sure to buy it.

404
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,960
It's expensive.

405
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,980
It costs 200,000 yen to draw one work.

406
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,060
Manga artists must have drawing power.

407
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,000
So, I'll give you drawing dolls from now on.

408
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,460
I'll give you a drawing doll.

409
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,920
Drawing Doll No. 1.

410
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,100
It's like a cursed straw doll.

411
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,720
It has a wire inside and it can move freely.

412
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,800
Next, it's a drawing doll for girls.

413
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,000
It doesn't change at all.

414
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,580
There is also a horse drawing doll.

415
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,320
It's like a big stick.

416
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,920
Then, I'll teach you the basics of making a story.

417
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,220
Teacher.

418
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,040
Yes?

419
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,800
I brought the work I drew.

420
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,560
Would you like to see it?

421
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,740
Okay.

422
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:25,860
I'll hold it.

423
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,400
I thought I was going to make an artistic work on the theme of human love.

424
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,580
What do you think?

425
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,260
Hmm?

426
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,020
Are you kidding me?

427
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,140
The theme is art?

428
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,320
You don't want that?

429
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,160
That's my own desire.

430
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm satisfied with myself.

431
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,560
What you want to read is an interesting manga.

432
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,060
You don't understand that?

433
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,820
Yes, I'm sorry.

434
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,240
What is an interesting manga?

435
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,580
I'll tell you the secret from now on.

436
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,920
Got it?

437
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,400
It's a boy manga!

438
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,200
The main character of a boy manga is a little naughty.

439
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,840
And next to him is a beautiful heroine.

440
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,340
And the main character's story.

441
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,200
And the main character always needs an enemy.

442
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,920
The stronger the enemy, the stronger the desire.

443
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,740
The more the main character is happy when he defeats him.

444
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,100
And finally, the battle with the enemy.

445
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,520
It's a battle.

446
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
The main character and the enemy always have a battle.

447
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,980
Even if you make a mistake, the main character must not defeat the enemy.

448
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,500
You must not be defeated by the enemy once.

449
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,660
And the main character realizes his own helplessness.

450
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,840
He shed a tear of regret.

451
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,700
And then he exercises.

452
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:45,820
Exercise?

453
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,800
In a situation like this, the main character is buried in a mountain and hit by a waterfall.

454
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,380
And after the exercise,

455
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,680
the boss is

456
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,500
trained by the enemy himself.

457
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,000
And the enemy is a trick to become a very strong enemy.

458
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,700
And the enemy does not run away from the mountain.

459
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,220
It's even better if you cut off one of the chịples yourself.

460
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,000
And then it will be a ground fight against the enemies again.

461
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,440
But here's just a little bit of excitement here.

462
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,300
Finally defeat the enemy.

463
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,540
And the enemy is SK of the heroine.

464
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,800
Becoming a partner of the heroine.

465
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,700
But at that time, a black shadow that was already hiding from them

466
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,000
There is a new enemy

467
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
More than that

468
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:33,080
Enemy appearance, confrontation, defeat, special training, confrontation, victory, reconciliation, enemy appearance

469
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,120
If you repeat this, you can continue the boy manga no matter how many times

470
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,680
Oh, is that so?

471
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,640
Um, teacher

472
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,140
What?

473
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,220
I want to draw a girl manga

474
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
Girl manga, good

475
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,160
Girl manga is love

476
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
The main character likes a transfer student boy

477
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,880
The main character is a little bit of a girl to get the reader's sympathy

478
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,260
And the main character is troubled by the appearance of a rival in love

479
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,860
It's going to stick, it won't stick

480
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,840
Ah, don't be frustrated

481
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,280
If you like it, say it quickly

482
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,960
I'm just trying to make the reader feel

483
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,540
I'm just trying to make the reader feel

484
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,800
Confession

485
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,480
Then

486
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,900
The transfer student also liked the main character from the beginning

487
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,460
What a ridiculous development

488
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,980
It can be said to be the standard of most girls manga

489
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,140
Let the main character hide his glasses

490
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,660
It was actually beautiful to take off his glasses

491
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,820
If you do something like that, the reader will be even happier

492
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,780
I see

493
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,800
Then the next is a boy manga

494
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,200
The main character is left alone by a man who can't stand it

495
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,140
Suddenly a cute girl comes and lives with him

496
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,200
Like this

497
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,040
If you talk about something that makes a man's selfish desire come true, the reader will definitely eat it

498
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,020
Girls wear glasses and dress up as a maid to make them even happier

499
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,280
Next is a fantasy manga

500
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,500
It's a world of anything

501
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:03,120
If you say something like superpower or age, the reader will be convinced that it is

502
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,480
But if there is too much of anything and the story becomes incomprehensible, you should keep it in the first part

503
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,720
The theory manga is a basic trick

504
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,980
Before the culprit gets involved in such a complicated thing

505
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,660
Talk to the sad side of the culprit

506
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,340
Don't forget about the forceful trick

507
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,900
I feel like I can draw something

508
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,460
Me too

509
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,580
Then, based on the above

510
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,820
Let's actually ask you to draw a manga

511
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,260
Even if I say

512
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,840
Because you are an amateur, you will not get ideas so easily

513
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,460
I will draw a wonderful original work

514
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,120
I will draw a wonderful original work

515
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,400
I will draw a wonderful original work

516
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,240
Thank you

517
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,140
Do useless employees get along with the president?

518
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,900
Does a submarine declare an independent nation?

519
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,140
Does a hero with a simple face play an active role?

520
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,020
Does the school slip to the future?

521
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,460
Does a frog stick to the shirt on the fallen cover?

522
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,400
Do robots fight?

523
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,620
Do you push and push instead of the moon?

524
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,620
Then, each of you will draw a manga in that original work

525
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,820
This is today's task

526
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,420
Draw

527
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:19,760
The characters all have the same face

528
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,880
You can only change the hairstyle

529
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,360
I can not draw the background well

530
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,600
Make a lot of screen tone and deceive

531
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,640
It is difficult to draw each mecha

532
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,940
Copy and turn it over

533
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,600
Somehow it seems to work well

534
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:33,920
That's right

535
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,100
As expected of Wagyo

536
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,060
I did it

537
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,880
Me too

538
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,240
I also

539
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,420
I also

540
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,960
I also

541
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,400
Put the original work on the desk and go home

542
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,900
OK

543
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,420
That's all for the original

544
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,280
All you have to do is print this

545
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Then I'll print this immediately

546
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,780
Ten thousand

547
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,020
Is it too many?

548
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,840
Idiot

549
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,260
I'm saying it's too little

550
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,100
It is said that the selling manga magazine is more than one million copies

551
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,360
One million pages

552
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,420
This magazine also has my most popular manga, Robodeca Banjo R.

553
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,460
Three million... No, I mean 5 million copies will sell.

554
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,540
5 million copies!

555
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,080
Stop being so picky!

556
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,160
I'm going to sell all the manga magazines I've made and smash you up!

557
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,020
So this is the comic Ryotsu Senpai made?

558
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,020
Yes, Robodeca Banjo R is in Kanto.

559
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,580
It's still a great picture.

560
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,800
It's even better when it's colored.

561
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,520
There's no way a manga like this would sell in Kanto.

562
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,360
Besides, the manga inside is all things I've seen somewhere, so no one buys such magazines.

563
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,660
Reiko-san was right.

564
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,240
The comic Ryotsu that has made 5 million copies is not selling at all.

565
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,520
It was this one that was crushed, not the weekly Sapphire.

566
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,180
There are too many people who don't care about the world.

567
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,940
No matter how you think about it...

568
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,080
It's obvious that it won't sell.

569
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,740
Ryo-san!

570
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,360
The father of Sekine Publishing!

571
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,900
Sensei!

572
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,600
You guys!

573
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,940
Ryo-san!

574
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,600
We finally have a father because of Ryo-san!

575
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,960
How are you going to pay for this!

576
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,680
Hey, no, you can't say that!

577
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,780
Sensei, what do you mean by the manga school is closed?

578
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,520
We paid for the class fee for a year. How are you going to pay for this!

579
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,300
And what kind of magazine is this?

580
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,940
You can't just put your manga on a magazine and...

581
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,460
It's a scam!

582
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,440
It's a scam!

583
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,900
So, this is...

584
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,940
Why are you giving it to me, Ryo-san!

585
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,800
Sensei!

586
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,920
Ryo-san!

587
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,620
The magazine is already full!

588
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,720
I don't want to do it! I don't want to do it!

589
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,760
Why do I have to do something I don't want to do and do something I don't have to do?

590
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,760
If you tell me that I don't have to do something I don't have to do, I might want to do it!

591
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,980
Next time on I Don't Want to Do It!

592
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,420
Please watch the other one!

593
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,540
♪ There's a turtle over there! ♪

594
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,000
♪ Ah, there's definitely a turtle! ♪

595
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,160
♪ Everyone, come to our town! ♪

596
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,640
Thank you!
