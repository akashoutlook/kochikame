1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,080
"When you're watching TV, light up your room and look away!"

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,520
Come to me, you poor thing!

3
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,940
I'm not here, but I'm worried

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:35,900
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

5
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,160
It'll be alright eventually

6
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:56,740
I have no job

7
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,800
Come to me, you poor thing!

8
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,500
I'm not here, but I'm worried

9
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,320
Look at the red clouds and the burning clouds

10
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,620
It'll be alright eventually

11
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,600
You know what to do, right?

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,160
You know what to do, right?

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,720
If you do, then come to me!

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,200
If you do, then come to me!

15
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,180
If you do, then come to me!

16
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,860
If you do, then come to me!

17
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,760
If you do, then come to me!

18
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,120
If you do, then come to me!

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,920
If you do, then come to me!

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,060
It's been a year since I entered the 21st century

21
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,580
But crimes don't go away at once

22
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,140
On the contrary, they increase

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,700
My special detective also pays full attention to the increasing crime every day

24
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,440
and the ability to deal with them.

25
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,500
However, our ability to deal with them is also reaching its limit.

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,480
That's why, this time, we're going to be adding a new special system.

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,480
That name is...

28
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,940
"The Transparent Giant Appears!"

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,460
The Transparent Giant Appears!

30
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,580
And so, I have appointed you to become a special detective!

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,020
So, I told you I don't want to be a member of the pervert group!

32
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,320
What?

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
My...

34
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,800
Where are you calling me a pervert?!

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,320
That's what I'm talking about!

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,780
Why are you so sad? You're the chief of the council and the chief of the council,

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,000
and you're acting like a weirdo!

38
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,840
Then, don't worry.

39
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,240
This time, you don't even need to wear a suit.

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,120
What kind of pose are you going to do? That's your choice.

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,120
Huh? Really?!

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,640
Yeah.

43
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,820
Why? Because you're going to be a transparent person.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,220
Transparent person?!

45
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,560
What is this?!

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,000
Kurokuro! Kurokuro! Kurokuro! Kurokuro! Kuro-suke!

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
Kei-koro! Kei-koro!

48
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,140
Yu-oh!

49
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,360
Professor Ezaki...

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,340
Ryo-san, is this...

51
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,180
It might be Pink Lady!

52
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,660
When you hear "transparent human," the first thing a Japanese thinks of is Pink Lady!

53
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,000
But isn't that song "Yu-oh"?

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,580
Gink!

55
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,380
Y-Yes, it is!

56
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,780
Actually, I can't help but remember the intro of "Transparent Human."

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,940
What are you here for?

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,760
Invisible Liquid!

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,040
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa!

60
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,120
By drinking this liquid, you can become a transparent human!

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,240
And become a special detective, Transparent Deka.

62
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,760
That's a no!

63
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,500
Did you really do the experiment?

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,700
You don't have to worry about the details.

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,960
In short, I'm the experiment team, right?

66
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,420
Every time, they're all ridiculous!

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,740
Ehem...

68
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,460
Ehem...

69
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,840
Hehehe.

70
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,440
Handsome, you seem to no longer perform as Transparent Deka.

71
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,140
What?

72
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,360
Aah!

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,820
What's lying here!?

74
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,300
Huh?

75
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,120
I-it's so transparent!

76
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,280
What?

77
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,040
Oh...

78
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Ah...

79
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:39,960
Ah!

80
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,860
While you were outside...

81
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,620
Huh?

82
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,060
I thought it was Seen in the Water.

83
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,480
Professor Ezaki gave it to you.

84
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,980
Professor Ezaki gave it to you.

85
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,800
I put the invisible liquid in there.

86
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,280
What an excellent collaboration play.

87
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,500
You guys are dirty!

88
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,320
I'm doing this to destroy crime.

89
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,360
You guys are like criminals!

90
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,020
Your body is...

91
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,560
It disappeared!

92
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,080
I've never seen a transparent human before.

93
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,500
I can't see it though.

94
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,540
It's my body!

95
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,120
Are you that happy?

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,360
I can see your happy face!

97
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,580
I can't see it because it's transparent.

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,740
What?

99
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:37,480
Ryotsu, when you're officially assigned to the Special Investigation Department, your salary will be three times as much as before.

100
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,240
In addition, you'll receive special treatment for all your travel.

101
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,440
I don't want to be fooled by such a sweet word.

102
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,840
He's definitely smiling.

103
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,500
There's no mistake.

104
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,020
What?

105
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,840
You guys can't see my face, can you?

106
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,960
I can see it even if I can't see it.

107
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,140
It's decided.

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,460
Then take off your clothes.

109
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,420
What?

110
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,240
If you wear clothes, there's no point in being a transparent human.

111
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,700
R-right.

112
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,220
I understand.

113
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,640
Take it off.

114
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,380
Take it off.

115
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,500
It's transparent inside.

116
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,400
Don't stare at it.

117
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,740
I can't see anything.

118
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,120
I can't see anything.

119
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,640
Hey, do I have to take this off?

120
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,440
Of course.

121
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,300
Even if you know that you can't see, it's hard to take off your pants in front of people.

122
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,900
How about this?

123
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,160
Oh!

124
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,320
When the transparent department carries out its missions, it must always be in line.

125
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,740
That's why you were chosen, a person who can never catch a cold even in the morning.

126
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,440
I knew you would say that.

127
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,480
Yes.

128
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,920
Hmm...

129
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,920
It's me.

130
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,080
Hmm...

131
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,480
I understand. I'll be right back.

132
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,080
I've got a job.

133
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,380
I'm Tomoe Deka Ryo-tsuwa.

134
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,740
Until I'm officially assigned to the Special Police Department, I will continue my work as I have been.

135
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,520
Well then...

136
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,780
I should get going now.

137
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,060
Wait a minute!

138
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,820
How am I supposed to get back to normal?

139
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,700
You're still a transparent human being.

140
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,300
You don't have to worry about getting back to normal.

141
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,880
I'm worried about what you've made!

142
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,960
"A place where the winter comes and the spring comes."

143
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,360
"There's a beginning and an end to everything."

144
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,880
"Any great invention can eventually be destroyed."

145
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,200
So you're saying we have to wait for the destruction to be over and we can get back to normal?

146
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,720
That's...

147
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,700
God knows.

148
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,840
What?

149
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,640
When you get back to normal, you'll be able to contact me.

150
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,680
Well then, goodbye!

151
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,820
Ugh...

152
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,720
What's going on?

153
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,760
Are you laughing?

154
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,980
I'm frustrated.

155
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,140
You guys have been dating me for years.

156
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,560
Don't you know whether you're angry or crying?

157
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,560
I can't see your face.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,600
What kind of face did you have?

159
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,380
You're all so annoying.

160
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:10,520
You're so annoying.

161
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,900
This is the face.

162
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,960
I see.

163
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,700
Not "I see".

164
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,420
Try to see with your eyes.

165
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,960
Yes, sir.

166
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,060
Listen up.

167
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,780
I'm standing in front of you.

168
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,320
Look at me closely.

169
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,300
You're going to laugh.

170
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,020
You see?

171
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,120
How's this?

172
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:40,740
How's this?

173
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:40,920
Do you see anything?

174
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,180
So what do you mean, "how's this"?

175
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,980
Is it possible for me to see with my imagination?

176
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,840
I think you can see, now.

177
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,300
Eh?

178
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,960
Are you sure you think I can see, Reiko?

179
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,440
S-s-s-sry.

180
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,320
This is a bit...

181
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,860
Let's go!

182
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,300
We're going to get you on in time.

183
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,760
How is this?

184
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,620
Well...

185
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,360
Now, you see?

186
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,040
Y-yeah.

187
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,640
W-well, guess who I guess this is?

188
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,520
Guess what it is.

189
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:07,940
Huh?

190
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,080
Um...

191
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,420
How should I put it?

192
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,880
Well...

193
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,220
It has eyes, a nose, a mouth, and ears.

194
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,860
See? You can see the nose. You're smiling, right?

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,460
Ouch!

196
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,280
I'm behind you, young man.

197
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,140
That's unfair.

198
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,640
Good morning.

199
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,560
Oh, Chief.

200
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,820
Good morning.

201
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,240
What?

202
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,880
Ryo-tsu, you're skipping again?

203
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,200
No...

204
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,700
Well, Ryo-san...

205
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,080
Shut up.

206
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,380
I'll pour you some tea.

207
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,320
Ryo-tsu, you're a pain in the ass.

209
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,460
Huh?

210
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,600
Oh, and before that, let's go to the bathroom.

211
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,340
Chief, you're so lucky.

212
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,800
Ryo-san, you're lucky.

213
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,180
Don't do that.

214
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,120
Now that I'm an invisible man, I'll make a little fun of the Chief.

215
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,460
When he comes back, I'll get him to walk on his feet.

216
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,380
Senior, you'd better not do that.

217
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,980
Shut up!

218
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm telling you, you two.

219
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,800
Be quiet!

220
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,420
I don't know.

221
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,880
Ah, I feel refreshed.

222
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,500
My body feels lighter.

223
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,440
Ouch!

224
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,400
Ouch!

225
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,180
Ouch!

226
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,360
I heard something strange.

227
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,520
What's that sound?

228
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,060
Is there a rat?

229
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,340
No, chief. Actually...

230
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,420
Get rid of it with my spirit.

231
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,040
Oh, that's...

232
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,800
Ouch!

233
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,060
Please stop!

234
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,180
I felt like I heard Ryotsu's voice.

235
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,240
It must be my imagination.

236
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,500
Ouch!

237
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,940
It's not my imagination!

238
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,020
No, no, no, no, no, no!

239
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,380
I'm the one you're hitting!

240
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,740
I became a transparent human!

241
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,920
Is that true, chief?

242
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,840
Senpai became a special detective, a special detective!

243
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,860
I knew it.

244
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,560
I got a call from you, too.

245
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
That's terrible!

246
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,020
If you knew, why did you do that?

247
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,120
I knew it!

248
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,820
I tried to pull the chair and make it hang on the ground,

249
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,120
or I tried to make it fall down!

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,140
Did you notice?

251
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,880
Ouch!

252
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,740
I can imagine what you're going to do.

253
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,100
Please don't pull my ears!

254
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,500
I can see where your ears are.

255
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,120
I've seen all Ryotsu's behavior patterns.

256
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,840
I've been a boss for more than 20 years.

257
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,060
As expected of Chief Ohara.

258
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,860
Chief, the tea is here.

259
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,680
Ouch!

260
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,000
Be careful, Reiko!

261
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,540
Oh!

262
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,560
I can't see, so I can't help it.

263
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,900
Damn it!

264
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,440
That's why I said I don't like transparent people!

265
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,420
Oh, no!

266
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,700
It's late again!

267
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,680
Oh, no!

268
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,980
My face is gone!

269
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,600
It's gone!

270
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,020
What's going on?

271
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,800
My body is gone, too!

272
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,200
Did I die?

273
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,440
Ouch!

274
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,040
Oh, I see!

275
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,020
I forgot I became a transparent big man.

276
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,200
You moron!

277
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,160
Ouch!

278
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,400
You're late again, Ryotsu!

279
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,020
Ouch!

280
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,920
I'm sorry!

281
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,620
I'm sorry!

282
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,960
If you skip work here because you're so transparent,

283
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,860
you'll be in trouble!

284
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,840
Chief, the tea is here!

285
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,140
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

286
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,640
I told you to be careful!

287
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,520
I told you to run away!

288
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,440
But I can't see it.

289
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,200
It can't be helped.

290
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,120
Damn, it's no good to be a transparent giant.

291
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,300
That's right.

292
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,460
Hey, Ryotsu.

293
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,660
Ryotsu!

294
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,060
Ryotsu!

295
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,360
Oh, no!

296
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,840
Ryotsu!

297
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,900
Ryotsu!

298
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,940
What's wrong?

299
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,340
Ryotsu disappeared before I knew it.

300
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,660
You must have been beaten up by your senior.

301
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,400
Damn, Ryotsu.

302
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,400
What's with the mountain of boiled eggs?

303
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,280
A lot of eggs came from the next farm.

304
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,320
I got a lot of eggs.

305
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,200
This is it.

306
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,580
No, no, I forgot my wallet.

307
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,160
I can't get a pachinko with this.

308
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,220
Is the chief still here?

309
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,720
Close the door.

310
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,740
There's no one here.

311
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,340
Ryotsu!

312
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,280
Where did you go?

313
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,400
Chief, can you see me?

314
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,460
You can't see me at all.

315
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,620
This is it.

316
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,040
You can see it from this egg's shell.

317
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,540
I'm going to get out of here.

318
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,520
If you want to get out of here, I'll let you go.

319
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,580
Send this document to the office.

320
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,480
Okay, okay.

321
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,420
I got it.

322
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,420
I'm going.

323
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,520
Chief, you don't have to get so angry.

324
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:33,800
Move!

325
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,700
What? Is that a remote-controlled bicycle?

326
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,380
Move, move.

327
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,340
Don't stare at me.

328
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,500
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

329
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,500
I'm going to kill you!

330
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,160
I played dirty to the end.

331
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,380
Uh, where is it?

332
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,520
It broke, but it can't be helped.

333
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,940
Let's walk.

334
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,220
I'm gonna get you!

335
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,620
Hey, what was that?

336
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,960
What was that?

337
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,900
What was that?

338
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,720
I don't know.

339
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,100
But I'm sure we're all tired.

340
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,820
You work too much.

341
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,880
Take a break.

342
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:35,320
That was close.

343
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,680
He's getting in my way.

344
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,280
I can't see the other side.

345
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,900
Ouch!

346
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,000
I think I heard someone.

347
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,620
Get out of the way!

348
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:48,840
Whatever.

349
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,900
Damn it. The road is dangerous.

350
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,820
Let's go the back way.

351
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,120
I think this way is safe.

352
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,660
Ouch! I stepped on a nail.

353
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,320
I can't walk on my own.

354
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
You...

355
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,420
I'm out of the way.

356
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,040
Ouch!

357
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,080
What?

358
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,560
Can you see me?

359
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,200
Oh, right. Dogs smell.

360
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,080
Do you know that?

361
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,600
Go away!

362
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:20,840
Ouch!

363
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,320
Don't bite my butt!

364
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,140
Ouch!

365
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,320
Ouch!

366
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,380
Shut up, you stupid dog!

367
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,160
Damn it.

368
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,020
I stepped on it.

369
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,300
Ouch!

370
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,020
Damn it.

371
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,380
Ouch!

372
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,680
Ouch!

373
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:41,960
Ouch!

374
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,000
I told you I'm not playing soccer in the street.

375
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:48,980
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,020
The back way is dangerous.

377
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,660
I'm sorry.

378
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,100
I'm sorry.

379
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,500
I'm sorry.

380
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,500
I'm sorry.

381
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,220
I'm sorry.

382
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,260
Ouch!

383
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,540
Ouch!

384
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,440
Ouch!

385
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,080
Ouch!

386
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,840
Ouch!

387
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,060
Ouch!

388
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:11,700
Ouch!

389
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,060
Ouch!

390
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,140
Ouch!

391
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,720
Ouch!

392
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,900
Ouch!

393
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,500
A women's room?

394
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm glad I became a transparent person.

395
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,020
Emergency! Emergency!

396
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,920
At the Katsushika-cho office,

397
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,240
-Hitojichi-Tatakiya-Buchi-ken... -Nako, let's go!

398
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,780
Huh? What's wrong?

399
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,420
I think we ran into something.

400
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,100
Just in case. Let's go.

401
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:32,820
Okay.

402
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,000
Damn it, you suddenly opened it.

403
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,400
I almost had a nosebleed.

404
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,720
It's your turn, Transparent Deka.

405
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,380
Why are you here?

406
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,200
A man who became a transparent person

407
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,280
would want to be here at least once.

408
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,480
Gifu, you're being read.

409
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,780
Why are you coming out of the room?

410
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,100
Don't worry about the details.

411
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,780
Ryo-tsu, the chief inspector,

412
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,000
if you successfully solve this case

413
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,980
and get officially hired by the Special Prosecutor's Office,

414
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,800
your pay will be tripled.

415
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,300
I-I see.

416
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,620
Okay, I'll do it.

417
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,220
Today,

418
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,200
the man who went to the Katsushika financial company

419
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,680
is running to the security and police station

420
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:18,880
where he ran into an emergency call

421
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,200
and running towards a female employee.

422
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,060
He's currently hiding in this new building.

423
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,600
The scene is in a mess.

424
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,160
Hey, you, get up!

425
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,100
Hurry up and bring the cash and the car!

426
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,760
I don't care what happens to this woman!

427
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,660
Help me!

428
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,160
I can't get any closer.

429
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,200
If Ryo-tsu, the transparent person, were here,

430
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,680
I'd be able to get close to the culprit.

431
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,420
He said he went to the Katsushika financial company

432
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:47,580
with Chief Inspector Kaipan,

433
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,040
but he's already here.

434
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,080
Chief Inspector Kaipan?

435
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,580
I'm here, too.

436
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,940
You're here?

437
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,540
How do you know that?

438
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,440
I said you saw through my actions!

439
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,300
It's not the time to play around!

440
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,940
I'm sorry.

441
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,240
How's the situation?

442
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,560
The culprit is a young man with a rifle.

443
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,520
He's holding a young woman,

444
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,040
and he's asking for 500 million yen in cash

445
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,480
and a car for the robbery.

446
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,720
The building is just completed,

447
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,780
and there's nothing in it yet.

448
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,960
There's not much of an obstacle,

449
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,140
and it's hard to get in.

450
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,020
The entrance is just that one place

451
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,200
in front of the front door.

452
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,640
All right, you're all clear.

453
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,400
You can get close without the culprit noticing.

454
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,860
Get close and rescue the host first.

455
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,940
Yes, sir!

456
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,440
Once you've been rescued,

457
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,040
the police force will rush in

458
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
and secure the culprit.

459
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,440
I'll make sure the culprit's safe.

460
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,440
No, you can't.

461
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,080
You just need to think about rescuing the host.

462
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,020
You're going to be in trouble

463
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,580
when you get in trouble.

464
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,820
Yes, sir.

465
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,420
Sir,

466
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,160
when the culprit enters the building,

467
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,940
he's locked in from the inside.

468
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,180
This is the key.

469
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,500
I borrowed it from the owner of the building.

470
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,220
All right, I got it.

471
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,680
Then the operation begins.

472
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,920
Clear and clear.

473
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,420
Clear and clear.

474
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:07,780
Roger that.

475
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,600
I'm on my way.

476
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,740
I don't think I can see him.

477
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,140
Here I go.

478
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,540
I can't see him.

479
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,540
He's dressed like this,

480
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,160
and he's showing his butt hole.

481
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,600
I can't even notice him.

482
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,480
Both of them

483
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,880
haven't reached the entrance yet.

484
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,980
Yes, sir.

485
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,780
It looks like they've entered the building.

486
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,220
Yes, they've entered successfully.

487
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,580
It's the second floor.

488
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,760
First,

489
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,220
we need to rescue the host.

490
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,240
Hey,

491
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,140
hurry up.

492
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,480
The car and the pipe.

493
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,840
Don't be so nervous.

494
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm the police.

495
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,440
I'll save you.

496
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,880
What's that?

497
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,280
I see something important

498
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,360
at an important moment.

499
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,740
Even if I hide it with my hands,

500
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,780
my hands are transparent.

501
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,680
Hey,

502
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
don't move.

503
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,700
Damn it.

504
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,320
If I do,

505
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,580
I'll burn.

506
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,800
What's that?

507
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,600
What are you doing?

508
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,100
It's a big transparent thing.

509
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,200
I'll arrest you.

510
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:12,600
Hey,

511
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,140
don't do it.

512
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,700
All right.

513
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,100
I'll get you.

514
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,440
Hey,

515
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,580
what are you doing?

516
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,220
Pull it.

517
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,520
Okay.

518
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,020
I'll go first.

519
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,320
It's over.

520
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,180
The case is solved.

521
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,420
Ryochi!

522
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,080
Hey,

523
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,980
Ryochi's figure.

524
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,100
The power of the medicine

525
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,580
must have run out.

526
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,500
Hey,

527
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:43,660
move.

528
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,240
Oh.

529
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,900
The culprit is arrested.

530
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,700
The poison scoop.

531
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,380
This is the arrest site.

532
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,760
Huh?

533
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,040
What was that?

534
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,540
The culprit is a pervert.

535
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,060
Something's wrong.

536
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,180
What was that?

537
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,960
The culprit's figure is...

538
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,000
A gentleman.

539
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,300
It's Ryochi.

540
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,800
A certain incident

541
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,540
has made him look weak.

542
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,180
No more night in his hypocritical face.

543
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,280
He hasn't been sent off

544
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,180
to the special police department,

545
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,200
nor to see anyone.

546
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,140
Amazing.

547
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,340
Hey,

548
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:23,980
don't get depressed,

549
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,720
Gorilla.

550
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,980
Everyone makes small mistakes.

551
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,380
Hey,

552
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,700
Hey Ezagi! I know it's your fault, but you made such a half-baked medicine!

553
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,480
Nin!

554
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,200
Invisible Liquid Market!

555
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,380
It's a supplement. This time it's perfect. Try it.

556
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,180
I'm never going to drink what you made!

557
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,440
It's already in the tea.

558
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,800
What?!

559
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,880
You idiot! You drank it!

560
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,980
This one's quick-release. It should work right away.

561
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,460

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,380
Nakagawa! How do I look? Am I gone?

563
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,820
No, you're not.

564
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,400
That's too bad.

565
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,340
You scared me!

566
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,380
I have to go back and do my Mark III research.

567
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,680
I don't want to!

568
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,840
Well, everyone, good luck!

569
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,480
Damn it. What a mad scientist.

570
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,980
What's wrong, Senior?

571
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,700
I feel dizzy.

572
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,420
I... I...

573
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,300
What's wrong, Ryo?

574
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,760
This time, only the key points are transparent!

575
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,760
Everyone, look!

576
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,200
No! Don't show it!

577
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
I said, you can't see it anymore!

578
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,980
It's true!

579
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,240
It's weird.

580
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,300
Damn it! Ezaki!

581
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,680
Ezaki, come back!

582
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,740
What are you doing to me?!

583
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,360
Damn it!

584
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,040
I feel dizzy now that I'm a transparent human!

585
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:05,980
"Residue"

586
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,100
"Residue"

587
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,060
"Residue"

588
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,920
"Residue"

589
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,540
"Residue"

590
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:17,920
"Residue"

591
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:19,700
"Residue"

592
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:20,920
"Residue"

593
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,320
"Residue"

594
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,760
"Residue"

595
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,220
"Residue"

596
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,380
I don't want to be a fool

597
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,320
If I go down the wrong path

598
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,640
The moon will run away

599
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,540
Because now is not everything

600
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,940
Don't worry too much

601
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,840
Even if you lie and cheat a little

602
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,640
You are sometimes helping someone

603
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,460
Baby do you know me

604
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,400
I'm going to tomorrow

605
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,880
Nice breathing

606
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,480
Don't get sick

607
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,780
I'll do what I have to do

608
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,540
Cute breathing

609
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,940
It's hard to understand

610
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,420
I want to show you

611
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,700
It's better than looking down

612
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,140
Na na na na

613
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,100
Na na na na

614
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,000
Na na na na

615
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,600
Na na na na

616
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,580
Na na na na

617
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,940
Na na na na
