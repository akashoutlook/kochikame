00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,320
Important

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:01,420
Thing

3
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,480
To

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,500
"When

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:07,620
you

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,240
TV,

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,820
make

8
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,060
the room

9
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,780
bright and

10
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,180
look

11
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,140
away!"

12
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,380
Come

13
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,980
here

14
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,000
you

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,960
money!

16
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,460
I

17
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,040
don't

18
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,080
have

19
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,420
money

20
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:26,880
but

21
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,380
I'm

22
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,000
worried

23
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,740
about

24
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:28,820
you!

25
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,040
Look

26
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,660
at

27
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:30,860
the

28
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,560
blue

29
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,800
sky

30
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,160
and

31
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,420
the

32
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,000
white

33
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,920
clouds!

34
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,480
You

35
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,000
will

36
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,420
get

37
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,560
something

38
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,200
out

39
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,760
of

40
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:41,960
it!

41
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,720
I'm

42
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,840
yet

43
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,340
but

44
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,900
don't

45
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,860
worry

46
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,060
about

47
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,420
me!

48
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,540
Look

49
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:05,720
at

50
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,420
the

51
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
red

52
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,420
clouds

53
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:11,980
that

54
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,260
You

55
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:14,980
get

56
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,900
out

57
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,380
of

58
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:17,480
it!

59
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
I

60
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,240
know

61
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,340
you

62
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:21,580
can

63
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:21,620
do

64
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,300
I know, I know!

65
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,700
If you know, then be quiet and follow me!

66
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,280
The Legend of the Red-Headed Girl, Teacher Kankichi!

67
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,360
The Legend of the Red-Headed Girl, Teacher Kankichi!

68
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,440
What are you going to do with that doll?

69
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,800
Today we're going to have a class on traffic safety in elementary school, right?

70
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,380
We're going to have this doll play the role of the car's bump.

71
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,260
Even if it's a truck with a lot of bumps, you can't get hurt.

72
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,900
I see. All right, let me borrow it.

73
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,140
No, not yet! I haven't finished yet!

74
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,260
All right, all right.

75
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,740
Like this.

76
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,080
Just like that.

77
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,840
Like this, like that, like this!

78
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,100
Imagine what it would be like to be bumped into!

79
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,040
Give that back, Ryo!

80
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,440
I haven't finished yet!

81
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,960
All right, give it back!

82
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,640
Ah, the chief's head!

83
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,940
Chief!

84
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,340
Is something wrong with my head?

85
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,480
No, not really!

86
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,300
Idiot!

87
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,600
Ryo!

88
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,840
You're going to be the one to replace the broken doll!

89
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,740
I, I...

90
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,860
Listen, everyone!

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,440
Today, the principal of all elementary schools will also be here to see you.

92
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,800
I want you to be able to teach them something that will not be embarrassing.

93
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,160
Yes, sir!

94
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,600
Ah...

95
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,840
Ah...

96
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,300
Ah...

97
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,600
I see.

98
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,840
I see.

99
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,660
I see.

100
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,620
I see.

101
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,920
I see.

102
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,140
I see.

103
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,040
I see.

104
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,680
I see.

105
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:07,760
I see.

106
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,000
Wait, what?

107
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,720
I see!

108
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:18,940
I see.

109
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,880
Ah, my head.

110
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,240
Unfortunately, I can't get it to work.

111
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,620
I can't stop myself.

112
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:21,920
I can't stop myself.

113
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,540
Ah, I see.

114
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,280
I see, I see.

115
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,200
I see, I see.

116
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,800
Ah, are you nicely dressed, Mr. Temohikawa?

117
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,080
This is like...

118
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,880
I can only turn it into a sisters gown.

119
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,260
Oh?

120
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,660
Oh, a cute29th year is in progress.

121
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,660
Oh, no, it's a story from here.

122
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,280
Even if the traffic light turns blue on Odan Road,

123
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,880
look right and left carefully before crossing.

124
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,140
Yes, sir!

125
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,580
If you play on the road because there are not many cars passing by,

126
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,100
you may not be able to see the car coming from behind.

127
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,640
Be careful not to get hurt.

128
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,520
Yes, sir!

129
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,880
I can't believe you were blown off so many times.

130
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,600
Ouch!

131
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,640
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

132
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,480
My coffee can!

133
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,040
What? What happened?

134
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,680
It's a chimpanzee.

135
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,280
No, Mio!

136
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,880
I know!

137
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,100
Come on!

138
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,400
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

139
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,500
No, but it's really...

140
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:32,680
My handbag!

141
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
Hey, Mio!

142
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,620
Catch that chimpanzee!

143
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,300
Yes, sir!

144
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,880
Hey! Give me back that handbag!

145
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,280
You're such a fool!

146
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,180
Don't let it go, Mio!

147
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,660
Mio, hold on!

148
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,440
I can do it, Mio!

149
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,880
All right!

150
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,640
That's right!

151
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,420
I caught it!

152
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,560
Oh, it fell!

153
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,460
Ouch!

154
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,260
Let's go, chief!

155
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:03,820
All right!

156
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,400
If you give it back quietly, I'll exchange it for a banana!

157
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,220
That's right, you get it?

158
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,200
I see, I hope you get it.

159
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,400
I got my handbag back!

160
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,300
That's amazing!

161
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,860
You're persuading a chimpanzee!

162
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,460
It's Ryo-chan's specialty.

163
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,260
She's closer to a chimpanzee than a human.

164
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,520
Be careful!

165
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:30,680
Be careful!

166
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,400
I can't believe a chimpanzee that's being transported to a zoo is running away.

167
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,940
I don't know what's going on in the world.

168
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,040
That's great!

169
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,500
He's the one I've been looking for!

170
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,420
What?

171
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,100
You're asking me to be a teacher?

172
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes, I've already received the chief's approval.

173
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,560
Really?

174
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,300
No, seriously.

175
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,120
If you ask a man like this to be a teacher, the students will think you're stupid.

176
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,740
Chief, what are you talking about?

177
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,320
Ryo-chan, do you have a degree in teaching?

178
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,320
Of course not!

179
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,380
Even if you say you're a teacher, it doesn't mean you can teach.

180
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,340
You have the strength of a wild animal.

181
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,480
You can talk to chimps like you've been friends for a hundred years.

182
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,520
I want you to learn how to express yourself.

183
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,120
I don't mean to teach you.

184
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,840
I want you to show the students what you're made of.

185
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,100
But I'm not a teacher.

186
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,660
I'm not a teacher.

187
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,100
I need someone like you in my school.

188
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,640
But...

189
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,160
Of course, I'll thank you.

190
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,440
What?

191
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,100
Thank you?

192
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,000
You're too arrogant to say you're a teacher.

193
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,020
I'm born to be a person who leads people.

194
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,340
You're in a good mood.

195
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,000
This is what happens when money gets involved.

196
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,920
Let's accept it.

197
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,680
For the future of Japan.

198
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,140
So, where are we?

199
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,320
We're in Tokyo, but...

200
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,160
Here.

201
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,480
Shodoshima?

202
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,620
Yes.

203
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,160
That 24-year-old girl.

204
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,000
No, that's a different place.

205
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,840
Shodoshima is in the Seto Inland Sea.

206
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,660
Our island is called Azuki Island.

207
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,700
Azuki Island?

208
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,060
Yes.

209
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,520
A small island.

210
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:29,900
To Azuki Island.

211
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:29,920
That's Azuki Island.

212
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,220
Yeah, it's a little island, like a bean.

213
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,940
Yes.

214
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,820
But it's full of nature.

215
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,240
It's a very beautiful island.

216
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,900
The set is this way.

217
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,880
I see.

218
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,800
There is a dormitory to sleep in. Please use that.

219
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,840
Yeah.

220
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,360
This is the classroom of Ryōtsu-sensei.

221
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,640
There are two classes in three years.

222
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,020
There are many students for the small island.

223
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,560
No. There is only one class for one year to six years.

224
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,000
Huh? Then what is this?

225
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,840
I like it. Mr. Golden Hair.

226
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:13,980
What?

227
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,240
As a special teacher for one week from today,

228
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,120
Mr. Ryōtsu-sensei will take care of you.

229
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,440
Everyone, listen to what Mr. Ryōtsu-sensei says and study hard.

230
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,200
Hi, fu, mi, yo. All 12 people.

231
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,760
Mr. Ryōtsu-sensei.

232
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,040
Huh?

233
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,180
Then I'll leave it to you, Mr. Ryōtsu-sensei.

234
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,000
But it's late now. What should I do?

235
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
For the time being, please play with everyone.

236
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,780
Play?

237
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,540
Yeah.

238
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,940
I'm looking forward to it.

239
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,440
Why do I have to play with them?

240
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,200
But, well, I have to thank them.

241
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,260
Well, let me introduce myself first.

242
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,500
Sala, sala, sala.

243
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,760
Hi, everyone.

244
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,700
I'm Mr. Ryōtsu-Sensei Kankichi.

245
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,680
You can't be underestimated here.

246
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,020
Everything starts with the beginning.

247
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,960
I'm a student of the TV Academy.

248
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,040
So, when something like this happens,

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,860
Hmm...

250
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,520
Listen up.

251
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,900
The word "human" means to support each other...

252
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,100
Sensei.

253
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,620
Huh?

254
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,540
That's not human. It's "Hailu."

255
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,340
Huh?

256
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,800
No, I can't do it.

257
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,760
I don't care about it.

258
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,780
Hey, Koichi.

259
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,580
What are you doing now?

260
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,160
What are you talking about? I'm in class.

261
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,500
Hahaha.

262
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,580
Hahaha.

263
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,420
What's wrong with them?

264
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,540
They're talking on their phones in the same classroom.

265
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,340
So, once you install it,

266
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,160
download the version data from the site...

267
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,340
That face looks like a gorilla.

268
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,620
Look.

269
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,720
Hahahaha.

270
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,680
Hahaha.

271
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,120
It's an island full of nature,

272
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,540
so I thought it would be more like summer vegetables,

273
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
but it's a sunflower bean.

274
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,080
Hahaha.

275
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,400
Shut up, you idiot!

276
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,080
Stop talking on your phone!

277
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,740
I knew you needed 12 megabytes.

278
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,120
And?

279
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,420
Listen to what he's saying!

280
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,180
If the person next to you makes your phone ring,

281
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:27,900
be careful!

282
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,680
You'll get in the way of your studies!

283
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,120
What's with this gloomy atmosphere?

284
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,500
Unlike the old people,

285
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,540
we don't interfere with each other.

286
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,000
What?

287
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,660
That's why you should leave us alone.

288
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,220
If we're all the same,

289
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,360
there won't be any conflicts.

290
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,560
It's not cool to sweat and work so hard.

291
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,460
Yeah.

292
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,180
The times are different.

293
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,260
The times.

294
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,960
You're making a fool of yourself.

295
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,720
You're completely different from the TV school guys.

296
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,020
No, no.

297
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,120
You can't get angry here.

298
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,420
Oh, right.

299
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,700
This is the standard sports of the school guys.

300
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:07,980
Get on it!

301
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,240
Get on it!

302
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,040
All right!

303
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,840
Let's play soccer together!

304
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,880
I can't play soccer.

305
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,140
How dare you!

306
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,200
Let's go!

307
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,520
All right!

308
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:20,920
Let's go!

309
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,680
That's it!

310
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,560
No, no, no.

311
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,760
I kicked too hard.

312
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,040
I don't care.

313
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,380
If you don't hurry up,

314
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:29,700
you'll fall into the sea.

315
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,100
There are almost no flat places.

316
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,300
Because it's a small island.

317
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,200
What?

318
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,520
We were injured.

319
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,280
We have to go straight ahead.

320
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,860
I can't fall.

321
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,840
Okay, okay.

322
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,240
I'm going to complain to everyone

323
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,860
when they get here.

324
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,520
It's a little scary.

325
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,880
I am a bad guy,

326
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,760
but with my power,

327
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,920
I can set a good course.

328
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,280
Then,

329
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,460
let me show you

330
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:00,640
I'm ready.

331
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:00,980
You mean sharks?

332
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,400
Trouble for such a hot-blooded student.

333
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,700
Help me!

334
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,520
I respect your teacher a bit, you childish child.

335
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:30,900
Hmm...

336
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,020
Ah!

337
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, this is bad.

338
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,480
What's wrong? You were so quiet.

339
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,900
What's wrong?

340
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,940
Oh, no, I...

341
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,140
You're Ryou Tsukankichi, right?

342
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,020
I've heard from the principal.

343
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,420
He said that the old-fashioned kid leader has become an adult.

344
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,120
Oh, no.

345
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,920
Oh, I'm late.

346
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,580
I'm Hideko Takahishi. Nice to meet you.

347
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,260
Oh, no, nice to meet you, too.

348
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,080
Nice to meet you, too.

349
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,860
You must be tired of your first class.

350
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,300
Oh, no, I'm not.

351
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,640
The kids these days are not cute at all.

352
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,240
They're not bad kids.

353
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,460
There's nothing wrong with what the principal said.

354
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,560
But I believe in you, Ryou Tsukankichi.

355
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,460
Oh, I think Kan'kichi is better.

356
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,620
The principal will definitely lead the students of this school in the right direction.

357
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,340
I'm in the eyes of the principal.

358
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,840
I'm sure the principal will be in the right direction.

359
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,080
Takaishi-sensei.

360
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,940
Good luck, Kan'kichi-sensei.

361
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,960
Yes, yes.

362
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,200
Ryou Tsukankichi will accomplish his mission.

363
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,080
He's a naughty brat but he can't befriend me, can he?

364
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,180
Oh, I have a call.

365
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Yes, Ryou-tsu.

366
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,520
Oh, what is it? Nakagawa?

367
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,640
Reiko is here, too.

368
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,320
Shall I call her?

369
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,100
Yeah.

370
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,220
How are you, Ryou-chan?

371
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,740
Are you doing well?

372
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,420
Oh, I guess so.

373
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,580
The principal is very worried.

374
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,520
He says all the kids Ryou-chan has taught will become like Ryou-chan.

375
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,180
I thought I'd be like you.

376
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,180
What's wrong with being like me?

377
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,540
Don't hit me.

378
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,180
The chief said so.

379
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,620
When I was a child,

380
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,880
Wait.

381
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,340
I see.

382
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,220
Let's go with that hand.

383
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,220
Return to Nakagawa.

384
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,160
I have a favor to ask.

385
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,720
Nakagawa's guy.

386
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,260
Did you deliver it to me immediately?

387
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,380
Ta-da!

388
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,180
How is it?

389
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,960
The latest mobile phone store.

390
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,300
What's wrong?

391
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:02,920
What's wrong?

392
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,760
Do you want it?

393
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,280
I want it!

394
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:05,660
I want it!

395
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,640
But I won't do it.

396
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,780
I'll make this a tribute.

397
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,580
Tribute?

398
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,760
What do you mean?

399
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,880
I'm going to do a survival hide-and-seek with you.

400
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,040
You can hide anywhere on this island.

401
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,240
Of course,

402
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,260
you can contact me by phone.

403
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,120
When the sun sets and you can't find everyone,

404
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,040
I'll go back to Tokyo quietly.

405
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,500
If you can't find anyone,

406
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,580
I'll do this mobile phone.

407
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,660
How's that?

408
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,100
What if we lose?

409
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,720
No problem.

410
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,640
It's the same as before.

411
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,640
How is it?

412
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,860
It's not bad, right?

413
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,600
What?

414
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,180
It's easy.

415
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,420
All right.

416
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,620
Let's do it together.

417
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,260
Yeah!

418
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,540
It's the same as when I was a kid.

419
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,200
First, take it with you.

420
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,360
Great success!

421
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,600
All right.

422
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,620
After 10 minutes,

423
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,320
let's go find it.

424
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,220
There are more places to hide in the mountains.

425
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,840
Koichi is over there.

426
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,940
Norika is over there.

427
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,740
Yeah.

428
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,100
Ryouchi,

429
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,420
you're finally starting something.

430
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,080
Yeah.

431
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,960
All right,

432
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,160
10 minutes have passed.

433
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,360
First,

434
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,740
from the mountains.

435
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:16,960
Let's go.

436
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,340
Okay,

437
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,100
let the

438
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,220
This is Hiro.

439
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,080
Here is the file you found.

440
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,240
I'm Hiro làm

441
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,480
Hello.

442
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,920
I've found Hiro.

443
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,180
what are you two doing?

444
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,460
I found Hiro.

445
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,500
This is Hiro.

446
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,160
Let's party.

447
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,680
What?

448
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,700
I found it!

449
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,840
What is it?

450
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,620
Well, that's common sense.

451
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,940
Now, what's next?

452
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,720
If you're coming from the one on the hill, you can just run to the water tank.

453
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,460
Let's go!

454
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,120
Daisuke, Tomoko, Mikke!

455
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,740
Why are we here?

456
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,900
Life is all about not going to the manual on time!

457
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,580
Now, give me your phone.

458
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,160
It's no use hiding in the water tank.

459
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,200
We're going to see through everything!

460
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,380
Oh, no!

461
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,700
Norika, Mikke!

462
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,900
Masahiko, Toshio, Mikke!

463
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,660
Yayoi, Mikke!

464
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,320
Suri!

465
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,480
Yoshiko, Naomi, Mikke!

466
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,260
Koichi, Mikke!

467
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,520
Shigichiro, Mikke!

468
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:08,420
Oh, no. Koichi's been caught, too.

469
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,960
I wonder if this is a matter of time.

470
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,380
Oh, no.

471
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,220
Ah!

472
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,280
S-S-S-S-S-Ss-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-s-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-

473
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:30,580
Hirooni, Daisuke, Tomoko, Norika, Yoshiko, Naomi, Koichi, Yayoi, Masahiko, Shinichiro, Toshio.

474
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,500
First of all, is Kenta still missing?

475
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,400
I don't think Kenta can be found.

476
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,580
He's a smart guy.

477
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,240
He's hiding in the sea while cutting off the mountains.

478
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,300
Yeah.

479
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,660
Shio can't leave or leave any message or contact, so he's Strange

480
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,960
Shio is getting crowded – what should I do??

481
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,680
I dropped my cell phone so I can't get in touch with anyone and I can't go outside!

482
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,140
If Shio comes up to the ceiling as it is…

483
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,720
Please, someone please help me!

484
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,300
Somebody! SOMEone!

485
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,540
I can't hear anyone screaming in a place like this.

486
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,840
That's strange. You can't find anyone looking for you.

487
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,060
Is there anyone who got a call from Kenta?

488
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,660
What happened?

489
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,640
Help! Someone!

490
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,820
Did you hear something?

491
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,760
No, nothing.

492
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:42,860
Nothing?

493
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,880
Listen closely.

494
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,440
I can only hear waves.

495
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,660
Yes, I heard it. It's from below here.

496
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,720
There's no place to hide.

497
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,400
It's dangerous. If you fall, you'll get a lot of sharks.

498
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,100
Be quiet.

499
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,440
It's from below here.

500
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,620
I found it. It's that cave.

501
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,800
I can't get out of here because it's a dead end.

502
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,120
But how can we help?

503
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,640
That's right. The entrance is already in the sea.

504
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,980
Bring the rope.

505
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,720
I can't get out of here.

506
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,120
You can't help if you don't get out of here.

507
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,960
Move your body more than you think.

508
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,040
Kenta, I'll help you now.

509
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,860
Someone, help me.

510
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,060
Listen, this rope is a life rope.

511
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,560
Hold on tight and let go.

512
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,840
Kankichi, be careful.

513
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:45,960
Yes.

514
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,540
Everyone, hold on tight.

515
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,480
Kankichi, do your best.

516
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,600
I'll save Kenta.

517
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,100
Everyone, do your best.

518
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,700
I was saved.

519
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,660
Okay. Stretch the rope.

520
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,500
Kenta, let's go now.

521
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,720
Teacher.

522
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,220
Kenta, look.

523
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,280
Now we've found everyone.

524
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,340
Okay.

525
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,260
Your legs are fine now.

526
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,540
Listen.

527
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,440
Don't be afraid.

528
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,940
Be brave.

529
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,100
You can do it.

530
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:39,840
Okay?

531
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,900
Okay.

532
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,840
Be brave.

533
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,360
Let's go.

534
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,900
Okay. Pull me up.

535
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,020
Kankichi.

536
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,840
I dropped my phone.

537
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,920
I thought no one would hear me anymore.

538
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,640
I thought no one would come to help me.

539
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,600
I thought no one would come to help me.

540
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,540
I thought no one would come to help me.

541
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,080
Teacher Kankichi.

542
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,420
Teacher Kankichi.

543
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,580
Teacher Kankichi.

544
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,140
Teacher Kankichi.

545
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,320
Look.

546
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:17,980
Look.

547
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,260
There's such a big nature.

548
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,320
You have to make friends with nature

549
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,140
not just with your cell phones and computers.

550
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,320
If you don't acquire the strength of the wild,

551
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,300
you won't survive in the future.

552
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,680
Got it?

553
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,360
Yeah.

554
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,960
Yes.

555
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,000
Shizugawa and esto democracy become the Origenri Senator.

556
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,780
Shizugawa andisto democracy become the Origenri Senator.

557
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,300
Shizugawa andisto democracy become the Origenri Senator.

558
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,820
Shizugawa andisto democracy become the Origenri Senator.

Shizugawa andisto democracy become the Origenri Senator.

560
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,080
Shizugawa andisto democracy become the Origenri Senator.

Shizugawa andisto democracy become the Origenri Senator.

Shizugawa andisto democracy become the Origenri Senator.

563

Shizugawa andisto democracy become the Origenri Senator.

564
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,000
Shiita Kankichi becomes the Origenri Senator.

565
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,200
This place was not a place to ignore or take a mosquito class.

566
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,240
Every teacher at school used to go to a school with many kids.

567
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,980
The reason for this is the fighting of kids like me.

568
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,820
Everyone seems to be fine.

569
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,200
I'm not stupid! I'm not going to waste my time again!

570
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,220
Ah, Chief!

571
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,580
This is the information society...

572
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,800
Hey, you!

573
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,320
Ah, teacher Kankichi is angry!

574
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,260
Hello, we came to see if you were doing well.

575
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:21,840
Hello!

576
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,260
Everyone!

577
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,440
Ah, teacher Kankichi's cell phone!

578
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,980
And it's the latest model!

579
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,020
Huh?

580
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,320
No, you can use the adult one.

581
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,260
We have the same one, too.

582
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,820
What?

583
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,300
I bought the computer in Akihabara.

584
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,580
I can't be late in the era.

585
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,260
Eh?

586
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,860
Senior...

587
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,800
You are talking about something different.

588
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,400
Well, even if the nature is full, the children now are different from when I was a child.

589
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,940
I knew it!

590
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,880
Alright!

591
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,940
Teacher Kankichi will make a lot of holes in the hole place of Tokyo!

592
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:57,940
Yay!

593
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,360
Let's go!

594
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,660
Yay!

595
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,580
Dad!

596
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,780
Dad!

597
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,020
Dad!

598
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,140
Dad!

599
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,860
Dad!

600
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,240
Dad!

601
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,600
Dad!

602
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:10,980
Dad!

603
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,000
Dad!

604
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,160
Dad!

605
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:21,740
Nemon-chan is a kindergarten child, but he likes historical dramas. Why?

606
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,080
The little beard of the mayor is slightly small. Why?

607
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,940
When he rides a Honda-san bike, his personality changes. Why?

608
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:42,780
The four years of his life are only once in a year. Why?

609
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:57,900
He doesn't lend money to the mass production company, but he can easily lend money to the tankers and fighter jets. Why?

610
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,240
Reiko-san is amazing.

611
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,920
He doesn't lend money to the mass production company, but he can easily lend money to the tankers and fighter jets. Why?

612
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,120
He doesn't lend money to the mass production company, but he can easily lend money to the tankers and fighter jets. Why?

613
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,400
Why?

614
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:31,520
What? I'm the head of the transportation department?

615
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,200
I'm the head of the transportation department?

616
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,360
The police is finally evaluated.

617
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,160
Zupan етрiferu

618
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,400
