There's four cars.

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,400
I've driven them all.

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,420
The police are worth the work.

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm literally not.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,620
I've got a job for a few days.

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,460
I got a job forWatchdog.

37
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,980
That's because we came to the edge of the district.

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,200
You're going to Honda's castle, right?

39
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,160
You should be able to come back soon.

40
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,520
That Honda's motorcycle broke down.

41
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,940
I'll be back as soon as the repairs are finished.

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,320
I see.

43
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,280
That's right.

44
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,280
Come back right now!

45
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,460
Those two are going out together.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,660
I don't think they're patrolling properly.

47
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:53,900
What?

48
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,800
What's wrong, senpai?

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,360
The chief found out.

50
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,600
I'll be back in Tokyo soon.

51
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,140
Hurry up!

52
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,860
Hey, hey, hey, senpai!

53
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,600
If you don't hurry up, I'll leave you.

54
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,600
The boss of the company.

55
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,440
All right, go, Honda.

56
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,580
But you have to wear your clothes first.

57
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,600
I'll go first.

58
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,700
You will stop at the right.

59
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:28,860
Yes, sir.

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,000
Hey, don't jump out of the car so suddenly!

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,640
Mr. Omawari.

62
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,660
Something terrible has happened.

63
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,760
Come with me.

64
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,760
We're in a hurry.

65
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,140
You're going to meet someone else.

66
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,820
I was in the field, and there was something terrible.

67
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,960
Tomorrow's newspaper is definitely not the same.

68
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,740
You're right about the newspaper.

69
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:50,980
There's no mistake in the newspaper?

70
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,020
Wait a minute.

71
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,500
Mr. Ryotsu, I heard that there's a rumor about Tokugawa's "Maizou-kin" around here.

72
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,940
What? Maizou-kin?

73
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,660
If you do it right, you might get a few hundred percent.

74
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,040
Hey, give me a quick tour!

75
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,400
Over there?

76
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,120
Move, move, move!

77
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,280
It's the police!

78
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,460
Nobody move!

79
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,140
Hey, move over there!

80
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,040
So, what about the "Maizou-kin"?

81
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,600
What do you think, Senpai?

82
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,660
No!

83
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,920
Th-th-that's...

84
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,280
It's a pretty strange box.

85
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,700
Is there a small chest in here?

86
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,720
What? What's wrong with you guys?

87
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,680
But, Senpai...

88
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,480
It looks like a bomb.

89
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:54,880
What?

90
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,060
Huh?

91
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:58,820
Huh?

92
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Hm...

93
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
A b-b-b-bomb!

94
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,760
That's Tokugawa's "Mai-zou-kin"!

95
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,500
Nobody said it was a "Mai-zou-kin"!

96
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,940
That's a bomb from the war, isn't it?

97
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,700
Yeah, you're right.

98
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,580
Let's go!

99
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,960
I thought you were going over there?

100
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,120
What did you just say?

101
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,420
You came all the way over here and you're still not moving...?

102
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,440
I'll take this!

103
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,460
And you!

104
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:30,500
And you!

105
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,720
We won't let you get away with this.

106
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,840
No!

107
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,540
Don't tell me you're not going to do anything?

108
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,260
I know, I know. I'll do something about it.

109
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,740
Yes, this is the station.

110
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,340
You want me to do it?

111
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,500
That voice is...

112
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,220
Shut up! Don't make a loud voice.

113
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,140
The chief is still here, right?

114
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,640
I'm so tired.

115
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,020
I should come back soon.

116
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,600
I'm in trouble.

117
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,020
I found a bomb.

118
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,020
Wow, it's a bomb!

119
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,040
Wow? A bomb?

120
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,840
Why are you so excited, old man?

121
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,080
Yes, it's a bomb!

122
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,540
I'm in trouble.

123
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,260
I stole a single one that I bought for 500,000 yen.

124
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,940
Old man, I need a note.

125
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,280
Yes, sir.

126
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,760
Um...

127
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes, sir.

128
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,700
I bought one for 500,000 yen.

129
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,440
You bought one for 500,000 yen?

130
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,160
What do you mean?

131
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,640
Are you saying you're going to buy a bomb for 500,000 yen?

132
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,700
I'm drinking soda at the cafe.

133
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,100
Soda.

134
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,560
Soda? Hey!

135
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,400
What's wrong, old man?

136
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,780
The priest said he'd buy a bomb for 500,000 yen.

137
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,260
What? No way!

138
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,080
He really said that.

139
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,520
Ask him yourself.

140
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,640
Hello, priest?

141
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:01,700
Priest?

142
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,540
Do you really buy bombs?

143
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,980
I'm an amateur.

144
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,680
I especially love cakes.

145
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,760
You love cakes.

146
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,220
He says he loves weapons.

147
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,200
There's no doubt about that.

148
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,080
But I didn't see a man interested in that.

149
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,720
Wait a minute.

150
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,860
His appearance, shape, glasses and weight.

151
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,640
He's not clear about his personality.

152
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,960
He's a real maniac.

153
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,680
He's a real maniac.

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,220
Besides, it's suspicious that he bought a house away from others.

155
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,060
Is he hiding his dangerous hobby from the world?

156
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,340
Hehehe.

157
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,460
I like bombs.

158
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,520
I know what he's up to.

159
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,300
He's a military man with a lot of money.

160
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,120
Catch him!

161
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,760
He's a bomb maniac!

162
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,000
All right, I sold it.

163
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,640
Get the cash and wait.

164
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,760
No way.

165
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,420
No way.

166
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:01,940
Hello, Ryo?

167
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,660
He's gone.

168
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,980
What on earth happened?

169
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,100
Well, when I contacted the headquarters,

170
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,160
I learned that a bomb was still buried in this area.

171
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,080
So I want you all to cooperate with that investigation.

172
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,900
So you're going to do that with the police, aren't you?

173
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,020
It's your place here.

174
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,740
It's dangerous for me to take it out myself.

175
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,620
It's only natural for humans to be able to see it.

176
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,860
But...

177
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,640
It's dangerous, isn't it?

178
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,060
It's dangerous, it's dangerous.

179
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,460
Budoki-san, stop it!

180
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,880
He's a better person than Fuhatsu-dan.

181
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,460
How's that? Did you find it?

182
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:48,940
No.

183
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,160
I don't have it.

184
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,620
I've searched for it so far, and only found two.

185
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:54,700
Two.

186
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,480
Two for a million yen.

187
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,060
That's good.

188
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,160
Alright, Honda! Carry this!

189
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,340
What? Us?

190
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,540
Of course!

191
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,280
As a police officer, it's a natural duty.

192
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,260
Did you forget?

193
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,200
This guy can buy a whole 500,000 yen.

194
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,860
But...

195
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,500
But...

196
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:14,900
Mr. Omawari!

197
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Are you sure you want this?

198
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,560
It's a good idea!

199
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,540
Put it on the whiteboard!

200
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,500
Pack it up.

201
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:24,680
It's done!

202
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,660
Let's go!

203
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,520
Let's stop it. It's dangerous.

204
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,020
Put it on the whiteboard!

205
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,760
If you hold the handle, the weak bugs will fly away.

206
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,380
What's wrong?

207
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,180
I'm too anxious, I can't be very strong.

208
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,020
Don't worry.

209
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,380
It hasn't exploded in over 50 years.

210
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,880
It's not like it's going to explode now.

211
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,260
Besides, I'll be with you when I die.

212
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,380
Sen... Senpai...

213
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,500
It seems to be okay.

214
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,980
Senpai, I told you we'd be together when we die!

215
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,160
Sorry, sorry.

216
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,380
My body moved as a result of the reflection.

217
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,820
STAY ALIVE

218
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,900
Now I understand.

219
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,260
Then everything will be OK.

220
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,780
All I have to do is drive carefully so your body won't get stimulated.

221
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,440
You love me, right?

222
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,020
Uogawa!

223
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,300
You and I were destined to be together in hell.

224
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,500
You know about that, right?

225
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,920
I do understand.

226
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,760
I guess you're a little identified.

227
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,220
No way...

228
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,360
You're not?

229
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,640
I was driving as instructed.

230
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,080
Shut up!

231
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,320
I was looking for a way back because you don't like to drive at high speeds.

232
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,500
But I can't pull a rear car with two people and load a bomb, so I can't go to high speed.

233
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,580
I'll be stopped at the toll station.

234
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,540
You can ring the siren and get through without telling me.

235
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,580
It's what you always do.

236
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,180
That's ridiculous.

237
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,380
The handlebar suddenly got lighter.

238
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,780
Is the road surface better?

239
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,720
I don't think so.

240
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,340
It's not like that.

241
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,640
The rear car is off!

242
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,360
What?

243
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,340
You want to get away?

244
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,860
Two people and a million yen!

245
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,240
I did it! I caught up!

246
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,600
Damn it! If you hit me, it's over!

247
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,440
Senpai, are you okay?

248
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:48,940
Are you okay?

249
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,440
Yeah.

250
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm okay.

251
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,740
Senpai, you're really going to carry it like this?

252
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,720
The rear car is gone. I can't do anything about it.

253
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,760
But I'm going to explode if I fall down.

254
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,680
You have to fall down.

255
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,420
Whoa!

256
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,480
What? Honda? Where are you?

257
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,620
Senpai!

258
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,000
Senpai! Help me!

259
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,360
What's that bird doing here?

260
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,580
Help me, please!

261
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,920
Is this really Japan?

262
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,560
Stop it! You're going to blow up!

263
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,820
I see...

264
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,860
Senpai!

265
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,540
Honda!

266
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,380
Wait for me!

267
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,860
I have to run away!

268
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,900
If I'm dropped like this, I'll be in trouble!

269
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,580
Honda! Don't let the bomb go!

270
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,760
It's 500,000 yen each!

271
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,660
I'm not kidding! Life is more important!

272
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,100
If I get paid, I'll give you 50%!

273
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,180
No, 50%!

274
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,420
Why is it tied so tightly?

275
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:07,900
No!

276
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,420
It's out again!

277
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,800
Stop it!

278
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,040
It's a movie!

279
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,720
500,000 yen!

280
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,760
Dad, Mom, Grandpa, Grandma, I'm sorry!

281
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,440
And my daughter, Nana!

282
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,280
Please forgive me!

283
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,540
500,000 yen!

284
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,380
I can't help you!

285
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,480
Stop!

286
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,640
Stop!

287
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,500
This isn't good!

288
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,580
I made it!

289
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,400
Don't run away!

290
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,580
Please do something, Senpai!

291
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,660
I'm telling you now!

292
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,900
Gas cut...

293
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:08,820
What?

294
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,100
A tunnel!

295
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,300
Oh, no!

296
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,580
I'm almost at my limit!

297
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,700
I was saved by a horrible truck...

298
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,980
Wow...

299
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,500
Your life has shortened by 100 years...

300
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,180
It's not that bad!

301
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,220
Let's get everyone to the city!

302
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,440
But if you carry this around the place...

303
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,120
It's gonna be a big mess!

304
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,280
You can't work that well, too!

305
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,080
What's he going to do, anyway?

306
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,380
I need to find something...

307
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,680
Oh!

308
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,040
This is it!

309
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,900
How's that? It's a giant Kokeshi!

310
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,880
It's not going to be suspicious, right?

311
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,140
I-Is that so...

312
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,340
What the heck.

313
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,460
I have to wait for more than an hour until the next train arrives...

314
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,800
I'm just a local line thief!

315
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,920
Let's take a break somewhere.

316
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,300
That's right.

317
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,680
I thought there was no coffee shop in front of the station...

318
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,280
Well, it can't be helped.

319
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:29,500
It can't be helped.

320
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,980
Hey, isn't this one too?

321
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,680
What? What?

322
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,540
Let's take it with us, Peccha.

323
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,280
What? It's pretty heavy, isn't it?

324
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,600
It's because there's so much stuff in it, Peccha.

325
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,220
Ugh, I can't. I've finally fallen asleep.

326
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,540
Ah! It's gone!

327
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,080
What's wrong, senpai?

328
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,360
It's gone! Gone! Gone! Gone!

329
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,400
What's gone, senpai?

330
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,440
The instant bullet has disappeared!

331
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,780
Damn it! Where is it?

332
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,000
Two bullets and a million yen!

333
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,280
You!

334
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,300
Don't you know the instant bullet over there?

335
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,640
Instant bullet, Peccha?

336
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,700
Senpai, it looks like a Kokeshi now.

337
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,460
Oh, I see.

338
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,420
Hey, don't you know the Kokeshi over there?

339
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,880
If you hide it, it won't be useful!

340
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,140
If it's Kokeshi, it's over there in the Kokeshi Temple, Peccha.

341
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,160
It's the Kokeshi Temple.

342
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,860
Today is the day of Kokeshi Kuyo, so there should be a lot of them, Peccha.

343
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,560
Huh?

344
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,200
Huh?

345
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,560
Senpai, wait for me!

346
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,300
Go! Go! Go!

347
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,120
Hahahaha!

348
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,400
Wait, where are you going?

349
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,000
You, heddle!

350
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,180
Where's this thing?

351
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,420
Kokeshi Kuyo...

352
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,120
What is this?

353
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,920
It's already burned.

354
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,620
If it's burned, there's no way to live.

355
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,000
Find it. It should be somewhere.

356
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,200
Even if you say so...

357
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,480
Ah!

358
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,100
It's there! Stop!

359
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,200
One million yen!

360
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,660
It's gone!

361
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,980
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

362
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,560
Ah, ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

363
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,280
Water, water!

364
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:34,580
Water!

365
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,140
Senpai, are you okay?

366
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,100
A- apparently.

367
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,420
Hope you're safe now.

368
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,220
Now you just have to get on the train.

369
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,400
But I'm embarrassed in this dress.

370
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,580
Hang on.

371
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,340
This is the best way to protect your self from suspicion.

372
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,520
I feel sorry for you.

373
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,880
A poison of the forest.

374
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,780
I guess the bride ran away.

375
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,580
What a face.

376
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,020
He's not going to get rid of it.

377
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,240
How many do we have?

378
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,460
Stop it! I'm still single!

379
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,160
Oh, he's Miko's father.

380
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,760
That's strange.

381
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,160
I heard that's how it is in the city.

382
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,720
Dori, what does the baby look like?

383
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,600
Don't look at me!

384
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,340
It's not bad.

385
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,000
Don't touch me!

386
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,600
Ouch!

387
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,900
Please forgive me!

388
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,940
I don't mind hearing the small wishes of an old man with short legs.

389
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,180
Is it okay if his short legs get even shorter?

390
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,500
Next is Ottai Daimae.

391
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,320
What's going on?

392
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,420
I don't know.

393
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,760
Don't push!

394
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,340
Don't push!

395
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:00,720
No!

396
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,980
Are you okay, Honda?

397
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,220
I'm not okay at all!

398
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,840
Senpai!

399
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,820
Help me!

400
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,900
What's wrong, Honda?

401
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,260
The bomb's gone!

402
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,520
What?!

403
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,160
It's a bomb!

404
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,660
No way!

405
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,300
It's a joke!

406
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,660
This is...

407
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,520
Move, move, you stupid!

408
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,720
Alright, alright, just like that, over here!

409
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,520
Move, you! You're all moving!

410
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,640
I told you to move!

411
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,440
Don't get in the way!

412
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,620
He's crashing!

413
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,100
It's an idea!

414
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,000
Was that real?

415
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,480
Go!

416
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,600
My balloon!

417
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,500
Sorry, kid. I was surprised.

418
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,660
It's dangerous to be in a place like this.

419
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,180
I'm sorry.

420
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,180
That guy was a good help.

421
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,640
Kamehameha! Kamehameha!

422
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,120
I'm finally here.

423
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,300
Get it right, Honda.

424
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,300
You're one step away from the goal.

425
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,000
What do you mean, one step away?

426
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,460
Captain!

427
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,500
Captain!

428
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,840
I heard that you two were in police uniform in the train,

429
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,460
and you caused a bomb.

430
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,520
I knew it.

431
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:01,900
You two.

432
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,300
Please calm down, Captain.

433
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,640
It's not my fault.

434
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,400
Don't worry.

435
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,620
I'll beat you up from the very start.

436
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,400
It's dangerous, isn't it?

437
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,460
You know my skills.

438
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,460
I won't bother the citizens.

439
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,240
But it's dangerous.

440
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,020
It's all messed up.

441
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:23,700
Don't let me down.

442
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,400
Get off me!

443
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,040
Don't wait!

444
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,240
Where's the entry ticket?

445
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,020
Where's the entry ticket?

446
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,100
If you do this,

447
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,400
I'll have to hand this to the priest

448
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,460
and take the one million yen.

449
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,680
Yes, sir!

450
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,340
I'm home now.

451
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,940
Ryo!

452
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,000
I brought it.

453
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,180
I'll give you one million yen.

454
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,760
What's that, Ryo?

455
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,440
It's a coup.

456
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,800
I told you I'd buy one for 500,000 yen.

457
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,040
That's why I brought it here.

458
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,380
Is that real?

459
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,740
Of course it is.

460
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,080
Give me the money.

461
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,220
I didn't say that.

462
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,600
Don't lie!

463
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,820
I told you I bought it for 500,000 yen.

464
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,640
When Ryo called me?

465
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,120
It was windy then.

466
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,200
It's so thick!

467
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,140
It's so thick?

468
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,020
When the old man stole the pot.

469
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,460
The culprit was found soon after.

470
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,940
Yes, yes.

471
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,300
I took a note of the old man's story

472
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,600
and bought it for 500,000 yen.

473
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,820
It's so thick!

474
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,640
I bought it for 500,000 yen?

475
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,380
I bought it for 500,000 yen?

476
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,800
I bought it for 500,000 yen?

477
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,160
You must have heard it wrong.

478
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,940
You must have heard it wrong.

479
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,620
What's going on?

480
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,160
What's going on?

481
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,560
I'm glad you're waiting at the exit.

482
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,560
I'm glad you're waiting at the exit.

483
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,260
Chief! This is...

484
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,460
Are you ready?

485
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,200
Are you ready?

486
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,700
Are you ready?

487
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,020
Please stop!

488
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,020
What if I hit your back?

489
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,920
What if I hit your back?

490
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,880
I don't think you can say that.

491
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,740
I don't think you can say that.

492
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,320
The sword!

493
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,160
The sword!

494
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,760
The sword!

495
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,180
The sword!

496
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,520
The double-edged sword!

497
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,960
The double-edged sword!

498
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,040
The double-edged sword!

499
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,140
The double-edged sword!

500
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,520
The double-edged sword!

501
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,600
Why didn't you say it was real?

502
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,620
I did.

503
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,360
The Chief didn't believe me.

504
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,180
It's because of your behavior.

505
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,380
He doesn't trust me, so he got this.

506
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,920
It's because of your behavior.

507
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,900
I can't believe it!

508
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,680
I don't want to go play with you anymore!

509
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,540
Hey!

510
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,240
Even if the police is going to arrest you,

511
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,680
if I die, this show is over!

512
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,140
Do you understand?

513
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,120
Hey, you responsible person! Come out!

514
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,520
Next time, "Ryotsu shitsu"!

515
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,040
What?

516
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,400
I won't forgive you!

517
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,320
Waf!

518
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,520
ununifukuchun

519
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:51,900
Tepe-tepe

520
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,720
To making up

521
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,520
Pyaa!

522
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,120
and stun

523
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,860
Sugoity

524
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,340
Power

525
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,440
without any doubt

526
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,680
Let's work on it!

527
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,640
With energy like in a dream

528
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,120
If you come with me

529
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,960
I'll capture tomorrow

530
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,260
and Jyuko

531
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,780
I'll draw up space

532
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,280
The turtle's star drew a circle

533
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,840
Isn't this good?

534
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,740
There's no reason to say it's good!
