6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,880
I kicked a love stone and it flew to my shoes

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:42,100
I wonder if I'm going to go to the gym that I've been saving up for

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,420
I laughed at myself saying that I was crying

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,600
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can't help but cry

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,000
I can't change even one of my hiccups

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,280
The cityscape is strangely gentle

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:13,340
From the waterfront of Tongari-boshi to Kaishakuten

13
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,280
The sun sets

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,840
Tomorrow will end like this

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,580
The sun sets

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,200
The sun sets

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,920
But I'm happy again

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,220
I noticed I lost my happiness

19
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,660
Because I'm a fool

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,400
Alright! It's done!

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,660
It's not a kotatsu

22
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,880
It's not just any kotatsu

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,240
It's not a Hori-Gotatsu.

24
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,320
Go inside without asking anything.

25
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,720
There must be some kind of strange trick.

26
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,500
I can get my feet down.

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,380
There's a hole in the floor.

28
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,460
How about this?

29
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,600
This is a Hori-Gotatsu.

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,020
I bought it at a sale at the electric shop.

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,020
But I can't open the hole on the second floor of the dorm.

32
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,900
Is this a Hori-Gotatsu?

33
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,920
I'm glad my feet are comfortable.

34
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:17,880
Really.

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,900
I used to hide a lot when I was a hidden child.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,600
If you're a child, you can get in.

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,980
However,

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,460
In the past, Hori-Gotatsu was not electricity.

39
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,660
They used to use beans and lotus.

40
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,960
Because it burns charcoal.

41
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,480
The inside of the kotatsu is sealed.

42
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,020
If you keep it in there for a long time, it will become a carbon monoxide poisoning.

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,280
There was a time when everyone who was hiding turned their eyes and it was a big mess.

44
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,500
I thought I was going to die at that time.

45
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,820
Oh my god.

46
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,920
That's dangerous.

47
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,640
I'm not worried about that after I become an electric heater like now.

48
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,740
Well, I'm going to patrol.

49
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,720
I'm going to the library.

50
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,400
Ryo, please take care of the room.

51
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,720
Yeah.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,180
No, no, no.

53
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,440
It's warm and I'm sleepy.

54
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm sleepy.

55
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:18,880
Hmm?

56
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,260
I can't go.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,880
I forgot to screw it.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,700
It's dangerous to move.

59
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,280
I'll screw it firmly.

60
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,720
Thank you very much.

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,660
Please put it on.

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,580
No, it's a passing road anyway.

63
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,760
That's right.

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,500
Why don't you go a little closer?

65
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,140
Ryo made Hori-Gotatsu.

66
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,580
It's warm.

67
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,780
Oh, really?

68
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,160
I'm a Hori-Gotatsu.

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,420
I'm a Hori-Gotatsu.

70
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,700
I'm a Hori-Gotatsu.

71
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:49,720
I'm a Hori-Gotatsu.

72
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,320
The country house is still a Hori-Gotatsu.

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,360
How about this guy?

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,020
He's a good and serious man working at a yakuba.

75
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,760
No, mom.

76
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,800
I don't want to marry in the long run.

77
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,340
You're really in trouble.

78
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
You're the only daughter who hasn't gone to marry in the village.

79
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,020
No, no, no.

80
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,600
The image of a clean city girl is broken.

81
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,660
What happened?

82
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,280
What's wrong, Komachi?

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,020
Oh, nothing. I've never done a Horigotatsu before.

84
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm so excited!

85
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,740
This is good.

86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,680
Really?

87
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,420
This is Horigotatsu!

88
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,480
Come on in. It's warm.

89
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,380
It's warm!

90
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,640
You don't need to be cold.

91
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,240
Really.

92
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,320
Oh, no. I can't go out.

93
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,880
I can't go out.

94
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,820
I can't help it.

95
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,980
I'll stay here until Reiko and the others go.

96
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,620
What? There's something like a tarp in the kotatsu.

97
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:52,940
What?

98
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,520
A tarp?

99
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,460
Oh, no.

100
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,320
Where?

101
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,520
Around here.

102
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,760
Oh, really?

103
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,320
But it's warm.

104
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,160
Then is it a cat like a tarp?

105
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,400
That's weird.

106
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,880
No way!

107
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,920
Stop it!

108
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,820
Ryo, Kanchi!

109
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,180
You were hiding in the slum, weren't you?

110
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:12,740
No!

111
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,780
If I were to screw you, you would be in trouble!

112
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,100
No need to be so rude!

113
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,340
You're a woman's enemy!

114
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:18,920
You're a pervert!

115
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,120
You're a pervert!

116
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,620
You're a pervert!

117
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,100
You're a pervert!

118
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,320
You're a pervert!

119
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,980
What's wrong with you, you little...

120
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,100
Komachi, have you been too indifferent to Ryo lately?

121
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,780
I can't keep up with him.

122
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,580
I wish this perverted gorilla would disappear.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,180
Damn you, Komachi!

124
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,800
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

125
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,080
I found it!

126
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,960
Yes!

127
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,260
Oh, Mom!

128
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,720
How are you?

129
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,560
I was wondering how you were doing with Ryochi.

130
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,040
I'm not joking!

131
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,420
I'm not going to be with that perverted gorilla!

132
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,760
You don't have to be so embarrassed.

133
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,380
When I took you to my house the other day,

134
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,480
you seemed to be doing pretty well.

135
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,840
Yeah, I told you I was wrong!

136
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,440
I told you so many times!

137
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,780
I was talking to dad just now,

138
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,640
but he said he'd be good at living in the countryside,

139
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,460
so he'd better go back to your place and have a first-aid kit.

140
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:16,820
What?

141
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,340
I'm not talking to you!

142
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,380
I'm going to kill you!

143
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Geez, you're completely misunderstanding me.

144
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,280
I'm really getting mad at Ryochi.

145
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,820
When he's embarrassed,

146
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,360
I wonder if he thought you were a pervert.

147
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,760
I'm sure Komachi likes Ryochi.

148
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,980
The problem is what Ryochi thinks.

149
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,880
I'm going to go to Tokyo and ask him how he feels.

150
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,440
That's a good idea.

151
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,740
If he comes to my place,

152
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,180
I won't have anything to say to him.

153
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,760
Leave it to me.

154
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll go to Tokyo.

155
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,440
I'll go to Ryochi.

156
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,180
I'll go to my place.

157
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,400
I'll go to my place.

158
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,740
I'll go to my place.

159
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,060
I'll go to my place.

160
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,820
I'll go to my place.

161
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,900
I'll go to bride Komachi's.

162
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,500
This is K Francisco!

163
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,580
This is K Francisco!

164
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,620
This is K Francisco!

165
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:21,920
This is princess Komachi!

166
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,740
This is princess Komachi!

167
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,420
you're here to save us.

168
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,280
Come in my arms.

169
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,740
Yes, prince.

170
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,060
Prince!

171
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,200
Princess!

172
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,180
Sister!

173
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,580
It's so severe.

174
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,800
That was so scary.

175
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,940
What kind of dream is that? There's a limit to nightmares.

176
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,980
Ryo's dream of Kankichi being the prince is the worst in the world!

177
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,920
If this is the case, Ryo won't notice.

178
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,200
Well then, let's start investigating.

179
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,160
What? Ryo-san?

180
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,040
That person is healthy.

181
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,420
Even if he falls off an airplane or hits a bullet train, he's always in a good mood.

182
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:06,500
He's happy.

183
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,160
I see. He's healthy and doesn't worry about getting sick.

184
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,060
I guess he's a person who stays in the wild.

185
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,320
He's perfect for living in the countryside.

186
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,700
He's the type that won't stop when he's bored.

187
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,880
He doesn't sleep at night and makes plums.

188
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,540
He's a hardworking researcher.

189
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,880
He's perfect for getting married.

190
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,340
I had a weird dream, so I was in a bad mood today.

191
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,520
I had a bad dream.

192
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,940
Hey, I have a fortune-telling that works.

193
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,120
If you check it out, you'll find a future partner.

194
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,500
I guess so.

195
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,240
I can see it. You're wearing a wedding dress.

196
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,260
Really?

197
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,820
The person next to you is...

198
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,560
What kind of person?

199
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,280
He's tall, handsome, rich, and has a Ferrari.

200
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,540
That's Nakagawa-san.

201
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,380
Shut up.

202
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,200
What kind of person is it?

203
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,380
He has really thin eyebrows.

204
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,460
And his bangs are short.

205
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,020
He has a thick jaw that can laughed all kinds of questions

206
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,220
and oily hair...

207
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,840
There's no way that's true.

208
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,380
That's Ryo Tsukangichi.

209
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:32,120
That's Ryo Tsukangichi.

210
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,620
That's the real thing.

211
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,360
That's the real thing.

212
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,180
N-No way!

213
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,880
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

214
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,920
But the first man I met here was exactly the same person.

215
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:53,780
That's a lie!

216
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,380
It's obvious that he's a fool.

217
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,100
But everyone says that this is a good spot to hit.

218
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,980
I'm just saying it out of the blue.

219
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,880
Ah, Komachi!

220
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,520
Ouch!

221
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:01,620
Ouch!

222
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,240
What are you doing?

223
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,540
What are you doing?

224
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,380
Ah, Komachi.

225
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,300
R-Ryotsu! Kaikichi!

226
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,620
The first man I met here was...

227
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,860
No! No! No!

228
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,680
You pervert gorilla! Why are you following me?

229
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,860
What? You're the one who hit me!

230
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,420
Oh, I see!

231
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,840
You're a real man!

232
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,580
What's with this grumpy woman?

233
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,860
What's wrong with you?

234
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,060
You bastard!

235
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,240
He's got a good eye.

236
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,980
Uh-huh, he himself has good eyes, and it's good.

237
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,640
Alright, all there is left is to make sure that Ryochi-san feels better.

238
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,620
Hey, stupid boy!

239
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,200
Drink up and come home already!

240
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:54,180
Ryo-san, are you going to make another one-point trip like that?

241
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,020
Yeah.

242
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,560
I can't wait till one thing gets me a date like that!

243
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,220
And do you just think about it?

244
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,660
Komachi's the real deal.

245
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,480
Oh!

246
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,180
Welcome.

247
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,320
What can I do for you?

248
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,860
That horseman...

249
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,920
The horseman!

250
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,200
Is she that good?

251
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,460
Well, she's a bit rough, but she's a good match for me.

252
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,440
Yeah, that's true.

253
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,480
What are you doing?

254
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,200
She's a horse that goes well with horses.

255
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,820
Yeah, that's true.

256
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,400
Her legs are great when she's running,

257
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,540
but her eyes are so beautiful.

258
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,960
You like Komachi too, don't you?

259
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,080
Of course.

260
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,500
I fell in love with her at first sight.

261
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
I said I'd bet on her.

262
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,440
Okay.

263
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,140
If you know that, you should hurry up.

264
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,920
Pizza is said to be eaten while it's still hot.

265
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,180
Okay.

266
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,080
I want to quit.

267
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,440
I can't handle the customer.

268
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,980
What's wrong with him?

269
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,080
Does he like her that much?

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,440
He's like Komachi Sakura.

271
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,800
What?

272
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,200
You're in that restaurant?

273
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,460
Really?

274
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,640
Yeah.

275
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,480
By the way,

276
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,440
you're going to be an 80-year-old woman, aren't you?

277
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,920
No, I'm not.

278
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,020
I'm a woman, right?

279
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,740
I'm a woman.

280
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm a woman.

281
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,700
I'm a woman.

282
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:32,900
I'm a woman.

283
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,340
I'm a woman.

284
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,260
I'm a woman.

285
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,080
I'm a woman.

286
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,560
I'm a woman.

287
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:36,880
I'm a woman.

288
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,220
I'm a woman.

289
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,580
I'm a woman.

290
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,840
I'm a woman.

291
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,100
I'm a woman.

292
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,540
I don't know.

293
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,260
I don't have the time to talk with you.

294
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,520
But the horse is good.

295
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,160
I can't believe you're saying that.

296
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,600
What?

297
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,280
I don't want any more couples.

298
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,040
Alright, if he's getting married, I'll give him anything.

299
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,320
It's like a dream, Maesa.

300
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,440
To think that Kankichi is getting married...

301
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,160
Well then, I'll proceed with the discussion.

302
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,340
No problem!

303
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,120
I'm good at this!

304
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's just do it without any fuss!

305
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,860
What?!

306
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,220
J-Just stop joking around!

307
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,020
Marrying a gay man like that!

308
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,800
Marrying a gay man like that!

309
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,760
So that fortune-telling was true after all?

310
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,800
What do you mean, Naoko?

311
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,320
Isn't that Komachi's father?

312
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,200
You should be quick about things like this.

313
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,380
Your mother is also your...

314
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:31,980
Cut it out!

315
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,300
I hate that pervert gorilla!

316
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,400
You don't have to be shy.

317
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,460
I like what I like.

318
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,940
Well, why don't you ask him?

319
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,500
You like Komachi, too, don't you?

320
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,460
Of course!

321
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,360
You fell in love at first sight.

322
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,540
I'm going to bet on him!

323
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,620
What?

324
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,980
You're confessing your love!

325
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,560
You're kidding, right?

326
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll let you know how many times I tell you.

327
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,140
There you go!

328
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,960
You fell in love at first sight.

329
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,980
You fell in love at first sight.

330
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,020
You fell in love at first sight.

331
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,620
Stop it!

332
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,380
The big news!

333
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,280
Ryo, Kankichi, and Komachi are confessing their love for marriage!

334
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,140
Ryo and Komachi are getting married?

335
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,100
No way!

336
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,300
No way!

337
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,900
No way!

338
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,820
I have a request for the president of the two.

339
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,920
If that's the case, we'll let you off the hook.

340
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,240
If Ryo leaves the office and goes to the countryside,

341
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,340
there's nothing more I can do.

342
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,300
Ryo is finally getting married!

343
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,860
He might have a big mountain in the countryside

344
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,960
or he might have to repay the debt.

345
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,680
He might have to repay the debt.

346
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,740
That psycho Ryo...

347
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,860
He's going to have to throw a big party.

348
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,160
Komachi!

349
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,600
What happened?

350
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,020
People around the world are saying you and I are getting married!

351
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,080
It's your fault, right?

352
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,440
I'm young, cute, and sexy,

353
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,140
but I confess that I love you in front of my dad.

354
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,260
What?

355
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,680
I don't remember saying that!

356
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,240
But the tape recorded it.

357
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,420
I fell in love at first sight.

358
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,080
You're stupid!

359
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,440
You like Komachi, too, don't you?

360
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,540
I see.

361
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,140
The guest who was in the bar at that time

362
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,380
misunderstood that I said I like Komachi Sakura.

363
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,760
Komachi Sakura?

364
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,880
It's a horse.

365
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,620
I like horse-riding more than you, the horse-riding horse.

366
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,840
What the hell!

367
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,900
I don't want to be called a grumpy monster!

368
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,120
Grumpy monster?

369
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,960
Where am I grumpy?

370
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,240
You have grumpy eyebrows, so you're a grumpy monster, got it?

371
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,920
It's not polite to say bad things about people's physical condition, Komachi.

372
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,500
Hey, you two.

373
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,500
It's hot.

374
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,600
What?

375
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,220
You two came to pick a wedding ring.

376
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,300
I'm jealous.

377
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,060
What?

378
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,400
What?

379
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,580
I won't bother you.

380
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,040
See you later, you two.

381
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,220
Hey, you two.

382
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,780
Hey, you two.

383
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,460
No, you're not, Sakonji.

384
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,500
Ah, ah.

385
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,780
What are you doing?

386
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,980
You misunderstood again.

387
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,880
Shut up!

388
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,500
He misunderstood without permission.

389
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,000
If you don't come here, this won't happen.

390
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,720
It's always your fault.

391
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,400
Don't say anything of your own, Komachi.

392
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,000
It's not my own.

393
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,880
It's not your fault that you were here

394
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,160
or that you know Sakonji.

395
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,600
It's all your fault.

396
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,860
Hey, are you listening?

397
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,740
That's not the point, Komachi.

398
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,300
What?

399
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,160
What about me?

400
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,000
If you're listening, then go!

401
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,040
Show me some of the gems in that box.

402
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,020
What do you own in this jewelery store?

403
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,240
Or do you...

404
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,340
Quiet!

405
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,860
I'll ask the owner to come with you.

406
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,420
You two will hold a wedding ring?

407
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,060
In that case, Rita will have lost her hand.

408
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,220
Hahahahaha.

409
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,340
Senpai, you're taking your time on your long solo life?

410
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,180
If it's true, I'll have to congratulate you.

411
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,460
What did you say?

412
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,600
They're the diamond robbers.

413
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
There's no doubt about it.

414
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,640
I see.

415
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,680
If you think you've seen them somewhere, it's a robbery.

416
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,700
If that's the case, we'll definitely be killed for the sake of the mouth seal.

417
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,720
We have to get out of here quickly.

418
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,360
Oh, no, no.

419
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,280
Ryotsu Shinrou is a police officer who is loved by everyone.

420
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,140
The number of death sentences is the first in the country.

421
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,780
Even the men's department, who don't want to get married,

422
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,220
No, no, no.

423
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,400
This is not a compliment.

424
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,720
I can't believe it's so difficult to praise him.

425
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,720
Brother.

426
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,220
It went well.

427
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,680
It was a dangerous place.

428
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,100
What are the two people behind you going to do?

429
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,740
What?

430
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,080
I'll have you fall down the valley with this car.

431
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,500
What are you doing?

432
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,300
I'm just trying to untie the rope.

433
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,840
Liar.

434
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,360
I touched it because I was confused.

435
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,060
Who will touch your butt?

436
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,580
I touched it.

437
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,800
I won't touch it.

438
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,260
This is not the time to do that.

439
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,000
Untie this rope quickly.

440
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,720
No.

441
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,220
This is my trouble.

442
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,020
My worry.

443
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,700
No, my pride.

444
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,880
I am shaken by Akane's lies.

445
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,940
It looks like we're in the mountain.

446
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
We have to do something.

447
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,580
What should we do?

448
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:57,920
I am not loops.

449
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,260
For now, get up.

450
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,220
I am not good.

451
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,420
I can't really help it.

452
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:04,620
I wonder if I can do it.

453
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,540
Ready, set, go!

454
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,360
I did it!

455
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,480
This is nothing!

456
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,500
Nice try!

457
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,880
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

458
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,160
You idiot! Who would do such a thing at a time like this?

459
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,240
Did you hear something just now?

460
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,880
There are many raccoons and foxes around here.

461
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,320
Komachi, don't let go of my leg!

462
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,100
I-I can't do this!

463
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,800
I-I can't do this anymore!

464
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,440
Hang in there!

465
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,440
Listen, rub the rope on the road surface and cut it.

466
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,600
I did it!

467
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,520
Thank you!

468
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,420
Now, let's start the counterattack!

469
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,100
Damn it!

470
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,360
Komachi, stay here!

471
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,080
No, I have to pay them back for what they did to me!

472
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,460
I don't know what to do.

473
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,700
Ready, set, go!

474
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,060
It's a tunnel!

475
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,340
Get in!

476
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,600
Are you okay?

477
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,540
I'm fine.

478
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,720
You're quite reliable.

479
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,880
Now let's start.

480
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,700
Ready!

481
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,960
No wait!

482
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,820
One, two, three.

483
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,680
Jump down from the right and left.

484
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,300
How's that?

485
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,520
Leave it to me!

486
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,320
When I was a kid, I used to play with you all the time!

487
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,620
Okay, I'll go.

488
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,640
One, two, three!

489
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,660
Yes!

490
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,520
Whoa!

491
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,080
Hey!

492
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,920
motion

493
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,180
Don't move!

494
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,720
Good thing you came along.

495
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,800
I didn't mean to let you live, but I'll have you die here.

496
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,440
I'm saved, Komachi!

497
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,880
It's a cliff!

498
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,500
Break!

499
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,940
Komachi, are you okay?

500
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,800
I'm fine.

501
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:54,960
I'm fine.

502
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,500
No, I don't want to.

503
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,600
What's wrong with me?

504
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,140
You're doing great.

505
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,000
I've watched you again.

506
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,480
I feel nervous.

507
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,700
Let's go and pick up the thugs.

508
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,320
This is a great reward.

509
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,040
Congratulations!

510
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:31,900
Congratulations!

511
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:33,980
Congratulations!

512
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:41,820
You finally did it!

513
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,400
Congratulations, Komachi!

514
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,340
Thank you!

515
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,080
Put the curtain down!

516
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,980
The curtain?

517
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,200
What's that?

518
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,580
What?

519
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,480
I thought it was a good idea to do this early.

520
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,040
I'm glad you all helped me.

521
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,340
I'm glad you all helped me.

522
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,720
Come on, Komachi!

523
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,000
This way!

524
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,100
Now, we will hold a wedding ceremony

525
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,820
for Ryotsu, Ono, and Ryouke.

526
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,380
for Ryotsu, Ono, and Ryouke.

527
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,740
Great job, Kankichi!

528
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,960
Don't do that.

529
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,080
Congratulations, Komachi!

530
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,300
Why do I have to marry such a thug?

531
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,280
Why do I have to marry such a thug?

532
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,380
I'm a thug!

533
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,420
If you're a thug, you're a thug.

534
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,940
You've been good at it since you were a child.

535
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,820
Thug?

536
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,300
Thug?

537
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,360
What's wrong with you?

538
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,920
What's wrong with you?

539
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,700
What's wrong with you?

540
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,780
I've been waiting for you!

541
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,540
I'm not in a good mood!

542
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,980
I'll hold you!

543
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,200
You're a thug!

544
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,160
You're a thug!

545
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,740
That's more like it!

546
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,400
You're a thug!

547
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,220
You're a thug!

548
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,240
I hate you too much!

549
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,800
You're a thug!

550
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,680
You're a thug!

551
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,680
You're a thug!

552
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,080
