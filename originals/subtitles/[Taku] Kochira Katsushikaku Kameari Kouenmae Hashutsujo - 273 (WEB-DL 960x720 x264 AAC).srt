1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,760
One More Time

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,860
When watching TV, light up your room and look away.

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,440
Those who are broke should come to my place!

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:23,780
Come here!

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm not here, but I'm worried

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,740
Look at the blue sky

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,880
White clouds

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,540
I wonder what will happen

9
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,380
I know! I know! I know!

10
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but I'm worried

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,440
Look at the blue sky

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,700
I wonder what will happen

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:23,180
I know! I know! I know!

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,160
If you know, come to me quietly!

15
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,580
Yay!

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,560
Senpai

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,900
Damn it!

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,720
I can't do anything today

19
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,100
But

20
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,780
But what are you going to do, senpai?

21
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,280
You spent all your salary this month in just one day, right?

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,640
Yeah, I spent my salary yesterday and I only had one day

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,580
Anyway, I'll be dead by the time this is over

24
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,800
If I can't do anything

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,540
Take back the treasure!

26
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,760
Idiot!

27
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,040
You don't have to be so arrogant!

28
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,440
You don't have to be so arrogant!

29
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,800
I don't have to be so arrogant!

30
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,280
What do you mean by being arrogant?

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,000
I spent one day of my salary and I only had one day of my salary!

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,800
Hey, that means you've lost it all

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,520
You're lying!

34
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,200
I've used it all up with the K-Ring, the Pachinko, the Keiwa!

35
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,660
Wow, you've lost it all

36
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,600
Hey, you idiot!

37
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,580
You idiot!

38
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,940
You were so mean today

39
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,640
I was so mad

40
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,860
But, chief

41
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,820
I have 29 more days

42
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,860
What should I do?

43
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,800
Do you want to eat the K-Ring?

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,700
Do you want to eat the K-Ring?

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,840
Oh, sure

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,560
You're such a coward

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,740
I wanted to say that, but

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,700
Listen, Ryotsu

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,800
I won't gamble again

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,900
If you write it in the yearbook, I'll lend you a special time

51
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,660
Yearbook?

52
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,120
Yeah

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,140
If you don't write it, you'll eat the root of the tree

54
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,100
If you don't write it, you'll eat the root of the tree

55
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,760
I can't live with that, right?

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,280
I have to eat rice

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,320
You write it?

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,380
You don't write it?

59
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:16,640
I don't write it

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,320
I understand

61
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,200
I'll write it

62
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,920
I'll write it

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:26,020
I, Ryotsu Kankichi, will not gamble again

64
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,540
Is that okay?

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,340
That's not enough

66
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,400
After that, write this

67
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,280
If you break your promise and gamble

68
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,320
I'll give you all the profits you've earned from the gamble

69
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,880
All of it?

70
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,820
All of it?

71
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,840
Yes, all of it

72
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,740
Any complaints?

73
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,060
I understand

74
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,100
I understand

75
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,180
Ryotsu Kankichi

76
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,160
Is this okay?

77
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,160
Yes, half of it

78
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes, half of it

79
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, that's good

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,620
Then, let's start with the foreshadowing

81
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,060
This

82
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,740
What is this?

83
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,080
It's a 2,000 yen note

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,880
That's rare

85
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,680
Only 2,000 yen?

86
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,280
You said you wanted to eat rice

87
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
If you have 2,000 yen, you can buy it for a month

88
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,680
You can buy rice

89
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,520
You can do something with that

90
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,720
That's not true

91
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,640
Senpai, what are you going to do for a month?

92
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,240
It's only 2,000 yen

93
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,860
If this is 2 times, no, 3 times, 10 times, 100 times

94
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,020
That's impossible

95
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,480
Money doesn't increase like a clone

96
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,740
What?

97
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,000
Is there a bank here?

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,520
Well, well

99
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,640
Everyone who's lost their dreams in this foreshadowing

100
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,400
Tomoyashi Bank has released a new treasure

101
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,920
You have only to enter seven numbers and your dream will come true

102
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,660
How about that?

103
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,140
Tomoyashi Bank is a name with no physical strength

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,760
That's not true

105
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Bean sprouts grow nowhere and it goes well with anything

106
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,700
This foreshadowing is the perfect food for the Ristora era

107
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,920
This bean sprout lottery is safer than any other treasure lottery

108
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,360
It's safer than lottery

109
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,500
Should I choose 7 numbers?

110
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,380
It's the same as lottery

111
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,940
But lottery is a combination of 6 numbers

112
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,300
If there are many numbers, there is a high probability

113
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,980
The first one is 400 million yen

114
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,560
What? 400 million yen?

115
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,840
Yes, the lottery is today next week

116
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:40,600
Bring the lottery ticket to the bank at 2:59:59 the next day

117
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:40,780
I won!

118
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,280
But Senpai, this is a gamble

119
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
The lottery is not a gamble

120
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,180
It's the same as buying a lottery

121
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,660
I guess so

122
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,880
You can't eat it for 2,000 yen anyway

123
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,080
I'll bet on Ichikabachika

124
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,140
That's what a man is

125
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,980
Should I mark this?

126
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,260
I'll get 2,000 yen

127
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,920
Thank you

128
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,980
First, Ichikabachika, please

129
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,560
1846497

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
Is it okay?

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,320
You've lost a lot of weight

132
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,080
I heard Kasumi and Kinone are the only ones who eat

133
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,360
What happened to the 2,000 yen borrowed from the manager?

134
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,640
Well

135
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,820
I'm going out

136
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,180
Are you ready?

137
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,300
Yes

138
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,140
Ryoutsu

139
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,520
Yes

140
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,260
I'm asking if you're ready

141
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,980
I told you yesterday

142
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,180
What?

143
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,120
Yesterday?

144
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,300
Yesterday?

145
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,960
From when to when?

146
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,920
I'm so hungry I can't understand

147
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,860
What's that?

148
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,180
What about the 2,000 yen I borrowed?

149
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,820
Oh, that's right

150
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,580
By the way, where are you going from now?

151
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,340
I'm going to inspect the new bank's security system

152
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:05,620
Recently, the bank robbery and the Napolitans' crimes have been going on frequently

153
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,800
Isn't there a funny magic combination?

154
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,340
That's Napoleon's

155
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,000
80 billion yen for the pumpkin bank

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,700
20 billion for the Petit Tomato bank

157
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,740
Even the Goya Bank has been robbed of 5 billion yen of bonds

158
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,160
Even the police have to prevent the next crime

159
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,700
That won't work

160
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,040
I don't know

161
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,440
2,000 yen and a few billion

162
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,080
Oh!

163
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,280
Ah, get a hold of yourself Ryo-chan!

164
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,760
Senpai, are you alright?

165
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,920
You're such a miserable guy.

166
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,580
If you don't do something, I'll leave you in the bank's safe.

167
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,280
This bank is a super-rich bank that has been trading with Nakagawa Concern and Akimoto Group.

168
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,940
We are paying the utmost attention to the security.

169
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,700
Confirmed.

170
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,540
It is also necessary to verify the elevator that goes down to the safe room.

171
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,900
Except for me, only a few people can get on the elevator.

172
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,480
Now, please come in.

173
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,700
The safe room is on the 15th floor.

174
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,160
It is safer than the accelerator.

175
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,940
This is the safe room.

176
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,300
This is...

177
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,680
This is...

178
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,200
This is amazing.

179
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,560
This is the latest type of safe.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,400
Now, I will turn off the infrared sensor.

181
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,780
When I touch this infrared sensor, the hypersensitivity gas immediately evaporates and the thief falls asleep.

182
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,120
But you can remember so many passwords.

183
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,080
I can almost remember the fingers.

184
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,480
The sensor has been turned off.

185
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Alright, let's go.

186
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,540
It is big when you get close.

187
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,820
Furthermore, when I confirm my ID card,

188
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,500
I can confirm the password.

189
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,860
Confirmed.

190
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,360
When the panel opens, another sensor appears.

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,720
The right side is the sensor that checks the password and password.

192
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,080
Hmm.

193
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,860
Time is money, money is also money.

194
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,480
Confirmed.

195
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,140
It was my own choice.

196
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,080
And finally, I will confirm the password with the left sensor.

197
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:17,900
Hmm.

198
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,400
Confirmed.

199
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,800
It was time to confirm the password.

200
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,600
Now, I will open the door.

201
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,540
Now, now, I will open the door.

202
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:25,820
The door will open.

203
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,400
Please get down down.

204
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, come on!

205
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,020
Well, as long as I don't built it, it is impossible to get it, isn't it?

206
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,980
It is really ingenious.

207
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:37,900
Yes!

208
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Oh, it is really spacious inside.

209
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,640
Ah, I am hungry.

210
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,000
My eyes flush.

211
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,380
Ouch!

212
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,840
What's wrong?

213
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,460
Oww.

214
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,100
I got something stuck in the box.

215
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,520
This is...

216
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,840
It's a bullet!

217
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,500
It's one hundred million yen.

218
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,260
One hundred million yen?

219
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,160
Don't put it directly on the floor!

220
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,320
Someone must have forgotten to take it.

221
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,740
Please put it next to it.

222
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,220
Let's go further.

223
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,260
There's about three hundred million yen in gold.

224
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,240
One hundred million yen...

225
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,580
If only I had this...

226
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,220
Ryo-san!

227
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,500
I know.

228
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,520
I knew it wasn't mine, but it suddenly got heavier.

229
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,880
Ryo-chan, you're...

230
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,580
It's not common to fall for one hundred million yen.

231
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,160
It's because you don't have enough attention.

232
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,160
Come out now.

233
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,380
Yes, yes.

234
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,520
Then I'll close it.

235
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,380
Yes.

236
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,720
You're kidding, right?

237
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,980
I'll close it manually.

238
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,680
It's locked now.

239
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,480
All that's left is to turn on the infrared sensor.

240
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,440
Then no one will hear you.

241
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,580
If this is the case, you must be totally relief.

242
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,020
If I make a mistake and drop it in the house key, it'll be really hard.

243
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,840
It's impossible for the real Neapolitans to do so in that warehouse.

244
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,700
No. First, it'll be fine.

245
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,900
That's amazing, sir!

246
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,120
This is hard!

247
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,380
I did it!

248
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,800
I did it!

249
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,080
Don't get me wrong!

250
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,780
Oh, Senpai, the bean paste you gave me last time!

251
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,420
What?

252
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,380
What? It was a bean paste?

253
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,620
Idiot! You'll find out from the chief!

254
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,400
No, it wasn't a bean paste.

255
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,000
He said he hit the bean paste and broke his stomach.

256
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,800
That's right.

257
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,160
I thought it was a gamble if you didn't hit it.

258
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,500
No way!

259
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,020
Let's go to the hospital.

260
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,500
By the way, chief, the treasure chest is for gambling.

261
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,940
You're still saying that?

262
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,680
There's no way to win either a treasure chest or a soccer chest!

263
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,640
No way!

264
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,540
Did you really hit it?

265
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,360
Look at this.

266
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,480
Where?

267
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,580
I wrapped it with a red pencil.

268
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,960
Senpai said it was a one or eight.

269
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,340
1846497...

270
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,860
One...

271
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,820
4...

272
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,860
4...

273
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,860
4...

274
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,540
4...

275
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:12,640
4...

276
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,020
4...

277
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,460
4...

278
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,280
4...

279
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,760
4...

280
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,720
4...

281
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,260
5...

282
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,600
4...

283
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,380
4...

284
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:23,640
4...

285
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,000
1...

286
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,820
2...

287
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,020
1...

288
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,180
4...

289
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,200
4...

290
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,360
5...

291
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,000
4...

292
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,380
3...

293
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,220
3...

294
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,340
4...

295
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, that's right.

296
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,300
Listen, Honda.

297
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,140
This is a secret from the director.

298
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,880
What?

299
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,560
What if you get 400 million and flee overseas?

300
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,120
It's my business.

301
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,180
That's right.

302
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,620
Honda, I'll give you 400 million.

303
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,440
400 million?

304
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,780
That's stupid!

305
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,660
Instead, be quiet to the director.

306
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,820
Yes, I'm glad.

307
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,980
Let's go to the meeting room immediately.

308
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,020
Oh, I have to go soon.

309
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,260
Oh, what?

310
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,960
Is it here?

311
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,940
Senpai?

312
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,020
You're kidding me, right?

313
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,560
What?

314
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,540
I can't believe it.

315
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,120
It's not here.

316
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,840
Hey!

317
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,480
It was here before, but it's not here.

318
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,940
Where did you drop it?

319
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,880
Please remember it.

320
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,760
Oh, that time!

321
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Oh, right.

322
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,100
That time.

323
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,120
What time is that?

324
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,820
It's in the bank's safe.

325
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,740
Hey!

326
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,320
I guess it's that time.

327
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,340
This time, it's the first time to drop it into such a hard-on-the-se rods safe.

328
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,760
What are you going to do, Senpai?

329
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,720
You'll end up without going out until 3 p.m. tomorrow.

330
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,140
I'll be in big trouble if this happens!

331
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,240
This program is called "Project Object X."

332
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
I would like to learn about the secret behind the success of the director Yamamoto.

333
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,660
Is that so?

334
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,480
First, take a picture of steel for anti-theft.

335
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,580
Let me take a photo of you

336
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,640
Ah, wait a minute

337
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,780
Here you go

338
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,620
Then, I'll go

339
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,400
Yes, thank you

340
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,800
Next, can you write your name and last name on this paper?

341
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,900
And also your name and last name

342
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,920
Last name?

343
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,440
Yes

344
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,520
Well, the person who succeeds is different from the hand

345
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,560
Oh, right, Mr. Manager

346
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,000
Can you read this last name to the camera?

347
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,640
Oh

348
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,920
Here you go

349
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,660
Time is money, money is also money

350
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,340
Yes, it's okay

351
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,280
Print this eye image

352
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,760
And then,

353
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,360
I'll make a contact lens

354
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,880
The last name and last name are used for the recorded image

355
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,200
Do you want to dub it in MD?

356
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,780
Yes

357
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,900
Time is money, money is also money

358
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,060
Okay, it's okay

359
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,160
Next is the first letter

360
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,220
This is the hand

361
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,980
I took it in with a scanner and put it in my computer

362
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,880
Now, I'll make a glove that looks like this

363
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,060
It's like a really cool movie

364
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,380
My hand doesn't work

365
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,660
The rest is the infrared sensor

366
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,560
You can make it through well

367
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:42,680
Easy, easy

368
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,760
This is the real burglar

369
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,160
It won't change

370
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,300
Shhh

371
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,440
Now this is the real deal.

372
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,380
The gloves for the

373
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,780
I've confirmed!

374
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,500
All right.

375
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,920
Wow, this is amazing.

376
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,860
Is this the safe?

377
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,680
This is the problem.

378
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,200
I didn't have time to check the complicated passwords.

379
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,260
You should put them on too.

380
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,160
All right.

381
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,140
I can see it clearly.

382
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,780
My waist.

383
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,520
Senpai, are you okay?

384
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,520
Can I come this far and play the game over?

385
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,480
Okay, senpai.

386
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,660
I'm here.

387
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,420
Come on, come on.

388
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,320
Yeah.

389
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,100
That's amazing.

390
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,740
That's amazing.

391
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,920
All right.

392
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,660
That's where I came in.

393
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,900
I've confirmed.

394
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,300
This is next.

395
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,380
The time is a money.

396
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,380
Money is also money.

397
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,260
I've confirmed.

398
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,920
All right.

399
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,400
All I need to do is put on the contacts made by the director's curtain.

400
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,700
I've confirmed.

401
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:10,780
All right.

402
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,640
I'll put on the contacts made by the director's curtain.

403
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,500
The door is opening.

404
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,180
I did it!

405
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:25,460
It was a great success!

406
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:33,680
If I think about it, this place is worth more than 400 million yen.

407
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,980
Senpai, that's not all.

408
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,440
I know. I wish it was worth 400 million yen.

409
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,500
Why are you so late?

410
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,660
Speaking of spaghetti...

411
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,340
Napolitan!

412
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,620
I love Napolitan more than meat sauce or tarako!

413
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,500
We are the Napolitans!

414
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,100
Napolitans?

415
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,220
I'm so tired. I didn't expect to sweat so much here.

416
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,860
You guys must be tired of breaking this safe.

417
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,380
Well...

418
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,300
I'm sorry.

419
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:16,980
What are they doing?

420
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,940
No way!

421
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,180
Sensor disabled.

422
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,580
All right.

423
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,540
No way!

424
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,700
Oh, the infrared sensor is gone.

425
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,760
By the way, I have something to ask you.

426
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,940
You opened this safe, but...

427
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,420
If the infrared sensor doesn't work, it's impossible to take out the things in here.

428
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,340
So, what do you think?

429
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,100
This is a mountain range.

430
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,980
Mountain range?

431
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,380
Yes. It should be worth 500 billion yen.

432
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,880
500 million yen?

433
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,020
Senpai.

434
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,160
I know.

435
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,540
Or maybe it's better to make a lot of money and make a small profit?

436
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,180
No way! Let me talk to you.

437
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,500
By the way, if they turn their back on you, I'm gonna jump on them.

438
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Y... Yes.

439
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,340
Here we go! The mountain range with the four of us!

440
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,940
That's a nice choice.

441
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,780
Let's open it a little more. You go ahead.

442
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,220
I'm sorry. I'll go ahead.

443
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,380
I'll go ahead.

444
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:17,800
Akiman!

445
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,080
It's a trap! Do it!

446
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,260
What?

447
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,780
Keikonko! That's right!

448
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,680
Kai Sou Napolitan!

449
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,420
I'll arrest you for breaking the bank!

450
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,640
Wait!

451
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,800
It's 4 billion yen!

452
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,240
Senpai, help me!

453
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,600
You!

454
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,000
Damn it! What are you doing? I can't run away!

455
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,780
Wait!

456
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,760
Honda, hurry up!

457
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,940
Damn machine!

458
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,340
4 billion yen!

459
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,280
What?

460
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,520
Damn it!

461
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,440
Are you okay, sir?

462
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,480
I'm okay! Don't slow down!

463
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,700
Alright!

464
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,360
Take this!

465
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,640
Bastard!

466
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,380
What?

467
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,400
I caught you!

468
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,500
Ouch!

469
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,420
Ouch!

470
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,180
What?

471
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,360
It's painful!

472
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,600
It's still chasing, big brother.

473
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,380
How persistent they are.

474
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,540
Well! Let's go with strategy B!

475
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,620
Roger!

476
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,400
Whoa! It's worry!

477
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,880
It's there, Honda! Go back!

478
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,740
Bastard!

479
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,340
You can see the car there!

480
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,580
I can see it!

481
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,380
Over there!

482
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:02,800
You!

483
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,140
Get him!

484
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,140
Look!

485
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,420
He's trying to escape by plane!

486
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
Damn it!

487
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,000
What?

488
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,620
Hold on tight!

489
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,040
Stop!

490
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,800
Stop!

491
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,700
Stop!

492
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,940
What a great year!

493
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,060
But this is the end!

494
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,700
Honda! Over there!

495
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,220
Honda!

496
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,460
Yes, sir!

497
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,840
400 million yen!

498
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,500
400 million yen!

499
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:44,960
Sir!

500
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,300
What an achievement!

501
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,060
It was a great achievement to arrest the Taito Napolitans!

502
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,480
Well, well...

503
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,780
Ohara!

504
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,560
Let's have a ceremony!

505
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,020
Senpai, 9 o'clock is perfect!

506
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,020
That's good!

507
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,520
What time is it now?

508
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,320
It's 9 o'clock in the morning.

509
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,400
Ryotsu!

510
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,740
The president will hold a ceremony.

511
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,300
Let's go back to the office.

512
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:10,840
Eh?

513
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,260
But I...

514
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,440
Don't hesitate!

515
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,860
Your nose is so high!

516
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,640
Hahaha!

517
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,380
I'll handle it my way!

518
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,440
Useless!

519
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,080
Hurry up!

520
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
It's 2 o'clock.

521
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,940
We have less than an hour left!

522
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,380
Then, let the Taitoípon from Ryo-tsu Honda go to the venue.

523
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,440
Please say something you hate about us all!

524
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,420
Ahahaha!

525
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,880
Senpai, you have to hurry up.

526
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,520
Ryo-tsu!

527
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,420
Ah...

528
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,220
Ah, president.

529
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,200
I'm so glad, Ryo-tsu.

530
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,760
Congratulations, Ryo-chan!

531
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,720
Senpai!

532
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,580
I'm happy. I'm not as excited as I was today, Ryotsu.

533
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,000
Chief, I'm sorry. Let me go to the bathroom.

534
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,500
What? Ryotsu, I'm going too.

535
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,780
Chief, I'm the big guy.

536
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,000
Is that so?

537
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,560
I have to hurry. 4 billion yen is a lot.

538
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,080
I'm going to die.

539
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,900
All I have to do is deliver the tarimaku.

540
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,760
4 billion yen!

541
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,520
Wait!

542
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,680
Ouch!

543
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,420
I don't want to do this. I have to hurry.

544
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,280
I did it!

545
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,980
I can still make it.

546
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,980
Now I'm a millionaire.

547
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,020
I'm going to die!

548
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:44,420
I'm going to die. 4 billion yen!

549
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:44,960
Ouch!

550
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,000
Hey, I have to hurry.

551
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Today's business is over.

552
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,980
No way!

553
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,280
4 billion yen is...

554
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,940
Damn it!

555
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,980
I hate the treasure!

556
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,640
To be continued

557
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,560
To be continued

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,760

To be continued

561
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,260

You can't tell if she's a police officer or a race queen
