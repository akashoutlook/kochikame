00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:32,720
I wonder if I should go to the gym that I used to do

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,160
I was laughed at as a child

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,540
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,780

I realized it after losing

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:49,960
What are you doing?

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,920
Chief, you're here?

19
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,360
You're early today

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,820
Shut up!

21
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,900
What do you mean you're sleeping while working?

22
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,920
I'm counting on you, Ryotsu!

23
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,900
What?

00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,400

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,920
Just a little sleep

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,700
Will you pour tea on your head?

27
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,340
No, I'm...

28
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,280
I'm really happy to have a good boss

29
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,380
Good job, Ryotsu

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
You're not tired, are you?

31
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,080
How are you?

32
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,760
Then can I sleep in the back?

33
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,220
Yes

34
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,960
Of course

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,460
Chief, can I?

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,660
I'm on duty

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,040
Hmm

38
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,120
I'm on duty?

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,100
You can get paid just by driving a Porsche all night

40
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,460
What?

41
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,040
Is there such a job?

42
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,800
The owner of this car moved to Tokyo by transfer

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,620
But I couldn't find a parking lot

44
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,700
Tokyo doesn't have enough parking lots

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,880
You can use the company parking lot when you're there

46
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,020
But it costs 350 yen at night

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,740
You can't use the parking lot for a paid parking lot

48
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,200
Then if you park it overnight, it won't be a big deal

49
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,100
Yes, it costs close to 10,000 yen

50
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,920
That's why you asked for a part-time job

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,800
That's right

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,400
If I run around the Tokyo-Kansai line at a limited speed

53
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,600
The gas bill won't cost that much

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,020
I see

55
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,500
If you add gas and the speed fee to your part-time job

56
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,760
It's cheaper than the parking fee

57
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,900
You've thought about it, right?

58
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,580
But I'm not sleepy

59
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,920
It's still 4 o'clock

60
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,260
Nakagawa, change the car

61
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,220
Stop the car

62
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,060
Yes

63
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:13,140
It's a Corvette

64
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,440
The engine is quite modified

65
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a beautiful driver

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,860
Let's chase Nakagawa

67
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,740
I don't like such words

68
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,580

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,600
It's nice to drive with a beautiful woman at dawn

73
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,360
Can you hear me?

74
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,360
Good morning

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,120
You laughed

78
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,160
Good job

79
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,040
Good night

80
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,020
Good morning

81
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,740
Hello

82
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,540
The engine is dead

83
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,020
What?

84
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,260

86
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,760
What's wrong?

87
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,960
What's wrong?

88
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,460
I don't feel well

89
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,960
Don't worry

90
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,180
Mr. Akai

91
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,620
I'll drive for a bit

92
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,320
Thank you

93
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,660
Are you hiding the Corvette?

94
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,480
You don't have to

95
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,300
Don't be slow, Nakagawa.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,700
Roger that.

97
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,400
That bastard is finally giving up.

98
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,960
What's that car?

99
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,340

I forced him to stop.

102
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,460
This is an unthinkable, bold race.

103
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,120
Get out of the car!

104
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,460
What?

105
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,880
You're a woman? You're doing something unnecessary!

106
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,360
You!

107
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,160
Stop!

108
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,760
Ouch!

109
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,740
Thank you for your help.

110
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,600
It's a '68 Corvette.

111
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,200
It's really cool.

112
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,320
Damn it! Let me go!

113
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,900
Don't be so rude!

114
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,040
Don't be so rude!

115
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,720

Hello.

118
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,100
This is a bad traffic violation.

119
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,740
I see.

120
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,040
I'll leave the rest to you.

121
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,560
Yes!

122
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,680
Well, that's a great driving technique.

123
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,860
It's not that much.

124
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,100
Do you like American cars?

125
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,700
I'm busy at work, so I can only drive at night.

126
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,960
I see.

127
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,360
I thought you were driving all night because there was no parking lot.

128
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,180
Ha ha.

129
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,000
No way.

130
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,060
It's an interesting man.

131
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,980
He's right next door.

132
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,000
Well, how about having some tea?

133
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,300
Hmm...

134
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,180
What can I do?

135
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,060
He looks really nice, so I'll go with him until the day of the festival.

136
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,980
Hooray!

137
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,120
I-I can't believe it.

138
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,560
I didn't know I'd get caught up in a car accident.

139
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,840
Ladies must be able to see men!

140
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:44,960
We have a film.

141
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,200
So, I leave the Porsche to you.

142
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,300
Eh?

143
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Sorry for keeping you waiting!

144
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,180
Let's go then.

145
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,020
Eh?

146
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,080
Alright!

147
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,300
Sen-Senpai!

148
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,920
Geez...

149
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,240
Here I come!

150
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,680
You're so mean.

151
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,160
Ah! I did it!

152
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:42,200
What's your name?

153
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
I'm Kyoko.

154
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,620
Ah.

155
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,760
What's your hobby?

156
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm a food researcher.

157
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,120
I teach Kado, Sado, and martial arts.

158
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,100
And I love cars so much I even race in them.

159
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,400
You have many hobbies.

160
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,900
I love cars too.

161
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,380
You seem to like it.

162
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,460
Is that so?

163
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,520
What's your hobby?

164
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,380
Eating food.

165
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,440
Eh?

166
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,920
Huh?

167
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,120
Why do you know my name?

168
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,760
Well...

169
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,520
There's no one in Tokyo who doesn't know Ryo Tsu Kankichi from the Kameyari Park Exhibition.

170
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,400
Really?

171
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,520
I was so famous that it's a long time ago.

172
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,700
But you seem like someone you know.

173
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,080
This is the first time I've ever met you.

174
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,360
Huh?

175
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,280
Your ring!

176
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,580
We're married.

177
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:40,660
I'm married.

178
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,280
I don't care about that at all.

179
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,880
I'm good at taking things from others.

180
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,460
You're a ugly husband, aren't you?

181
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,720
I guess so.

182
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm sure you are.

183
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,080
What's your face like?

184
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,500
My eyebrows are sharp and my eyes are sharp.

185
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,380
Oh, your eyebrows are sharp and your eyes are sharp.

186
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,580
I have a beautiful beard.

187
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,680
Beard?

188
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,380
What is it?

189
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,580
It's a hair like a head.

190
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,760
A head...

191
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,440
What happened?

192
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,120
Nothing.

193
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,200
That old man is not my husband.

194
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,680
I'm wondering what's going on.

195
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,680
I can't imagine what's going on.

196
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,480
It's already this late?

197
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryotsu.

198
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,920
Oh, I see.

199
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,200
I'll pay for it.

200
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,140
Really?

201
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,360
Thank you for the meal.

202
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,380
Well, I hope we can meet again.

203
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,160
That's fine.

204
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,100
I'll invite you next time.

205
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,020
Take care.

206
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,260
All right.

207
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,300
She looks elegant and beautiful, doesn't she?

208
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,660
Isn't she?

209
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,620
She seems to be studying cooking.

210
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,760
Her driving technique is excellent.

211
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,180
She's a super star.

212
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,900
Her style is excellent.

213
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,360
Ah!

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
I finally see a red thread.

215
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,580
It's spinning.

216
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,980
It's spinning.

217
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,500
It's spinning.

218
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,620
It's spinning.

219
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,960
And on the ceiling.

220
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,020
And on the ceiling.

221
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,100
A red thread?

222
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,320
Yes.

223
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,980
Goodbye to the long solitude.

224
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,100
Wait a minute, Mr. Ishii.

225
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,820
Isn't she married?

226
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,400
Yes.

227
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,020
Ryo, stop it.

228
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,620
You're not married.

229
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,840
Shut up.

230
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,880
The more you have an obstacle, the more you burn.

231
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,360
Maria.

232
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,100
My heart is burning with the fire of envy.

233
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,020
Ryo!

234
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,100
You're too much to be loved!

235
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,240
Calm down, Maria.

236
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,600
So you're giving up?

237
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,720
Listen carefully.

238
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,820
You're a man.

239
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,700
You can't get married with me.

240
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,220
But she's a woman.

241
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,100
If you marry her, you can get married.

242
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,940
Ryo-sama, you're terrible!

243
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,460
I'm so desperate for you!

244
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,760
I hate you, Maria.

245
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,240
What's wrong?

246
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,560
What's wrong?

247
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,140
Why is my mother in the picture with Ryo-sama?

248
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,300
What?

249
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,760
Then this beauty is Maria's mother?

250
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,440
I thought I saw her somewhere.

251
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,080
I didn't expect to see Maria's mother.

252
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,280
The world is so big and small.

253
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,920
But Maria's mother is still young.

254
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,320
She's still 36 years old.

255
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,560
Maria's mother?

256
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,980
So that's her father-in-law?

257
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,300
Maria, how old are you?

258
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,720
I'm 20.

259
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,780
So...

260
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,660
You were born when you were 16?

261
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,900
Yes.

262
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,540
You're still in middle school.

263
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,260
Yes.

264
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,420
You're so stupid.

265
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,240
That stupid father is a coward.

266
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Maria, marry me.

267
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:40,940
No!

268
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,840
It's a crime to make a mistake.

269
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,400
It's not that my father is stupid.

270
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,340
My mother is more passionate about my father.

271
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,360
What?

272
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,920
Your mother is more...

273
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,860
I can't believe it.

274
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,060
Where on earth is she from?

275
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,580
We met by chance.

276
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,900
My mother was born between

277
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,480
her father, Denyemon Imada,

278
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:09,660
the son of the hermit,

279
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,120
and my mother, the shaman.

280
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,160
How are you doing?

281
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,060
I'm fine.

282
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,960
She was raised like a doll in a box.

283
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,400
At one point, she left alone out of curiosity

284
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,660
and was involved with the bad guys.

285
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,400
On the spot,

286
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,840
Father, who was training, happened to pass by.

287
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,560
My cute sister, let's play together.

288
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,220
What are you doing? Please stop!

289
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,780
I can't stand that face.

290
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,140
Stop it!

291
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,100
It was a sudden event.

292
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,040
In an instant, I defeated all the Chimpiras.

293
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,980
I'm sure the prince who came to help me on the horseback

294
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,680
remembered my mother.

295
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,260
I was completely mesmerized.

296
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,520
I feel that the girl who grew up in the house

297
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,360
is more likely to fall for the prince.

298
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,460
But, there was also the opposition of your parents, right?

299
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,620
Yes, but my mother's determination was firm.

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,160
My father took the plane to New York to go to training,

301
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,120
and we fell into a cliff.

302
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,540
And I was born in New York.

303
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,180
I heard that my parents forgave us because of that.

304
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,060
Well, that's good.

305
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,460
You are dramatic, Senpai.

306
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,580
What is dramatic?

307
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,880
I was just deceived by that Chimpira's father.

308
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,060
I will make you wake up!

309
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,700
Even now, she is still beautiful,

310
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,060
but she was very beautiful at that time.

311
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,480
Damn you, Chimpira!

312
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,880
Oh!

313
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,940
Ai, how are you?

314
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,140
I'm fine.

315
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,800
She is your mother, right?

316
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,380
Yes.

317
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,600
She looks even more beautiful in the daytime.

318
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,100
Ryo-san, thank you for breakfast.

319
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,520
Well, I can't believe I can see you again.

320
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,100
Ah, come on.

321
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,800
Ryo-sama!

322
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,200
Mother, you are terrible.

323
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,460
You know I love Ryo-sama,

324
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,620
but you are dating me.

325
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,540
Ai-chan, you are mistaken.

326
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,400
I just wanted to know what kind of man Ai-chan was in love with.

327
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,880
Oh, I see.

328
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,100
Really?

329
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,920
So, how did Ryo-sama look in your mother's eyes?

330
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,780
He was as unique as my darling,

331
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,760
and he looked good with Ai-chan.

332
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,960
Ah, I'm so happy!

333
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,220
As expected of my mother!

334
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,300
I came here because I was going to invite Ryo-san to my house

335
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,660
and have a dinner with him.

336
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,480
Really?

337
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,740
Yes.

338
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,840
If you don't mind,

339
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,780
please join us.

340
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,680
Ah, I'm so happy!

341
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,440
Don't hesitate.

342
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,760
Hehehe.

343
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,200
I am a much better man than that Chimpira's father.

344
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,900
I have a chance to sell him to a better man than that Chimpira's father.

345
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,560
Welcome, everyone.

346
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,660
Please come in.

347
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,320
Thank you.

348
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,160
Hey!

349
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,360
Yes?

350
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,480
Arrange your clothes properly.

351
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,720
Oh, yes.

352
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,840
I have to draw white lines, too.

353
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,300
It's too detailed.

354
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,580
Your mother's weakness is that she likes to look beautiful.

355
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,340
If she is a beautiful woman,

356
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:16,700
she will forgive anything.

357
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,120
Ah!

358
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,720
What's wrong, mother?

359
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,520
W-where is she?

360
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,460
A cat has entered my house!

361
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,540
Darling!

362
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,680
Yes, honey!

363
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,860
I'm home!

364
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,440
Ah, Shikigomashi!

365
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,820
Ryo-san!

366
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,720
Darling, you are so annoying.

367
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,460
You are too old.

368
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,900
Why are you here?

369
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,220
I invited you here!

370
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,300
I'm sorry.

371
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,340
There are cat footprints in the hallway.

372
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,040
Please clean it up.

373
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,340
Yes, honey.

374
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,640
I'll do it right away.

375
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,100
Ah!

376
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,140
Hey!

377
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,460
It's my job!

378
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,780
I like to look beautiful,

379
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,740
but when I see you dirty,

380
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,940
I want to look beautiful.

381
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,640
Ah!

382
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,960
There are stains here, too.

383
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,660
And here, too.

384
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:06,840
Hey!

385
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,460
I told you it's my job!

386
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,180
It's dirty here, too.

387
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,080
Hey, stop it!

388
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,120
Yes, it's clean.

389
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,560
Don't wipe it!

390
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,120
Stop it!

391
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,320
It's dirty!

392
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,160
It's dirty!

393
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:17,760
Ah!

394
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,320
Great!

395
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,820
I didn't know you liked to look beautiful.

396
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,340
Darling, you have to learn from me.

397
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,720
I did it!

398
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,700
I'll show you what a good man I am.

399
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,280
Ryo-chan!

400
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,380
What are you planning to do?

401
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,840
I feel sorry for you, honey.

402
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,380
I feel sorry for you, too.

403
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:40,600
What?

404
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,580
Darling!

405
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,040
What are you talking about?

406
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,840
Honey, it's nothing.

407
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,300
I won't let you do whatever you want anymore.

408
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,960
Come here, please.

409
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,220
Wow!

410
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,940
It's a huge room!

411
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,940
It's a luxurious room.

412
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,460
What?

413
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,760
All of them are in pairs.

414
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,380
It's like a new house.

415
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,640
Geez!

416
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,740
Don't touch me!

417
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,680
Don't use a pair of cups for your old man!

418
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,560
It's disgusting!

419
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
It's a huge house!

420
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:21,760
Ah!

421
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,060
What's wrong, honey?

422
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,120
Over there!

423
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,920
Is it because of the earthquake?

424
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,840
That garden stone is about a centimeter off to the right.

425
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,460
Can you fix it?

426
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,180
Yes, yes.

427
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,860
Leave it to me.

428
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,980
Yes!

429
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:35,720
Oh!

430
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:35,940
Oh!

431
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,600
Oh!

432
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,420
Oh!

433
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,300
I'm going to be a fool with a fire.

434
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,220
I'll go on my way.

435
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,560
Don't be absurd at all.

436
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,140
It's fine.

437
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,080
Okay, I'll go on my way.

438
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,720
Okay.

439
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:53,880
Goodbye.

440
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,300
Goodbye.

441
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:57,860
Mom!

442
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,000
I love you!

443
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,640
Mom!

444
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,240
Mom!

445
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,800
Mom!

446
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,380
Mom!

447
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,460
Mom!

448
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,760
Mom!

449
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:03,820
Mom!

450
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,460
Mom!

451
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,220
I'm not the one to be expected!

452
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
You two are both old enough, so don't be reckless.

453
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,360
Here.

454
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,080
I've prepared a meal for you.

455
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,860
Wow, it looks delicious!

456
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,760
As expected of a cooking researcher.

457
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,300
It's an original dish of Japanese cuisine.

458
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,860
Maria, that's enough. I'll eat it too!

459
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,400
Hey, wait!

460
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,620
I've never seen such delicious food before.

461
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,100
Well, I'm glad you said that.

462
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,680
I can eat it three times a day.

463
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,540
You're jealous, aren't you, Ryotsu?

464
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,580
It's not a big number. Look, I've already eaten this much.

465
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,200
What? Me?

466
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,340
You're a little too much!

467
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,280
Hey, Ryotsu!

468
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,560
Thank you for the meal.

469
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,880
The food with love is the best.

470
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,500
I ate more than you.

471
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,640
Of course, I ate more!

472
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,660
What?

473
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,580
Well, I'm glad you're so happy.

474
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,860
There's still a lot of food to prepare.

475
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,180
There's still more?

476
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,140
I'm already...

477
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,580
What?

478
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:31,940
I'm already full!

479
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,100
I'm already full!

480
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,060
I'm already full!

481
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,100
I'm already full!

482
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,060
I'm already full!

483
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,040
I'm already full!

484
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,200
What's wrong, Ai?

485
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,640
I just saw someone sneak into the garden.

486
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,600
Isn't it a thief?

487
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,020
What?

488
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,760
Alright, I'll catch him.

489
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,660
No, I'll catch him.

490
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,860
Leave the thief to the Darlings, and we'll wait for the meal.

491
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,600
Hey, you!

492
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,000
You!

493
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,860
Bastard!

494
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,600
I wanted to show you some good stuff.

495
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,320
But you're not strong enough to take this!

496
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,520
I'll show you some beautiful skills!

497
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,060
I'm Mie-chan of Buffy!

498
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,560
What?

499
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:28,620
What?

500
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,340
It's an opening!

501
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,960
I'm wearing a protective gear to prevent this.

502
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,100
You're a professional fighter!

503
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,320
It won't work at all!

504
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,620
It's not painful or itchy.

505
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,740
I'll get the money right away.

506
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,640
Oh no! It's coming in!

507
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,000
I can't forgive this!

508
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,420
X!

509
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,260
Where's the safe?

510
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,760
Just a moment.

511
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:20,460
I-It was just one blow!

512
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,900
I trained him for your sake, but he's stronger than me.

513
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,200
You two!

514
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,280
Huh?

515
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,540
I'm sorry.

516
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,300
I'll borrow a super strong punch from you!

517
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,280
You've got to clean it up, please.

518
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:40,660
Okay?

519
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,500
Yes.

520
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,240
You're dead wrong, lady.

521
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,700
It's rare to see you endure this tearful incident.

522
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,520
I-I know that I have been loved.

523
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,940
I will get married for now.

524
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,100
See?

525
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,120
He's still being called.

526
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,060
What do I do?

527
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,240
What should I do?

528
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:58,740
I'm going to be a monkey!

529
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,580
I'm going to be a monkey!

530
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,940
What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?

531
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,540
You're not like the usual Kotone-chan!

532
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,020
Cheer up!

533
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,320
Oh, right!

534
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
When the Hanayashiki satellite is complete,

535
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,060
let's go on it together!

536
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:14,920
We're the best!

537
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,640
We'll definitely do it!

538
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,660
Next time, "Asakusa's First Love Story"!

539
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,240
Don't miss it!

540
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,960
I hear rumors that I'm a woman who can't fall in love

541
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,060
But I have a lot of things I want to do

542
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:49,380
I want to run through the vast desert on a motorcycle

543
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,140
I want to be more free than a bird

544
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,320
I want to be more free than a bird

545
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,260
With the speed of the full moon,

546
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,980
I change into a lady's dream

547
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:15,180
My love, I'm sorry, wait for me

548
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,620
The future of the panorama is

549
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,340
pretty bright

550
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:26,520
You understand, right?

551
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,920
I'm sorry

552
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,540
I'm sorry

553
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,020
Wait for me
