00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,040
Maiden's Wife

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,860
Make the room brighter and get away when you watch the TV!

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:23,780
The people without money, come to myplace!

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,920
I don't have anyone either but I'm worried

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,900
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

6
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,420
You'll be able to do something somehow

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,480
You'll be able to do something somehow

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,420
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

9
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,080
You who have no job, come to my place

10
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,480
I don't have one, but I'm worried

11
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,360
Look, it's burning

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,400
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

13
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,620
You who have no job, come to my place

14
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,980
You'll be able to do something somehow

15
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,580
You know, right?

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,220
You know, you know!

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,700
If you know, then shut up and follow me!

18
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,280
You know, you know!

19
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,840
You'll be able to do something somehow

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,740
You'll be able to do something somehow

21
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,380
You know, you know!

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,920
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,580
You know, you know!

24
00:01:59,580 --> 00:01:59,780
It's the same as your mom's!

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,680
You're wrong.

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,660
I know, I'm not wrong!

27
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,260
You're wrong.

28
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,060
It's a little different.

29
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,300
Roadside trains run on both the river and the rail,

30
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,140
but this one runs on two poles only.

31
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,220
It's cheap because there's no need to draw a track,

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,600
and it's a "ecology car" that's out of the question.

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,540
What?

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,140
Actually, I've driven a trolley bus before.

35
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,360
Really?

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,620
What do you mean?

37
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,740
Let me hear it.

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,600
It's a story from when I was a elementary school student.

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,780
The

40
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,620
Tokyo sky a long time ago was full of electric wires.

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,800
At that time, the foot of the common people was the railway, the bus, the roadside train, and the trolley bus.

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
The roadside train was convenient because it could carry a lot of people at once,

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,740
but the construction cost was high to build the railway.

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,860
That's where

45
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,040
the

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,220
the

47
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,240
the

48
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,720
the

49
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,940
The

50
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,200
the

51
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,000
the

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,020
the

53
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,120
That's why.

54
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,060
This is a special seat.

55
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,640
It's just a sandbag.

56
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,060
Is it a stopped station?

57
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,600
No, the pole came off the river.

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,960
You guys are not on a ride?

59
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,260
No, we have a real ride.

60
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,720
It's not a ride.

61
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,880
If you want to ride, pay the ride fee properly and ride.

62
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,740
What if you get hurt riding in such a place?

63
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,920
It's fine.

64
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,040
I'll help you if you fix it.

65
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,320
Hey, get off the bike.

66
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,120
600 volts are flowing.

67
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,660
It's fine.

68
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,980
We're used to riding on a 20,000 volt pole.

69
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,560
About 600 volts.

70
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,640
Idiot.

71
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,680
It's hard to power the pole even with 600 volts.

72
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,740
I told you it's dangerous.

73
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,400
You guys are not afraid of anything.

74
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,180
The driver is Ken.

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,180
He is a good-looking guy who is faster than the driver.

76
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,480
He is a good-looking guy who is faster than the driver.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,020
He is a good-looking guy who is faster than the driver.

78
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,540
He has high driving experience.

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,760
It's not easy to break the pole.

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,260
The road construction is rampant in this area.

81
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,560
The number of sliders is decreasing.

82
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,100
It's about time to replace the pole.

83
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,960
Oh, no.

84
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,740
The road construction is rampant.

85
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,920
It's about time to replace the pole.

86
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,640
It's about time to replace the pole.

87
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,940
It's about time to replace the pole.

88
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,860
This is great.

89
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,340
It's shaking a lot.

90
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,220
There's a lot of construction work in Tokyo.

91
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,480
They're planning to build a highway.

92
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,860
Ah, I can't do it!

93
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:58,500
It's you guys again.

94
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,380
Sorry!

95
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,880
Thank you very much.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,060
What's wrong, Grandma?

97
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,560
It's strange. I can't find my wallet.

98
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,800
I found it a while ago.

99
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm sure it was when Kanchi was making a firecracker.

100
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,340
Yeah, I lost it because of the commotion.

101
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,480
Alright, I'll look for it.

102
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,200
Hey, you guys, help me!

103
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,220
Sorry.

104
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,500
Grandma, what kind of wallet is it?

105
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,920
It's a Hibikawa Gamaguchi.

106
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,500
Hibikawa Gamaguchi? Hibikawa, Hibikawa...

107
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:32,880
What?

108
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,280
I found it!

109
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,220
Huh?

110
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,540
This isn't a Hibikawa wallet. It's a snake toy.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,860
Damn it. Where did it go?

112
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,680
Wallet, wallet...

113
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,460
Oh, it's here.

114
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,940
This is it, right?

115
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,540
Oh, that's right.

116
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,120
Oh, thank you for your help.

117
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,560
You're welcome.

118
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,480
I'll thank you from now on, kid.

119
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:56,580
Kid.

120
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:56,920
Hehe.

121
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,860
See you, kids.

122
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,540
Hey, go to my elementary school next time.

123
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,740
On this bus.

124
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,000
Hahaha.

125
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,020
Sounds good.

126
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,080
I'll go wherever there's a river.

127
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,960
See you!

128
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,080
Goodbye!

129
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,460
This loop at the end is powerful.

130
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,820
But it's weird when you think about it.

131
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,060
The plus and minus are one turn at U-turn.

132
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,340
No matter how you think about it, it'll be short.

133
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,140
I'll make it go through the loop.

134
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,160
Look.

135
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,920
The plus and minus...

136
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,840
Oh, they switched.

137
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,560
At the same time, I'm converting the motor and the song.

138
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
I don't understand at all.

139
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,720
Chinkichi is a railroad maniac, after all.

140
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,000
That's right.

141
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,320
Chinkichi might be able to do it.

142
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,060
Huh?

143
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,940
Pull the power cable for the troll bus to the school.

144
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,000
Huh?

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,320
Did you really put the power cable on?

146
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,520
Of course.

147
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,140
I'm a man who does what I say.

148
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,280
Huh?

149
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,900
I brought the power cable that I didn't need in the middle of the night from the waste disposal area.

150
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,360
I dug a hole in front of the school gate at night.

151
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,600
I put a fire line and just let the current flow.

152
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,580
Then it became morning.

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,220
I was found by the teacher and removed immediately.

154
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,780
Of course.

155
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,280
Hahaha.

156
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,620
The adults were happy, but Ken was just smiling.

157
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,520
You're right.

158
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,060
That's what happens one day.

159
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,540
Oh?

160
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,900
Mr. Ken.

161
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,960
Is it near here?

162
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,260
Yes.

163
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,280
There's a bath at home, but it feels better when it's bigger.

164
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,820
My house is near the troll bus garage.

165
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:38,860
Huh?

166
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,920
Oh, you came out first.

167
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,120
I've been waiting for you.

168
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,420
No.

169
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,820
This is Ken's...

170
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,620
Yes, my wife Chieko.

171
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,900
Nice to meet you.

172
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,620
Yes.

173
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,920
I'm Ryozu Kankichi.

174
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,600
I like troll buses.

175
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,660
I became a driver because I was opposed to my parents.

176
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,740
If you say this person, it won't work.

177
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,140
I was opposed to marriage and I was impressed and I was surprised.

178
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,260
A baby will be born soon.

179
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,240
This person is going to be restless from now on.

180
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm definitely a boy.

181
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,940
I don't know that.

182
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,860
I'm a good girl.

183
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,860
If you're a girl, you'd better not be like Ken.

184
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,260
I told you.

185
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,440
Hehehe.

186
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,140
Well, it doesn't matter if you're a boy or a girl, if you're fine, you're fine.

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,920
That's for sure.

188
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,860
I'm moving well every day in my stomach.

189
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
And I'm getting along with Ken.

190
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,060
Are you good, Kankichi?

191
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,120
Yes.

192
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Oh, Kankichi.

193
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,800
Mr. Ken.

194
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,420
Here I come, Mr. Ken.

195
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,220
Go, Kankichi.

196
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,240
If you can shoot, shoot me.

197
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,120
Got it!

198
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,160
Be serious when you're playing for a child.

199
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,160
What are you going to do if the ball is gone?

200
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,720
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,400
When you can't find the ball, I will compensate.

202
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,720
You like baseball, you like children, no matter

203
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
I was a fan of Turo Bus

204
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,700
This is the auxiliary engine switch

205
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,900
That is the fire engine

206
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:31,300
But such Turo Bus was pushed by the so-called micro-car boom

207
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,280
It was about to disappear

208
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,640
What did you say?

209
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,280
Mr. Amano and Mr. Miyata are fired because of the limited number of employees?

210
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,800
Is there such a stupid way?

211
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,260
Both are the most influential to the company

212
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,640
It doesn't work for the company

213
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,000
Both are old

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,460
I'm going to be fired from now on

215
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,460
Are you kidding?

216
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,760
I'll go to the president

217
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,440
Good, Mr. Ken

218
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,840
Go

219
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,160
President, can't you ask me this much?

220
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,060
No

221
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:15,240
Turo Bus

222
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,700
Turo Bus is a car that is a long time ago

223
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,180
From now on, it is the era of micro-car

224
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,820
I'm not going to be a Turo Bus from now on

225
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,380
I'm going to start a new business

226
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,020
That's more money

227
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,540
What are Mr. Amano and Mr. Miyata going to do?

228
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,140
It's too bad if you suddenly get fired

229
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,840
I can do other jobs at my age

230
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,120
Turo Bus and those old things

231
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,240
There is no choice but to disappear quietly

232
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,180
Turo Bus is only a car

233
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,960
If you understand, hurry to work

234
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,280
What are you doing?

235
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,700
I'm the president

236
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:04,520
I'm the president

237
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm the president

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,260
I'm the president

239
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,540
I'm the president

240
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:06,580
I'm the president

241
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,700
Call the police

242
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,560
I'm a thief

243
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:09,980
Mr.

244
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,660
Let's go, Ganchi!

245
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,500
Yeah!

246
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,680
Oh, nice!

247
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,780
I got as many as Ken-san!

248
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,460
Again?

249
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,340
K-K-Ken-san!

250
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,140
What?

251
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,540
What did you say?

252
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,140
It must be a mistake!

253
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
No, it's definitely Ken-san!

254
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,940
Let's go check!

255
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,540
That's right!

256
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,760
Alright, let's go!

257
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:46,600
Yeah!

258
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,820
Is there really no mistake?

259
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,040
He just got caught and killed.

260
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,940
Ken-san is a short tempered person.

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,720
Uncle, can't we do something about this?

262
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,600
That's right.

263
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,560
I feel sorry for Ken-san!

264
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,220
Even if you say that...

265
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,020
I see.

266
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,260
That's right.

267
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,300
If he's a president, he got angry and went home.

268
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,820
Alright, let's go get Ken-san!

269
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a private chat between the president and me!

270
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,000
Follow me!

271
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,760
What?

272
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,200
You took away Chiba's head?

273
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,120
Yeah, Ken-san's going to have a baby soon.

274
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,280
I feel sorry for him.

275
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,320
What?

276
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,220
That has nothing to do with me!

277
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,120
You can't say no!

278
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,840
Go home!

279
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,700
Because Ken-san went to lecture on behalf of the troll bus driver, right?

280
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,980
It's strange for Ken-san to be responsible for one person!

281
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah, yeah!

282
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,580
It doesn't matter what you say!

283
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,660
In general, troll bus is no longer needed!

284
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,120
No driver is needed!

285
00:12:59,400 --> 00:12:59,920
What?

286
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,140
Why?

287
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,420
Sales are decreasing and revenue is increasing!

288
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,800
The maintenance fee of the vehicle is increasing, and the city's beauty is also ruined!

289
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,740
It's fine even if there is a river!

290
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,260
It's cool, right?

291
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,740
Shut up!

292
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,620
Anyway, there is no need for such a modern thing!

293
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,040
That's terrible!

294
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,720
We ride it every day!

295
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,140
Shut up!

296
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,980
Do you understand that children are business?

297
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,240
Go home, kids!

298
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,200
Go home!

299
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,680
If you don't go home, I'll call the police!

300
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,320
Damn it!

301
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,740
Stop it!

302
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:31,920
Stop it!

303
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,340
Damn it!

304
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,000
I hate you!

305
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,480
Even if I have money, I don't want to be such an adult!

306
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,040
Damn it!

307
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,920
What happened to Ken-san?

308
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,240
Has he returned from the police yet?

309
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,580
No time to say it!

310
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,080
第4回

311
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,660
You're not there yesterday, Ken!

312
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,680
Ken-san's not home, so I'll call you back!

313
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,300
Right?

314
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,080
Ken-san?

315
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,760
I didn't expect him to get it?

316
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:22,920
Come on!

317
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,380
Get out of here!

318
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,960
Dad!

319
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,360
The next day

320
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,600
I understand how you feel, but it's not good to hit.

321
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,880
It's just that my will doesn't pass.

322
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,020
I know, but I just cut it.

323
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,240
Well, I have some reasons to say that I'm a new job.

324
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,560
I have a child and I can't play with her.

325
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,700
I'm sorry.

326
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,660
Mr. Detective, you can go home now.

327
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,320
My wife is alone.

328
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,400
If I go home, the car and the train won't move.

329
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,100
Then run home.

330
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,420
Don't say nonsense.

331
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,180
Well, now is the worst time.

332
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,760
Just wait a little longer.

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,900
If it goes on for a while, the storm will end.

334
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:20,500
It's a huge storm.

335
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,680
Yeah.

336
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,680
Just stay here until it gets better.

337
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,560
What's wrong with my wife?

338
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,700
It's probably about Ken, so get on the train immediately.

339
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,080
What do you mean?

340
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,360
I didn't mean to keep it a secret.

341
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,080
What happened?

342
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,360
It's all because of that stupid president.

343
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,360
I see.

344
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,680
You're right.

345
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,640
I understand.

346
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,260
My parents made me die because of that stupid president.

347
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,980
For sure, you were worried and made me go home.

348
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,040
That way, I won't have to worry about her.

349
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,960
Well, we should be very grateful for that.

350
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,900
Just take care of yourself and send me back home.

351
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,400
Yeah, I know.

352
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,880
It's okay, Monami.

353
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,520
It's good to have a baby and be able to share a full responsibility.

354
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,060
What?

355
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,440
Well, I don't know what to do with that baby.

356
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,180
The baby is going to be born?

357
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,780
Oh no!

358
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,880
Chikichi, call an ambulance!

359
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,680
Where's the phone?

360
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,780
I don't have a phone. I have to call an ambulance.

361
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,660
The water is like a river.

362
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,320
We can't go like this.

363
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,000
It's an ambulance.

364
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,420
What should we do, Kikichi?

365
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,120
That's it.

366
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,660
We have to take it to the hospital.

367
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:47,920
Okay.

368
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,380
The water is like a river.

369
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,980
It's perfect for the electric line.

370
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
As expected of the railroad maniac, Chikichi.

371
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,920
Kikichi!

372
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,660
Chikichi!

373
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,760
Hurry up!

374
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,540
Okay.

375
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,320
Go, Chikichi!

376
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:58,880
Okay.

377
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,460
Turo Bus, go!

378
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,000
What's the problem?

379
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,960
I want to show the bad guys who made fun of Turo Bus.

380
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,840
Okay.

381
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,500
We have to stop the train.

382
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,100
I'm going to the hospital.

383
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,720
Okay.

384
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I'm going to the hospital.

385
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,800
Okay, Chikichi.

386
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:36,940
No, no.

387
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,780
We have to take care of the baby.

388
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,700
Okay.

389
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,940
We have to go.

390
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,420
Okay.

391
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,660
There's no fire in the hospital!

392
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,340
Leave it to me. The electricity is up to here.

393
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,460
Lower the trolley pole.

394
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,020
This is the latest model with an auxiliary diesel engine.

395
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,020
Oh, I see.

396
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,960
Pole storage completed.

397
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,280
All right, change!

398
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,400
It's working! As expected of the latest model!

399
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,200
Kankichi, hurry up!

400
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,540
I got it!

401
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,360
If that idiot president doesn't have a house, it's a shortcut.

402
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,620
I don't have time to sing.

403
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,980
Somehow I'm going to cut the garden.

404
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,600
The baby is more important than the president's house!

405
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,460
It's time for real estate sales.

406
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,380
I'm sorry.

407
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,260
What's that?

408
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,800
Hmm?

409
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,140
Drive more safely!

410
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,600
I know.

411
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,500
Eh?

412
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,760
What?

413
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,980
Ah!

414
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,820
Ah!

415
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:00,940
Ah!

416
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,640
Ah!

417
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,220
Ah!

418
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,020
Yaah!

419
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,240
Ah!

420
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,840
Wow!

421
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,640
Yaaah!

422
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,440
Yaaaaa!

423
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,340
Yes!

424
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,000
Kyaaaaa!

425
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,860
Kyaaaaa!

426
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,800
Kyaaaaa!

427
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:36,760
Yayaa!

428
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,580
Ah

429
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,660
Yes, here is Asakusa

430
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,840
What? The child got on the troll bus and ran into President Akashima's house?

431
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,980
What did you say?

432
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,940
Hmm...

433
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,460
Hey, Kankichi!

434
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,180
Huh?

435
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,620
Mr. Ken!

436
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,120
Are you guys alright?

437
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,060
Yes!

438
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,620
Mr. Ken, a baby will be born and we will...

439
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,600
What? Really?

440
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,380
It will be born?

441
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,160
It was born...

442
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,680
Congratulations, Mr. Ken!

443
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,200
You did it!

444
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,280
Mr. Ken, it's your dad!

445
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,180
Hahaha

446
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,140
Congratulations, Mr. Ken!

447
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,900
Wow!

448
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,820
Here, you're a healthy boy!

449
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,040
A boy! You did well, Mr. Ken!

450
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,020
It would have been dangerous if you had been a little bit later.

451
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,640
It's all thanks to these children!

452
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,440
Hehehe

453
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,120
If that's the case, it can't be helped!

454
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,280
Wow!

455
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,580
Hehehe

456
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,120
You did it!

457
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,740
Kankichi made him look like Mr. Ken!

458
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,080
Hehehe

459
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,660
Phew...

460
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,220
No matter how urgent the situation is, he can't get into the house on a troll bus.

461
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,380
After that, it must have been hard.

462
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,780
Yes, that's right!

463
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,780
It's a great thing from my father and my teacher!

464
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,700
But that incident was in the newspaper, and the people in the city were on my side!

465
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,280
Hrm...

466
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,340
Hrm...

467
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,400
Well, that president has been paying his insurance bills and has rebuilt the house.

468
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,020
Well, even so, the trolley bus was a gentle vehicle in the global environment.

469
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,400
The sound is quiet and the exhaust gas does not come out.

470
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,800
I feel like it's a vehicle that is needed in this era.

471
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,740
That's right. But it was different back then.

472
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,860
The number of minibuses and taxis increased, and most of the passengers did not get on the trolley bus.

473
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,660
The traffic jam is getting worse day by day.

474
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,440
The trolley bus is no longer the foot of the common people, but a lazy and annoying being.

475
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,620
The trolley bus was driven out from the road and was dropped off one after another.

476
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,520
Is today the last day?

477
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,780
I want to run more.

478
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,720
Hey, you guys are here too?

479
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,920
K-san!

480
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,640
You're here after all.

481
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,880
Yeah. I have to see the last flower road.

482
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,840
Yeah. I have to see the last flower road.

483
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,180
Yeah. I have to see the last flower road.

484
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,600
Huh?

485
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,040
Huh?

486
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,520
Huh?

487
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,700
That's the 50th-generation 77 vehicle K-san was driving.

488
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,840
That's the 50th-generation 77 vehicle K-san was driving.

489
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,340
But the slider is worn out...

490
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,940
But the slider is worn out...

491
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,260
But the slider is worn out...

492
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,440
You don't have to take it back, do you?

493
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:57,520
You don't have to take it back, do you?

494
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,840
Also, the trolley bus is too slow.

495
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,760
Never again.

496
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,940
Ken looked very sad at that time.

497
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,880
I think the world has become richer than before, but I wonder if that's all right.

498
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,340
That's right.

499
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,700
Chief.

500
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,140
Ryotsu sometimes says good things.

501
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,620
There are many good things that people have lost in exchange for wealth.

502
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,780
I almost forget about it.

503
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,620
Chief, I won't forget.

504
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,400
In your case, you won't forget, but you won't progress.

505
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,680
You won't be rich, and you'll be poor in your head.

506
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,540
You're still a child when you drove a trolley bus.

507
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,420
You guys are also...

508
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,520
Well, humans don't have to force themselves to change.

509
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,440
No, in your case, you should change a little.

510
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,680
No way!

511
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,680
Chief!

512
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,140
The afternoon after the rain, as if someone was calling me

513
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,840
I walked looking back

514
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,020
"Mom, let me hold your hand."

515
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:34,320
I felt that strange feeling at that time

516
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:43,300
So I tried to walk on the black tile of the arcade

517
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:53,500
Everyone was a child once, but everyone forgets

518
00:24:53,500 --> 00:25:00,600
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above his eyes

519
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,040
Look up at that corner

520
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,620
I can see everyone

521
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:19,340
There is a turtle, there must be a turtle

522
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,680
Come on everyone

523
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,320
I'm done

524
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,800
To the town of the future

525
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,400
Thank you

526
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,940
"3.3.3"

527
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,920
3.3.3 is my birthday

528
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,380
However, I am in trouble each time

529
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,740
I thought this year

530
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,080
Where am I going

531
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,020
Next time, "Hisan San Zan Birthday"

532
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:46,960
Thank you

533
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,320
"3.3.3"

534
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,980
There is a turtle there

535
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,940
"Akito Kameari"

536
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,760
Everyone, come to our town!

537
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,880
Thank you!
