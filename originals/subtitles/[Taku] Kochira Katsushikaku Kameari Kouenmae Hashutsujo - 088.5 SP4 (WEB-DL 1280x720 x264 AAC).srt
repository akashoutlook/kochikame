1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,100
Alien

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:13,580
You will lose your sight to the stars beyond time!

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,860
Found the culprit's car!

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:20,820
Roger!

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Let's lower the altitude further!

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,380
There's no need for that!

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,940
I'll leave the rest to you, Ryo!

8
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,180
The helicopter just now hit the tires!

9
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,540
Right. If this happens, we'll run away on foot.

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,400
But this is a highway.

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,120
S- Special Security Team!

12
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,600
Sorry to keep you waiting, villains!

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,420
Everyone, be quiet!

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,240
-S- -S-

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,440
-S- -S-

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:11,680
-S- -S-

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,800
-S- -S-

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,040
-S-

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,880
-S-

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:28,960
-S-

21
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:30,900
- -S

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,720
- -s

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,500
- -S

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,640
- -S

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,600
- -S

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:47,760
-

27
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,960
-Hyaa! -Hyaa!

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,020
-Hyaa! -Hyaa!

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,020
-Hyaa! -Hyaa!

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,200
-Don't shoot me!

31
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,560
Now, stand up!

32
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,700
-He's a small one. -H- help me!

33
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,920
-Hyaa! -Hyaa!

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,660
-Hyaa! -I'm throwing the gun!

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,020
-I'm gonna kill him if I can't do it!

36
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,580
-Did you hate the other one?

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,160
-Help me!

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,260
-What should we do, Ryo?

39
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,840
-Leave this to me!

40
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,060
-Hey! -Senpai!

41
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,540
-Ryo!

42
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,180
-Hey!

43
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,700
-Can't you hear me saying to throw the gun?

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,300
-Yeah, I can't hear you at all.

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,380
-What?

46
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,180
-Is it okay for him to die?

47
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,960
-Don't look at me or do anything.

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,340
-No way!

49
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,580
-Don't come near me!

50
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,200
-Don't come near me!

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
-Oh, I see.

52
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,100
-You!

53
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,020
-You're still a special security!

54
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,180
-Yah!

55
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,360
-Hyaa!

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,620
-You did it!

57
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,260
-Now, stand up!

58
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,580
-Nice, Nakagawa!

59
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,740
-We both are the arrested!

60
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,600
-You, too!

61
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,720
-Amazing!

62
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,400
-All of us!

63
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,320
-I definitely think he's telling the truth.

64
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,120
-I know that all of them would get the dirty eye

65
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,600
-due to his decision of Ryo and Kikichi.

66
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,180
I think so.

67
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:41,020
Next, the 9th member, Reiko Akimoto.

68
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,520
She's a member of the Katsushika-sha.

69
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,960
You did it, director!

70
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,260
Four members were chosen from our department!

71
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,600
My department has excellent staff.

72
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,720
And the last member, the number 10,

73
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,880
Ryozu Kankichi, a member of the Katsushika-sha.

74
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,820
Why Ryozu?

75
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,480
It can't be!

76
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,740
That's all for now.

77
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,940
Special Security, known as the SS team,

78
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,280
who has just been established,

79
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,500
is now a member of the Katsushika-sha.

80
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,360
Now, let's have Captain Keppel,

81
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,980
who is the captain of the world-famous SGS-9,

82
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,020
who will lead the team.

83
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,420
It's international now.

84
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,520
With the high-tech development of Tokyo,

85
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,700
there will be a terrorist attack and terror

86
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,260
like other international cities in the near future.

87
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,300
For that, we have to build a special unit

88
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,300
like our country's SGS-9 as soon as possible.

89
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,560
Captain Keppel, I have a question.

90
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,480
What is it?

91
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,800
The last member chosen from our department

92
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,780
is a former Green Belly,

93
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,490
and Asato is a former kickboxing champ,

94
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,220
and Nakagawa Akimoto is a shooting skill

95
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,360
that fights with the police,

96
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,220
so it's obvious that he will be chosen by the members.

97
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,680
But why did you choose Ryozu?

98
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,560
I can't choose Ryozu?

99
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,280
Ryozu Kankichi is a member of the Shima-tachi.

100
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,820
He draws more than 100 cards a year.

101
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,480
It's impossible to do such an important mission.

102
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,240
Tch, tch, tch, tch.

103
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,580
Ryozu is good at shooting,

104
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,400
and he has a lot of vitality and vitality.

105
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,400
And he is a man who is needed

106
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,600
as a vitamin for the SS team

107
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:30,900
so that there are no more Ukkari and Hachibai

108
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,380
He is quite a Japanese 2.

109
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,640
Yes.

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,380
You may give us an opportunity to throw an 181-yen howitzer,

111
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,780
Good idea, Nakagawa!

112
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,580
You are good at shooting,

113
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,600
I want to join your club.

114
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,140
I?

115
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,440
Yes, that's right!

116
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:55,460
What did you do for 10 years?

117
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,840
and who caught my club?

118
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,260
I was a newbie.

119
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,140
That's strange.

120
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,720
Is it for been in our club for so long?

121
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,480
Next!

122
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,880
Ryo-tsu and Kankichi! Here I go!

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,620
One, two, three!

124
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,320
R-Ryo-sama!

125
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,460
What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

126
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,080
I forgot to tighten the belt.

127
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,840
You're a little under 8 meters, Ryo-tsu.

128
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,620
Be careful. There's a saying that a gorilla falls from a tree.

129
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,160
Captain, if you say that, the monkey will also fall from a tree.

130
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,260
Oh, sorry, sorry.

131
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,200
President Hashimoto.

132
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,780
Oh, it's so cold!

133
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,760
Captain, I don't mind the heat of Japan, but your joke is like Dave Spector.

134
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,800
Is that so?

135
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,380
Next, I'll tell you about the tactic when the culprit got stuck in the high-rise building...

136
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,720
Ryo!

137
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,420
I'm counting on you!

138
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,260
What's with the tactic? It's a very important training!

139
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,120
You should learn from Ryo-tsu.

140
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,680
Don't blink. Stretch your back and listen carefully.

141
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,200
Yes!

142
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,100
What's going on?

143
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,060
He's always sleeping in the high-rise building.

144
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,140
That's strange.

145
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,180
Ryo-tsu.

146
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,500
In this case, how will you arrest the culprit?

147
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,360
Hmm?

148
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,560
Ryo-tsu.

149
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,440
Please answer the question.

150
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,240
Ryo-sama.

151
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,340
Can't you hear me?

152
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,780
Ryo-sama, what happened?

153
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,560
Ryo-chan.

154
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,880
This is a doll.

155
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,380
It was made by a toy manufacturer last year.

156
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,620
It's a one-in-one figure that was sold out.

157
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,540
What? Then, what about Ryo-tsu?

158
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,000
Get rid of that doll.

159
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,580
Yes, sir.

160
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,420
Ryo-tsu!

161
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,300
Idiot!

162
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,000
Stand in the corridor!

163
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,980
What?

164
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,820
I'm not a doll, and I'm not a student.

165
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,720
Captain Keppel.

166
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,660
Please listen to me.

167
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,120
What?

168
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,000
What did you say?

169
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,820
Everyone.

170
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:28,860
Everyone.

171
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,960
The lecture is canceled.

172
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,240
Ryo-tsu.

173
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,540
Nakagawa.

174
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,160
Akimoto.

175
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:33,840
Volvo.

176
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,840
The five of you.

177
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,000
Gather in my room in thirty minutes.

178
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:37,980
Understood?

179
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,840
Yes, sir.

180
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,100
What happened?

181
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,540
Captain Keppel's face was blushing.

182
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,500
Maybe he's watching a disgusting video.

183
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,420
That's not true.

184
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,560
Captain Keppel is a Japanese-style, so he's a Japanese-style police officer.

185
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,680
I see.

186
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,220
I see.

187
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,620
But I'll recommend a stupid lord from Shibura Prefecture.

188
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,560
There was a big guy among the criminals arrested last night.

189
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,380
What?

190
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,200
This man, Adayada, is the younger brother of the boss of the Dark Syndicate, Abudara Kadabra.

191
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,280
Abudara Kadabra?

192
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,460
Do you know him?

193
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,580
Yes.

194
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,100
He's a master of darkness who sells weapons and ammunition at a high price

195
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,160
when there's a war or a conflict.

196
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,840
He's a master of darkness who sells weapons and ammunition at a high price when there's a war or a conflict.

197
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,060
He's a master of darkness who sells weapons and ammunition at a high price when there's a war or a conflict.

198
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,860
He's known internationally, but he hasn't been caught yet.

199
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,500
He's a super duper big guy.

200
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,780
Abudara Kadabra.

201
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,280
Why do you call me "big guy" when my name sounds like a magician?

202
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,180
Don't underestimate him!

203
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:45,900
He already knows what happened last night and sent us a letter of challenge.

204
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,980
A letter of challenge.

205
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,700
Captain Keppel, you were so good to arrest him, didn't you?

206
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,140
Yes.

207
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,620
I'll let you know what will happen if you challenge me!

208
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,060
I'll definitely take back my brother and revenge on you and the SS team!

209
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,660
Prepare yourself!

210
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,840
You're so brave to challenge us!

211
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,900
Look at this.

212
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,220
Who are those scary people?

213
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,400
These are the photos of the terrorists that Avdala sent from the SGS headquarters just now to avenge them.

214
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,320
Jackal Henders, the leader who takes the name of the destroyer.

215
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,620
He's a special unit of the Oni army that has a strong presence in the foreign forces.

216
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,540
Next is the former pro wrestler Atomic Thunder.

217
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,680
He's the special unit of the close combat line that has been incorporated into all martial arts.

218
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,760
The special unit of the close combat line that has been incorporated into all martial arts.

219
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,760
Well, these two are Mr. Suke and Mr. Kaku, if you say so.

220
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,280
Next is Lily Francis.

221
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,200
Next is Lily Francis.

222
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,640
There's a woman too?

223
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,760
I don't think you can underestimate me because I think you're a woman.

224
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,560
Lily is a shooting specialist who won the world shooting tournament, including the Olympics.

225
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,920
If you say it as a high school teacher, it's the position of the Shadow Old Silver.

226
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,140
Yumekaru looks more colorful than him.

227
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,200
And the last one is the high school teacher, Mr. Sato.

228
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,760
Let's go, Mr. Sato.

229
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,640
What is this?

230
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,740
And who were you to ask?

231
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,220
I was wondering because you weren't the one who should know.

232
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,540
Your father is a Mongolian.

233
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,400
Russia and America are half.

234
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,320
Your mother is an English Chinese.

235
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,300
No, well, it's just not explained at all.

236
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,300
My lord is...

237
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,640
Wearing a 63-year-old velcro.

238
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,360
Hey, hey, don't say it first.

239
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,920
Oh yeah, whatever you guys, do anything for the money.

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,560
Tiger.

241
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,500
There is no information that they have landed in Japan yet.

242
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,000
For now, Avdara's brother will be transferred to another place secretly from the base.

243
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,700
While the others are searching for their brother, we will make the mission a success.

244
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,320
You guys also prepare for an emergency and wait!

245
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,140
Roger!

246
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,120
Hmm?

247
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,240
Hmm?

248
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,360
Hmm?

249
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,240
Hmm?

250
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,440
Hmm?

251
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
It's under construction.

252
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,540
What a terrible thing to do!

253
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,240
It's unbelievable that they have already been landing in Tokyo!

254
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,500
Hey, the route is wrong. The airport is in the opposite direction.

255
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,540
That's enough.

256
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,500
Don't you dare say that!

257
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,180
Hey, the route is wrong. The airport is in the opposite direction.

258
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,240
We were hired by your brother. We don't accept your orders.

259
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,740
But, the SGS-9 Kepler has the grudge of sending many of its friends to the prison.

260
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,520
Until we make him pay, we won't be able to say goodbye to Japan.

261
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,540
Oh, my.

262
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,640
Oh, I see the military uniform.

263
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,000
That's it.

264
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,740
Captain Kepler!

265
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,180
Captain Kepler!

266
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,680
Captain Kepler!

267
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,740
Captain Kepler!

268
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,440
Captain Kepler!

269
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,820
Captain Kepler!

270
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,140
Captain Kepler!

271
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,440
Captain Kepler!

272
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,400
Captain Kepler!

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,840
Captain Kepler!

274
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,560
Captain Kepler!

275
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,520
Captain Kepler!

276
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:00,800
Captain Kepler!

277
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,940
Captain Kepler!

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,180
Captain Kepler!

279
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,880
Captain Kepler!

280
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,220
Captain Kepler!

281
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:03,960
Captain Kepler!

282
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,480
Captain Kepler!

283
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,100
Captain Kepler!

284
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,920
Captain Kepler!

285
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,700
Captain Kepler!

286
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,860
Captain Kepler!

287
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,100
Mr. Ryuichiro Nakagawa is being arrested.

288
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,720
Mr. Ryuichiro Nakagawa is being arrested.

289
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,220
We will broadcast this from the scene.

290
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,960
Mr. Kasai on the scene.

291
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,440
How could the Japanese police and SS team be silent about such a big thing?

292
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,520
That's our aim.

293
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,100
What?

294
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,200
The news that we are involved will be spread all over the world.

295
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,440
Everyone's eyes will be on this Odaiba building.

296
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,860
It's already happening.

297
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,920
More than 10 mass media helicopters are flying around.

298
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,580
I see.

299
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,600
We will show you the best show in that.

300
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,220
The best show?

301
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,620
Mr. Musou, I set up all the traps.

302
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,220
Especially, I set up a lot of explosives on the first floor.

303
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,260
Good job.

304
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,600
Then I'll show you a real show.

305
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,780
What do you think about the amount of this bomb?

306
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,000
Perfect.

307
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,900
Then I'll tell Keppel what I want to ask.

308
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,260
How much do you want for the Minoshiro Gold?

309
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,880
One million million yen.

310
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,900
What? One million yen?

311
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,720
We can make the money with Nakagawa's tax.

312
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,640
It's too much for one million yen, no matter how much you ask.

313
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,780
Who said it was expensive?

314
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,660
100 billion yen is too cheap!

315
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,340
What?

316
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,940
I earn 100 billion yen per second.

317
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,400
If you get released from the hostages with such a cheap money, you'll be a laughing stock!

318
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,600
1 trillion yen, no, 10 trillion yen!

319
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,540
What?

320
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,280
10 trillion yen!

321
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,720
10 trillion yen and an overseas flight to escape?

322
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,040
Is that what the terrorists are asking for?

323
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,880
That's right.

324
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,260
They said if we don't prepare by 3:00 p.m., we'll kill Nakagawa Ryuichiro.

325
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,580
Let's prepare for now.

326
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,240
Hey, hey, wait a minute!

327
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,740
If we say 10 trillion yen, it's 100 times, 1000 times, 10,000 times my salary!

328
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
It's too much that I don't understand!

329
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,260
As expected of Nakagawa's wealth!

330
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,040
In the old days, they called it Kinokuni and Bunzaemon.

331
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,700
You don't understand!

332
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,320
You guys, get in through the back door.

333
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,560
Roger!

334
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,280
The rest of you, go straight ahead!

335
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,080
Roger!

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,780
The rat got caught right away.

337
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,460
This is the direct route to the president's office.

338
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,140
Wait, Ryo!

339
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,480
Everyone, step back!

340
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,900
Hey, what are you doing, Reiko?

341
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,820
Damn!

342
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,180
Even this trap!

343
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,460
If Reiko hadn't stopped me, everyone would have been killed!

344
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,060
Damn it!

345
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,440
We have no choice but to climb the stairs!

346
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,460
Damn it!

347
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,020
There are also stone walls here!

348
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,880
If we don't go down the stairs, we won't be able to get to the president's office.

349
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,320
Don't worry.

350
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,100
The eye is an eye, and the bomb is an bomb.

351
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,280
Here, there is a walking bomb-like Volvo.

352
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,740
Yeah! Leave the bomb to me!

353
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,400
The Bomb

354
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,600
The Bomb

355
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:56,620
The Bomb

356
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,460
The Bomb

357
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,120
The Bomb

358
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,880
The Bomb

359
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,680
The Bomb

360
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,060
The Bomb

361
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,300
The Bomb

362
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,630
The Bomb

363
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,380
The Bomb

364
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,820
The Bomb

365
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,620
The Bomb

366
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,340
The Bomb

367
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,900
The Bomb

368
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,520
The Bomb

369
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,460
The Bomb

370
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,480
The Bomb

371
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:21,880
The Bomb

372
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:21,940
The Bomb

373
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,200
The Bomb

374
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,340
The Bomb

375
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,620
The Bomb

376
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,420
The Bomb

377
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,160
The Bomb

378
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,740
The Bomb

379
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,040
The Bomb

380
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,640
The Bomb

381
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:29,740
I'm sorry.

382
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,600
I can't move from here.

383
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,000
What? There's an enemy?

384
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,180
No. I used all the grenades I had.

385
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,260
Raku! Think before you use them!

386
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,140
This time, it's fine. I brought as many as I could.

387
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,260
Are you Mr. Gombe?

388
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,520
If I get shot from behind, I'll blow up the entire building.

389
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,360
Oniwa Soto!

390
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,800
Aqua-uchi!

391
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,960
Let's go, Poli-ball!

392
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,060
Oniwa Soto!

393
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,420
You idiot! What are you going to do with the broken stairs?

394
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,160
There are too many of them!

395
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,800
But, just in case, I need to think about safety.

396
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,980
Don't use 10 shots at once!

397
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,520
Are you doing a leaf-building job?

398
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,960
I'm sorry.

399
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,380
I'll be more modest.

400
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,160
Be more modest. Be more modest.

401
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,400
S-sure!

402
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,860
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

403
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,880
Are you trying to eliminate your allies?

404
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,880
I have to do it quickly or else I won't be able to keep up.

405
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,720
Whatever!

406
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,340
Nagaga, do it!

407
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,340
Y-yes!

408
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,960
Just like Gunso,

409
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,660
there was a bomb-man.

410
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,540
I didn't expect half of them to come up.

411
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,460
Sander, Gosha, it's your turn.

412
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,380
Ouch!

413
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,120
Nagaga is so excited!

414
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,360
Father wants to save him with his own hands.

415
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,640
Oh!

416
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,600
Good! Don't be late, Nagaga!

417
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,380
Father, I'll definitely save him.

418
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:24,520
I'll save him!

419
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,220
Hey!

420
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,660
Hey, Nagaga!

421
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,140
senses

422
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,940
P-Pu study

423
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,360
Ryosuke!

424
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm here, dolbe!

425
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,560
ha ha!

426
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,940
kept

427
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,960
ha ha ha!

428
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,620
ha!

429
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,700
ha ha ha!

430
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,880
Damn it! Don't let me do it!

431
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,080
It's no good.

432
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,640
How could he attack Mr. Wolff with a single blow?

433
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,380
You guys have to stop here.

434
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,160
I'm going to the president's office.

435
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
Please stop them somehow.

436
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,400
I got it.

437
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,340
Wait!

438
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,800
I won't let you get away!

439
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,660
I'll be your opponent here.

440
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,860
Alright.

441
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,260
If you keep this up...

442
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,360
I'll kill you!

443
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,040
Hey, stop it!

444
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,620
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill this woman!

445
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:02,980
Kei!

446
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,920
Reiko!

447
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,960
Is this the end?

448
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,460
That means...

449
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,240
this is the president's office.

450
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,060
It seems that only two of you have cleaned it up.

451
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,920
Keiichi...

452
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,320
What?

453
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,820
Be quiet!

454
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,480
Mr. Ryozu!

455
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,500
Mr. Nakagawa!

456
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,820
Are you alright?

457
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,660
You!

458
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,560
If you have a match, raise your hands!

459
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,020
You're the one who should raise your hands!

460
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,240
You!

461
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,260
What?

462
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,240
Senior!

463
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,800
Nakagawa!

464
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,020
Keiichi...

465
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,400
Father!

466
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,840
You got caught!

467
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,560
I'm sorry.

468
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,740
Sorry.

469
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,360
What?

470
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:00,900
What?

471
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,900
All of you?

472
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,260
I'm sorry.

473
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,320
It seems that it's the other way around.

474
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,780
Is this the level of the Japanese SS?

475
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,840
It's pathetic that only four of us can't win.

476
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,040
It's pathetic that only four of us can't win.

477
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,600
Shut up!

478
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,380
These guys are a reserve force!

479
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,820
I'll bring the real one, so wait for me!

480
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,240
I'll bring the real one, so wait for me!

481
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,360
Everyone, I'll definitely save you!

482
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,880
Everyone, I'll definitely save you!

483
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,680
Don't be silly!

484
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,320
This is the 100th floor of the building!

485
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,560
This is the 100th floor of the building!

486
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,720
I forgot that it was the 100th floor!

487
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,260
That's a foolish guy.

488
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,440
The only thing left is Keppel.

489
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,180
He's not a senior who's going to die just like this!

490
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:42,920
He's not a senior who's going to die just like this!

491
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,320
That's right!

492
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,000
Ryo's life force is more than a cockroach!

493
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,340
That's right!

494
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:49,420
Ryo's life force is more than a cockroach!

495
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,340
Oh, no.

496
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,200
Do you really think this is gonna end?

497
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,620
Do you really think this is going to end?

498
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,140
The SS team has gone to capture the culprit,

499
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,080
but, on the contrary, we got all of them killed,

500
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,820
and now only Ryo is left and we're at a disadvantage.

501
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,240
Nnngh...

502
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,640
As I thought, it's impossible for Japan to have a special force.

503
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,080
What a shame...

504
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,140
I'll contact the SGS9 of the country and ask for their support.

505
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:24,900
Hm?

506
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,960
The competition hasn't started yet!

507
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,400
I'm still left!

508
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,600
Impossible!

509
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,980
Just by being careless, Hachibey can't defeat the enemy!

510
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,760
As I thought, there must be someone like the Cazaguruma's Yashichi and Kagero Ogin!

511
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,100
Fufufufufufufufufufufufufufufufu!

512
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,740
Ahhhhh!

513
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,940
What?

514
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:46,980
What?

515
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,680
It's a windmill.

516
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,400
It's not a piece of wood.

517
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,260
When an accident happens on land,

518
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,120
it can be solved with one pan.

519
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,860
One of the special police officer, Sanbagaras.

520
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,480
Big pan.

521
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,740
I'm back, Sanjiro.

522
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
There's a door.

523
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,300
Don't come in by opening the wall.

524
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,460
What's that voice?

525
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
What's that voice?

526
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,240
What's that voice?

527
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,500
It's a flying monkey!

528
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:19,820
It's a flying monkey!

529
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,620
I love the sea and protect justice.

530
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,800
Who read this?

531
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,720
Poseidon.

532
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,260
I'll put it in my tank.

533
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:36,300
I'm the captain of the police force on land.

534
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
I'm the leader of the sea.

535
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:38,960
The

536
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Oh, these two are...

537
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,560
They are, too.

538
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,640
Is this the high Scholar's strange ointment?

539
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,140
No.

540
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,380
What?

541
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,400
I saw a woman's silhouette on the window.

542
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,380
What?

543
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,500
And they're dressed properly.

544
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,600
How naive. They're the most perverted.

545
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,240
What?

546
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,620
Moonlight Power!

547
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:15,960
Are you transforming?

548
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,500
You'll laugh if you watch.

549
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,440
This is...

550
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,980
Wake up!

551
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,540
They're... they're changing.

552
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,100
It's not just a fancy transformation.

553
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,540
They're wearing the moon energy on their backs,

554
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,920
and they're breaking the stick of justice.

555
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,560
Leave the other cases to me.

556
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,360
The Moonlight Magician, Gekkou Deka!

557
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,160
I'm also the Venus Deka!

558
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,840
I'm back!

559
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,980
You guys are taking too long!

560
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,000
It's been a while, Ryo-tsu.

561
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,040
We're special police officers,

562
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,860
Samba-Galas,

563
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,720
and I can easily arrest terrorists.

564
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,680
Hmm.

565
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,800
Ryo-tsu, these guys are reliable.

566
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,260
Hey, hey, are they reliable?

567
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,140
Hmm...

568
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,060
Here it comes!

569
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,660
It's a pre-battle hunger strike.

570
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,640
Oh.

571
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,480
I knew it!

572
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,420
Hmm...

573
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,060
They're quite strong,

574
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,000
to let Hachibie fall.

575
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,360
Don't you get impressed, too!

576
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,400
You guys, support Ryo-tsu,

577
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,320
and rescue the hostages.

578
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,180
Yes, sir!

579
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,740
The peace in Japan is on your shoulders.

580
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,800
Hmm...

581
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,720
I don't care what happens.

582
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,240
I don't care what happens.

583
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,240
The building on the 100th floor is the neck.

584
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,540
Well,

585
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,040
I'll burn the energy before I reach the top floor.

586
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,720
I'll burn the energy before I reach the top floor.

587
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,460
If it's at least 10 times,

588
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,460
I can arrest myself.

589
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,000
No way.

590
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,140
You can't do that.

591
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,300
You can't make the 100th floor into 10.

592
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,880
Make the 100th floor into 10?

593
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,120
No.

594
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,240
It's not like I can.

595
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,460
Huh?

596
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,920
I have an idea.

597
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,520
Cheers!

598
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,200
In an hour,

599
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,420
I'll get 10 trillion yen of cash,

600
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,840
and we'll be in Japan.

601
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,720
The weird guy who ran away from the window,

602
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,860
didn't show up to rescue us.

603
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,740
He ran away because of our terror.

604
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,600
He ran away because of our terror.

605
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,020
He truly6

606
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,820
really6

607
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,280
really8

608
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,820
really8

609
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,860
really9

610
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:50,620
really10

611
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,200
really11

612
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,380
really12

613
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,660
really14

614
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:54,740
really21

615
00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:03,000
really24

616
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,320
All the members inside, move quickly!

617
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,480
What did you say?

618
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,820
Okay! Let's start the wire lock operation!

619
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,620
-Roger! -Roger!

620
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
Fire the wires!

621
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,600
Fire!

622
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,540
Fire!

623
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,400
Alright! Good! Pull out!

624
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,500
Roger!

625
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,380
Come on! Let's escape quickly!

626
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,780
Kawashima, Kisa, Tsukui!

627
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,080
Don't let them get away!

628
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,520
Protect them with your life!

629
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,720
Alright! Good! Keep it up!

630
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,180
Terrorists! Look!

631
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,220
What is that?

632
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,980
Captain Kepelle?

633
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,620
What on earth is he planning to do?

634
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,620
Alright! Put the helicopter on the side!

635
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,680
Fire!

636
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,380
Special 9 wire!

637
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,340
Alright!

638
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,120
Alright! Go!

639
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,440
It's a mythic fall!

640
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,060
No way out.

641
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,440
Go away!

642
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,680
Oh...

643
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,980
It's going anywhere!

644
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,060
This is the kind of thing I would do.

645
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,820
Okay! One more!

646
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,580
...

647
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:09,940
...

648
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,060
...

649
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,800
...

650
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,120
...

651
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,580
...

652
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,040
Okay! Good, everyone!

653
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,500
Low the building down at this rate!

654
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,600
Understood!

655
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,600
...

656
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,820
What's going on?

657
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,100
Damn it! What have they done?

658
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,680
The building is getting lower!

659
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,140
What's going on?

660
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,480
To do such a reckless thing...

661
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,580
Ryo! Ryo is here!

662
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,580
What's going on?

663
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,560
Ryo!

664
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,700
Good! We can get in easily if we pull this much.

665
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,060
You terrorists! Wait!

666
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,160
Kaipan Deka and I will get in.

667
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,500
Dolphin Deka and Moon Deka, follow me to the base.

668
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,560
Roger!

669
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,160
Good! Let's go, Kaipan Deka!

670
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:24,840
Wait.

671
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,700
What?

672
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,940
When you combine with me, you must wear these.

673
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,160
That again?

674
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,900
If you don't wear them, I won't talk about this.

675
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,840
I got it. I just have to wear them, right?

676
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,940
Is it okay to let them do as it is?

677
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,960
This is the time. Leave it to me.

678
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,060
Let's go!

679
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,160
The SS guy is coming in with another one.

680
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,820
And he's naked.

681
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,160
What?

682
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,120
Thunder, Gosha, let's fight back.

683
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,860
Roger!

684
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,220
Ryo is here to help us.

685
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,880
But what does it mean to be naked with another one?

686
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,060
Maybe, maybe...

687
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,900
Don't say that! I don't want to hear that name.

688
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,380
How is it? This outfit is easier, right?

689
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,580
Shut up! Run!

690
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,040
Look! There are 95 stairs on the 5th floor.

691
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,800
It's wonderful.

692
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:27,860
Wonderful.

693
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,700
Alright, let's go!

694
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,580
That's it.

695
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,320
I won't let you go any further.

696
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,400
You're stupid to stand with a rifle and a hand.

697
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,700
What are you doing?

698
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,020
I don't need any equipment.

699
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,300
Don't panic.

700
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,060
Hey, hey!

701
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,800
Excuse me, it's time to get some nutrition.

702
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,760
I told you to stop eating that banana!

703
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,000
Mugumugu.

704
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,420
Gokkun.

705
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,580
I don't like to fight.

706
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,380
Let's get naked and talk.

707
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,280
What?

708
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,340
Now, let's get naked and talk.

709
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,140
Isn't he crazy?

710
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,960
He is.

711
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,700
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

712
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,600
Everyone was barefoot when humans were born.

713
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,840
Let's talk in a pure heart like a baby.

714
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,320
Don't get too close!

715
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,400
Ryotsu, you should take off your pants.

716
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,160
What?

717
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,300
You're lying!

718
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,400
If you take them off, they'll take them off, too.

719
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,720
I don't know the basis at all.

720
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,480
In order to make the other person naked, I must be naked first.

721
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,260
That's your own logic!

722
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,300
Take them off!

723
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,980
I got it.

724
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,440
I'll take them off.

725
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,360
You're a useless assistant.

726
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,680
What are you doing?

727
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,920
You're already a middle-aged man.

728
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,480
You don't have to hide it.

729
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,700
Don't raise the level on your own.

730
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,960
Damn it!

731
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,560
I don't like this anymore.

732
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,020
How is it?

733
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,120
Now, you don't have to be embarrassed anymore.

734
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,580
Don't get too close!

735
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,940
We don't have that kind of hobby!

736
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,180
Don't be so embarrassed.

737
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,420
If you make us move, you'll be free both physically and mentally.

738
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,660
I'm hungry.

739
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,320
Now!

740
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,380
Choryo!

741
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,300
It's a little more than we expected.

742
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,920
As usual, it's a terrible method.

743
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,980
Senpai!

744
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,560
Ryo!

745
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,560
I knew they'd come.

746
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,540
What's wrong with the terrorists?

747
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,440
They're planning on running away.

748
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,400
Take your father to the roof!

749
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,540
Tadayada's little brother, Abdara, is coming on a helicopter to fetch us.

750
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,520
Did Abdara come to Japan?

751
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,300
You got it? Kaipan, leave it to us!

752
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,400
Ryo-sama, be careful!

753
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Dolphin, start the second operation!

754
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,520
Roger!

755
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,020
Hey, move it!

756
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,140
You made us work so hard.

757
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,680
I'm sorry, brother.

758
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,420
It's alright. Get on the boat.

759
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,320
Oh, Mr. Ryo.

760
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,780
I won't let you get away!

761
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,900
Dolphin Digger!

762
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:00,820
What?

763
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:08,080
Nobody knows the South Sea...

764
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,360
Joe, it's not the time to sing!

765
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,540
Hurry up!

766
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,840
What a tough guy.

767
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,960
Welcome, Mr. Sokkuri!

768
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,440
The one in the South Sea is Ryuichiro!

769
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,560
I'm the one in the South Sea!

770
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,780
The one in the South Sea is Ryuichiro!

771
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,540
Shut up!

772
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,800
I'm not that kind of a man!

773
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,920
I'm not that kind of a man either!

774
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,020
Which one is the real one?

775
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,100
Then, you all get on the boat!

776
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,140
Hurry up!

777
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,080
I'll kill you!

778
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:46,900
Oh, no!

779
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,600
Can't believe he's taking all of us!

780
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,500
Gekko, come here!

781
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,340
Roger!

782
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,040
Alright! Go chase the helicopter!

783
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,360
Idiot! Why are you coming down?

784
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,680
What are you doing? Go chase the helicopter!

785
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,380
Now, change into this.

786
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,740
Eh? Again?

787
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,400
With such a shabby outfit, I will be laughed at.

788
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,320
I will also transform, so change quickly.

789
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,020
I don't care, so hurry up!

790
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,260
Moonlight Power!

791
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,600
Hey, hurry up!

792
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,260
What is that outfit?

793
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,920
Let me explain.

794
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,540
When Gekko Deka wears the bunny girl costume,

795
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,220
his sense of taste changes.

796
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,200
And he becomes ten times more powerful.

797
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,420
I can hear it.

798
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:52,960
I can hear it.

799
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,420
Their helicopter is...

800
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,100
It's over there!

801
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,480
Right.

802
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,080
You can see it, can't you?

803
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,800
Why don't you transform and chase it?

804
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,200
Then, let's go with the costume for the chase.

805
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,740
Stop it!

806
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,680
Yeah!

807
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,040
Leave it to you.

808
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,340
I will drive.

809
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,780
They are chasing us.

810
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:18,960
I'll help you.

811
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,920
You are way too fast.

812
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,300
These are coming, so hurry up!

813
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,700
Instead of the training over, I won't be faster.

814
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,400
I will change the car тотem.

815
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,520
You'll take care of them.

816
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,080
I will!

817
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,520
You move a bit.

818
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,280
Hey!

819
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,340
I'll shoot them!

820
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,540
Hey, it's dangerous!

821
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,620
Their arms have the power of Nagagawa or Reiko!

822
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:46,900
Reiko?

823
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:46,920
panelists

824
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,320
Yeah!

825
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,220
Aim the engine next time.

826
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,260
OK!

827
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,000
What's going on?

828
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,640
What's wrong?

829
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,040
It's a living thing, even though it just shot out its spine!

830
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,920
That's not going to happen.

831
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,320
Aim once more!

832
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,100
lt's a monster!

833
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,100
Hissing! Hissing! Hissing!

834
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,720
Hissing! Hissing! Hissing!

835
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,880
Hissing! Hissing! Hissing!

836
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,460
I- I'm out of bullets...

837
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,840
Ha ha! I'm out of bullets at last!

838
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,300
They were all my figures!

839
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,300
You tricked me!

840
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,280
Let's go! Now it's my turn!

841
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,440
Go, Bazooka!

842
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,300
Take this!

843
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,560
Let me explain.

844
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,880
If you transform into this costume,

845
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,860
you can do some crazy acrobatic controls!

846
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,320
Let's go!

847
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,200
How's that?

848
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,100
It's the full 30 Udinmai!

849
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,700
I got it!

850
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,600
I got it, so please stop!

851
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,480
I feel so bad!

852
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,600
You're still going to shoot me?

853
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,480
That's right.

854
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
I'm going to shoot you!

855
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:52,360
I'm going to shoot you!

856
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,420
I feel so bad!

857
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,680
He's so good at controlling that I can't believe it!

858
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,680
All right! Let's go!

859
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:08,960
I can't control the machine!

860
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,800
What?

861
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,780
Damn it!

862
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,480
Let's get out of here!

863
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,200
Yes, sir!

864
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,500
Wow!

865
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,660
What's going to happen to us?

866
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,200
Help!

867
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,240
Getto, you guys!

868
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,800
Go rescue the old man and the children!

869
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,020
Roger!

870
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,040
Yes, sir!

871
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,620
Help!

872
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,940
I'll save them now!

873
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,320
Voilà!

874
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,300
OK, we rescued the old man!

875
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,600
And those guys won't let us out!

876
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,080
What?

877
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,320
Dammit!

878
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,680
Get off the ship.

879
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,820
What's happening?

880
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,360
What's going on?

881
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,300
I'm going to take the ship!

882
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,660
Take this, Asuka!

883
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,420
How dare you escape!

884
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:17,940
Y- yes!

885
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,980
W- what's that?

886
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,580
Nobody knows.

887
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,760
It's him again!

888
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:27,460
Damn!

889
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,880
The sea of waves.

890
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,960
We can't escape anymore!

891
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,320
Shut up!

892
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,740
Don't underestimate the special security!

893
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,440
Dolphin Dagger, counterattack!

894
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,280
OK!

895
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,660
Hey, Dolphin!

896
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,580
Come on!

897
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,540
I'm the only one in pink!

898
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,360
No, no, no!

899
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,460
Today, Pinka, the dolphin,

900
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,740
has come to cheer us on.

901
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,700
You know, the one who comes out at midnight!

902
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,460
A- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a-

903
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:11,860
You idiot!

904
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,360
You shouldn't make the enemy happy!

905
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,860
This is a promise, by the way.

906
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,160
I'm serious about the next one.

907
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,200
That's it!

908
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,100
What are you going to do?

909
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:31,740
Go for it!

910
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:32,540
Wow!

911
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,520
Bней Hauring

912
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,220
-Get out of the way! -Damn it...

913
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,240
Are you still trying to run away, Dolphin Digger?

914
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,020
Don't you have any stronger weapons?

915
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,040
Of course, but I don't have any responsibility.

916
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,980
What? Tomahawk?

917
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,420
Go koo!

918
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,280
No, don't make a noise!

919
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,560
We did it!

920
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,100
We did it!

921
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:45,080
We'll arrest everyone.

922
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,340
We're here.

923
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:48,420
We're here.

924
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,060
Captain Keppel, the operation is over.

925
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,360
Mr. Ryozu, thank you. Thank you so much.

926
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,440
We broke the building, but it's not a problem compared to the 10 trillion yen.

927
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,160
I don't care about the money.

928
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,500
He's here on behalf of Fuji TV.

929
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,080
Mr. Tsuyuki.

930
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,120
Our company's car.

931
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,420
I'll have it insured.

932
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,580
20 billion yen?

933
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,340
Are you kidding me?

934
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,720
We don't have that kind of money.

935
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,800
Oh, right. Where's Nakagawa's father?

936
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,460
Goodbye. We'll meet again in 10 years.

937
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,100
Father, goodbye.

938
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,120
Hey, don't send me off without permission.

939
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,220
Captain Keppel, please do something.

940
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,200
I didn't say to do this. I don't care.

941
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,500
No! Hey, Kaipan!

942
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,080
What?

943
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,780
What? An incident?

944
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,180
All right, I'll be right there.

945
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,440
See you later.

946
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,420
Hey, I didn't call you.

947
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,320
Don't run away!

948
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,600
Damn it!

949
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:00,740
Captain Keppel!

950
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,820
Take one!

951
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,380
Florence Joyner!

952
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,180
I don't care, but you guys are too old-fashioned.

953
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,420
Let me explain.

954
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,620
Captain Keppel, if you wear this costume, you'll run away faster.

955
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,440
Hey, you're dirty!

956
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,260
You're a dolphin!

957
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,920
You're a dolphin!

958
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,700
Nobody knows!

959
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,600
Nobody knows!

960
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,260
Hey!

961
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,640
Come on!

962
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,620
Let's pay him!

963
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,160
Hehehe.

964
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,140
I don't like the Special Security team!

965
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,560
I don't like the Special Security team!

966
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,840
I hate him!

967
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,100
You say it like that,irrelevant to our company!

968
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:58,320
Eh?

969
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:58,900
Damn it.

970
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,240
Let's get in here.

971
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,960
I Ai-kun will goく!

972
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,140
Do I need to lean this equipment this much?

973
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,720
I'm fine!

974
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,300
Ah, really.

975
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:05,780
Thank you very much.

976
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,040
What a pity.

977
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:07,840
Listen to what I have to say.

978
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,600
I'll pay you later if you get it.

979
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,360
Mr. Kawasaki, your ticket is in a neat way.

980
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:09,940
Say, how was your trip from in Japan?

981
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:10,600
It was great.

982
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:10,820
It's the best in Japan.
