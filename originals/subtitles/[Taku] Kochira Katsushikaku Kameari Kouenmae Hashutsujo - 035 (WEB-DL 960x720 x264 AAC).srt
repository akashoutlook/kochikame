Dad...

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,860
You're so annoying.

30
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,300
Dad, that was Hideo's call.

31
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,780
Yeah. He said he'd call you, so I hung up.

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,100
You're so mean!

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,380
No matter how much you call me, I don't do that often.

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,560
Hideo ran away from America, where he was supposed to go.

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
I don't know about that.

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
Dad...

37
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,240
If Hideo came back from America, there's something important to talk about.

38
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,840
No, no, no, I'm having a cold...

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,720
I'm going to sleep...

40
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,120
Dad!

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,740
Oh my... it's hot.

42
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,700
It must be the cold...

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,780
I like you.

44
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,460
You got a wedding dress, huh?

45
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,540
Hey, Reiko!

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,360
What?

47
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,020
What's wrong, Ryo?

48
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,000
You tore your head.

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,540
Try it on.

50
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,460
Oh.

51
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,440
Show me what you can do!

52
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,060
Oh, you're good at sewing too.

53
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,560
I'm glad to have a wife.

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,880
You were reading this book?

55
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,900
Well, girls like wedding dresses.

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,020
But Ryo, how about you get a wife?

57
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,540
I don't need one. I only want the first one.

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,920
I'm enjoying my life!

59
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,300
But I feel a bit saddened when I see you enjoy your life.

60
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,220
But you're asking if I need a wife.

61
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,160
You're a poor man. Tell us the truth.

62
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,560
Shut up! Let go of me!

63
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,040
Oh, no. No, no.

64
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,420
That's good enough.

65
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,700
Good job, everyone.

66
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,940
I'll go to the library and come back.

67
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,120
I'll leave the rest to you, Nakagawa.

68
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,820
Yes, sir.

69
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,360
Good job.

70
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,080
I'll go home and get some rest.

71
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,140
Good evening.

72
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,760
Hey, Hiromi.

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,480
Long time no see.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,780
What's this?

75
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,060
Did you come to see the chief?

76
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,480
Hello.

77
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,620
Chief?

78
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,700
Chief, where have you been?

79
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,120
Chief!

80
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,300
What's up, chief?

81
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:19,700
You were here?

82
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:19,740
You were here?

83
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,900
Dad, there's something important.

84
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,300
Let's have dinner together.

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,820
No, I still have work to do.

86
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,080
Dad, I can't...

87
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,980
I can't do anything.

88
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,880
I have important work to do.

89
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,400
Chief, you just said you were going home.

90
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,660
I changed my mind.

91
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
What's wrong?

92
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,540
Your daughter is here to pick you up.

93
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,320
I know. You're embarrassed.

94
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,200
You're old, too.

95
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,360
It's because of me.

96
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,360
It's more important for me to have dinner with my boyfriend than to eat with that old man.

97
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,240
You should be happy to see him.

98
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,040
You should be happy to see him invite me to a party.

99
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,760
Dad, I...

100
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,160
Shut up!

101
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,220
I don't care about you!

102
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,980
I'll go to patrol.

103
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,720
Dad...

104
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,020
Hideo...

105
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,560
Hiromi...

106
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,480
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,260
I'm sorry. My father didn't listen to me at all.

108
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,260
I'm out of time.

109
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,380
You've been dating since you were a student?

110
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:30,660
Yes.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,080
Are you proposing to me?

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm happy to propose to you.

113
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,700
So what do you mean you're out of time?

114
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Hideo suddenly changed his mind.

115
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,460
I wanted to talk to you before that.

116
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,800
My father is so stubborn. He doesn't listen to me at all.

117
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,220
Hey, Hideo.

118
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,700
Hey, Yo-chan.

119
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,420
The director is a kid.

120
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,140
It's okay. We'll try to push him.

121
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,400
Thank you.

122
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you.

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,100
I couldn't go to the main gate.

124
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,760
I was so impatient that I couldn't think about my father's feelings.

125
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,700
Impatient?

126
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,820
Are you going to move out that far?

127
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,340
No, I'm going to Hokkaido.

128
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,300
Good. Good food and good beer.

129
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,220
Why are you talking sohausly?

130
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,240
You're not going to play, are you?

131
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,860
Oh, I see. You're going to the capital.

132
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,960
You made a mistake like you had to leave your death certificate.

133
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,300
No, I'm not.

134
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,700
Hideo's company is Hokkaido.

135
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,860
I'm sorry to say this, but I work for a company like this.

136
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,500
Well, then you're an atin.

137
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,300
Please.

138
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,060
It's a computer game software development.

139
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,820
After I joined the company, I've been traveling around the U.S. and Japan.

140
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,040
I thought I'd finally be able to relax, but now I'm in Hokkaido.

141
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,240
I can't do anything for you.

142
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,340
Don't worry about it.

143
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,040
I'm fine.

144
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,280
Even if you can't be with me, I'm very happy.

145
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,900
Hiromi...

146
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,360
Hey! Hey!

147
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,040
Yes?

148
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,140
Your company is developing a game called "Campus Fairy Quest".

149
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,040
Why do you say that?

150
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,140
Because you like games.

151
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,120
There are only a few people who know about it.

152
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Why don't you meet with the manager and give me a project?

153
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
C-Can-Fair?

154
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,260
If you like games...

155
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,500
How about a bug-in version of "Nukupuya-san 2"?

156
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,320
Oh, a bug-in version?

157
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,300
What about "Omunage Police"?

158
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,380
I got it before the reservation.

159
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,780
How?

160
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,020
How about "Angel Hazard"?

161
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,560
I have it, and I cleared it.

162
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,140
What?

163
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,040
Then, what about "Poyo-Yon Super"?

164
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,660
I cleared it and I gave it to someone.

165
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,100
Why?

166
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,940
Well, well...

167
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,740
Then, how about "Tekken Den Memorial Aqua Note Training Festival"?

168
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,260
Oh, that's a good idea.

169
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,180
Okay, leave it to me.

170
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,220
I'll go and meet the manager.

171
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,140
Really?

172
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,240
Yeah.

173
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,840
So, I'm counting on you for the game software.

174
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,800
Yes.

175
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,940
Okay, bye!

176
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,260
Bye!

177
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,580
Hey!

178
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,880
Good news!

179
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,040
Yes, sir!

180
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,820
Run!

181
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,860
Hey, what are you doing?

182
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,520
Please don't bother, Director!

183
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,480
I need to find his mind!

184
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,980
If you don't tell me, you won't be able to listen to me!

185
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,280
What?

186
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,020
Hey, Kakuta! Let go of me!

187
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,560
Father...

188
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,440
No, Mr. Ohara!

189
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,880
I don't know! I don't know! I can't hear anything!

190
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,000
Chief! I'm not a child! Stop it!

191
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,300
I don't know!

192
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,700
Ryotsu!

193
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,120
Mr. Ohara!

194
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,440
Chief!

195
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,760
I don't know! I'll go patrol!

196
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,400
Honda! Don't let him run away!

197
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,160
Yes!

198
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,260
Chief!

199
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,260
Chief!

200
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,140
Mr. Ohara!

201
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,900
Please listen to me!

202
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,640
You're like a child!

203
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,940
Okay, that's what you want!

204
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,040
I did it!

205
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:33,860
Father!

206
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,360
Chief!

207
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,320
Father!

208
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,620
Father!

209
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,160
Father!

210
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,380
Father!

211
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,600
Get him!

212
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,960
Hang in there until the next bus stop!

213
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,420
Stop it! Stop it!

214
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,120
Ohara!

215
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,740
There's no time to waste!

216
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,260
You're suspecting me!

217
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,020
감사호!

218
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,720
Eh...

219
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:21,820
Lady...

220
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,080
So what?

221
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll report you to the police.

222
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,880
I'm very sorry...

223
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,660
This is for you!

224
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:34,880
Thank you.

225
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:34,940
Thank you!

226
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,080
Ms. Ohara!

227
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,380
Since you're going out with this...

228
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:36,420
Can we go?

229
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,540
Let's get out of here!

230
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,220
Chief!

231
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,700
Father!

232
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,700
Listen to me!

233
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,460
Chief, I won't let you go!

234
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,160
How persistent they are!

235
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,920
There!

236
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,760
Ryotsu, it's a net!

237
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,980
It's a flood!

238
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,760
Let's get out of here!

239
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,460
Sendou, go to America!

240
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,780
America?

241
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,340
Remember!

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,960
Action!

243
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,980
That was tough.

244
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,980
I'm sorry about that, Chief.

245
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,980
Here's your tea.

246
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,120
Thank you.

247
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,860
How's Kakuta doing?

248
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,260
He's back at work.

249
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,340
I see.

250
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,880
But he's also very determined to follow me to the end.

251
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
I want to help him somehow.

252
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,980
So what are you going to do from now on, Ryotsu?

253
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,520
Well, I guess I'll have to leave you alone, Chief.

254
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,120
Huh?

255
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,020
I'll do it by myself.

256
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,420
Watch me.

257
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,220
I'll give you a wonderful wedding that will make you feel better.

258
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
Oh, no!

259
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,320
Then we have to go to America!

260
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,060
I'm sorry, Ryotsu.

261
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,540
But you have to stay here with us.

262
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:18,740
Well, I can't go.

263
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,160
But you have to do it for me!

264
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,460
Oh, no, I can't go.

265
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,020
Take me to America!

266
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,340
No, no, no, no, no!

267
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,120
No, no, no, no, no, no!

268
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,560
No, no, no, no, no, no!

269
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,520
No, no, no, no!

270
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,720
Come here!

271
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,280
No, no, no, no!

272
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,480
No, no, no, no, no!

273
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,920
No, no, no, no, no!

274
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,260
I'm sure your father will forgive you.

275
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,520
I'm sorry to say this, but it's so sad to see Hiromi go to get married.

276
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,100
Ryotsu, you're right.

277
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,780
Let's make sure she's ready.

278
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,980
Please continue to talk to her.

279
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,180
Leave it to me.

280
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,480
I'll keep talking to her.

281
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,340
Move!

282
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,340
Oh, no.

283
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,620
You didn't swim in Tokyo Bay, did you?

284
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:00,860
What?

285
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,480
Listen, dear.

286
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,060
What?

287
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,220
It's about Hiromi.

288
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,620
How about you forgive her?

289
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,160
You know Kakuta is a young man who doesn't have a right to ask for permission, right?

290
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,000
No, I don't want to hear that from him.

291
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,620
Then please meet with Kakuta once.

292
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,980
What?

293
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,320
Please meet with him, talk to him, and then decide.

294
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,800
Dear!

295
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,160
If you don't meet with him now, we'll talk about the ceremony on our own.

296
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,480
What? What right?

297
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,620
It's my right!

298
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,900
I'm Hiromi's mother!

299
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,620
Do you think you raised her all by yourself?

300
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,000
No, no, no.

301
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,040
I didn't mean to.

302
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,240
Then please meet with him.

303
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,080
I don't care.

304
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,320
I don't care if you don't know who the horse is.

305
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,880
I don't care if you don't know who the horse is.

306
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,360
I don't care if you don't know who the horse is.

307
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,380
If you want to do it, do it yourself.

308
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,700
Dear!

309
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,500
What a troublesome person.

310
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,920
What right do I have?

311
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,760
Who did you do it for?

312
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,720
Do it yourself.

313
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,560
Hey, is the reservation full?

314
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,080
I want to do it in a week.

315
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:20,860
What?

316
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,480
Forget it!

317
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,500
I'll never ask you again!

318
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,020
Damn it!

319
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,700
Where's the next one?

320
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,840
Hey, you can't use it anymore?

321
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,200
It's perfect.

322
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,920
I didn't know you'd work so hard.

323
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,620
It's true.

324
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,000
If this happens, I'll be in trouble.

325
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,100
I see.

326
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,260
By the way, was he there?

327
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,760
Yes, I'm Asakusa Kamen Kaku.

328
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,060
Are you the president?

329
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,060
Please wait a moment.

330
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,400
Hey, Ryo, long time no see.

331
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,440
Hey, Ryo, long time no see.

332
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,340
Are you going to open the hotel?

333
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,660
Ryo suddenly said that.

334
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:03,660
Ryo suddenly said that.

335
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,920
Is it because you opened it a week ago?

336
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,880
It's okay.

337
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,020
The venue is ready.

338
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,260
But it's still under construction.

339
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,600
What?

340
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,820
February 1st, 4 years ago.

341
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,080
February 1st, 4 years ago.

342
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,620
February 1st, 4 years ago.

343
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,540
Your house is being demolished.

344
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,100
Who was the person who sent you to my house?

345
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,800
Who was the person who sent you to my house?

346
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,480
I can't remember.

347
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,240
I think there's something I need to tell you.

348
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,920
I can't remember.

349
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:27,980
I got it.

350
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,400
I won't tell you.

351
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,860
I'll make a big one like the one in Kinsho-dono.

352
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,320
I'll make you a big one.

353
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,960
I'm counting on you.

354
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,440
How's the party?

355
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,160
It was a little bit awkward.

356
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,600
What? It's a little bit more.

357
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,020
Yaaay!

358
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,860
What are you doing in the middle of work?

359
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,800
It's a pity.

360
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,600
I'm off work right now.

361
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,620
Then go home now!

362
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,300
Chief, I'll tell you before I go home.

363
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,740
I'm going to the wedding, and I'm alone.

364
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,240
I'm counting on you.

365
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,620
You're a beautiful bride.

366
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,360
You're a beautiful bride.

367
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,500
Don't say that!

368
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,420
At least, I'm a little bit happy.

369
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,140
Dad, come to me.

370
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,800
Oh my...

371
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,220
Father!

372
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,420
It's okay, Hiromi.

373
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,280
I'll make it up to you.

374
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
Dad will definitely come.

375
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,840
But...

376
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,980
Don't worry.

377
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,160
You're cute, so it can't be helped.

378
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,320
Honey!

379
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,060
I'm so hot!

380
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,760
Hiromi, call the doctor!

381
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,640
Hiromi!

382
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,680
Yes!

383
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,220
Anyway, warm up today and sleep well.

384
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,060
Okay.

385
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,920
Thank you very much.

386
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,700
Hiromi, you should go to bed.

387
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,320
Tomorrow is an important day.

388
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,340
Can I do it?

389
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,220
Mom, you should rest.

390
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,760
Because it's my fault.

391
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,860
I was worried about you.

392
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,280
Dad didn't sleep well last night.

393
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,920
But you...

394
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,800
Please.

395
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,960
Because I only have today.

396
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,400
Until tomorrow's wedding,

397
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,540
I want to be Ohara's daughter

398
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,340
and your father's child.

399
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,800
Hiromi.

400
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,180
Hiromi!

401
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,380
No!

402
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,940
I won't allow you to get married!

403
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,100
Hiromi!

404
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,560
No!

405
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,760
We don't have time for that.

406
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,580
I mean...

407
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm happy for you.

408
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,580
I'm relieved.

409
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,020
My fever is gone.

410
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,320
Dad?

411
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,100
Thank you very much for your long time.

412
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,380
Today, I am marrying Hideo.

413
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,400
I want to marry you.

414
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,520
I wanted my father to be happy.

415
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,160
But I couldn't.

416
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,400
I wish I could think about my father more.

417
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,280
Hiromi.

418
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,560
It's about time.

419
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,860
Don't worry about your father.

420
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,400
Mother will be back soon after the ceremony.

421
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,600
The ceremony starts at 12.

422
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,640
Hurry up.

423
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,880
Yes.

424
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,100
I'll be back soon.

425
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,300
The chief is not here.

426
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,940
He fell down because of the cold.

427
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,480
Hiromi.

428
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,900
I wish I could think about my father more.

429
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,100
I...

430
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,280
No, I'm cold.

431
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,540
I'll go to bed.

432
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,120
Father.

433
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,320
No.

434
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,160
I still have work to do.

435
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,820
I don't care about how Hiromi feels.

436
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,240
I'll be brave.

437
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,580
Father.

438
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,740
Did you come to pick me up?

439
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,400
Yes.

440
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,340
What will you become when you grow up?

441
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,780
My father's wife.

442
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,960
I see.

443
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,940
Your father's wife.

444
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,980
You want to go to a police school?

445
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,000
No, no.

446
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,560
I can't let you get involved in such a big job.

447
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,720
Go to college.

448
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,600
You have a lover.

449
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,140
Hiromi, you're pretty.

450
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,720
It's about time.

451
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,460
Can you wait just five more minutes?

452
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,500
Father.

453
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,460
Hiromi.

454
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:39,980
Uh.

455
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,820
Hiromi!

456
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,400
Hiromi!

457
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,040
Hiromi!

458
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,140
Hiromi.

459
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,020
Yeah?

460
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,780
Let's do our best to make your father happy.

461
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,380
Yes.

462
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,000
Asakusa!

463
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,580
It's Kame-Unkaku! Hurry up!

464
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,340
I've been dating Kakuta since elementary school.

465
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,080
Since I was a student, I've been with him since I was in high school.

466
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,260
I'm so happy.

467
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,800
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

468
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,380
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

469
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,000
Wait!

470
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,400
Dad!

471
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,660
This is bad!

472
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,380
Stop!

473
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,980
Chief! Where's Okano?

474
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,160
Chief!

475
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,340
Shut up!

476
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,800
Everyone!

477
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,360
I'm the bride's father!

478
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,000
I was against this marriage!

479
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,500
I didn't even think about making Hiromi sad.

480
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,260
I've been avoiding Kakuta.

481
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,080
If my subordinates didn't force me to give him the ceremony,

482
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,140
I would have to starve for the rest of my life.

483
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,240
Thank you for today, everyone.

484
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,440
And Kakuta.

485
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,440
I'm sorry.

486
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,860
Dad...

487
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,460
Hideo!

488
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,340
Hiromi!

489
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,900
Please take care of my daughter.

490
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,040
Y-Yes!

491
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,940
Leave it to me!

492
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,560
I'll take a picture!

493
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,480
Smile!

494
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,980
Okay!

495
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,640
Pose!

496
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,120
What a nice picture!

497
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,860
It was a nice ceremony!

498
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,580
Good!

499
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,360
Let's go there!

500
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,040
Let's go!

501
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,620
Chief!

502
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,020
It's time to go home.

503
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:44,820
Your cold.

504
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,320
What?

505
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,300
I'll have to complete the job.

506
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,360
I got it.

507
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,180
Let's go.

508
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,000
No matter what.

509
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,120
I have to go.

510
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,040
Tang tang!

511
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,260
Tang tang!

512
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,620
Tang tang!

513
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,200
Tang tang!

514
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,000
Tang tang!

515
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,560
Tang tang!

516
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,200
I'm going to chase you home and take back my paper bag that I brought by mistake!

517
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,680
Huh? Why do you have to go out with me to get it back?

518
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,900
Because your photo is in it!

519
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,220
Next time, "Take back Maruhi's photo!"

520
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,240
Thank you for watching!

521
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:51,200
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

522
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,760
Even if it rains today,

523
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,940
Tomorrow won't be sunny

524
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,740
Bye bye, let's wash our hands

525
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,200
Say goodbye to the things you don't like

526
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,800
Oh yeah, live as you like

527
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,220
Live as you like

528
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,800
There's something good

529
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,300
Outside the door

530
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,340
The sun is calling
