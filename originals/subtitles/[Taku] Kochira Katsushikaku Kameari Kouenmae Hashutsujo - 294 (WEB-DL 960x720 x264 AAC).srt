1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,420
Tears in the Modern World

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,220
When you watch the television,

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,620
clear up and separated the room!

4
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,920
People who have no money!

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,660
Come to me!

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,900
I don't have anyone, but I'm worried

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:35,880
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,140
You'll be able to do something somehow

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,940
You'll be able to do something somehow

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,220
Those who have no job, come to me

11
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,460
I don't have one, but don't worry

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,300
Look, it's burning

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,120
Ah, it's burning

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,840
Ah, it's burning

15
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,940
You'll be able to do something somehow

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,560
You know it, right?

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,360
You know it, you know it

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,700
If you know it, then just shut up and follow me

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,460
Huh?

20
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,560
You know me too well

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,380
Ah, what a nice day.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,440
Summer's just around the corner, isn't it?

23
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,080
You're right.

24
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,460
Ah...

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,280
Huh? Ryou's neck's gone.

26
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,000
Ah-ha!

27
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,060
-Yay -Yay

28
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,320
It's dangerous. It's a two-seater.

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,400
You guys!

30
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,120
Look at that!

31
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,160
Ryo-chan, you're fast.

32
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,680
You two, the two-seater is dangerous.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,700
You can't do that.

34
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,580
Yes, yes, I understand.

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,100
It seems like he's not reflecting on himself.

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,460
It's like he's just talking.

37
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,980
Well, it's not the age to be careful.

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,040
Ryo-chan, you're good at understanding things.

39
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,940
I remembered.

40
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,900
I was looking at them.

41
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,940
What?

42
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,920
What are you looking at?

43
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,280
I found it. This is it.

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,320
What is it?

45
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,640
These scars.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,080
It was when I was in junior high school, like them.

47
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,440
Azakusa!

48
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,540
I want to see you, Azakusa!

49
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,880
Krillin, you were here in high school, too?

50
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,880
Yes, we went to Nagoya with my friends.

51
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,840
Yeah, I was.

52
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,280
Let me think about it.

53
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,760
You came for Misa-kun's birthday, didn't you?

54
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,720
I thought he was going to fall.

55
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,480
There.

56
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,220
We have to take a look at this.

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,440
But it's Osaka, so it's gonna take a lot of trains.

58
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,040
If you could make it in Sensoji's Keidai or Hanayashiki, it would be nice.

59
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,900
You're so picky.

60
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,280
Hanayashiki is too small to make a pavilion.

61
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,320
It's not a pavilion, it's a pavilion, dad.

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,100
Shut up!

63
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,080
Whoa! It's on!

64
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,440
Hey, Tonpei, Chikichi, you guys get on too.

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,120
Are you alright, Kankichi?

66
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,080
It's an old man's motorcycle, so it'll be hard to break it.

67
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,160
Hurry up and get on.

68
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,740
Okay.

69
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,840
Can you drive?

70
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Leave it to me.

71
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,680
You're gonna get hurt by a bicycle.

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,420
Let's go!

73
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:26,980
Go!

74
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,480
Easy, easy.

75
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,540
Hey, what are you doing?

76
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,180
I can't.

77
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,020
Can't you stop?

78
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,920
You can't drive like that!

79
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,980
Kankichi, this is bad! Stop!

80
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,220
That's...

81
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,880
What's wrong?

82
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,280
I don't know how to stop.

83
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,680
Stop! Stop!

84
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,840
I don't know how to stop.

85
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,360
Kankichi!

86
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,480
Kankichi!

87
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,800
There's Sumida River ahead!

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,920
You guys, get off the road!

89
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,780
No, no, no!

90
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:25,540
That's the scar from that time.

91
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,440
Did you jump in from here?

92
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,320
So what happened?

93
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,540
The aquesta was aligned with me.

94
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,380
I got into the net of the fishing spot.

95
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,740
If I had not been there, I would have been on the Natti Line.

96
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,560
We wereagnered.

97
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,760
But the man who was younger than us was a nice guy.

98
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,440
Eat.

99
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,720
Due to his despondency, he took us by motorcycle.

100
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,880
And drove around the area with us.

101
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,280
Hey, get me next time!

102
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,060
I'll be the next one!

103
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,180
Huh?

104
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,040
Oh, that's right.

105
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:17,260
Hey, Dad.

106
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,980
Let's buy a color TV.

107
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,860
Color?

108
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:21,740
You idiot!

109
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,060
There's no color TV in Tsukudaniya.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,880
No way!

111
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,840
I bought one for Tsuyoshi and Satoru.

112
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,560
It's already half the class.

113
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,040
The only thing that's left is color.

114
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,160
Huh?

115
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,160
The word "color" that appeared on the edge of the screen at the time

116
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,880
looked very uncomfortable to me.

117
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,860
Hey, Dad.

118
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,840
Shut up!

119
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,440
I don't need color.

120
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,460
If I watch that, I'll have a bad headache.

121
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,440
Tch.

122
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,700
But,

123
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,560
I really wanted to watch this much of the program in color.

124
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,980
What is it?

125
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,220
Well,

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,460
we were in puberty at that time.

127
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,300
It's a legendary program.

128
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,960
We really wanted to watch that in color.

129
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,660
We talked to the electrician's son

130
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,580
and went into the store at night.

131
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,840
Hey, Shinji,

132
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,920
I hope you're okay.

133
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,920
It's okay if you stay quiet.

134
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,120
We go to bed early.

135
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,360
Yes.

136
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,680
Wow!

137
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,540
Shin Pirobont!

138
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,680
It's different from color, isn't it?

139
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,800
Check the channel.

140
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:47,840
Yeah.

141
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,900
This...

142
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,020
Shabu-Shabu-Dabu!

143
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,800
Shabu-Shabu-Dabu!

144
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,400
Hey, wake up.

145
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,100
What's this? It's so late.

146
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,980
There's a strange sound coming from the store.

147
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,360
Could it be...

148
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,080
What? A thief?

149
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,120
I don't know.

150
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,160
Alright!

151
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,260
Someone's here.

152
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,360
It's you.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,160
You bastard!

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,260
Get out of here!

155
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,360
Get out of here!

156
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,560
Get out of here!

157
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:45,360
What's wrong?

158
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,500
Sir, it's a thief!

159
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,420
What?

160
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,100
Wait!

161
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,560
Wait!

162
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,600
He's alive!

163
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,980
He's alive!

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,260
He can't escape anymore!

165
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,800
You're Shinji!

166
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,760
I guess this is the fifth time I've been taken to the workshop.

167
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,280
You've been taken to the workshop five times a year?

168
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,840
How many times have you been taken to the workshop?

169
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,520
15 times?

170
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,760
16 times?

171
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,280
I guess you're right.

172
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,660
It's fine.

173
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,020
I don't mind that.

174
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,860
What else did you do that made you feel bad?

175
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,720
Well,

176
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,620
I guess the thing that left an impression...

177
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,960
Please pay attention to Janet Lin, the figure skater's beautiful performance.

178
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,440
You're glad you bought the color TV, Dad?

179
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,940
Well, well.

180
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,680
Geez.

181
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,000
The Olympics, the Olympics.

182
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,760
They're on TV from morning to night.

183
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,700
Those two are...

184
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,280
It's growing, it's growing!

185
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,300
We did it!

186
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,440
The Japan HINOMARI Air Force has won the Olympics!

187
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,780
As expected, the Sapporo Olympics made us so excited.

188
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,240
Go!

189
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,820
Chikichi!

190
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,000
Chikichi, this way!

191
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:46,960
Wait!

192
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,780
I'll catch you!

193
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,160
Let's go!

194
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,120
Go!

195
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,240
Shoot!

196
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,640
Well, this is just a daily routine.

197
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,640
The only time I couldn't do it was when I imitated the HINOMARI Air Force.

198
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,640
Now, it's done.

199
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,940
It's a wonderful jump.

200
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,100
So cool!

201
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,740
I'm satisfied.

202
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,180
Let's slide now.

203
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,060
Yeah!

204
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,680
Who can fly the farthest?

205
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,740
Let's compete.

206
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,240
The one who wins is the lunch box for three people.

207
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,520
All right.

208
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,380
No.1.

209
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,300
Tompei, here we go!

210
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:33,520
Go!

211
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,640
I failed to land.

212
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,380
I failed to land!

213
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,980
You suck.

214
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,440
It's because you did this.

215
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,460
Now, Kasaya, Kankichi,

216
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,420
I'll aim for the firing line.

217
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,640
Let's have a look!

218
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,600
This is amazing!

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,660
How's that?

220
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:00,880
Sorry.

221
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,860
Oh, that's my faze!

222
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,060
You brought more than enough letztment.

223
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,160
You're very fast.

224
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,120
You can go fast, too.

225
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,500
A few dozen pigs were in a riot in the streets of Asakusa.

226
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,760
This was to be seen.

227
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,400
Of course, it's the police's business,

228
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,440
so the rich is waste for their father.

229
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,560
Don't put people in trouble.

230
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:39,980
I'll be back soon!

231
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,780
I'll be back soon!

232
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,120
It's cold... I'm starving...

233
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,100
Hey, you're being chased again?

234
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,700
Hey!

235
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,040
Thank you, sir!

236
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,220
It's so delicious!

237
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,340
You're so naughty!

238
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,340
You're so naughty!

239
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,500
The End

240
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:11,740
The End

241
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,020
The End

242
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,660
Three people on a motorcycle fell into a river...

243
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,380
The End

244
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,560
They snuck into a store and got mistaken as thieves...

245
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,680
The End

246
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,660
They imitated a jumper and made a piggy run...

247
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,280
The End

248
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,380
I see... Ryo's middle school days were really rough.

249
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,020
I see... Ryo's middle school days were really rough.

250
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,720
By the way, we also did a chicken race on our bikes.

251
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,540
By the way, we also did a chicken race on our bikes.

252
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:35,820
Huh?

253
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,200
The other guys were the bad boys from the middle school next door.

254
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,320
If you want, I can do more.

255
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,100
If you want, I can do more.

256
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,180
I know!

257
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,860
I get what you mean!

258
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,980
Make sure you get everything you want, okay?

259
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,380
Please do, Kankichi.

260
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,540
The technological revolution is so important.

261
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,320
I know. Just leave it to me!

262
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,320
Then, let's start.

263
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,360
It's easier to slam the brakes than to run.

264
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,740
It's easier to slam the brakes than to run.

265
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,960
Ready?

266
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,220
Ready?

267
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,160
Start!

268
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:06,900
Go!

269
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:39,800
Ah!

270
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,580
Kankichi!

271
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,640
Kankichi! Are you okay?

272
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,220
Hehehe!

273
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,260
I was in trouble at that time.

274
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,180
That's not the problem.

275
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,140
You have to laugh.

276
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,860
Yes, yes. There are others.

277
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,100
Are there more?

278
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,280
I'm afraid to ask.

279
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,600
Many of our school students are quiet.

280
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,540
They were targeted by the bad students everywhere.

281
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,540
One day, I found my students who were involved in them.

282
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,960
You're amazing!

283
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,360
You bastard!

284
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,740
Now, let's get out of here!

285
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,080
Yeah.

286
00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,940
You bastard!

287
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,780
Hey, you again!

288
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,320
Ah!

289
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,700
Hehehehehehe

290
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:13,800
Ouch!

291
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,620
Damn, you made me get hurt!

292
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,580
You're overdoing it because you're so energetic!

293
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,260
But, but...

294
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,000
Not but!

295
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,220
It hurts! It's not a woodpecker! Stop it!

296
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,920
I can't tell by your mouth!

297
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:28,940
Ouch!

298
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,100
I'll entrust you to Gokurakuji and be a boy!

299
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,760
Ouch, ouch, ouch! I hate boys!

300
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,760
Haha, well, well. There were only three of us.

301
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,900
That's right! It's three against one!

302
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,580
E-V-E-R-U-L-E-Y!

303
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,500
Hmm...

304
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,720
Hey, Kankichi-kun, do you know that short-term is a loss-time?

305
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,160
Short-term is a loss-time?

306
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,700
When you get short-term, you make a huge loss.

307
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,940
Even if you fight, it's not for the best, right?

308
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,700
But, I can't run away!

309
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,000
However, I think that's too much to say.

310
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,740
It's too late.

311
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:04,920
I had a weight of a thousand times.

312
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,440
What do you mean?

313
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,120
He was aiming to become a champion.

314
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,220
A champion?

315
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,520
Huh? He was boxing?

316
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,960
Well, yeah.

317
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,000
He made his debut in high school, and won all five championships.

318
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,800
He was being expected to be the champion.

319
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,200
But, he was still a rookie in the East Japan final.

320
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,540
Oh...

321
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,560
He was forced to fight 5 guys during the night running.

322
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,720
Ouch!

323
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,300
Ouch!

324
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,520
Ouch!

325
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,380
Ouch!

326
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,060
Ouch!

327
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,120
Ouch!

328
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,760
Ouch!

329
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,440
Ouch!

330
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,180
Ouch!

331
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,060
Ouch!

332
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,600
Ouch!

333
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,340
Ouch!

334
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,000
Ouch!

335
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,500
Ouch!

336
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,940
Ouch!

337
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,180
Ouch!

338
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,380
Ouch!

339
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:11,540
Ouch!

340
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,040
Ouch!

341
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,540
Ouch!

342
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,000
Ouch!

343
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,140
Ouch!

344
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,220
Ouch!

345
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,280
Ouch!

346
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:14,620
Ouch!

347
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,540
Ouch!

348
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:15,940
Ouch!

349
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,360
Ouch!

350
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,460
Ouch...

351
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,360
At that time, if I had a little more distinction, I would have escaped.

352
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,080
I realized that was the right decision after becoming a police officer.

353
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,120
I understand. I will never fight again. I promise.

354
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,080
I see. You said it well, Kankichi-kun.

355
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,520
Yeah.

356
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
- Kankichi was bununjiru.

357
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,300
You were at fault.

358
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,300
- Kankichi Kunt Gaupen The

359
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,920
Please don't say gently angry.

360
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:14,880
- Kankichi Kunt Gaupen Don't you enjoy volume

361
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,880
OK, I understand.

362
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,820
Let's go together.

363
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,580
- Kankichi Kunt Gaupen

364
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,340
- Kankichi Kunt Gaupen

365
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:23,440
- Kankichi Kunt Gaupen

366
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,820
Kichi-kun...

367
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,760
I promised I wouldn't fight!

368
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,820
You're so stubborn!

369
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,000
Get out of my way! I'll forgive you if you do!

370
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,900
Get... out of my way?

371
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,780
What are you guys doing?

372
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,580
Crap! Run!

373
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,440
Damn it! This guy's so lucky!

374
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,620
Kichi-kun!

375
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,340
Is something wrong?

376
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,520
It's nothing!

377
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,300
You've put up with it, haven't you?

378
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,900
Well, at least at that time. But...

379
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,640
What did you say?

380
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,580
Tonpei Chinkichi...

381
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,020
Yeah, I said if you want to help, come to the river!

382
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,460
Damn it! They're not just me, but two of them!

383
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,440
I'm counting on you, Shinji!

384
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,140
If Kankichi doesn't come, I'll throw him into the river!

385
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,720
Kankichi will come for sure!

386
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,580
That's right!

387
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,780
What do you think of that waist?

388
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,660
Kankichi is not a waist!

389
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,910
Hey, I... I'm sorry for breaking the promise...

390
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,340
Kankichi!

391
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:16,340
You're good!

392
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,000
As expected of Kankichi!

393
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,460
He's not a waist!

394
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,240
I'm not a waist!

395
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,720
I'm not a waist!

396
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,340
I'm not a waist!

397
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,080
I'm not a waist!

398
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,580
I'm not a waist!

399
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,780
Damn it! Where are you, Kankichi?

400
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,280
Show us your true form, you slug!

401
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,420
Who's a slug?!

402
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,560
Kankichi!

403
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,940
You bastard!

404
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,120
Kankichi!

405
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,940
You slug!

406
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:59,820
Where are you going, you moron!

407
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:11,540
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

408
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:20,100
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

409
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,600
He's been going around in a terrible way.

410
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,640
Tatsumaki, huh.

411
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,340
I see.

412
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,320
You're Tatsumaki, right?

413
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,320
Y-Yeah.

414
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,260
Right?

415
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,480
Y-Yeah!

416
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,840
Then, I'll have to go back and write a report.

417
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,640
Men have times when they have to do something.

418
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,960
But, you have to do it in moderation.

419
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,840
Yes!

420
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,880
That's how I learned to be patient.

421
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,440
Patience?

422
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,600
From your seniors?

423
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,020
No, that's not the most appropriate word for Ryo-chan!

424
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,860
What are you talking about?

425
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,480
Even if the chief gets angry, he's still patient, isn't he?

426
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,780
Hey, they're here again!

427
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,620
Hey, you two, get in the car!

428
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,000
I told you, you can't do this!

429
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,800
You're always like that!

430
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,240
You're always so noisy!

431
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,260
What are you doing?

432
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,580
What's with the patience?

433
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,980
You're getting angry right away.

434
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,460
Wait!

435
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,300
Wait, you!

436
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,060
You!

437
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,540
You!

438
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,420
You!

439
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,420
You!

440
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,340
You!

441
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,620
You!

442
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,280
You!

443
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,560
You!

444
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,580
You!

445
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:40,760
You!

446
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:46,800
You!

447
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,480
Why are you doing this?

448
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,600
I told you, you two are in danger!

449
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,640
You!

450
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,180
Sorry!

451
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,900
I'm so sorry!

452
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,660
I'm so sorry!

453
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Welcome!

454
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,080
Welcome!

455
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,260
Welcome!

456
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,200
Welcome!

457
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,300
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

458
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:20,680
Welcome!

459
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,720
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

460
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,060
Excuse me, may I?

461
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,620
Welcome!

462
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,400
A little roll, a little roll, a little roll, a little roll,

463
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,100
I wonder what to do with any roll?

464
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,440
That's right, do you have a California roll?

465
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,260
California roll is not available.

466
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,260
This is not America.

467
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,420
Excuse me, sir.

468
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,800
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

469
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,960
Welcome!

470
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,720
Please, I'll have a kushigaki, a kakiage, a katsuage,

471
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,280
What would you like?

472
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,480
What do you recommend?

473
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,560
Take care of the katsuage,

474
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,640
Huh? Is that a gag?

475
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,080
Yes, you too.

476
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,440
I don't understand.

477
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,860
Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Really?

478
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,460
Welcome! Welcome!

479
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,100
Welcome!

480
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:12,800
Welcome!

481
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,540
Welcome!

482
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,200
Welcome!

483
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,860
Welcome!

484
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,520
Please!

485
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,240
Welcome!

486
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,400
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! You're welcome to this room!

487
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:34,360
Ryoutsu, Tamekichi, are you my late grandfather?!

488
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,720
Why are you here?

489
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,560
Are you drunk and coming to earth from heaven?

490
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,600
Do people really come back if they're drunk?!

491
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,520
Next episode: Good afternoon, Master Gosen!

492
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,820
Thanks for watching!

493
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,740
Kameari

494
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,120
Ah, I'm sure it's Kameari

495
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,760
Everyone, come to our town

496
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,880
Thank you!
