CAPTIONS PREVIEW

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,220
Granny, what are you doing here?

20
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,480
Knifes, pressing and holding a ruler.

21
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,740
Shh, wait a sec.

22
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,280
You never take any.

23
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,100
-You mean Kanchi? -Yeah, I've been waiting for this.

24
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,760
"Choukanda Sushi"

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,620
"Norenwake Taiketsu"

26
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,320
Ehhhhh! What's going on!

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,700
K-Kankichi, don't show your feelings!

28
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,060
U-um... I'm sorry.

29
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,540
Your skill as a sushi chef is at its peak.

30
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,100
Why don't you take over the shop?

31
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,680
U-um...

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,060
Don't make a loud noise!

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,560
U-um...

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,040
So, which shop is it?

35
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,500
It's a shop inside the Sky Tower that Nakagawa-san's company completed this month.

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,740
Huh? The world's largest high-rise building that will open next month?

37
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,900
Yes. With Nakagawa-san's support, we decided to open as tenants.

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,840
I see. A private store. Amazing!

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,080
It's my shop!

40
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,740
I can't believe you have a private store!

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,940
The rights to the store will all be mine.

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,600
That's a promise, too.

43
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,940
It's a very specific one.

44
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,280
There are certain conditions.

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,940
Huh? What are they?

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,220
The condition is that Nakagawa-san will take over the store.

47
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,420
All fish and seafood will be given an IC tag.

48
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,540
The production, freshness, price, and quality will be managed by Nakagawa-san.

49
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,620
The management will be in charge of the management, and the sushi will be eaten without any worries.

50
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,660
So, it's a high-tech sushi.

51
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,960
That's what Kankichi is good at.

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,320
It's not a private store. It's an independent store that can't be used.

53
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,100
Do it well!

54
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,040
Even if I have a shop, the operating budget is not even a single yen...

55
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
I'll leave it at 10 million yen for free.

56
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,320
What?

57
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,700
I'll return it in three years.

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Yay! As expected of Gepard!

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,200
I'll make it my favorite shop!

60
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,860
Grandma, are you sure you want to leave it to Kankichi?

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,980
Don't worry. I have the talent to make money.

62
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,340
But if it's for making money, you have to lower the quality.

63
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,200
There's an IC tag there, so it's fine.

64
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,440
I'm looking forward to it! It's my store!

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,440
Manager?

66
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,940
What's with that surprised face?

67
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,300
You guys are bothering me because I'm the manager?

68
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:19,400
No, not really. But that store is a very important store for Nakagawa Group...

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,960
Nakagawa! How about I own that important store?

70
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,960
R-Ryo-chan is worried about lowering the quality to make money.

71
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,100
Gepard and Matoe told me the same thing.

72
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,180
Why don't you all trust me?

73
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,240
You told me that you want to fill in the IC tag and look up the operating data.

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,820
I see.

75
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,700
That's a good idea. Let's do it.

76
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,080
But Ryo-chan, what are you going to do about the police?

77
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,180
Of course!

78
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,680
Are you going to quit?

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,760
Of course!

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,040
We're going to aim for the best sushi restaurant in Japan...

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,320
No, the best sushi restaurant in the world!

82
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,040
You guys should come and eat!

83
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,220
I'm going to go now.

84
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,280
I'm going to go now!

85
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,440
Huh?

86
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,400
Bro!

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,360
It's been a while, Matoi.

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,960
What's wrong, all of a sudden?

89
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,560
Don't be happy, Matoi. We just finished our training in Kyoto and we're back.

90
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,420
Yuzu, hold on to the orange.

91
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,440
Come on, orange. Come on.

92
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,680
It's expensive.

93
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,500
So we're going to live together for the first time in years.

94
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,320
Yeah. This will give us a chance to catch some fish.

95
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,800
Grandma, Bro is back.

96
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,560
So we should leave the Sky Tower to Bro, not Kankichi.

97
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,840
We were just talking about that.

98
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,480
If we could have Yuzu do it, we wouldn't have to.

99
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,800
But, you know, we told him we'd leave it to Kankichi.

100
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,460
Oh, right.

101
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,640
That idiot made a mistake.

102
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,660
Lemon sent an e-mail.

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,900
He said, "Please give us some advice."

104
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
So we're going to leave the Sky Tower.

105
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,960
We have no choice.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,940
What are we doing here?

107
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,280
What?

108
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,560
You guys are not following your promise!

109
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,340
We're going to leave the Sky Tower!

110
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,040
You can't leave it to us.

111
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,160
We're not going to leave it to you.

112
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,040
Huh?

113
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,360
What?

114
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,600
We can't afford to leave the Sky Tower.

115
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,760
We want to do our best.

116
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,460
Let's open two stores.

117
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,640
What? Two stores?

118
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,100
We'll split it into two stores.

119
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,920
The Sky Tower grand opening is next month.

120
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,400
Until then, we'll open for a week.

121
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,020
We'll leave the store to the one who makes the most money out of the two.

122
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,240
I don't mind.

123
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,740
But Kankichi...

124
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,780
I don't care what you do.

125
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,740
My future depends on you.

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,600
You have to accept it.

127
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,040
I've been training in Kyoto.

128
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,900
I'll fight with all my might.

129
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,760
I'll help you, too.

130
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,620
I'll win.

131
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm going to fight against him one day!

132
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,020
I put a sign up on my account in advance.

133
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,960
So the customers are line up.

134
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,580
You're so energetic.

135
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,120
What about Kankichi?

136
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
Kankichi, are you okay with two people?

137
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,620
The purchase is managed by Nagagawa Water.

138
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,800
I can't cut it.

139
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,660
I have to save the human rights.

140
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,500
I see.

141
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,420
But you look like an amateur.

142
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,060
That's right.

143
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,920
I was taken a week off and I paid 1,000 yen for the day.

144
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't you think it's terrible?

145
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,320
Don't say that.

146
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,500
I promised you that I would give you sushi for the rest of your life.

147
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,540
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

148
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,940
Welcome!

149
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,140
Welcome!

150
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,980
Today, we will give you a special service.

151
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,420
We'll give you a special rice ball and a flyer.

152
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,580
And we'll give you a discount of 500 yen.

153
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,960
It's that cheap?

154
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,640
That's crazy!

155
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,100
500 yen?

156
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,080
That's half of our price.

157
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,880
Don't worry.

158
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,040
500 yen is not a big deal.

159
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,120
We'll just keep going.

160
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,600
A special flyer.

161
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,800
A special flyer.

162
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,060
I'm back.

163
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm back.

164
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,180
I'm going to the bathroom.

165
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,380
Leave it to me.

166
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,560
I'll do it.

167
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,500
I'll do it.

168
00:08:59,500 --> 00:08:59,900
I'll give you a flyer.

169
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,140
I'll give you this.

170
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,800
I'll give you a flyer.

171
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,100
The price is right.

172
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,760
I got it.

173
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,920
Who comes to play with me?

174
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,600
This guy.

175
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,920
I know who it is.

176
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,320
Thank you so much.

177
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,780
Thanks.

178
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,920
That's a big plank.

179
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,200
Thank you for the service.

180
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,060
What?

181
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,120
You idiot!

182
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,140
I'm not cooking a picnic lunch.

183
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,600
Sayori, we're waiting for you.

184
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,280
This is Kohada.

185
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,500
He's really good, but he hasn't washed his hands yet.

186
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,880
Don't worry, it'll be clean in a few minutes.

187
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,400
Huh?

188
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,080
Ah, it's a foreigner.

189
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,120
I can't speak English at all.

190
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,180
Is this a sushi bar?

191
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,340
It doesn't matter. We have customers.

192
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,960
Do something about it!

193
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:51,980
Just a little bit.

194
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,260
Please...

195
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,940
What's wrong?

196
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,680
I don't understand English at all, so I went to the next door.

197
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,320
I see.

198
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,520
You have to get foreign customers from the place.

199
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,640
Is this a sushi bar?

200
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,500
It's a foreigner.

201
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,840
Bro, I can't speak English.

202
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,900
Don't worry.

203
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,560
There were a lot of foreign tourists in the Kyoto Ryotei.

204
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,100
Yes! Sushi bar! Sushi bar!

205
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,960
Please sit down!

206
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,120
Oh...

207
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,000
Please, please! Japanese tea, please!

208
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,260
What?

209
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,700
What? Same profit?

210
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,780
We make overwhelmingly more profit in Kankichi, but the profit was small.

211
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,620
Damn, I've gone to all the foreign customers in the room.

212
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,620
Huh?

213
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,860
Dis swatр

214
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,280
Honda, master all of them by tomorrow.

215
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,880
Yase-senpai, I can't.

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,820
I make sushi that satisfies foreign customers.

217
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,260
I'll think about it.

218
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,340
We made this tonight. A menu for the foreign guests.

219
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,060
You mean by that, I'll just have the pictures taken and you'll know, right?

220
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,680
Yeah.

221
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,880
Good afternoon.

222
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,340
Please, please.

223
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,400
- Welcome. - Welcome.

224
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,920
Here you go.

225
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,300
I wonder which country he's from.

226
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,780
Maybe he knows English.

227
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:31,880
Indian.

228
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,860
I wonder if there's any sushi that's Indian.

229
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,360
Don't worry. I've prepared it for that.

230
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Hey, wait.

231
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,760
Curry sushi made with dry curry.

232
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,040
Oh! Very, very good!

233
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,960
He he, I did it!

234
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,480
Oh, it's refreshing.

235
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,860
I don't know what refreshing is.

236
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,100
It's okay.

237
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,140
It's said that it's good to enjoy the refreshingness of the dried bonito with snacks.

238
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,720
He he, I'll try it then.

239
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,520
No, let's go with the Italian style dried bonito carpaccio.

240
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
What? You can do that?

241
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,120
No problem.

242
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,940
I've made it in Kyoto.

243
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,060
Hey, wait.

244
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,660
Oh, delicious!

245
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,380
Gyo Gyo Gyo!

246
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,200
Gyo Gyo Gyo!

247
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,500
Gyo Gyo Gyo!

248
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,200
What? You said you lost a little?

249
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,460
If it's a sale, I'm completely winning.

250
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,500
It's true that there are many, but the cost of materials is double.

251
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,420
There are too many made in Kankichi.

252
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,080
Hmm, if this happens, I'll make a more impactful store.

253
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,440
Matoi, we have a lot of customers in our store, but no repeater at all.

254
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,600
R, right.

255
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:57,780
That's right.

256
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,460
Everyone is the first customer.

257
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,820
Is it just because it's rare?

258
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,120
Yes.

259
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,960
The customers will be sold out.

260
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,800
It's a store that makes me want to come again.

261
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,640
Okay, let's go back.

262
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,600
Wada, let's attack with the atmosphere of Japan.

263
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,280
Hmm, you're coming.

264
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,320
I'll wear a kimono.

265
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,320
Yes, let's do that.

266
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,380
Oh, no, I won't lose either!

267
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,360
Really, he is a noisy man.

268
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,700
Oh, of course!

269
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,280
Okay, I'll shoot at the base

270
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:42,840
The offensive rate is low.

271
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,660
I'll let him be.

272
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:52,300
Well, he's a little of a man.

273
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,600
Let's go carefully.

274
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,980
What is this?

275
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,180
What is this fuss?

276
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,960
Don't push it! Don't push it!

277
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,160
Buy the ball properly and then hit it.

278
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,500
Where is this called a sushi shop?

279
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,680
Hey, look closely!

280
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,180
I did it! I got a big tuna!

281
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,640
Congratulations!

282
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,660
Here, a big tuna.

283
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,380
I did it! It's a sea!

284
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,800
I got a sea too!

285
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,200
Hey, congratulations!

286
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,420
It's a slope again.

287
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,220
I want to eat a tuna.

288
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,280
Hurry up when you finish.

289
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,260
You can use it later.

290
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,600
How about this?

291
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,920
If you're a good customer, you can be full with 100 yen.

292
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,340
Well, there's no such customer.

293
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,940
It's like Kankichi, but do something about the noisy music.

294
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,580
I got it. I got it.

295
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,360
Even so, it's a great customer.

296
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,840
Hey, the tuna won't come out.

297
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,780
Ah, I got it.

298
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,180
Hey, I got it.

299
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,040
This is a sea!

300
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,640
It's a sea!

301
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,880
Kampuchi, it's a sea!

302
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,600
A tuna, red sea bream, huge tuna, all in one.

303
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,520
Hey, Kampuchi. Congratulations.

304
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,900
Senpai, look at this.

305
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,260
Huge tuna sea.

306
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,140
It's all over the place.

307
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,080
What's up?

308
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,720
It's gone?

309
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,000
The people who are selling this place ate it all.

310
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,960
Who's selling it?

311
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,540
It's still the sea, the sea and the green onion and the tuna.

312
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:19,820
Not yet.

313
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,620
Hey, you're the Pachi Pro on the Pachinko magazine!

314
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,620
Hurry up!

315
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,240
I'm back!

316
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,920
I'm out of ideas and ideas!

317
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,380
I ate it, I ate it!

318
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,660
It's an Amaridama present. I'll come again tomorrow.

319
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,220
Senpai, if you come tomorrow, we'll be in trouble!

320
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,460
I'm in trouble.

321
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,020
I'm not going to eat Pachi Sushi!

322
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,800
Wait a minute, sir.

323
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,280
They're trying to start something again.

324
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,540
Headmai Sushi Get Racing!

325
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,460
Explain the rules!

326
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,000
Pull out the sushi you want to eat!

327
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,560
Let's start!

328
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,640
All right, I'll aim for the expensive ones!

329
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,800
It crashed!

330
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,080
Game Over!

331
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,360
Now I'm the best!

332
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,020
You know, F1 racers have a difficult course.

333
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,180
How many times are they set at 95,000 steps?

334
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:24,520
I don't manage sushi.

335
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,940
Nacağım!

336
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,900
Damn you, Guts!

337
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,980
This can't be happening!

338
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,940
Come on!

339
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,160
Wait a minute, Guts!

340
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,780
It's the Egg and....

341
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,660
It's the Egg and....

342
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,800
I can't keep up!

343
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,900
I can't keep up!

344
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,560
It's the Egg and....

345
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,160
I can't keep up!

346
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,200
I can't keep up!

347
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,980
So fast!

348
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,720
But I'm a pro in this world too!

349
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,360
I can't afford to lose!

350
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,140
That's a great run!

351
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,600
Is he going to dance?

352
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,880
What a technique! Amazing!

353
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,760
As expected of Otaro.

354
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,000
He doesn't seem to be a one-man team.

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,820
He's not really a pro.

356
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,960
But you're too confident in your own story.

357
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,460
Otaro is too heavy!

358
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,520
If you're as light as me, you'll be able to get through!

359
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,500
I won! I can't lose!

360
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,120
Otaro, get!

361
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,860
It's a legend! This guy's a legend!

362
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,900
Thanks for the dream!

363
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,620
Wait, this isn't a sushi restaurant!

364
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,240
Not again, Otaro!

365
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,620
Wait, guys! Get!

366
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,640
It's a bad game!

367
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,980
Senpai, you're out of your mind again.

368
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,160
No way!

369
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,340
Hey, who are you?

370
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,660
I'm Shono Gotsudo.

371
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,640
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow.

372
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,660
It's the F-1 driver's shoe!

373
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:08,940
Right?

374
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,200
Why is the real F-1 driver's shoe coming?

375
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,940
I quit this too!

376
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,420
The fifth day has made a big difference.

377
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,360
If this continues, the store will be in a gloom.

378
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,120
No, there's still two days left!

379
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,460
I'll show you a real gloom!

380
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,440
Senpai, just the renovation fee for the store alone...

381
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,940
But I'm out of 100 million yen of operating funds.

382
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,840
All the fish and fish I've ever eaten are in the fridge.

383
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,260
I can't win against Yutsu-san's store.

384
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,280
In this case, I'll have to use a real hand.

385
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,720
A real hand?

386
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,740
What are you going to do about it, Senpai?

387
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,320
What are you going to do about it, Senpai?

388
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm going to leave only the tail tag with the IC tag on it and sell it later!

389
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,420
I'm going to leave only the tail tag with the IC tag on it and sell it later!

390
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,740
If I do that, I can't hold on to sushi.

391
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,240
I'll buy you cheap fish with the money I sold you.

392
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,080
What's going on?

393
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,120
What? 300 yen?

394
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,360
It's even cheaper than the service on the first day.

395
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,960
Kankichi's going to be burned to death!

396
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,220
Tomorrow will be a comeback home run!

397
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,140
What do you expect from me?

398
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,340
Um...

399
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,600
I'll call you when I leave.

400
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,560
Okay!

401
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,220
Okay!

402
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,400
What's wrong, Yutsu!

403
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,060
Ready now!

404
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,280
One, two!

405
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,700
Three!

406
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,480
They came to the survey room, and they came to the end of the session!

407
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,080
What?

408
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,720
Of course.

409
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:03,760
Hey, it's only 1:00.

410
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,400
Well...

411
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,680
Hmm...

412
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,560
Grandma, what do you think?

413
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,020
The profit is exactly the same as both.

414
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,960
That's ridiculous!

415
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,880
Damn it! I was winning because the customers were still there for 5 minutes!

416
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,780
You're cheating! You can't make a profit with 300 yen!

417
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,460
I'm not kidding! I'm using the IC tag of all fish from Nagagawa!

418
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,200
Then show me the remaining fish!

419
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,400
Too bad. I've cut all the fish.

420
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,540
What's with these tuna? Aren't they flounder?

421
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,260
Flounder? They're supposed to be real tuna.

422
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,440
You're right, Lemon. I think it's because of the heat.

423
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,280
That's not true.

424
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,500
Kankichi, bring me the bones of the fish you've cut.

425
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,900
What's that?

426
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,460
Honda-san, bring it to me.

427
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,560
Okay...

428
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,880
Look! It's got the IC tag, right?

429
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,640
It's a fish, as I thought!

430
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,420
You're stupid!

431
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,420
Kankichi, what's this?

432
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,000
It's a fish, as I thought!

433
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,500
But it has a tail.

434
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,340
Eww!

435
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,180
It's suspicious. Show me.

436
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,320
It's a glue!

437
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,340
You idiot! I told you not to make such a mistake!

438
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,780
I knew it.

439
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,720
It seems like it was a game.

440
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,680
I'll have you pay back 10 million yen.

441
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,080
No way! I worked so hard!

442
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,540
Ah, Nagagawa-san! Reiko-san!

443
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Good evening. I was just worried about the game and came here.

444
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,580
Matoi-chan, what happened?

445
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,480
Kankichi cheated and the older brother won.

446
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,320
Yuu-san, congratulations!

447
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,360
Thank you.

448
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,540
Give it to me.

449
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,580
Let's celebrate the new manager, Yuu-san!

450
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,260
Kankichi, Batu-chan, grab the sushi!

451
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,400
Yes, yes.

452
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,000
Everyone, please eat more.

453
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,780
Mmm, it's really good!

454
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,540
Yuu-san, you can do this as a representative of Japan.

455
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,940
Thank you very much.

456
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,040
Kankichi, are you still eating?

457
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,840
The sushi is ready.

458
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,560
Here, take it.

459
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,520
OK.

460
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,400
Here, Kobachiro.

461
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,100
Let's eat!

462
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,220
It's good!

463
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,660
Mmm, it's good!

464
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,460
The thickness of the fish, the texture of the sushi, and the texture of the sushi.

465
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,340
It's perfect no matter which one you eat!

466
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,960
What?

467
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,020
It's better than the sushi I ate.

468
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,300
I lost.

469
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,760
Your sushi is really good!

470
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,820
It's really good.

471
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,060
You're good, Ryo-chan.

472
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,700
Grandma, I'm going to Kyoto again to do my training.

473
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,240
Then, everyone, good luck.

474
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,240
Brother!

475
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,640
Yuu-san!

476
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,240
Yuu-san!

477
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,080
I went there again.

478
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,600
Damn it.

479
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,380
If you do it normally, you'll win.

480
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,820
Wait.

481
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,600
If Yuu-san is gone, I'll be the manager.

482
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,020
You can't say that!

483
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,880
I'll return the Yuu-san that I returned years ago to Kyoto.

484
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,960
What?

485
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,320
Why is this always like this?

486
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,580
"Yuu-san, I'm going to Kyoto again."

487
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,140
"Yuu-san, I'm going to Kyoto."

488
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:55,580
"Yuu-san, I'm going to Kyoto."

489
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,480
"Yuu-san, will you do it?"

490
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,120
While I walked with a look back.

491
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,140
I was drawn to the lamp.

492
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:10,720
I felt a strange feeling at that time.

493
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,340
I walked on the black side of the Akeidogai

494
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:30,020
I was a child once, but everyone forgot

495
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,180
A politician with a great face

496
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,000
A blue aunt above my eyes

497
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,280
Look at that corner

498
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,980
I can see everyone

499
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,240
There is a wall

500
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,740
There must be a wall

501
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,700
Come to our town

502
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,560
There is a wall

503
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,980
There must be a wall

504
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,640
There must be a wall

505
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,820
Come to our town

506
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,000
Thank you!

507
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,580
A great person wants to see the flowers?

508
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,400
And it's a legendary cherry blossom that has been blooming all year round?

509
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,860
Is that really true?

510
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,840
I can't help it. Leave it to me, the head of the Katsushika-cho flower viewing club.

511
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,860
Next time, "Sakura's Big Change."

512
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,120
"Heisei Romance and the Cherry Blossom Storm."

513
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,960
See you in summer.

514
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,180
Don't forget to subscribe.

515
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,760
Next time, "The Lest Santa Claus Has Gone."

516
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,140
See you.

517
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,140
Thank you for watching!
