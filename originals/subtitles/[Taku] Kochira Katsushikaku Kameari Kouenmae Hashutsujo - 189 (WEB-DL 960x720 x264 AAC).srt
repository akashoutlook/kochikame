1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,740
I don't believe in hell

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,920
when you're watching TV,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,780
how about you try and

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,300
make this room your own?

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,800
This cloudy evening,

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,080
like someone's calling me,

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,500
I walked while looking back at the day after the rain

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,180
"Mom, please hold my hand"

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,300
I felt a strange feeling at that time

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,200
So I walked only in the dark place of the Akegogai Tile

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,280
Everyone was a child once, but everyone is forgetting

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,720
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above their eyes

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,120
Turn around and look at that corner

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,800
You can meet everyone

15
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,520
There is a wall over there

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,440
There must be a turtle

17
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,520
Everyone, come to our town

18
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,660
Thank you!

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,240
Bonus Battle

20
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,200
Fight!

21
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,140
This is...

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,060
The first CI castle!

23
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,820
It's a treasure in the Hot Dog Gang!

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,060
And it's...

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,920
A box with a beautiful item!

26
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,460
I didn't know there was such a thing in this store!

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,920
A friend's toy closed the store

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,100
I was able to get the item there

29
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,820
It was in there

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,700
How much is it?

31
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,880
I don't intend to sell it

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,640
I'll display it in the store

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,040
Please! Sell it!

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,120
Well, if you insist...

35
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,840
Is it like this?

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,720
It's too expensive!

37
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,260
At least...

38
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,020
It's like this, right?

39
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,000
Then, how about this?

40
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,400
A little more!

41
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,020
Then, like this!

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,520
I won't buy anything more than this!

43
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,440
Alright! I bought it!

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,360
Thank you!

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,520
Hm?

46
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,140
What's this hand for?

47
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,800
It's not "what", it's a coin!

48
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,620
Unfortunately, I don't have any money

49
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,440
I'll pay later

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,080
We're a cash transaction

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,720
I said I'll pay later!

52
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,360
Can I trust you?

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,140
I can't!

54
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,320
You don't have to be so honest

55
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,440
I'm wondering how much you've been through so far

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,820
I didn't know that

57
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,600
I had a lot!

58
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,440
It's not just me!

59
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,020
We have a bar, a bar, a bar, a bar, a bar, a bar!

60
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,240
How much do you think we, the people of the shopping street, have suffered?

61
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,680
I knew it wouldn't sell

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,100
Please! Sell it!

63
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,900
I'll pay later!

64
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,580
If you don't have any money, leave the store

65
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,380
It's a bonus soon!

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,500
Then I'll pay!

67
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,260
I heard there's someone who likes this kind of thing around the 3rd store

68
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Please! I'll pay for real!

69
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,860
This time for sure!

70
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
You say that every year

71
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,440
This year is for real!

72
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,380
Look at my eyes!

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,160
It's cloudy

74
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,440
Please, Bram!

75
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,280
Promise me!

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,840
I'll make sure to pay for sure!

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,780
That's not a promise

78
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,440
It's a pledge!

79
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,900
I'll write anything in the contract!

80
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,940
Then, let's sign this.

81
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,420
What is this?

82
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
It's like a contract.

83
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,420
Come on, sign here.

84
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,820
I got it!

85
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,760
Don't forget the coin.

86
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,940
I did it! I finally got it!

87
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,140
Thank you!

88
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,320
I did it!

89
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,980
Please, Dad.

90
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,560
Oh, Ryo-san, how are you?

91
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,240
I got a nice figure.

92
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,460
I'm going to give it to you as a blessing tonight.

93
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,800
That's good.

94
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,960
Well, then, see you later.

95
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,100
See you later.

96
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,340
Hey, Ryo-san, I haven't paid the bill yet.

97
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,640
It's a bonus.

98
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,800
I'll pay you with a bonus.

99
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,480
I'm always fooled by those words.

100
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,120
If you really want to get it,

101
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,600
let's ask him to sign it.

102
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,560
It's cheap if you just sign it.

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,680
My darling!

104
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,820
Wow!

105
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,240
W-what is this?

106
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,340
When I got my first CI,

107
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,840
I wanted something to decorate my surroundings.

108
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,860
I was just...

109
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,600
He's surprised.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,820
You're making a lot of money, aren't you?

111
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,260
Well, yeah.

112
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,380
You've got a lot of money.

113
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,880
Even though it's a bonus.

114
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,120
Well,

115
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,260
I'll give you a bonus.

116
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,240
I'll give you a bonus.

117
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,980
I'll give you a bonus.

118
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,360
I'll give you a bonus.

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,100
Ryo-chan,

120
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,400
if you keep saying that every year,

121
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,500
you'll end up being a rich man.

122
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,100
You're bothering the people in the shopping district.

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,900
I'll pay you this year.

124
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, yes.

125
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,460
You're such a noisy woman.

126
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,820
That's why I got a bride.

127
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,360
Did you say something?

128
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,380
Nothing.

129
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,180
Hello!

130
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,560
I'm from Tsurukame prefecture.

131
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,240
Oh, you're here.

132
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,540
Leave it there.

133
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,940
Yes.

134
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,060
Here.

135
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,140
It'll be 750 yen.

136
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,660
Please put it on.

137
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,060
Ryo-chan!

138
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,840
I don't have a date now.

139
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,960
I can't help it.

140
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,680
Then I have to ask for a date.

141
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,240
I can't help it if you ask for it.

142
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,040
Oh, you're so ridiculous.

143
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,100
Should I change the date?

144
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,740
No, no, it's fine.

145
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,640
When you get married,

146
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,520
I'm told to have this document signed.

147
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:06,940
Sign?

148
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

149
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,320
Okay, sure.

150
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,380
Thank you!

151
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,440
What was that?

152
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,880
I don't know.

153
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,340
When I shop in the shopping district recently,

154
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,000
I get signed all the time.

155
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,680
Haven't you checked?

156
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,000
It's like a contract.

157
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,620
"Pay with a bonus!"

158
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
Hmm.

159
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,580
Oh, by the way,

160
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,360
I just got an email with a draft.

161
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,560
Where is it?

162
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,080
I found it somewhere and threw it away.

163
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,640
I see.

164
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,280
I wonder?

165
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,320
Yes, I think so.

166
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,460
Oh, the one next to it.

167
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,560
Oh, right.

168
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,620
"Pay with a bonus!"

169
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,220
What's this?

170
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:52,980
Oh, my God!

171
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,880
What's wrong?

172
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,740
What you signed is not just a contract.

173
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
It's a contract to withdraw a loan from Daikin.

174
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,200
Daikin?

175
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,600
A loan?

176
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,340
What?

177
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,660
That is,

178
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,900
it's a contract to withdraw Daikin from Ryo-chan's bank loan automatically.

179
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,080
I see.

180
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,440
I didn't believe you.

181
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,960
I didn't think you'd know that.

182
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,160
Can you do that?

183
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,780
I can.

184
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,960
Electricity, gas, water,

185
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,360
Even buying things with a credit card,

186
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,140
That's what's going on.

187
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,700
Oh, if you say so,

188
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,980
It's too bad, Ryo-chan.

189
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,880
We can't afford to pay the loan.

190
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,440
The bank loan is probably going to be empty in a flash.

191
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,060
No way!

192
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,600
I'm going to hold a strategy meeting for the 29th Ryotsu Kankichi Bonus Battle.

193
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,600
...I'd like to say that.

194
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,900
Congrats!

195
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,300
This year's bonus battle is confirmed to end with our victory.

196
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,100
Today's the break-off. Enjoy it as much as you can.

197
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,580
No way, I never thought there would be such a way.

198
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,060
Ryo-san has been in debt for two years.

199
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,900
I should have noticed it earlier.

200
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,740
I don't like this kind of way.

201
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,800
When I don't see it, money moves without knowing it.

202
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,460
Well, well, thanks to that, my money will come back.

203
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
Hey! Promo!

204
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,920
You're all here, you little punks.

205
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,080
You're all here, you little punks.

206
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,060
Oh, good!

207
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,160
I didn't force you to sign it.

208
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,520
Ryo-san signed it himself, right?

209
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,200
I told you it was a contract!

210
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,180
I told you it was a contract.

211
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,340
It's Ryo-san's misunderstanding, isn't it?

212
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,480
You! You've calculated that far!

213
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,000
Or did you think I could ignore it if it was a contract?

214
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,560
Huh? No, not at all.

215
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,700
But I don't like this way of doing things.

216
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,560
I've been watching you this whole time.

217
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,880
I've been trying to pay you back with my own hands,

218
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,780
with my own feelings.

219
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:08,580
But!

220
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,540
I don't need any kind of thanks.

221
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,000
All I need is money to come back.

222
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,600
Huh?

223
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,140
Huh?

224
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:15,680
Besides,

225
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,960
Ryo-san was the one who suddenly wanted to pay you back

226
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,320
when you saw the cash in front of him.

227
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,840
Th-that's...

228
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,800
Damn it! Remember that!

229
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:29,960
I'll get you back!

230
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,180
I did it!

231
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,560
I'm so happy!

232
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,140
I'll get you back!

233
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,220
I'll get you back!

234
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,500
This is it!

235
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,240
If you do this,

236
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,640
I'll have to ask you to pay the cash in advance,

237
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,660
not to deposit the bank.

238
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,000
How do I convince them?

239
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,080
How do I convince them?

240
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,720
Hey,

241
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,560
don't throw away the newspaper.

242
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,600
Huh?

243
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,220
Huh?

244
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Here it is.

245
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,740
Here it is!

246
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,920
200g of pork,

247
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,200
carrots,

248
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,680
onions,

249
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,360
and...

250
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,100
Chief,

251
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,640
I have something to tell you!

252
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,100
Sshh!

253
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,660
Huh?

254
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,840
Nothing.

255
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,080
What?

256
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,380
The second supermarket is a special sale?

257
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,700
We should buy it there, right?

258
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,980
Okay, I got it.

259
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,580
Huh?

260
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,900
You're the chief of the Katsushika office,

261
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,520
but you're a waiter?

262
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,240
How pathetic.

263
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,180
You've been like this for a long time.

264
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,820
Leave it alone.

265
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,780
You've been like this for a long time?

266
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,940
What?

267
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,320
Actually,

268
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,600
not only the house of the chief,

269
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,880
but the authority of the father's family has decreased throughout Japan.

270
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,640
The cause is all

271
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,300
the fact that the salary has fallen into the account.

272
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,320
That's ridiculous.

273
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,460
Is that really true?

274
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,500
Please remember.

275
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,640
The day you brought a thick bag of bonuses to your house and went home.

276
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,700
A thick bag of bonuses?

277
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,460
I'm home.

278
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,920
Welcome home.

279
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,080
Here's a bonus.

280
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,940
Wow, a bonus!

281
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,020
Dear,

282
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,100
thank you for your hard work.

283
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,200
Let's go shopping together next Sunday.

284
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,940
Yay!

285
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,400
Thank you, dear.

286
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,740
Let's have sukiyaki tonight.

287
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,340
Here you go, dear.

288
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,100
Oh, sukiyaki!

289
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,120
Now, we're going to the store.

290
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
No, don't take these yet!

291
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,900
If you'll just give it to me.

292
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,260
You have to sign it.

293
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,600
Hello?

294
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:41,720
The gift is?

295
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,260
I can't believe this.

296
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,460
Don't be so arbitrary!

297
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:46,500
No, it's not!

298
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,660
It's my real money.

299
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,760
This is the thoughts of the head of our family.

300
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,640
My experience кл

301
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,680
But if that happens, it will take a lot of time.

302
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,100
I don't want you to do that to your monthly salary.

303
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,900
At least you should pay the bonus.

304
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,260
But...

305
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,900
President, have you ever been grateful for the bonus?

306
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,280
By the way, last year...

307
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,020
I'm home.

308
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,240
Oh?

309
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,100
Hey, what's wrong with this?

310
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,020
I bought it for the bonus.

311
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,560
You bought it? Without my advice?

312
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,620
Take it to my room.

313
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,140
Sigh...

314
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,840
Without any advice, I bought my own computer, and there was no thank you.

315
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,980
It's my bonus.

316
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,040
President, now is the time.

317
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,520
To restore my father's authority, the bonus should be returned to the cash register.

318
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,240
My Katsushika office is not going to stop that.

319
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,080
What?

320
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,100
I need you to help me restore my father's authority.

321
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,960
This Tonda Gomez is well- anthrop translated for the purpose of restoring the rights of his father, Imaishizu.

322
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,380
This year's bonus is a beleza.

323
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,100
Hey, president!

324
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,520
As expected of a man!

325
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,720
Oh, this is bad!

326
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,920
My hair is burned!

327
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,920
Hello, Kikuchi-san.

328
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,020
I'm free today.

329
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,840
The balance of the production has returned.

330
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,440
That's ridiculous! Look at this!

331
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,540
What?! The bonus at the Kazushika office is in cash?!

332
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,140
The president is talking all over the place.

333
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,500
Ryo, if you get a cashier, I'll contact you.

334
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,180
If you sit there, you'll get in the way.

335
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,360
It doesn't matter where I am.

336
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,460
I just want to get the bonus as soon as possible.

337
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,080
I just want to get the bonus as soon as possible.

338
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,480
It's them.

339
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,600
They're so cool.

340
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,000
The bonus hasn't been paid yet.

341
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,760
It seems that the cashier has arrived late.

342
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,180
Okay, the payment is ready.

343
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,760
That's why I was against that strategy.

344
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,140
You can't just say that now.

345
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,420
Mr. Tramaya, what strategy do you have in mind this time?

346
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,960
Yeah.

347
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,820
The Sky Eye strategy that uses an artificial satellite navigation system.

348
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,880
And the Peeping Eye strategy that uses a surveillance camera around the city.

349
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,220
The final strategy is the Shaking X, a new weapon that I developed for the president of the Ryo family.

350
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,820
You've always failed in your previous strategies.

351
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,860
I didn't have time to prepare.

352
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,000
There's no way I can do it.

353
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Besides, I'm going to power up the Shaking X.

354
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,200
It's a Shaking X Max.

355
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,200
You can do it.

356
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,560
You can do it.

357
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,140
What?

358
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:59,520
What's the matter?

359
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,320
Wait, what's wrong?

360
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,660
What's wrong?

361
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,020
This is crazy.

362
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,260
Don't be so annoying.

363
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,540
You can do it.

364
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,800
You can do it.

365
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,360
Yes, yes, you can do it.

366
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,440
We're young.

367
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,520
Stop it!

368
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,160
What are you doing? Get off!

369
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,740
We can't let Ryo-san go free!

370
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,500
If we don't get the money, you won't get the money!

371
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:39,160
But if you find it, you can get your bonus and escape.

372
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,680
I see.

373
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,500
Don't do that! I'll pay you!

374
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,660
But you always end up with the money.

375
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,220
Damn it!

376
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,720
Emergency!

377
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,160
A cashier was attacked in the Katsushika office.

378
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,420
The bonus of everyone in the Katsushika office has been stolen.

379
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,600
The bonus of everyone in the Katsushika office has been stolen.

380
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,480
The culprit is a man in a suit!

381
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,100
He's running away with a white shirt!

382
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,180
We'll arrest him with all our might!

383
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,020
The culprit is a man in a suit!

384
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,740
What are you going to do, Pramoya?

385
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,480
If Ryo-san gets away with it, it'll be a big deal!

386
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,500
We'll take the cashier back with our own hands!

387
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,800
What?

388
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,360
The culprit is a man in a suit!

389
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,880
I see.

390
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,880
I'll go hold the cashier.

391
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,180
What!?

392
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,120
The culprit is a man in a suit!

393
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,900
He's running away with our own hands!

394
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,360
We're taking care of this innocent picture!

395
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,380
We're taking care of this innocent picture!

396
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:05,620
We have to take care of him, but this can't be.

397
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,620
His power is so weak.

398
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,080
What if he is a policeman?

399
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,260
I don't think it will be a redstone.

400
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,940
What was the culprit doing for a while?

401
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,640
What's wrong?

402
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,560
I don't know.

403
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,220
There was a blue van with a terrible smudge.

404
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,080
I don't care about that.

405
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,280
The culprit's car is a white van.

406
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,100
No, I'm in a good shape.

407
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,780
I'm worried when I see a good job.

408
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,540
Sorry.

409
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,780
I understand. That's the culprit's car.

410
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:48,220
What's wrong, Mr. Plamo?

411
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
He changed the color of the car.

412
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,840
It's true that it's impossible to change it in a short time.

413
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,460
Just temporarily blind the police.

414
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,860
Put it in a place where no one can see it.

415
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,340
Cover the front glass with a newspaper and paint it.

416
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:03,520
That's how you do it.

417
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,360
If you look closely, you'll notice something unnatural.

418
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,240
The police are looking for a white van.

419
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,100
There is a possibility to overlook it.

420
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,960
I see.

421
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,320
As expected, you're a man.

422
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,940
This year is our victory, Mr. Ryo.

423
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,840
It's the police.

424
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,240
Open the back bed.

425
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,680
Yes, sir.

426
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,320
...

427
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,340
Well, we didn't find a white van.

428
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,960
All right, let's go.

429
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,760
The white van is in a small wolf woman's car.

430
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,420
There is a clue.

431
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,540
What's happened to the white van?

432
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,240
I got a clue.

433
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,580
I'm going to use it.

434
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:54,880
Hurry?

435
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,460
Yes.

436
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:55,720
Yes, sir!

437
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,440
The blue van is heading west from Kamiari.

438
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,180
Roger that!

439
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,840
I found it! The blue van!

440
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,940
It's huge!

441
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,900
Alright! Don't let it escape!

442
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,880
We'll catch up with it!

443
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,880
Nakagawa! Don't let it miss us!

444
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,700
Oh!

445
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,420
Money in this place?

446
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,160
Money?

447
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,160
Stop!

448
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,160
Here it comes!

449
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,200
Where's the money?

450
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,480
I found a 500 yen coin.

451
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,520
What's this? It's a coin from the game!

452
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,400
What are you doing?

453
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,580
I'm just going to...

454
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,960
I'm not doing this for nothing!

455
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,360
I need to get a bonus!

456
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,740
Oh no! I lost it!

457
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,080
Stop! The car over there!

458
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,680
Stop!

459
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,100
I'm going to get you!

460
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,260
I'm going to get you!

461
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,560
I'm leaving!

462
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,820
Oh no!

463
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,800
I'm going to get you!

464
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,140
I'm going to get you!

465
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,880
It's finally time to show off the true power of the Shaking X!

466
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,880
Oh no!

467
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,080
You can go now.

468
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,740
You won't be able to run from me!

469
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,620
It's too late!

470
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,020
I'm warning you!

471
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,360
Damn it.

472
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,760
They should be around here!

473
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,680
What do we do?

474
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,920
If we keep going, the culprit will get away!

475
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,000
Is there any way to contact the police?

476
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,500
In this state...

477
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,300
Hmph, everyone is not fooling around.

478
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,860
There is a special way.

479
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,960
What? Special?

480
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,400
Do it like this.

481
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,240
Ah! There is a bullet falling in such a place!

482
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,100
A bullet is falling!

483
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,560
A bullet is falling!

484
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,840
A bullet is falling!

485
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,520
A bullet is falling!

486
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,060
A bullet is falling!

487
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,400
That way, Nakagawa! Hurry up!

488
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,300
But, what about the car of the plumber?

489
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,520
The cash in front of us is better than the car of the plumber!

490
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,780
Senpai, it's dangerous!

491
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:32,840
Hey, you, go back!

492
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,300
What?

493
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,860
Where is the bullet?

494
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,220
Mr. Ryoma!

495
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,540
What?

496
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,500
Senpai, is that...

497
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,060
Oh!

498
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,900
It's a trunk for the cash transport!

499
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,620
That guy is the culprit!

500
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:54,740
What?

501
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,620
This is Nakagawa! The culprit was found!

502
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
There is my bonus in there!

503
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,280
F-fool!

504
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,220
Can't you see this?

505
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,960
Give me back my bonus!

506
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,420
Get out of my way!

507
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,660
I did it, senpai!

508
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,260
My bonus! My bonus!

509
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:24,860
Mr. Ryo!

510
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,880
You're going to give me back the cash, aren't you?

511
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,740
W-well...

512
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,860
I'm running away!

513
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,960
I'll take out my bonus for you!

514
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,300
Bastard!

515
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,300
You want to be the nobleman?

516
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,980
He'll never be the nobleman.

517
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,260
I'm from the nobleman club.

518
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm accounts for all the bank accounts.

519
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,400
You're still here with the nobleman?

520
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,420
Y-yeah...

521
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,000
The floor is stooped...

522
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,880
You guys have to pay the fine.

523
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,280
And I have to pay the fine, my boys!

524
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,440
I'll give it a try.

525
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,380
Yay!

526
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,880
Kaka!

527
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,960
The first local worker, Mr. Ryotsu Kankichi.

528
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,240
Here.

529
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,600
Here, good work.

530
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,840
Huh?

531
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,020
It's so thin.

532
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,620
Huh?

533
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,040
613 yen, right?

534
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,160
Hey!

535
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,260
Isn't that a mistake?

536
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,020
No, it's not.

537
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,840
Hey, chief!

538
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,800
I only have this much bonus.

539
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,480
What's going on?

540
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,640
In your case, I've broken a lot of books.

541
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,880
I got it from the bonus.

542
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,980
That's...

543
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,420
You didn't get it this year either.

544
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,140
I'll get it next year for sure.

545
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,000
I tried my best, but I can't believe it.

546
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,820
But I really did.

547
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,860
It's

548
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,380
"Got a lot of books!"

549
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,700
Such a big clause.

550
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:30,440
I'm filled with words that I can't handle.

551
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,960
Ah!

552
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,200
I can't read books.

553
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,320
So you're reading books?

554
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,400
Are you so surprise?

555
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,000
Then it's important to read the books completely.
