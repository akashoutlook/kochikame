If you're angry, then we won't do anything!

53
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,800
But this time, we don't need to feel that bad.

54
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,620
What?!

55
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,180
The 35th Ryoutsu Kankichi Bonus Education War strategy meeting is about to begin.

56
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,920
Mr. Plumber, this time we don't need to feel bad. What do you mean?

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,280
We decided to take a strategy that will definitely recover our debt without wasting our time.

58
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,780
Oh!

59
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,960
What strategy is it?

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,160
Teacher, please come in.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,720
Teacher!

62
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,840
I'm here.

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,180
T-this person is...

64
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,880
Mr. Plumber Mr. Muu.

65
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,840
He's a professional debt collector.

66
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,860
A professional debt collector?

67
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,720
Your debt recovery rate so far is 10%.

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,640
You've never failed.

69
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,840
And the amount of debt you've recovered is not that much.

70
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,460
But even if you're a professional, you can't catch Mr. Ryou alone.

71
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,940
That's right.

72
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,440
Not alone. I have a few excellent subordinates.

73
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,340
Hehehe.

74
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,440
What?

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,180
What?

76
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,200
What?

77
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,300
Leave this year's bonus education war to us.

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,380
Leave this year's bonus education war to us.

79
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,160
Leave this year's bonus education war to us.

80
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,120
Bonus Education War 8!

81
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,440
Bonus Education War 8!

82
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,420
I'm back. I went on patrol.

83
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,080
How was the shopping street?

84
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,920
Is there any place to rest?

85
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,100
Plumber, electricity vendor, fish shop, sugar plumber.

86
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,280
Everyone it's open all the time.

87
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,800
UKASHI Yesterday when I was patrolling, there was no shop closed.

88
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,980
What's wrong with that?

89
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,280
Every year around this time, the shop is preparing a bonus.

90
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,640
This is when to prepare for my bonus!

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,040
This is when to prepare for my bonus!

92
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,980
Tap, tap, tap

93
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,620
The

94
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,180
Now that you mention it, it seems so.

95
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,720
But yet, this year there hasn't been any movement at all.

96
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,280
Now then, have you given up on repaying our debt?

97
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,500
Of course not!

98
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:18,960
Huh?

99
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,900
Ah! You were there!

100
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,400
We talked about it and decided not to do anything special this year.

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,680
It's stupid to just chase after Ryo-san and ruin his precious day at the end of the year.

102
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,260
That's why I didn't give up on collecting the debt.

103
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,580
I'll come to Saesoku while I'm delivering.

104
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,540
Pay me well!

105
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,540
Really, you're not going to do the bonus delivery this year?

106
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,080
Yeah.

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,920
We...

108
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,760
Yay! Bonus!

109
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,320
I had a lot of things this year, too.

110
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,200
What would I do if I didn't get a bonus?

111
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,660
That's good, Senpai.

112
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,740
All right, I'll immediately lower everything at the bank...

113
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,800
What's wrong, Senpai?

114
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,980
Usually, people from the shopping street should come up with something.

115
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
You said you wouldn't do the bonus delivery this year.

116
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,160
That's right, Senpai.

117
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,980
No, but it's about them.

118
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,420
Maybe they're planning something.

119
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,200
Are you crazy? You're suspicious.

120
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,560
Thanks for your thought, Usagi.

121
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,820
I'm sure it'll work out.

122
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,920
...Did you say you were suspicious of the bonus delivery this year?

123
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,100
...What do you mean?

124
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,120
Oh?

125
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,460
Well, as you can tell, I haven't been buying anything lately.

126
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm looking forward to it.

127
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,140
Thank you very much!

128
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,760
You don't have to watch our movements, Ryo-san.

129
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,360
Yay! Now I can use the bonus without hesitation!

130
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,380
I wonder if it's okay to give them a little debt.

131
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,240
I don't know!

132
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,420
I'm so happy!

133
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,740
I didn't know how long I had to wait for this day.

134
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,800
I'm so glad I came to the police station.

135
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,360
What is this feeling?

136
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,240
I have a terrible feeling.

137
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,020
I didn't expect to get a debt.

138
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,500
It's just a thought.

139
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,800
Let's begin.

140
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,240
Uncle! Uncle!

141
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,240
What?

142
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,240
Give me back my money.

143
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,160
What?

144
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,620
Why do I have to give you back my money?

145
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,000
The shopkeeper asked me to get a debt from Ryo-san.

146
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,240
What are they thinking?

147
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,660
They asked a child like me because they were busy.

148
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,960
Give me back my money.

149
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,480
I'll do it next time.

150
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,000
When?

151
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,360
When I feel like it.

152
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
When do you feel like it?

153
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,540
When I feel like it.

154
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,600
When do you feel like it?

155
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,860
When I feel like it.

156
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,300
When I feel like it.

157
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,700
Be still, be quiet!

158
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,300
Give me back my money!

159
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,100
No way!

160
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,040
What do you want?

161
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,700
Uncle won't give me back my money.

162
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:36,680
"I'm not going to do it."

163
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,560
"What?"

164
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,700
"Are you a professional debt collector?"

165
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,200
"You have to pay back the debt quietly."

166
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,380
"Or I'll cry."

167
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,020
"You can collect more people."

168
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,800
"What do you think of people who are bullying kindergarten children?"

169
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,360
"I understand."

170
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,260
"You just have to pay the debt quietly from the beginning."

171
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,620
"Take this!"

172
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,280
"Damn it!"

173
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,560
"Just in case, I'll use the weapon to take the debt."

174
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,740
"I'm glad I prepared a weapon."

175
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,000
"Target locked on."

176
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,660
"Starting the search."

177
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,520
"They're making fun of the people at the shopping district too."

178
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,360
"They're making fun of the people at the shopping street too."

179
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,020
"I don't like the idea of hiring a kid like me."

180
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,660
"I don't like the idea of hiring a kid like me."

181
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,000
"I don't like the idea of hiring a kid like me."

182
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,360
"I don't like the idea of hiring a kid like me."

183
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,620
"And I don't want to be asked to do things for others."

184
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,140
"I won't give a bonus for getting bullied!"

185
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,500
"You can't do that."

186
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,020
"What?"

187
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,200
"Be sure to pay back the debt!"

188
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,560
"W-What the hell are you doing?"

189
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,060
"My name is Hayate no Jouji, I'm a professional debt collector."

190
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,940
"I'm here to collect money."

191
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,140
"I'm the child's partner from earlier!"

192
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,200
"You can't be with a kid like him."

193
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,660
"This target scope and booster shoes are connected."

194
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Once you lock on the token, it will continue to chase you to the end of hell.

195
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,460
You're already locked on!

196
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,980
Return your debt!

197
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,940
What?!

198
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,740
Return your debt!

199
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,520
I'm going!

200
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,120
Robot Nation!

201
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,260
I'm going!

202
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,700
This is my garden!

203
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,940
I'll get caught by that guy!

204
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,740
What?!

205
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,820
I told you! You must not let the token you locked on escape!

206
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,880
What was that just now?!

207
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,780
We're just taking it easy, old man!

208
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,860
As expected of you, big brother! You're so good!

209
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
There's no one around here who can beat me!

210
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,580
Get out of here!

211
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,760
What?!

212
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,300
I got pulled out by a bike!

213
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,880
Return your debt!

214
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,160
I got pulled out by a human too!

215
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,640
What the hell?

216
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,220
Thank you for your hard work!

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,260
You're good!

218
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,580
You're a stubborn fellow!

219
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,920
That's what it's all about!

220
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,540
You can't run away from me!

221
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,680
Damn it!

222
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,880
That's right!

223
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,460
What the... is this?!

224
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,080
You're going to jump over the river with that momentum?

225
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,280
You're not going to!

226
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,780
Damn it!

227
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,240
You have to do it!

228
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,900
Gadren Kick!

229
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,520
What?!

230
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,880
*Splash*

231
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,640
*Sigh* Good grief.

232
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,120
He was a tough opponent.

233
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,600
Hm?

234
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,960
*Sigh*

235
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,280
*Splash*

236
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,240
*Splash*

237
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,480
What's this?

238
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
*Splash*

239
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,780
*Splash*

240
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,320
*Splash*

241
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:28,460
*Splash*

242
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,560
*Splash*

243
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,480
*Splash*

244
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:32,660
Hey-!

245
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,440
You're dead!

246
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,040
*Splash*

247
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,800
*Splash*

248
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,120
*Splash*

249
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,940
What the hell!

250
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,180
*Splash*

251
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,280
*Splash*

252
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,200
*Splash*

253
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,320
*Splash*

254
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,720
stan me!

255
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,960
*Splash*

256
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,140
*Splash*

257
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,640
Uwaaah...

258
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,540
*Splash*

259
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,800
*Splash*

260
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,140
If you want to see more, pay me back my debt.

261
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,640
Debt?

262
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,640
Are you also a debt collector?

263
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,520
Thank you.

264
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,120
My name is Sexy Rose.

265
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,620
There's no man who didn't fall for my charm.

266
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,520
Now, pay me back my debt.

267
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,180
The most important thing to me now is...

268
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,560
Please.

269
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,880
Money is more important than charm!

270
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,400
Hey! Wait!

271
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,180
My name is Scissor Hand Paper.

272
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,380
I'm a debt collector.

273
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,500
Oh, what's next?

274
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,300
Watch me show you my skills.

275
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,760
Dog.

276
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,200
Cat.

277
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,460
Bat.

278
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,000
Huh?

279
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,540
And the

280
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:14,220
It's a fun game, but you have to pay back the debt!

281
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,820
That's foolish.

282
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,180
I want to keep this half...

283
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,820
My name is Parasol Tanaka.

284
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,800
I'm going to captivate you!

285
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,460
Get out of the way!

286
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,780
My name is Mizugay's Mizutayu!

287
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,960
My name is Gengen!

288
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,720
Get out of the way!

289
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,920
My name is...

290
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,500
Shut up!

291
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,340
Damn it! I'm going to the Asakusa Indie Hall!

292
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,220
I wonder if the debt collectors are okay.

293
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,520
They're 100% successful professionals.

294
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,980
No matter how well they do, they won't get away.

295
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,180
Welcome.

296
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,340
Coffee!

297
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,320
Me too.

298
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:52,820
Thank you.

299
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,400
If the debt comes back, so will my wife.

300
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,100
I'll go home too.

301
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,240
I'm glad you're here.

302
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,700
I should have done this from the beginning.

303
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,920
We didn't have to push Ryo-san around.

304
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,000
Why did the bonus fight start?

305
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,980
At first, we just went to collect the debt together.

306
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,080
But Ryo-san suddenly ran away when it was time to pay.

307
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,280
I see.

308
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,200
I was in a hurry at that time.

309
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,420
I was in a hurry.

310
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,080
Ryo-san was young, but we were young too.

311
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,360
We all ran away.

312
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,900
The old lady at the confectionery was still as energetic as she was running around.

313
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,980
In the evening, I thought I finally caught Ryo-san.

314
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,740
After using up all the bonuses...

315
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,620
I was really hungry at that time.

316
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,480
So from the next time, I started to plan and collect the debt.

317
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,180
That's right.

318
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,700
I did a lot.

319
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,300
I dug a little pit and made a lot of holes.

320
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,520
After I became the president of the confectionery, I made machines and so on.

321
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,080
But in the end, I failed.

322
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,260
You really laugh.

323
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,480
I'm sorry.

324
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,580
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,380
From now on, you don't have to do that.

326
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,320
It's a good thing.

327
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,660
It's not good.

328
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,760
It was my duty to collect the debt from Ryo-san.

329
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,920
I'm so frustrated that I have to leave it to them.

330
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,060
Grandpa.

331
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,800
My special move!

332
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,460
How many people are you talking about?

333
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,760
Huh?

334
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,940
Collecting the debt!

335
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,500
You again!

336
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,360
I told you.

337
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,720
I will continue to chase you to the end of hell.

338
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,900
If you do this...

339
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:48,980
Yes!

340
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,600
What did you do?

341
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,920
It's a special instant adhesive.

342
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,940
I can't follow it.

343
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,220
Don't underestimate me.

344
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,100
Full power!

345
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,140
Ouch!

346
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,460
Ouch!

347
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,280
What a surprise!

348
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,740
Don't come back again!

349
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,440
It seems that I have to go myself.

350
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:19,640
Don't you get it?

351
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,280
I wouldn't be cool.

352
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,600
Teacher...

353
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,560
It's okay.

354
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,480
Your expectations are not changed.

355
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,080
I meet you again.

356
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,880
I always wait for your customer.

357
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,480
Is it the end?

358
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,280
What?

359
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,580
Coming!

360
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,420
It's working!

361
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,660
I can do that.

362
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,020
You've done well in pursuing my subordinates.

363
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,640
You're the master of debt collection, aren't you?

364
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,220
My name is "Debt Mu".

365
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,160
I hate debt from the bottom of my heart.

366
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,120
What?

367
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,100
My parents had a small shop in Hokkaido.

368
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,800
But the shop was destroyed because of the customer who didn't pay the rent.

369
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,140
I swear to my heart since that day.

370
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,220
I will never let you step on the debt.

371
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,740
Now, pay the debt!

372
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,640
Ah! It's a UFO!

373
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,060
Now!

374
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,680
How cowardly!

375
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,420
Usually, you can't defeat a boss character by yourself.

376
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,800
But you can't defeat a boss character by yourself.

377
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,540
There's no such thing as cowardly people who can't pay the debt.

378
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,060
It's the plumber.

379
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,520
Hello?

380
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,300
Yeah, yeah.

381
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,280
I see.

382
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,780
Ryo-san was caught.

383
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,500
Oh, Ryo-san...

384
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,240
Well, you did a good job.

385
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,340
Thank you very much.

386
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,820
You guys are wrong!

387
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,420
You guys even borrowed the hands of the people who don't know this!

388
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,840
Don't you think it's embarrassing?

389
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,260
That's right.

390
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,480
Don't you think it's embarrassing not to pay the debt forever?

391
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,460
Huh?

392
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,280
I'll pay the debt someday.

393
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,120
But I'm sorry to die this time.

394
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,180
I'm not worried about him.

395
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,940
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

396
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,400
You're going to use your cowardly hands again?

397
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,980
I'll show you the true power of my boss character.

398
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,540
Huh?

399
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,440
Huh?

400
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,120
Now, you want to pay the debt.

401
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
You want to pay the debt.

402
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,000
Psychiatry?

403
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,540
Damn! Who's a psychiatrist?

404
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,600
It's useless. You're already in the mood to pay the debt.

405
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,940
You can't help but want to pay the debt.

406
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,620
You'll pay the debt no matter what happens.

407
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,960
You have a debt.

408
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,160
You have to pay the debt.

409
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,120
Of course.

410
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,120
Now, if I count to three, you'll wake up and pay the debt.

411
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,760
One, two, three.

412
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,540
That's right. I have to pay the debt.

413
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,520
I've been in debt for a long time, but I haven't paid it at all.

414
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,920
What a terrible man I was.

415
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,640
I'll pay the debt now.

416
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,640
I've borrowed hundreds of millions so far.

417
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,520
I'll pay the debt to Nakagawa.

418
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,060
I'll pay you back all the bonuses, Nakagawa!

419
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,640
What's going on here?

420
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,820
I think you went to returns from the biggest part of the debt.

421
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,720
So you mean you won't return our debt?

422
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,860
That's...

423
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,420
I'm not kidding.

424
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,440
We hired you.

425
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,260
Let's take responsibility and get my debt back.

426
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
I know.

427
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,180
I know! Bring it back!

428
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,300
Let go of my debt!

429
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,160
I'm going to pay you back!

430
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,540
I'm going to pay you back!

431
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,220
I won't let you go!

432
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,560
I'm going to pay you back!

433
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,860
I'm going to pay you back!

434
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,580
What the hell?

435
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,300
I knew this was going to happen.

436
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,180
Those who don't know much about mass production can't get their money from mass production.

437
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,160
We made a mistake by asking them to do this.

438
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,480
But if we do it ourselves...

439
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,340
The cost...

440
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,420
What's the point?

441
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,900
We don't care how much it costs, right?

442
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,220
We're chasing mass production every year not for money.

443
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,120
It's a matter of pride as human beings who do business.

444
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,940
Pride?

445
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,560
We get the money for the products we sell.

446
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,960
Even if it costs a lot of work.

447
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,020
That's the pride of a businessman.

448
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,460
That's a good point, Ma-san.

449
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,980
Pride of a businessman?

450
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,280
It seems we were wrong.

451
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,240
Mr. Deng.

452
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,740
But what about this year's bonus?

453
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,620
Are you going to give up?

454
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,020
What?

455
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,700
There's a way for people who know Ryo very well.

456
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,400
Nakagawa!

457
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm going to pay you back now!

458
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,660
What?

459
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,400
What?

460
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,240
I'm going to pay you back as well.

461
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,800
What are you doing here?

462
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,280
I'm sure I was caught by the debtors.

463
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,740
More importantly, where is the sound of the bell?

464
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,600
Where?

465
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:52,980
Huh?

466
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,180
You just...

467
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,620
I got it!

468
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,920
I did it! I'm so lucky!

469
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,100
Oh no! The trap!

470
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,360
This is good enough.

471
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,820
Ryo, I'm going to pay the debt.

472
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,800
There's no other way.

473
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,580
Stop me!

474
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,380
Don't come near me!

475
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,640
Don't come near me!

476
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,900
My bonus!

477
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,940
I guess you can't rely on the power of others.

478
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,880
My bonus!

479
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,740
Next year, we'll definitely pay the debt ourselves!

480
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,640
Yeah!

481
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,440
Next year, we'll definitely pay the debt ourselves!

482
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,240
What should I do?

483
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,580
I ate a strange tree that came from the sea,

484
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,560
and I became a rubber human whose body stretched like rubber.

485
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,240
Wait a minute.

486
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,480
My limbs are stretched, and this may be surprisingly useful.

487
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,600
Next time, "Ryo of the Rubber Rubber".

488
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,320
See you!

489
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,700
Next time, "Ryo of the Rubber Rubber".

490
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,660
See you!

491
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,880
Next time, "Ryo of the Rubber Rubber".
