1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,580
The

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,240
When you're watching TV,

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,020
brighten up the room and watch from afar.

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,960
Who doesn't have the money,

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,480
come to me!

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,480
I don't have it either,

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,940
but I'm worried.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:35,880
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,920
It will be all right somehow

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,660
It will be all right somehow

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,160
Come to my place if you don't have a job

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,720
I don't have one, but don't worry

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,100
Look, I'm burning

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,420
At the red clouds

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,760
It will be all right somehow

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,600
You understand, right?

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,340
I understand, I understand

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,740
If you understand, be quiet and follow me

19
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,440
Have a good bath at Hashijyo Onsen

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,240
Ah, it's hot, hot

21
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,060
Look, there are shadows on the road, and the whole city looks distorted

22
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,820
It's like you're in the desert

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,540
It's a good thing I said I was in Tokyo desert

24
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,160
Ah, it's hot, I'm going to die

25
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,240
Ah, it's hot, I'm going to die

26
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,200
Ah, it's hot, I'm going to die

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,580
Let's take a bath in the desert oasis

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,880
But the Hashijyo is right there

29
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,380
Senior

30
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,120
I like the best bath in this kind of place

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,480
I'm sorry

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,100
It's okay, it's okay

33
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,200
I'll leave it here, grandma

34
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,680
I'll leave it here, grandma

35
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,980
Phew, he's such a child

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:43,920
Yahoo!

37
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,960
Phew, this is the best bath

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,620
It's a rare painting, isn't it?

39
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,820
Is it Mt. Fuji in the autumn leaves?

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,480
Yeah, since the god's name is Momiji

41
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,780
By the way, the master is called Tsurutaro, and the man is called...

42
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,000
Ah, this is bad, Nagagawa is coming out!

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,800
What's wrong, senpai?

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,420
What's wrong, senpai?

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,720
Momiji's painting is a woman's bath

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,640
The man's bath is in the front hill with a crane

47
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,620
What?

48
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:16,940
What?

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,740
What?

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,120
Geez, I'm sweating so much

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,660
that I can't believe I'm mistaking a man's and a woman's bath

52
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,400
Ah, I'm sorry

53
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm sorry

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,840
Recently, I've had a lot of customers

55
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,280
I've also been a little relaxed

56
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,620
Now that you mention it, the fourth bath has become a supermarket

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,140
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

58
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,920
I shan't talk about something that's old-fashioned

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,160
Young people are 'going to maneira' a man's bath

60
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,820
A son-in-law-in-law together

61
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,540
But in the current situation, we can't pass on the choreography like this

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,420
Once upon a time, the teacher and students sat together

63
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,900
You'd make a circle to form a friendship

64
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,140
cheupion was the place to be won

65
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,720
This is the past

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,260
Ah, yeah, old lady, I'll have some coffee milk

67
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,400
Huh?

68
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,240
I'm sorry, Ryo-san.

69
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,220
I don't put it in my coffee.

70
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Young people only drink mineral water.

71
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,300
Mineral water after a bath?

72
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,720
The fun of the bath is gone again.

73
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,980
Come to think of it, I also drink mineral water.

74
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,620
Me too.

75
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,560
Reiko is a monk, anyway.

76
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,520
I use it when I put tea or coffee in my house.

77
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,380
What?

78
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,860
You use mineral water for tea or coffee?

79
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,380
Same goes for the waste disposal.

80
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,100
It tastes the same as making this with tap water.

81
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,400
Ryo-chan uses tap water.

82
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,960
Why do I only use tap water?

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,520
Ryo-chan likes the taste of tap water.

84
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,280
That's right.

85
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,500
I always put my face on the corner and drink delicious water.

86
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,660
That's why I don't use tap water.

87
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,560
Then, you should say that mineral water is good from the beginning.

88
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,040
Mineral water?

89
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,800
Now is the time to carry a mineral bottle when going out.

90
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,300
Mineral water for cats and cats.

91
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Mineral water for cats and cats.

92
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,900
Mineral water for cats.

93
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,020
Mineral water is good.

94
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,740
Mineral water...

95
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:47,900
Mineral water...

96
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,540
Mineral water is...

97
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,380
Mineral water...

98
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,020
Mineral water...

99
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,260
This is the place.

100
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,140
Mineral water is good for cats and dogs.

101
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,940
If he says he only drinks mineral water and dies, I'll respect him for the rest of his life.

102
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,320
What an extreme example!

103
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,520
That's right. No matter how much it is.

104
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,080
How much is a bottle of that?

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,920
That's right. About 200 yen.

106
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,860
200 yen?

107
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,960
That means that if a person in Japan drinks one bottle at a time, it's 200 billion yen!

108
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,920
Wait a minute. If you dig a well that contains minerals, the source is just...

109
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,440
If you sell this, you'll make a whole profit and 200 billion yen will roll in my place!

110
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,720
All right! I'll do it!

111
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
He started something again.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,240
He's going to dig underground water that can be sold as mineral water.

113
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,520
I'm sure of it.

114
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,680
Ryo-san, you can dig such a place without permission and get scolded by the chief.

115
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,240
I can't hear him at all.

116
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,340
Ryo-chan's concentration when he's in trouble is invincible.

117
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:21,480
Well, dad and mom, that's enough.

118
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,420
I'll leave it to you.

119
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,300
I feel lonely when I think that the chimney here will never be seen again.

120
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,380
If you open the hot spring, it will be different again.

121
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,820
That's not going to work.

122
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,860
Hot spring.

123
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,780
Come out.

124
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,160
Come out.

125
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,900
Come out.

126
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:50,960
Come out.

127
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,880
Mineral water.

128
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,260
Come out.

129
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,360
Mineral water.

130
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,540
Come out.

131
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,380
What are you digging well?

132
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,160
Hey, next to the motel.

133
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,620
Those are going to sell the groundwater as mineral water.

134
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,500
You idiot.

135
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,960
Hey, Ryo-chan!

136
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,420
Ryo-tsu!

137
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,460
Did he dig this hole with only a scoop?

138
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,440
I think he dug it with an iron box, so it must be at least 100 meters high.

139
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,880
Hey, Ryo-tsu! Can you hear me?

140
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,080
Hey, Ryo-tsu! Can you hear me?

141
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,380
It's coming out soon, you idiot!

142
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,020
It's coming out soon, you idiot!

143
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,840
It's coming out soon, you idiot!

144
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,160
What? You're so noisy.

145
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,500
If you keep whining, you'll suffocate to death.

146
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,900
You'll suffocate to death!

147
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,100
What? What did you say?

148
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,700
You'll suffocate to death?

149
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,800
What's going on?

150
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,300
Hey, Ryo-tsu!

151
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,420
Ryo-tsu!

152
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:09,960
Ryo-tsu!

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,960
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

154
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,300
Ryo-chan, what's this?

155
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,800
It's not water, it's hot water.

156
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,140
You dug a hot spring!

157
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,700
You idiot!

158
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,680
We did it! It's an escape hot spring!

159
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,140
We did it, Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

160
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,760
This is better than mineral water!

161
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,120
Ryo-tsu has set up a hot spring in front of our presence.

162
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,500
I see?

163
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,460
Ryo-tsu dug his own up hot spring and let us know how popular it is!

164
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,320
Yes.

165
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,360
The owner has declared that he is doing this for the local residents at a special price.

166
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,600
Right!

167
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,880
The bad of that is the judges' salary.

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,760
The bad of that is the judges' salary.

169
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Hey, Mr. Mayor!

170
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,920
Thanks to the governor, the public규

171
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,840
It's very popular among the residents.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,840
The hot springs at the station.

173
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,550
Ryotsu, are you sure that you didn't take anything else

174
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,660
Of course.

175
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,860
It's just a resident service.

176
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,180
Let me see inside.

177
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,180
Huh?

178
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,460
No, I mean...

179
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,580
What's wrong?

180
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,460
Is there something wrong?

181
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,940
N-No, there isn't.

182
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,960
Please, the director and the chief,

183
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,740
please go inside the hot springs.

184
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,080
Please go inside.

185
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,480
Now, two adults, please come in.

186
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,900
Welcome.

187
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,460
Are you working in Nakagawa?

188
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,120
Yes.

189
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,540
I wouldn't say no if you said it was a resident service.

190
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,100
How is it?

191
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,220
We made it easier for the residents to use it

192
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,760
thanks to the beautiful men and women at the reception.

193
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,720
It looks like a normal hot spring

194
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,780
unlike the other hot springs.

195
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,740
Yes, yes, director and chief.

196
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,160
The men's hot springs are here.

197
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,820
Uh-huh.

198
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,860
Oh, a hot spring.

199
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,540
It's surprisingly large.

200
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,580
It's 100% a natural hot spring.

201
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,040
Let me see your back first.

202
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,540
Yes, please, i'll do it.

203
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,000
Hey, please,

204
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
please, let's get the two of us in the back.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,480
What?

206
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,900
Not done yet?

207
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,640
Ahhh!

208
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,360
What?

209
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,660
Oh, you are shy.

210
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,940
Oh, the director.

211
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,520
Uh-huh.

212
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,740
It's a special service,

213
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,880
so don't let me have a chip.

214
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,860
Oh, don't worry.

215
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,600
So, my specialty, the Matsushika...

216
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,080
What was that?

217
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,700
I heard something.

218
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't wanna get in the way of the chief.

219
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,740
It's too quiet.

220
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,180
I can't see anything.

221
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,760
Beer and Nieda.

222
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,220
Honda.

223
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,520
Senpai, the brakes are in good condition.

224
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,620
Honda, it's not good now.

225
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,600
What?

226
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,360
The chiefs are coming.

227
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,540
Just work in the break room.

228
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,540
It's not good.

229
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,640
I think a hot spring is...

230
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,480
Chief, I prepared a massage.

231
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,320
Here you are.

232
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,100
What?

233
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,660
You have a massage?

234
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,640
I'm exhausted.

235
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,360
You're right.

236
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,720
Right?

237
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,140
The break room hot spring is perfect for this healing period.

238
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
The break room hot spring is the oasis of the people.

239
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,520
The break room hot spring is the oasis of the people.

240
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,460
The break room hot spring is the oasis of the people.

241
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,560
There are two members, so the break room hot spring is the best.

242
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:20,160
The break room hot spring is the oasis of the people.

243
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,220
What's the matter?

244
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,360
It's about time.

245
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,260
Ah?

246
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,820
Grandma, I'm sorry.

247
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,040
The bathhouse here is gone.

248
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,580
Grandma was really looking forward to the big bathhouse here.

249
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,980
But it can't be helped.

250
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,260
There are people who are still looking forward to our bathhouse.

251
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,340
Massage table, onsen manju, onsen tamago.

252
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,120
And the sale of beer and edamame.

253
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,320
I don't see any profit.

254
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,780
Massage is quite tiring.

255
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,840
I'm sure you'll get paid for your part-time job.

256
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,960
It's all right.

257
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,800
I'm preparing for the next project.

258
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,460
The next project?

259
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,220
Look, New Hachisujyo Onsen.

260
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,520
This is the whole picture.

261
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,860
First, we'll pass through the main gate, which is the entrance gate.

262
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,880
We'll get on this floating moving basket and move.

263
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,360
The second line is the neon bathhouse.

264
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,900
The third line is the Awa bath, the East circle, which is used for Tenshikaku.

265
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,940
The third line is the Tono-sama bath.

266
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,920
To the left is the Honmaru electric bath.

267
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,640
The fourth line is the Hinoji bath.

268
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,400
The fifth line is the San-no-maru mineral bath.

269
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,880
Here, at this Lezier bath, we can have a swimming pool in a large TOKYO.

270
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,080
You can enjoy the goodあわば sound.

271
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,840
This is the big Dutchman bath.

272
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,440
And this is the hot water slide one, where you can enjoy the thrilling feeling of being naked and running your whiskers.

273
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,120
We can prepare for the seven baths and for the attractions.

274
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,420
We can enjoy it from adults to children.

275
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,920
The dream hot spring, Deja Land, will be born

276
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,160
There is a hot spring in the cave

277
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,900
There is a banquet hall and souvenir shop in the castle

278
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,340
There is a ninja and a Polynesian dance in Show Time

279
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,920
The angel square is a karaoke hall

280
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,920
The lord sings like a lord

281
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,660
The golden carousel is rich

282
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,920
Well, here it is

283
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,040
Great, senpai! It's a big project

284
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,160
Really?

285
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,280
But, senpai, what about the land?

286
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,980
There is no such large land

287
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,980
That's right, you don't want to destroy the Kameari Park, do you?

288
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,040
That's right, the residents' hot spring for the residents

289
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,560
The park land will be donated to this hot spring

290
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,180
What?

291
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,560
But, I don't have permission to do that

292
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,620
The media will be on your side

293
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,000
The media?

294
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,080
The day of the interview has already been decided

295
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,740
Leave everything to me

296
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,640
How is it? Will the amount of hot springs increase?

297
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,520
I can't say anything yet

298
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:45,800
Unwanted

299
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,720
To convert this hot spring into a great leisure land

300
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,920
You must increase the Angels amount

301
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,700
We're counting on you

302
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,260
Yes, sir!

303
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,060
res�에서

304
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,140
Are you in the deep sea?

305
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,600
Yes, I'm

306
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,680
What's the point of not leaving now?

307
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,420
There are people who are in danger

308
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:09,800
A falls down

309
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,200
A falls down?

310
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:12,400
A falls down?

311
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,720
The End

312
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,300
What? The hot spring's gone?

313
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,040
You can't turn the valve all the way on.

314
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,040
Lend it to me.

315
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,600
No, I'm full.

316
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,260
Damn it!

317
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
The interview's tomorrow!

318
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,780
You're completely out.

319
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,160
I can't give up on you!

320
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,040
Listen, we're on the same page.

321
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,960
If you keep digging, you'll find it.

322
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,540
The hot spring's gonna come out!

323
00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:00,240
How's it? Is it out?

324
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,300
Not this one.

325
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,460
Not at all.

326
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,360
Not good, senpai.

327
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Don't give up. Dig until it comes out.

328
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,300
Okay.

329
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,160
Here.

330
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,900
One more time.

331
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,020
Damn it!

332
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,820
The submarine!

333
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,260
R-Ryons!

334
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,260
The gyo-ryu-ga!

335
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,840
The gyo-ryu-ga is gonna eat me!

336
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,300
Senpai!

337
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,040
I can smell something weird!

338
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,080
It's so dark I can't see anything!

339
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,920
The gas pipe's broken!

340
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,120
It's not coming out.

341
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,260
What are you gonna do, Ryotsu?

342
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,340
I'm gonna cheat.

343
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,140
How?

344
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,740
I'm gonna bring the boiler and boil the water.

345
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,680
You're gonna cheat?

346
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,520
I'm gonna do something with the hot spring.

347
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,360
You know what I mean, right?

348
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,880
It's over.

349
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,980
It's night time.

350
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,440
It's morning already.

351
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,360
Listen, you're gonna make it through today's interview.

352
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,520
Listen, Honda.

353
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,080
You're gonna put the hot spring in every 30 minutes.

354
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,820
I'm gonna do it on my own.

355
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,320
I'm sleepy.

356
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,440
I have to deal with the media.

357
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,140
Sakonji's a massage therapist.

358
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,100
Huh?

359
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,780
Listen, I'll bring you a pot of rice balls and miso soup later.

360
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,700
Okay.

361
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:06,120
Today's "Watching from the Street" is about the famous Hachijyo hot spring at Kameari Park.

362
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,120
Let's go.

363
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,260
Wow, here it is.

364
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,980
Well, let's take a bath.

365
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,720
It's important work for sakura as well.

366
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,480
The young master of Hachijyo hot spring Ryotsu is here.

367
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,900
Hello, I'm Ryotsu.

368
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,840
How'd you figure this hot spring out, Mr. Ryotsu?

369
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,300
I thought I'd dig a well for the folks in the area so that there would be no water shortage there.

370
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,040
You could've gentle work, but you were too young.

371
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
If you stutter in the rain, some kind of wave would be coming this way.

372
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,100
The hot spring has started to float.

373
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,540
Yes, I think it must be given by God.

374
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,440
Are you surprised? He said that.

375
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,660
As expected of a senior.

376
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,780
There is also a plan to redevelop the Kaneari Park and make it a leisure land.

377
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,180
Yes, I'm doing my best to meet the requests of the residents.

378
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,460
Then let's have Mr. Ryo-tsu guide the hot spring.

379
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,320
Yes, please come here.

380
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,500
I'm sorry.

381
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,880
Please come in.

382
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,660
This is the hot spring bath of Otokoyu.

383
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,100
So let's ask the customer's impressions.

384
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,720
Oh, I have to go to the hot spring.

385
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,800
Hot spring.

386
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,580
Hot spring.

387
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,300
How is this hot spring?

388
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,540
It's very good.

389
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,880
What about you?

390
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,040
There is also seaweed floating.

391
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,400
It's like miso soup.

392
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,200
Yes, it's like miso soup.

393
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,840
Yes, it's like miso soup.

394
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,000
What?

395
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,860
Seaweed.

396
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,760
Miso soup.

397
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,300
Oh, that idiot.

398
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,860
It smells like miso soup.

399
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,200
What?

400
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,940
This is strange hot spring.

401
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,080
Something strange is floating.

402
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,000
What?

403
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,200
This is really miso soup.

404
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,900
Tofu is floating.

405
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,460
Tofu is floating.

406
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,480
Tofu is floating.

407
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:27,900
Tofu is floating.

408
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,160
Mr. Ryo-tsu, what is this?

409
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,060
This is a rare miso soup hot spring.

410
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,580
Red miso, white miso, sweet miso.

411
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,940
What?

412
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,920
What?

413
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,640
Ryo-tsu.

414
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,320
What?

415
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,800
What?

416
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,840
What?

417
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,240
What?

418
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,420
What?

419
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,220
What?

420
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:49,840
What?

421
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,220
What?

422
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,400
What?

423
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,820
What?

424
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,460
What?

425
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,540
What?

426
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,180
What?

427
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,700
What?

428
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,520
What?

429
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,060
What?

430
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,220
What?

431
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,340
What?

432
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:22,940
What?

433
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:22,960
What?

434
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,680
It's hot!

435
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,980
Dad, look at this!

436
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,260
It's the hot spring! The hot spring has boiled!

437
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,260
We can do this! This is a hot spring battle!

438
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,540
I hope everyone comes again, Dad!

439
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,060
Yes, it's a great success!

440
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,200
It was really a hot spring at first!

441
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,640
Look at this!

442
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,100

Idiot!

445
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,920
Why am I always the only one who gets lucky?

446
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,160
This summer has come again!

447
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,980

I bet this time it's really useful!

Uwaa, tch tch tch tch tch!

If he gets mad, does he start burning?

483
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,760
He's a dangerous bastard!

484
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,080
Alright, I've decided!
