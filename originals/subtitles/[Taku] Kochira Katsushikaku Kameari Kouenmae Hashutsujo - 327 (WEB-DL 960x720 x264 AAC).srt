Battle Shogi

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,720
I played with Kei-chan three times and won three times. Ryo-chan's chess skills are also quite good.

33
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,380
I'm confident in chess, but...

34
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,480
Hahaha. You can play against me at home. The match cost is 5,000 yen.

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,220
Eh? I'll hold back.

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,780
Then how about you guys?

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,180
I'll hold back too.

38
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,380
I also pass.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,040
Well, I'm not proud of it, but I haven't lost in chess since I was a child.

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,520
I haven't lost in chess since I was a child.

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,760
But there are some people who are better than you.

42
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,860
Ohara-buchou is so talented that he won in the main school's chess competition.

43
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,780
That's right. The captain's chess is full-scale.

44
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,080
What? I'm not good at it.

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,500
You're very confident.

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,960
Of course. Chess is the life of the flutter.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,920
Like that captain, I'm so stubborn...

48
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,760
Ohara-buchou!

49
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,120
I want to say that I'm not good at chess during my work, but I'll play against you.

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,480
Are you going to play with your senior?

51
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,760
Wow! This is a very interesting match.

52
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,020
It's not interesting just to play.

53
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,320
If I win, I'll have lunch over there for a month.

54
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,980
All right.

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,240
All right. I won't hold back.

56
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,320
Ohara-buchou

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,520
Ohara-buchou

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:08,580
Ohara-buchou

59
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:08,920
I'm going.

60
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,360
You can come from anywhere.

61
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,500
Ohara-buchou

62
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,300
Ohara-buchou

63
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,540
Ohara-buchou

64
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,760
The captain's expression has changed!

65
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,980
Ohara-buchou

66
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,440
Ohara-buchou

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,000
The captain is serious.

68
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,000
Ohara-buchou

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,680
Ohara-buchou

70
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,520
Ohara-buchou

71
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,460
Ohara-buchou

72
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,280
Ohara-buchou

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:54,360
Ohara-buchou

74
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,100
Ohara-buchou

75
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,860
Ohara-buchou

76
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,840
Ohara-buchou

77
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,240
Ohara-buchou

78
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,460
Ohara-buchou

79
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,620
Ohara-buchou

80
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,780
Ohara-buchou

81
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,460
Ohara-buchou

82
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,500
Ohara-buchou

83
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,040
Ohara-buchou

84
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,220
Ohara-buchou

85
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,580
Ohara-buchou

86
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,860
Chief, one more time!

87
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,180
It doesn't matter how many times I do it.

88
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,300
- Again, Ryo-san? - One more time!

89
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,580
- Senpai, that's... - Hey, one more time!

90
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,480
Ryo-chan.

91
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,420
One more time!

92
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,740
One more time!

93
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,840
One more time!

94
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,960
One more time!

95
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,320
- Stop it already. - Damn it!

96
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,100
I can't beat that chief no matter how many times I do it.

97
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,440
I'll drink to my fill today!

98
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,520
Chief.

99
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,100
Wait a minute.

100
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
Wait for me.

101
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,440
I'll give you 500 yen if you wait.

102
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,260
It'll double from the third time.

103
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:45,980
Okay?

104
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,600
No way.

105
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,540
Damn it, it's better than losing.

106
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,700
What are you doing, old man?

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
You can't tell, can you, old man?

108
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,880
Do I look like a cult?

109
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,220
Chief.

110
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,580
You're going to get in trouble.

111
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,160
Calm down, old man!

112
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,860
What?

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,760
What's up?

114
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,200
What's up?

115
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,100
What are you talking about?

116
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,300
Who do you think you are?

117
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,220
Who do you think you are?

118
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,540
You don't know my name?

119
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,620
You're so annoying.

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,480
I'm the king of the Ennai Shogunate.

121
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,020
Oh, it's me.

122
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,340
The child who was silent started crying.

123
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,280
Oh, good, good.

124
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,900
Good, good, good.

125
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,080
You're so annoying.

126
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,640
You're going to get in trouble.

127
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:37,960
But...

128
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,860
He's really good at it.

129
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,660
The king of the Ennai Shogunate, huh.

130
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,940
You're no good at personality,

131
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,520
so you're not good at Shogi.

132
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,820
Your Shogi is the best.

133
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,780
If you're upset, find a base.

134
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,100
Come to me step by step like this.

135
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,360
Then, with a special service,

136
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,260
I will show you my special skill!

137
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,620
I will cast a lightning storm!

138
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,880
Dragon's Mouth!

139
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,380
That's awesome!

140
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,020
This might be the real thing!

141
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,900
Please!

142
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,840
Make me your apprentice!

143
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,180
I really want to beat the chief!

144
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,720
Idiot!

145
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,680
The spirit of Shogi is the spirit of Fu.

146
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,140
Fu is Fu, meaning "to lose".

147
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,580
The spirit that wants to win will cause a disaster.

148
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,700
What?

149
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,500
Shogi starts with Fu and ends with Fu.

150
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,000
No matter how strong you are, you will eventually lose.

151
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,080
Master, I ask you again!

152
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,120
Please make me your apprentice!

153
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,040
Please, Master!

154
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,440
Do you want to be my apprentice?

155
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,500
Yes!

156
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,800
Then, first...

157
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,240
Yes!

158
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,140
I'll start with the bath!

159
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,100
What?

160
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,700
If you blow...

161
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,700
I didn't think there was anyone who used a bath like this.

162
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,860
Master, how is the floor?

163
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,060
It's hot!

164
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,340
It's hot!

165
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,460
If you blow, I'll clean the toilet.

166
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,200
Oh, my!

167
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,600
This is a mess!

168
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,140
If you blow, come to my room!

169
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,540
Yes!

170
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,140
Master, I think I can teach you Shogi in earnest!

171
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,160
Master, I'm coming in!

172
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,120
You're here.

173
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:51,900
Yes!

174
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,500
Next is the inner color of the inner pot.

175
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,160
What?

176
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,780
The bath, the toilet, and the inner pot...

177
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,920
I'm here to help you with Shogi!

178
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,560
Are you dissatisfied?

179
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,040
Because you always make me do things that have nothing to do with Shogi...

180
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,660
You idiot!

181
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,500
You!

182
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,620
You poor thing!

183
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,740
You have no skills at all!

184
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,780
I'm here to teach you the spirit of Shogi.

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,980
The spirit of Shogi?

186
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,820
As I said earlier, the spirit of Shogi is the spirit of the nation.

187
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,900
The nation begins and ends with the nation.

188
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,060
Think about what you've done so far.

189
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,540
What have I done?

190
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,200
Well...

191
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,580
First, I've done the bath, then the rice, and then the toilet.

192
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,520
And then the last one is the inner pot.

193
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,080
That is, the nation begins and ends with the nation.

194
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,100
What?

195
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,080
Don't make me look stupid!

196
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,900
Are you dissatisfied?

197
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,740
Of course!

198
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,580
If you don't teach me Shogi anymore, I'm going home!

199
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,760
If you're going to say that much, I'll teach you.

200
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,220
I'll teach you.

201
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,420
I'll teach you.

202
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Let me teach you that.

203
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,080
If I teach you that much, will you?

204
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,700
Of course I will.

205
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,780
Why don't you become my servant?

206
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,300
I'll teach you.

207
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,580
Oh, I gotcha!

208
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:19,600
Something's wrong with all of them.

209
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:19,680
That you can't laugh.

210
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,740
I can see it from so far away.

211
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,020
I'm scared.

212
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,780
Come on, boiling.

213
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,860
Gah!

214
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,860
Splendid!

215
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,240
You are the successor of the battle shogi that I have been waiting for!

216
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,220
What is battle shogi?

217
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,260
Look at this.

218
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,020
Battle shogi is a new game that combines traditional shogi and fighting.

219
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,040
The rules are simple.

220
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,460
You use a piece of iron to win.

221
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,060
The loser will be blown away by the explosion.

222
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:12,940
You cannot win with your ability, but this battle shogi is not a dream of a world champion.

223
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,700
World champion?

224
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,360
I am not crazy.

225
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,180
You are born to play battle shogi.

226
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,020
You are born to play battle shogi.

227
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,920
You are born to play battle shogi.

228
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,840
If you win, you will have a lot of prize money and a lot of money for the commercial.

229
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,880
You will also be a champion in the Olympic Games.

230
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,320
If that happens, I may also have a rich life.

231
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,420
Master, please teach me battle shogi.

232
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,980
The training is tough.

233
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,280
I will never cry.

234
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,020
Good for you.

235
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,180
Let's aim for the victory of battle shogi together!

236
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:47,920
Master!

237
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,120
This is...

238
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
No way...

239
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,260
No way...

240
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,920
No way...

241
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,580
You're going to win a battle shogi game that I have been planning.

242
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,040
Master!

243
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,000
Master!

244
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,620
Master!

245
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,380
Master!

246
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,220
Master!

247
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,560
Master!

248
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:14,820
Master!

249
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:14,940
Master!

250
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,440
Master!

251
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,520
Master!

252
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:15,760
Master!

253
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,420
Master!

254
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,000
Master!

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,140
- closet door - - toilet

256
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,420

257
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,360

263
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:00,860
Episode 1: The Battle of Nagasaki

264
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,760
Come on!

265
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,380
It's a match! Dynamite Nagasaki wins!

266
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,480
It's not a match, it's more like a combat.

267
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,620
This is perfect for Ryo.

268
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,980
This is not a match, it's more like a combat.

269
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,540
It's Ryo's turn.

270
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,880
Strong Kondo enters the red corner.

271
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,520
Ryo Tsukankichi enters the blue corner.

272
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,640
Ryo's turn.

273
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,060
Ryo, you can do it!

274
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,160
Ryo, you're going to win!

275
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,220
Kankichi, don't lose!

276
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,960
Listen, Kankichi.

277
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,960
If you use the techniques I taught you, you'll win.

278
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,540
Time limit 1 match.

279
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,600
About Ryo's position...

280
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,880
Sente Aoi!

281
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,460
Sente Aoi!

282
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,680
Time limit 1 match.

283
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,740
Start!

284
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,380
Let's go!

285
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,100
Sente Aoi!

286
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,700
Sente Aoi!

287
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,460
Sente Aoi!

288
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,480
Sente Aoi!

289
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:38,780
Sente Aoi!

290
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,380
Sente Aoi!

291
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,700
Sente Aoi!

292
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,580
Kankichi, use that!

293
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,980
That's it. Use that.

294
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,200
Fire!

295
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,300
Kenshin오 Inazuma!

296
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,780
Okay!

297
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,680
That's it!

298
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,400
OK!

299
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,200
It's a match! Ryo Ryo and Kanchi win!

300
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,340
Amazing! Ryo won!

301
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,520
Good job, Kanchi!

302
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,440
You idiot!

303
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:22,700
You idiot!

304
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,540
The second round! Red, Ryuo and Watanabe vs. Blue, Ryo and Kanchi!

305
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,700
Say my name.

306
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,160
Ryo, you're in trouble!

307
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,440
It's a match.

308
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
The power of Shogi is greater than Ryo's.

309
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,940
You're totally in trouble.

310
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,160
Don't hesitate, Kanchi.

311
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,560
This is the only way.

312
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,680
Higidaifunkacchabudai!

313
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,040
He's rearranging his moves as if he's the winner.

314
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,760
What a cowardly move.

315
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,120
The rules of battle Shogi are OK.

316
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,840
You start from the moment you rearrange your moves.

317
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,200
OK!

318
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,920
It's a match! Ryo and Kanchi win!

319
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,880
Amazing! It's a big turn!

320
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,800
The first round is over!

321
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,700
Red, Ryo and Kanchi vs. Blue, Dynamite Nagasaki!

322
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,220
You're strong! You're a killer!

323
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,920
What?

324
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,100
Daigai!

325
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,120
Ryo, how many moves?

326
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,040
Two!

327
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,940
Look at that!

328
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,460
So far so good.

329
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,580
Everything is so fast, Ryo.

330
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,220
I'll get you if you play seriously.

331
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,340
What about this?

332
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,320
Are you А déjà vu?

333
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,580
You fool!

334
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,480
What?

335
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,160
What?

336
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,140
Ote!

337
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,720
Good job Ryo-san!

338
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,180
Ryo-san!

339
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,300
Good job!

340
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,100
Ote!

341
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,580
Ote!

342
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,680
OK!

343
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,620
The two who are left in the final of the World Championship is...

344
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,660
The original Kamen Rider, Ryo-tsukanki!

345
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,620
You're the world champion Ryo-san!

346
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,040
Ryo-chan you're wonderful!

347
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,920
Senpai, do your best!

348
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,840
Just do whatever you want.

349
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,640
Kankichi, you can win with any hand you want!

350
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,380
The day has finally come.

351
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,780
The opponent is that fated rival.

352
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,300
And the opponent of this battle is...

353
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,720
The supreme Shishida Ryusei army!

354
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,600
Nagareboshi Ikketsu!

355
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,620
Kankichi!

356
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,080
Don't be careless.

357
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,800
The opponent is me.

358
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,160
The man who drove us into retirement.

359
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,180
Master!

360
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,200
Shoukaku, it's either you or me.

361
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,260
The one who loses this match will retire from the battle.

362
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,240
OK?

363
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,020
I'm looking forward to it Ikketsu!

364
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,740
And I can't let it be!

365
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,160
Hehe...

366
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,180
Hehehe...

367
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,540
You're already dead.

368
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,780
What?

369
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,540
That's right!

370
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,300
OK!

371
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:07,120
In that match, I defeated the One Iron Sky Thunderstrike!

372
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,420
*Strike*

373
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,880
*Strike*

374
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,640
*Strike*

375
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,720
*Strike*

376
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:13,980
*Shot*

377
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,180
*Shot*

378
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,100
*Shot*

379
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,360
*Shot*

380
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,380
*Shot*

381
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,860
*Shot*

382
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,620
*Urace will come *

383
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,760
The fact that you were able to establish a bond between me and my disciple all this long;

384
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,820
it is truly an eternal pact!

385
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,260
Master, I will take that revenge for you!

386
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,200
You can destroy that as much as you want to.

387
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,720
The final battle will be held here, in the special ring built on the Sumida River.

388
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,820
The winning piece used in the final battle is 100 kilograms.

389
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,840
The battle on this river where there is no place to run or help is exactly the battle between Musashi and Kojiro on Ganryu Island.

390
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,640
-Hakushii! -Ryo-chan!

391
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,000
-Ryo-san! -Will Ryo and Musashi win?

392
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,440
The winner is Nagareboshi Kojiro!

393
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,680
Kankichi, come at me as hard as you can!

394
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,220
If the winning piece is in the ring, then I won't be able to use the cat's eye, the mid-air spin, or the big wave chabudai.

395
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,580
Hehehe.

396
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,620
Hahahaha.

397
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,540
You're already dead.

398
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,480
Wow! The final line of the Nagareboshi-I-Tetsu is already out!

399
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:51,080
The final line of the Nagareboshi-I-Tetsu is already out!

400
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,600
The final line of the Nagareboshi-I-Tetsu is already out!

401
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,920
The final line of the Nagareboshi-I-Tetsu is already out!

402
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,200
The battle is already on fire!

403
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,920
I can't even open my eyes!

404
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,120
Oh, no! Nagareboshi-I-Tetsu has taken over the corner of Ryōzu Kankichi!

405
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,520
Ugh...

406
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,220
Damn it.

407
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,440
Yeah, it's pretty tough.

408
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,060
You seem to be using your stamina more intensely than me.

409
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,300
Take this!

410
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,160
Sky-Fall of the Sky!

411
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,120
Big Wave Chabudai!

412
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,160
T-This is...!

413
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,820
A giant whirlwind created a huge whirlwind!

414
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,760
A giant whirlwind created a huge whirlwind!

415
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,880
That's right!

416
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,060
The first one!

417
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,440
It completed that giant whirlwind!

418
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:42,980
The first one!

419
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,760
It completed that giant whirlwind!

420
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,120
See?

421
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,380
Kankichi, that's a dummy!

422
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,600
What?

423
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,620
What?

424
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,040
What?

425
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,800
What?

426
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,400
What?

427
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:00,820
What?

428
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,020
What?

429
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,740
What?

430
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:01,900
What?

431
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,580
What?

432
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,720
What?

433
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,080
Ryo got caught!

434
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,040
Ryo-chan!

435
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:12,140
んでfinitive

436
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,440
This is intense!

437
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,480
Attack them!

438
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,340
Kankichi!

439
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,580
Stand up!

440
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,320
Don't stop, Kankichi!

441
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,740
Stand up and find your glory, Kankichi!

442
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,540
I promise to finish you off!

443
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,120
If you're not here,

444
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,700
then I'm gonna let you win!

445
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:32,840
Hmph!

446
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,740
It's a waste of time!

447
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,440
He stood up!

448
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,940
Ryo Tsukakichi!

449
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,680
He's gone to hell!

450
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,440
Now it's my last chance!

451
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,220
What?

452
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
What was that, Ryo Tsukakichi?

453
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,480
He was wearing a silver ring underneath his grave!

454
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,900
Hmph!

455
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:00,980
He's gone!

456
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,360
He's the one who's screaming as he's destroying a metal device!

457
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,260
The game starts and ends with a fail!

458
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,640
Let's go, Hi!

459
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,740
Shinku Datsunaki Otoshi!

460
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,200
Ryujin no Mai!

461
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,140
I won't let you do that!

462
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,200
Shinku Inazuna Otoshi!

463
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,940
The Great Uzu no Naki Version!

464
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,340
What?

465
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,060
Whoa!

466
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,940
Let's go!

467
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,140
The game's on!

468
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,600
Ryo Tsukakichi wins!

469
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,760
Ryo-san wins!

470
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,660
That's awesome, Ryo-chan!

471
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,840
Senpai, you're the best in the world!

472
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,100
Kankichi!

473
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,520
You did it!

474
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,260
You finally paid for your grudge against the stone.

475
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,880
Let's see!

476
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:15,740
What?

477
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,720
What's this?

478
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,480
W-what just happened?!

479
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,360
The iron rod cracked due to the impact of the battle!

480
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:38,300
S-s-save me, please!

481
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,820
I'm sick of this game!

482
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,800
To Be Continued

483
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,200
10 games, 5 times, 3 times, rock, paper, scissors, go!

484
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,920
10 games, 10 games, 5 times, 3 times, rock, paper, scissors, go!

485
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,220
Always sandals, always scandals, don't worry about it

486
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,960
Play the tunnel, everyday

487
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,840
Tiredness, I rolled it up in the end, threw it in the hole

488
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,460
Thin-legged instinct, a

489
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,360
stupid whipping instinct

490
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,300
Am I a fool?

491
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,720
