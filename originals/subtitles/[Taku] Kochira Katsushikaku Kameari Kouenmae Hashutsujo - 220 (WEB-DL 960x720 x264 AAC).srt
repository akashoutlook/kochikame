ternamentale

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,860
When you watch the TV, bright the room and look away

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:23,800
For those who have no money, come to me

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,280
Come here!

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,980
I'm not here, but I'm worried

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,760
Look at the blue sky

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,900
White clouds

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,160
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

9
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but I'm worried

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,420
Look at the red clouds

11
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:17,680
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,380
I know, I know, I know

13
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,780
I'm not here, but I'm worried

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,300
If you know, just follow me quietly!

ê² 

16
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,340
That's the way.

17
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,340
That's the way.

18
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,480
That's the way.

19
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,080
So, I think there was a potholder I want.

20
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,840
I think there was a potholder I want.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,060
You did not call for a phone call today?

22
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,060
Hey, the phone call!

23
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,580
Show me

24
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,000
you did not call for a phone call today?

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,020
you are the one who tied the kebab

26
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,100
What's wrong?

27
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,060
I'm talking about you.

28
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,500
You did some bad business with hackers and the internet.

29
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,780
Sorry.

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,380
The computer course will be held in Katsushika today,

31
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,520
so I was invited as a teacher.

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,240
What?

33
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:35,920
You're a teacher of elementary school?

34
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,320
Plus is a professional hyper elementary school student

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,440
when it comes to computers.

36
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,200
Thank you for coming, Mr. Deng.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,980
Mr. Deng, you're here.

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,120
Welcome to the Katsushika library.

39
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,980
What's wrong with you?

40
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,260
You're a poor student.

41
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,860
Plus is a professional hyper elementary school student.

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,800
Aren't you embarrassed as a police officer?

43
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,220
Shut up!

44
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,880
Today, I'm going to teach Mr. Deng the internet

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,280
so that the old man and I can understand it.

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,080
What's wrong with this?

47
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,440
That's right.

48
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,860
The world is in the age of the opponent.

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,120
The opponent?

50
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,780
You don't even know the opponent?

51
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,340
You're the worst.

52
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,960
That's why you're no good.

53
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,780
Is the opponent supposed to be IT?

54
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,120
What?

55
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,400
What?

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,020
Is IT the IT of the IT revolution?

57
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,580
Yes, that's IT.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,840
So it's not IT, it's IT.

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,060
Don't say that.

60
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,000
Then do you know what IT means?

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,740
That's...

62
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,100
Mr. Ohara's touch.

63
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,020
What?

64
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,720
No way.

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,460
Did you intend to learn the internet without knowing that?

66
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,460
Don't make fun of me.

67
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,260
IT...

68
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,960
No, when it comes to IT...

69
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,180
When it comes to IT?

70
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:55,880
Yes.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,440
I want to meet you soon!

72
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,460
What?

73
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,160
I want to meet you soon!

74
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,920
Information Technology.

75
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
It's information technology based on computers.

76
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,340
No way.

77
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,980
Mr. Ohara was about to say that too.

78
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,400
Did he slip away?

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,100
The joke you wanted to accept, I'm afraid it slipped away.

80
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,500
Really?

81
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,720
That's a common sense.

82
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,000
That's an Chan-shinkin common sense.

83
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,080
No, today's joke slipped away.

84
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,760
No, it was quite interesting.

85
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,640
Plus, I don't know the computer

86
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,580
I don't know the character

87
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,780
I don't know the joke

88
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,960
Mr. Ohara's teacher is difficult.

89
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,520
Isn't he?

90
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,800
Really remember me.

91
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,120
If you do, you can be a good customer of my company

92
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,480
and my father's company's products.

93
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,440
And I'll be a good customer.

94
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,900
It's a comment that I don't think is very elementary school.

95
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,900
Anyway, please come here, Mr. Electrician.

96
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,760
Mr. Ohara, please bring the land cell.

97
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,140
Yes.

98
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,840
No, it's okay.

99
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,260
No, I'm sorry.

100
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,420
No, it's not.

101
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:05,460
Mr. Ohara.

102
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,760
That's why I said it was okay.

103
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,460
What? You developed a new hyperland cell again?

104
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,140
Yes.

105
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,840
The security system has been improved to operate as if only the person other than the person touched it.

106
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,860
I have a computer that is like a workstation.

107
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,300
The mecha is solid.

108
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,980
There are no notebooks or pencils.

109
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,700
I can type everything on the keyboard, so I don't have any paper or pencils.

110
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,360
What do you do when you catch a cold and go to school?

111
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,820
In the past,

112
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,640
Chiki-chi!

113
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,260
Let me transfer the notes!

114
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,340
We don't do that.

115
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,300
We borrow data from friends when we need it.

116
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,940
Let me take the data.

117
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,900
No.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,820
It's going to change.

119
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,640
Oh, there's a solo version.

120
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,980
Solo version?

121
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,600
The solo version has left and right finger movements different from the keyboard, so it's good for finger movement.

122
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,220
The more you use your fingers, the better.

123
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,680
You're particular about strange things.

124
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,560
Mr. Electrician, please give me an instruction.

125
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:06,740
I'll answer you.

126
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,360
All right.

127
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,580
I got stoned.

128
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,100
It takes three minutes to complete this.

129
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,280
I have to go to school after this, so I have to hurry.

130
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,840
I leave the rest up to you.

131
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,220
I'm interested to know how you teach people.

132
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,880
Nagagawa, let's take a look inside.

133
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:25,980
Okay.

134
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,000
No.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,940
No, it's not that easy for that mecha-stupid old man to understand the internet.

136
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,140
Even if this is impossible for him, I think he can climb up to the sixth level of Mt. Fuji.

137
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,060
He explains it well in other places, so that's a given.

138
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,320
He's not cute.

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,840
More importantly, I've overdone 5 minutes more than I planned.

140
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,380
Can you speed up so that I can make it to the school?

141
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,140
Huh? You hyper-young kid, Nakagawa, speed up more.

142
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,680
Yes, sir.

143
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,480
Wait, Nakagawa! Fly!

144
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,960
- You... - I won't take your time!

145
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,740
Lemon!

146
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,840
Oh, Kankichi.

147
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,660
What are you doing here?

148
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,340
This dog injured his leg and is bleeding.

149
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,880
What should I do?

150
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,300
I'll take you to the hospital.

151
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,080
Okay. I'll take you to the hospital.

152
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,240
Kankichi...

153
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,960
- Nakagawa! - Did you call me?

154
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,700
Nakagawa, go to the nearby dog hospital. I understand.

155
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,580
Wait a minute. My...

156
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,560
What's going to happen to the school?

157
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,720
It's an emergency!

158
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,940
Which is more important, your wound or your school?

159
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,680
I'm sorry I'm in a hurry. I really want to save the puppy.

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,360
I'm sorry I'm in a hurry. I really want to save the puppy.

161
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,640
I'm so sorry!

162
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,240
Nagagawa, help her!

163
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,320
Come back!

164
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,980
Nakagawa, help her!

165
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,040
Why did you call me?

166
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,320
I was worried about you.

167
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,520
What?

168
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,240
Why did you call me?

169
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,300
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,320
What's going on?

171
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,920
If you don't help me, I'm not going to save you.

172
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,320
I am not afraid of any dogÂ´s barking.

173
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,360
You don't say.

174
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,080
Yeah!

175
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,460
That's good.

176
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,240
The owner got in touch with you right away.

177
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,600
Yeah, I wrote his phone number on my necklace.

178
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,580
He called me and ran away in 5 minutes.

179
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,440
Oh, an email.

180
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,920
Who's that girl?

181
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,760
Is it your email?

182
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,880
She's right in front of you. Let go of her!

183
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,240
Ghiboshi Lemon.

184
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,220
She's my relative who lives in Kanda.

185
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,560
How old are you?

186
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,080
Don't ask me in the mail every day!

187
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,040
Ask me yourself!

188
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,000
Say hello properly!

189
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,120
Geez...

190
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,440
You're a salaried man, aren't you?

191
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,480
10?

192
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,600
It's not 10, it's a plus.

193
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,060
It's an electric pole plus.

194
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,940
Listen to the email address.

195
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,680
Don't send me emails every day!

196
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,120
Ask me yourself!

197
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,720
Please.

198
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,060
Lemon, do you have a cell phone?

199
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,900
Plus is asking.

200
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,860
Don't make Nakagawa your messenger.

201
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,900
I have one.

202
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,760
I'll lend you some.

203
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,500
It's okay.

204
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,420
I'll just send you a text message.

205
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,880
I'll send you a message.

206
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:56,960
Huh?

207
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,640
I'll send you a text message.

208
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,020
Thank you.

209
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,480
You're welcome.

210
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,020
Hello?

211
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,940
Did you send me an email with the company address

212
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,040
because you got an idea for a new software?

213
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,000
Got it.

214
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,580
I'll check it now.

215
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,080
I see.

216
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,600
It's pretty interesting.

217
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,740
Let's consider it at the next project meeting.

218
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,460
He's like an adult.

219
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,560
He has three companies.

220
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,140
He's one of them!

221
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,080
And now you tell me one part of it.

222
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,680
How do you think?

223
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,420
I know the answer.

224
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,900
I'll buy one of them.

225
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,080
But I have kids.

226
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,540
And I have three.

227
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:33,980
That's all I need.

228
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,820
How old are you and the girls?

229
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:36,900
Up to four years.

230
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,960
Four years.

231
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,880
I think that Lemon, who knows the taste of food with one bite, is also a very strange kindergarten child.

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,880
Lemon-chan, since you're here, let's send you to Kanda's house.

233
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,020
I'll do it.

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,540
Huh?

235
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,920
He's a big fan of historical dramas.

236
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,680
I see...

237
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,680
Hello?

238
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,140
Something's wrong. It's off again.

239
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,500
It's off again...

240
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,140
Lemon, the bath's open. What's wrong?

241
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,140
I got a call from earlier, but it's off again when I get to the second floor.

242
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,640
Is it a prank call?

243
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,580
It's an e-mail, isn't it? Let me borrow it for a moment.

244
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,400
I knew it.

245
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,840
Who is it?

246
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,000
Electricity 10?

247
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,220
It's a plus.

248
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,460
It's not 10, it's a plus.

249
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,340
What's wrong with the plus?

250
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,140
There are many e-mails from a person called "plus."

251
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
Hmm, what does that e-mail mean?

252
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,020
It means that you can exchange letters on your mobile phone or computer.

253
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,320
If it's a letter, it's okay. But the plus is a really strange thing.

254
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,900
mail is sent every day, so Lemon is confused."

255
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,880
Every day?

256
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,820
"Every two hours, he asks me what kind of flowers I like, such as the date of birth, the blood type, and so on."

257
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,840
Perhaps Plus fell in love with Lemon-chan.

258
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,300
No way. Plus is 9 years old and Lemon is still 5 years old.

259
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,700
Oh, I don't think it has anything to do with love.

260
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:40,380
Lemon doesn't know how to send an email, so can't you tell him that it's useless to send an email?

261
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,940
Yeah, I'll do it.

262
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,700
His kimono is cute, too.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,980
What are you doing?

264
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,160
What are you doing? You came into my room without permission.

265
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,640
I knocked it properly. If you want, I'll knock you again.

266
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,280
Is that OK?

267
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,140
What do you want?

268
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,860
Oh, well, that's.

269
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,240
It seems that you have finally developed a sense of a normal boy.

270
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,520
There's nothing more to say that I'm doing normal.

271
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,600
What do you mean?

272
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,760
When I think about Lemon, I can't do anything.

273
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,180
rawn

274
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,940
The heart pounds.

275
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,320
Why do you know that?

276
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,240
You're not sick?

277
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,080
Don't worry.

278
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,040
If a boy falls in love, everyone falls in love.

279
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,460
I was like that when I was a kid.

280
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,540
Love...

281
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,620
I have a big strike zone.

282
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,460
From the cute "Micchan" to the cute "Tome"

283
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,460
Is this what love is?

284
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,080
So, why did you come here?

285
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,740
I know you like lemons.

286
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,120
Don't send me emails.

287
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,040
Don't send me emails.

288
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,780
He usually replies to me, but he doesn't reply at all.

289
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,380
Of course. He has a cell phone for security.

290
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,460
I don't send emails.

291
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,500
Oh, really?

292
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,640
I was worried that you would hate me.

293
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,260
I heard about your youth and hobbies in the mail.

294
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,800
I want to know about that directly.

295
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,480
That's...

296
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,320
That's right.

297
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,240
You are my relative, so ask Lemon.

298
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,640
Don't say the same thing.

299
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,400
Why do I have to ask?

300
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,720
If you give me an answer, I'll give you a laptop.

301
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:36,780
What?

302
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,460
Really?

303
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:38,900
Yes.

304
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,300
It doesn't matter if it's a laptop or not.

305
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,580
I see.

306
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,660
I see.

307
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,760
So, what should I ask?

308
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,320
I'll send you a question from the computer.

309
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,160
Please wait.

310
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,420
Good.

311
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,380
Please answer all 50 questions.

312
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:58,780
Please.

313
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,920
Okay, leave it to me.

314
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,940
What's your favorite flower?

315
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,860
My favorite flower is a tulip.

316
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,760
Then, the last question.

317
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,160
What's your favorite type of man?

318
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,800
Well, that's no comment.

319
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,860
No comment.

320
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,320
Thank you for your cooperation.

321
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,360
See you.

322
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,540
See you.

323
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,940
Hey, you two, make a good love.

324
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,020
Huh?

325
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,140
Hey, Plus, what are you doing there?

326
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,040
I was dumped by Lemon.

327
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,160
What?

328
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,360
What?

329
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,380
I asked Lemon to go out with me many times, but he didn't say yes.

330
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,460
You're good! Did you meet him directly and talk to him?

331
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,760
No, I didn't.

332
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,780
I put the answers to 50 questions you asked me in the computer

333
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,240
and made a love simulation of you and me.

334
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,760
A love simulation? It seems like it's a plus.

335
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,180
So, no matter how many times I do it, Lemon will give me a hard time.

336
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,540
Hmm, that sounds interesting. Let me see that simulation.

337
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:33,180
Huh? It's a real-time one.

338
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,320
First, the date is a movie.

339
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
A historical drama that Lemon likes.

340
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,360
I know what Lemon likes.

341
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,760
Next is the meal.

342
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,840
Lemon is noisy about taste.

343
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,100
It's okay. There's a data of super-unique taste.

344
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,480
Hmm, you're holding it down.

345
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,580
Next is the zoo above for Lemon who likes animals.

346
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,440
I've only done the research beforehand, so it's not easy.

347
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,720
Oh, it's evening.

348
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,560
This is Odaiba.

349
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,500
You're pretty good.

350
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,100
I looked at the sunset on the Ferris wheel of Odaiba and gave her her favorite tulip bouquet.

351
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,200
She even make a confession to me that she'll go out with me.

352
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,720
However...

353
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,080
I was dumped in the street.

354
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,020
I was dumped in the street.

355
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,380
What is this?

356
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,100
What's wrong with the input?

357
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,380
It's a lonely game.

358
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,920
All right, enough!

359
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,520
It's not a game.

360
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,500
Don't be disappointed in this kind of simulation game.

361
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,460
But...

362
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,620
I have a lot of love experience.

363
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,240
I have a lot of experience.

364
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,080
Men should hit each other directly and crush them.

365
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
But you're a loner, aren't you?

366
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,200
If you hit me, I'll crush you.

367
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,820
Ugh!

368
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,500
Shut up! You're too much!

369
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,600
Anyway, meet Lemon directly,

370
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,000
talk about your feelings and ask him to go out with you.

371
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,600
No! That's impossible!

372
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,880
I can't talk to him when I see his face.

373
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
He's always so cheeky but he's so pathetic.

374
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,060
Then write a letter.

375
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,700
Write a letter.

376
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,900
I don't have anything to write.

377
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,620
It's all keyboard input.

378
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,440
What kind of elementary school student are you?

379
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,300
Here.

380
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,760
I'll lend you something from the post office.

381
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,840
Write it.

382
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,980
Are you going to write with a brush?

383
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,900
Lemon likes to write about the times.

384
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,280
I think he'll have a good feeling about a letter from the department.

385
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,140
I've never written since I was in kindergarten.

386
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,080
That's right.

387
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,360
I used the Word Pro's library as a reference.

388
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,700
What are you doing? Don't rely on such things.

389
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,200
It doesn't matter if you're poor.

390
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,220
It's important to write with your feelings.

391
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,320
I understand.

392
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,200
Okay.

393
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,600
Then, I'll clean the fax.

394
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,940
No! You hand it over to Lemon.

395
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,080
What? By chance?

396
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,260
Of course!

397
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:14,340
Of course!

398
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
You can't put it in the post office.

399
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,360
No!

400
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,300
Then, I'll put it in Lemon's room.

401
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:20,960
What if you get hurt?

402
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,920
If you come this far, you'll be hungry.

403
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,840
Miss, Ichiro-san has brought a guest.

404
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,580
Yes, pass it.

405
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,900
Excuse me.

406
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,800
Please, take your time.

407
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,440
Wait!

408
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,180
It's 4 o'clock.

409
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,440
Don't go home!

410
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,600
You've got a human-like behavior for the first time.

411
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,260
Sit down.

412
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,440
What's wrong, Kankichi?

413
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,200
Lemon is...

414
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,940
I told you not to talk in e-mail.

415
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,380
Here, give me the letter you wrote.

416
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,260
Hurry up!

417
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,360
Shut up and give it to me!

418
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,160
Are you a Karakuri Doll?

419
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,080
You always say something so selfish.

420
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,980
You talk too much in front of your favorite girl.

421
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,860
Kankichi.

422
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,400
What?

423
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,900
You stopped your computer again.

424
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,960
Not again.

425
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,980
I'll buy a new one.

426
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,980
If you don't mind, I'll fix it.

427
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,540
Huh?

428
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,260
It's not working because it's full of capacity.

429
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,460
I'm cleaning the inside of the computer with Defrag now.

430
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,520
You don't have to buy a new one.

431
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,160
It's OK.

432
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,760
I'll delete the data I don't need and make an empty capacity.

433
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,500
It's enough.

434
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,140
You don't have to buy a new one.

435
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,100
I see.

436
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,560
Oh, it seems to be fixed.

437
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,260
I can still add memory.

438
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,260
So I'll add my computer's memory.

439
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,540
Let's add 20GB of hard disk.

440
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,200
Please.

441
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
You're so knowledgeable.

442
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,580
You're a junior high school student.

443
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,040
I'm not just a junior high school student.

444
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,340
I run three software companies.

445
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,420
Oh.

446
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,240
But I like a girl like you.

447
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,420
I'm going to see Kabuki next week.

448
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,320
Will you come with me?

449
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,080
Huh?

450
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,780
You're invited to a date.

451
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,180
Say yes or no or say yes or no.

452
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,660
Oh.

453
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:38,940
Don't reply to e-mail.

454
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,420
I see.

455
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,500
I just come by when I have a condition.

456
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,580
May I?

457
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,760
Condition?

458
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,700
Safely

459
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,920
Only on Lemon's side...

460
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,280
Only on Lemon's side...

461
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,620
Why does it have to be your side to come here with the troublemakers that is such names?

462
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,040
Wait!

463
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,900
I'm sleeping with some troublemakers!

464
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,660
What a great chance!

465
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,700
Monster, send Lemon his favorite gender.

466
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,780
N- No!

467
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,340
I'm too shy to listen!

468
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,160
Oh yeah, why not send this by e-mail?

469
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,160
Or, via text mail.

470
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,040
And no calligraphy, no ink.

471
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,640
Plus, what's up?

472
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,480
Um, um...

473
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,260
Lemon, please tell me your favorite type of man.

474
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,420
He's like Kankichi.

475
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,800
Is it over already?

476
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,880
Oh my god!

477
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,460
System error. Please restart.

478
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:34,460
Subtitle by Subdiver

479
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:44,020
So I walked through the dark side of the Akegai

480
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:52,680
Everyone was a child once, but they all forget

481
00:24:52,680 --> 00:25:00,600
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above their eyes

482
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,040
I'll turn that corner

483
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,300
I can see everyone

484
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,920
There is a wall

485
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,420
There must be a wall

486
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,300
Everyone come to our town

487
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,400
Thank you!

488
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,620
What is this old man?

489
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,620
A new policeman?

490
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,720
Although he is old, I am older than him

491
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,300
I will tell you everything, so follow me

492
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,780
Next time, a wonderful story of the super old policeman

493
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,860
Thank you!

494
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:00,880
Thank you!
