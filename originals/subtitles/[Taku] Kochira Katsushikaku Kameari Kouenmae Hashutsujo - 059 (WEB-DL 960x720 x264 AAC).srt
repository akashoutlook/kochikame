English Translation:

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:13,560
A starry sky blooms on the inner palette

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:24,460
I kick the stone, then the shoes fly off

4
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:33,300
I wonder if I should go to the gym I was saving up for

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,080
I was laughed at as it was

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,480
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,000
There are only patsushika and Kameari

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape that doesn't change even one yawn is strangely kind

9
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,420
Please give me that

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,000
From the drain of the

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,400
Tungari Boshi

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,960
to Taishakuten

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,120
the sunset falls

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,880
Why does tomorrow end like this

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,960
Katsushika and Shibamata

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,660
People often say they only lose

17
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,900
But I didn't mean that

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,480
So stupid

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,200
Matsutake guard, guests!

20
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,660
Fantastic!!

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,560
Delicious! This is the paradise of this world!

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,740
Hey, Ichidou!

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,440
Z Пон let's fight!

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,380
Connection!

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,680
Look! It's Kyoto's best-selling Matsutake!

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,660
One kilogram, 100,000 yen!

27
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,840
It smells pretty good.

28
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,560
Mmm, it really does.

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,480
So this is the scent of Matsutake!

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,240
It's Canada's imported Matsutake, but it's one kilogram, 8,000 yen.

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,260
It's cheap.

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,300
It's cheap.

33
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,340
Speaking of the best-selling Matsutake of the autumn season,

34
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,320
it's the one that's eaten first in the spring.

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,180
You guys should be grateful for just looking at it.

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,220
I'll cook a Matsutake of one kilogram, 100,000 yen from now on.

37
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,660
While I was coming here, I saw the people lining up in the yard.

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,840
We all came here to taste the roasted Matsutake.

39
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,800
It seems that there are also imported Matsutake from Europe.

40
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:42,860
Yeah.

41
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,700
Thanks to that, we citizens can easily enjoy the Matsutake.

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,840
Actually, I'd like to go to Binchotan,

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,300
but at this time, it's like an imported product.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,420
I'll just use gas.

45
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,680
So, from now on, I'll cook a Matsutake of one kilogram, 100,000 yen

46
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,060
at Binchotan!

47
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,100
Everyone, I'll serve the scent of Matsutake for free

48
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,420
in exchange for your little delay.

49
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,480
Matsutake!

50
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,000
Matsutake!

51
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:11,820
Shut up!

52
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:11,920
I'll go!

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,580
Think that the scent alone is not enough!

54
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,160
Wow, what a great scent!

55
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,600
Be careful not to burn yourself.

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,520
Okay.

57
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,600
Yum!

58
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,300
Yum!

Yum!

69

Yum!

70
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,140
Yum!

71
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,480
Yum!

72

Yum!

80
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:43,580
Yum!

81
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,040
Yum!

82
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,180
Yum!

83

Yum!

89
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,360

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:51,840
Yum!

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,120
Yum!

92
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,720
Here it is.

93
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,080
Um, sir?

94
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,780
Can I bring some home?

95
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,580
I feel bad for the family if I eat alone.

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,560
Oh, that's fine.

97
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,640
You're a family man, aren't you?

98
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:10,900
Really?

99
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,880
Yeah.

100
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,940
Well, shall we eat?

101
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,680
Let's eat!

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,600
Hey! It's a shiitake!

103
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
Ryotsu!

104
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,920
No way! Why?

105
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,480
There's so much shiitake!

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,120
Don't mix it!

107
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,920
What's wrong, Ryotsu?

108
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,280
Did you bring some shiitake too?

109
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,120
Uh...

110
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,280
I don't know what's going on.

111
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,940
Chief Ohara bought some for us.

112
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,740
He bought some for Mr. Kanada.

113
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,960
Mr. Kanada?

114
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,360
Here, Ryotsu.

115
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,480
Let's eat while it's hot.

116
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,140
Wait!

117
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,860
What's wrong, Su-senpai?

118
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm not kidding!

119
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,440
Don't be with the chief's stingy milkman!

120
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,740
Stingy?

121
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,600
My shiitake costs 100,000 yen a kilo!

122
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,100
I'll buy it!

123
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,620
It's the best thing I've ever had!

124
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,140
100,000 yen a kilo?

125
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,840
That's right!

126
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,020
It's different from what the poor people eat!

127
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,320
Then, why don't you choose the shiitake you bought yourself?

128
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,100
What do you mean by that?

129
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,200
I don't know which shiitake costs 100,000 yen!

130
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,180
It looks similar, but it smells completely different.

131
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,400
You bought a high-priced shiitake, so you have a good taste in price, don't you?

132
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,180
Right, Ryotsu?

133
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,480
Uh...

134
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,940
You have to eat it quickly, or it'll cool down.

135
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,360
I'll eat it.

136
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,520
Hey, Reiko!

137
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,240
Oh, this is...

138
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,780
Huh?

139
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,480
Sorry, Ryotsu.

140
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,900
What do you mean by sorry?

141
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,760
The chief asked me to eat your shiitake!

142
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,260
Don't say that.

143
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,320
You brought it here on purpose because you wanted to eat it with everyone, didn't you?

144
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,020
Huh?

145
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,820
Uh...

146
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,620
That's...

147
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,920
Oh, that's right.

148
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,720
Huh?

149
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,840
Nagagawa, you!

150
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,600
As expected, high-priced shiitakes have a different scent.

151
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,320
Really?

152
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,620
It's delicious.

153
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,760
Right?

154
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,500
Hey!

155
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,860
You're eating my shiitake!

156
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,120
If you don't eat it quickly, you'll lose your senior's share.

157
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,840
I know!

158
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,300
Uh...

159
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,600
Is it a domestic product or a imported product?

160
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,100
Which one is the best?

161
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,600
All right!

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,620
This one!

163
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,780
Hmm?

164
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,920
Oh, my!

165
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,720
The inside of my mouth is full of it.

166
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,280
Oh!

167
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,060
Mr. Kanata, you look delicious, too.

168
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,800
You can eat imported products, too, can't you?

169
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,380
Damn it.

170
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,440
This time...

171
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,340
Oh, my!

172
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,200
This is the real one!

173
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,340
Wait for the imported one, Ryo-chan.

174
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,080
If this goes on like this, I'll get hit by a lot of bad shiitakes!

175
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,940
I can't taste it anymore!

176
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,760
Mr. Ryo.

177
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,480
You're a good boy.

178
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You only eat imported products.

179
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,120
I don't even know what it tastes like, but I do shopping without knowing the taste of it.

180
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,480
Give it back!

181
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,140
Give me back my 100,000 yen!

182
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,800
Yoshinori-chan, what are you looking at?

183
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,260
opinion

184
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,480
Mr. Matsutake is a living corpse.

185
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,780
Mr. Matsutake has a 10-ienie omelet.

186
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,980
International Food has a 10-ienie omelet.

187
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,620
Oharabuchi has a 10-ienie omelet.

188
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,940
He's been living like that for more than four hours!

189
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,900
Hmm...

190
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,680
I feel sorry for him.

191
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,540
Don't be reduce.

192
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,160
He has eaten a lot of your shiitakes, Ryo-chan.

193
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,060
I know, but...

194
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,280
I have one, chief. It's a special for Ryo.

195
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,740
Ryo's?

196
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,220
"Aki no Kouraku ni Matsutake Gari"

197
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,620
I was thinking of going with my family, but I got a lot of matsutake earlier.

198
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,660
Besides, I thought this was for Ryo.

199
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,740
That's right. If you're a senior, you might be able to get back as much as we ate.

200
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,480
So if Ryo's mood gets better, it'll be cheap, right?

201
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,920
I guess so.

202
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,680
That's right. If you keep this up, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

203
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,040
You have two hours. We'll take them all!

204
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,740
Ryo!

205
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,420
Leave it to me.

206
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,560
Mr. Ryo!

207
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,500
I don't care if it's a mountain or a river, my bike is worth a thousand dollars!

208
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,160
All right, that's what I'm talking about. Let's do it!

209
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,580
It seems like you're in a good mood. That's good, chief.

210
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,820
Let's go to the Matsutake Gari course, Mr. Ohara.

211
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,560
I'm Matsukichi Takeyama, the owner of this area.

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes, please.

213
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,860
Well, let's go.

214
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,300
Hey, you! Get off the bike from here!

215
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:43,580
Get off!

216
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,940
What?

217
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,060
I got it.

218
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,700
What's wrong with this guy? He's got a strange customer.

219
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,340
Hey, old man. What's the Matsutake Mountain season right?

220
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,220
Well, I started it to sell my land.

221
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,200
Oh?

222
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,860
Matsuri.

223
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,280
I met him because he didn't have any customers.

224
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,940
I'll give him the land I've been waiting for.

225
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,520
Oh, that's a good idea.

226
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,180
Huh?

227
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,800
The land is worth three hectares of land that was put on the rope.

228
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,560
That's a lot.

229
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,320
Now, the rights of this Akamatsu forest, which can harvest a lot of matsutake, is only 150,000 yen.

230
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,240
It's a good deal to come here every season.

231
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,700
So, if you can get more than 150,000 matsutake, you can make a profit.

232
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,860
But, I don't see any important matsutake.

233
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,840
No, it's not like that.

234
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,120
Last year, I got a lot of matsutake on the mountain next to me and it was on the newspaper.

235
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,700
It's almost a million yen.

236
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,660
A million?

237
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,120
What?

238
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,380
What?

239
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,900
What's this?

240
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,240
Is this true?

241
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,060
Is it really a million?

242
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,060
It depends on the area and age, but no matter how little it is, it's double the amount of the lent.

243
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,380
Chief!

244
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,660
Let's stop hunting matsutake and do it here.

245
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,720
But 150,000 yen is a big budget over.

246
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
You heard what I said, right?

247
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,240
150,000 yen paid will be at least 300,000 yen and come back.

248
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,100
I hate such a gamble.

249
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,440
Huh?

250
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,120
Even though it's a chance to make money, Chief Maihon!

251
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,680
Good!

252
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,700
Chief, how is your grandson Daisuke doing?

253
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,460
Daisuke?

254
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,360
Daisuke must be happy.

255
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,240
If he runs around the mountain with his grandfather.

256
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,560
I see.

257
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,100
This is a contract.

258
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,300
Just sign and pay contract and it's okay.

259
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,920
Ah ...

260
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,820
I'd better think more about it first.

261
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,480
You still say that, eh?

262
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,940
Shut up!

263
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,700
Idiot.

264
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,320
What are you saying, idiot?

265
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,900
Senpai, don't you think 150,000 yen is too cheap for such a size?

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,020
It's not sure if there's any matsutake.

267
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,800
Huh?

268
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,120
Then, we just need to have more than 150,000 yen worth of matsutake, right?

269
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,840
The root of the red pine is the point where the matsutake is put in.

270
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,400
All right!

271
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,360
Hey, Ryosu! What are you doing?

272
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,500
You know what I mean, right? The smell is important! The smell!

273
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,180
Senpai, you're not a dog!

274
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,580
Oh!

275
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,860
There it is!

276
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,360
Oh, as expected of Ryosu!

277
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,400
You're really good at this!

278
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,300
Chief, I'll find 150,000 yen worth of matsutake right away!

279
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,840
Although the imported ones and the domestic ones were not able to be separated,

280
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,120
do you know the smell of the matsutake itself?

281
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,400
When you make money, you will develop a superhuman ability.

282
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,300
All right! I'll use this to get more matsutake!

283
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,740
No way!

284
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,320
Then, I'll sign the contract.

285
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,600
Oh, yeah.

286
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,020
Sir, are the matsutake on the cliff included in the contract?

287
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,280
Yeah, they're included.

288
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,280
Hmph! No matter where you look, there's no matsutake around here.

289
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,180
Here, Chief! Sign it quickly!

290
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,220
You can write your name here.

291
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,820
Here.

292
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,920
You can write your name here.

293
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,620
Chief, sign the contract right away.

294
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,700
Huh?

295
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,800
But I really can't gamble!

296
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,960
Yes, you're right!

297
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,420
Forget about this!

298
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,180
Oh, no!

299
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,120
Hey!

300
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,640
Ryosu!

301
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,520
Hey! Is this okay?

302
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,580
Don't you say you're my brother!

303
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,360
How did it go, Koichi?

304
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:26,980
Oh?

305
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,360
Now we have a deal.

306
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,740
I see.

307
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:47,000
It's full of matsutake.

308
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,240
I didn't know the top of the cliff was Akamatsu-bayashi.

309
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,020
Nobody was bothering me, so I grew up like this.

310
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,700
This is like digging a gold mine.

311
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,400
You did it, senpai.

312
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,460
Ryo-tsu, I had a good shopping thanks to you.

313
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,420
No, it's a little bit of oil.

314
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,740
Please call me Matsutake Hunter Ryo-tsu.

315
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,720
If there was such a place, I wouldn't have lent it.

316
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,180
Banjai! Banjai! Banjai!

317
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
Matsutake Mountain Banjai!

318
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,460
A thief came to my Matsutake Mountain.

319
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,640
Is it Matsutake Mountain that Ryo-chan said you had found?

320
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,020
That place is in the newspaper and TV.

321
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,980
The thief was the thief.

322
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,220
I was told to come.

323
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,060
Yes, Kameari Park...

324
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,760
Oh, Ryo?

325
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,400
Did you see the newspaper?

326
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,360
I came here early in the morning because I couldn't stay.

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,760
It's terrible.

328
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,000
I brought a lot of matsutake mushrooms.

329
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,260
Ryo?

330
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,320
Boss, please rest assured.

331
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,580
I'm going to harvest them all now!

332
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,200
Wait!

333
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,080
I promised Hiromi and the others that I'd bring them to the matsutake hunting this holiday.

334
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,140
I love them unless they're properly grown...

335
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,320
Grandpa said I was lying.

336
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,560
It's okay, Boss!

337
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,060
The new matsutake will come out by the next holiday!

338
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,200
Really?

339
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,460
Alright.

340
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,160
Protect the matsutake from the thieves.

341
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,460
Then you can do as much as you like.

342
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,060
Really?

343
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,880
As much as you like matsutake?

344
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,280
Yes.

345
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,980
Relax.

346
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,760
I'll protect it.

347
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,220
I got it.

348
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,540
Leave it to me.

349
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,540
I bought some food, Boss.

350
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,420
Then I'll protect the matsutake no matter what.

351
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,680
Here.

352
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,900
I have to do this much.

353
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,180
Boss!

354
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,200
The matsutake on the west side was stolen by the cats!

355
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,580
Here it is.

356
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,540
It was stolen?

357
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,540
It was stole!

358
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,340
Let's go!

359
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,020
Let's go!

360
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,560
You're a thief, Boss!

361
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,920
What do you mean, sir!

362
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,100
Let's go!

363
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,340
You are entirely innocent!

364
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,080
They're not some thieves.

365
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,280
Let's run away!

366
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,820
Let the police show up.

367
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,180
Let's go!

368
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,060
Let's go!

369
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,920
Wait...

370
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,560
Listen up, Osogi!

371
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,040
Retreat!

372
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,340
Damn it!

373
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,700
The next day

374
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,160
Senpai, I've brought all the members from Nakagawa Prefecture.

375
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:53,920
Alright!

376
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,360
General, I'm the commander of Ryotsu!

377
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,180
Uh, uh, isn't that a bit too much?

378
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,780
This is just right!

379
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,540
Listen carefully! The purpose of the operation is to protect Matsutake!

380
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,200
In other words, we must not put intruders on the cliff!

381
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,200
Based on this line, we will form the Matsutake Defense Sword!

382
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,700
All members, with all your strength, let's support them!

383
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,760
Yes sir!

384
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,920
It's a rather strong defense.

385
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,340
I heard that there are a lot of pretty good Matsutake.

386
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,380
We can put them on the cliff, right?

387
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,820
This is it! Act No.1!

388
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:22,380
The third group, quickly capture the target!

389
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,000
Roger!

390
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,500
The tenth person?

391
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,680
We can leave the chief's Matsutake alone.

392
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,860
Of course! There's no one who can break through this defense!

393
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,780
Ah!

394
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:33,760
I don't know, I don't know.

395
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,180
I can't believe it!

396
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,220
He's guarding so seriously!

397
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,300
Looks like there's a professional with a strong arm.

398
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,500
Damn! What a persistent thief!

399
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,980
The C-24 infrared camera caught the culprit!

400
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:46,920
Huh?

401
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,640
Give it to me!

402
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,180
What? What a stinky thief!

403
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,420
Oh!

404
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,160
Yes, Matsutake Defense Force.

405
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,960
Senpai, I'm Chief Ohara.

406
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,100
What?

407
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,880
Oh, ah, Ryotsu.

408
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,040
How's Matsutake doing?

409
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,400
Has he grown up?

410
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,660
Yes, of course, Chief.

411
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,120
Tomorrow, Hiromi and Daisuke will go hunting Matsutake.

412
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
Please take care of him.

413
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,560
See you!

414
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,040
Tomorrow...

415
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,720
I'll re-plan the plan!

416
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,980
I can't let any of you steal Matsutake!

417
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,400
It's a battle of force!

418
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,360
Please...

419
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,500
Stupid!

420
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,820
I can tell from your movement!

421
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,380
Take this!

422
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,920
Now get down!

423
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,480
Finally someone has helped me out, bastard!

424
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,860
Prepare yourselves!

425
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,500
Let's go!

426
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,260
Hey, Senpai! Where's the defense switch?

427
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,700
W-what's going on?

428
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,540
Senpai!

429
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,120
Let's get this guy out of here!

430
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,000
Roger.

431
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,260
Wait a minute! Are you going to kill me?

432
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,440
Fire! Fire!

433
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,780
You idiot! You idiot!

434
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,340
That's... wrong.

435
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,380
Mr. Tsuchiya, stop the attack!

436
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,240
You're too late!

437
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,900
Damn it! It's like a thunderclap!

438
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,200
It can't be helped. I'll go back upstairs...

439
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,760
You thief!

440
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,380
Get up!

441
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,620
You stole my matsutake!

442
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,580
You're the thief?

443
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
You're the one who stole my matsutake.

444
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,360
What?

445
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,600
I just took back my own matsutake!

446
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,860
What are you talking about?

447
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,840
You're the one who stole my matsutake!

448
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,880
I'm coming!

449
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,420
Stop it!

450
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,800
This is terrible.

451
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,740
I'm a thief.

452
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,720
The right thing to do now is to get back.

453
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,580
I did it!

454
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,000
The right thing to do now is to get back.

455
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,120
Did I do it?

456
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,720
I just didn't get to protect my matutake.

457
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:21,820
Don't get so angry!

458
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,020
Roger!

459
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,220
You're the one who stole my matsutake!

460
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,160
You're the one who stole my matsutake!

461
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,820
You're the one who stole my matsutake!

462
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,240
You're the one who stole my matsutake!

463
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,420
I'm going to protect the pine tree.

464
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,080
I see.

465
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,960
It's your job.

466
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,760
Idiot!

467
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,940
You should bury yourself in the pine tree.

468
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,820
And become a pot of oil.

469
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,980
At least, you can kill the enemy.

470
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,720
See you.

471
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,280
Are you leaving, chief?

472
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,240
I'm going to die.

473
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,780
I'm not going to die.

474
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,420
I'm not going to die.

475
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,640
Maria.

476
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,000
What happened to the pine tree?

477
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,340
Since when did it become a real woman?

478
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,560
Maria is here, too.

479
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,140
I didn't know you were a clone human.

480
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,660
Next time, "Hondara Prefecture is in danger."

481
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,540
Please watch it.

482
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,480
The girl who plays the role of the enemy.

483
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:32,620
I can't fall in love.

484
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,740
Rumor says so.

485
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,020
There are so many things I want to do.

486
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,660
I want to try the love.

487
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,460
I want to ride a bike in the vast desert.

488
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,300
I want to ride a bike in the vast desert.

489
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,060
I want to ride a bike in the vast desert.

490
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,200
I want to ride a bike in the vast desert.

491
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,980
I want to be a lady

492
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,340
With the speed of a full moon

493
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:07,000
I change into a lady's dream

494
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,700
Love heart

495
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,520
I'm sorry, wait

496
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,260
The future of the panorama

497
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,580
The dazzling light that shines

498
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,520
You understand, right?

499
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,300
I'm sorry, wait
