On the corner of laughter, Ebisu-kun!

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,940
Ryo-chan, what are you making this time?

28
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,260
It's a character doll of the TV series.

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,680
Until now, you were making a model gun with a wooden grip, weren't you?

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,740
Yeah, but I had to stop because it was time-consuming.

31
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,200
If it's a character doll, you can make one of the same type of metal, and it can be mass-produced.

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,520
This month, I'm spending all of my life on this.

33
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,600
But you're really good at carving.

34
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,760
When I was a kid, I was a genius at carving with a pencil.

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,940
I can make anything.

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,040
Then, what about a bear souvenir from Hokkaido?

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,300
It can be made in five minutes.

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,180
The face of the chief can be made in two minutes.

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,840
Two minutes?

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,120
Well, look.

41
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,900
I'm called the Michelangelo of the bear, and I can't do anything.

42
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,660
See? It's done.

43
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,520
Wow!

44
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,760
It's exactly like it.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,500
That's why I said I was a genius.

46
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,000
You should make a little more expression.

47
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,400
Your eyes are a little bit dull.

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,420
The bottom of your nose is longer.

49
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,980
All right.

50
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,560
It's done.

51
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,800
You look like a real genius.

52
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:56,980
Huh?

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,340
A real genius?

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,840
Who's a genius?

55
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,880
No, no, no.

56
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,320
I said you could make it.

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,160
The second one.

58
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,740
What?

59
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,520
What's this?

60
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,140
You were doing something else, Ryotsu?

61
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,480
No, no.

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,260
This is a bonito.

63
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,560
A bonito.

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,680
Oh.

65
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,080
Then, try it.

66
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,140
What?

67
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,720
It's a bonito, right?

68
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,900
Y-Yes, it is.

69
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,900
This bonito is the best.

70
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,380
Eat it all.

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,180
Don't leave any.

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,140
Of course.

73
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,820
Ryo.

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,800
Don't push yourself too hard.

75
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,600
It's delicious.

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,020
By the way, Nakagawa and Reiko,

77
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,740
I've brought a new member who's been transferred from the police department to my house.

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,080
Ebisu, come on in.

79
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,320
Yes.

80
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,740
Nice to meet you, everyone.

81
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,360
I'm Ebisu.

82
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,960
Nice to meet you.

83
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,760
I'm Nakagawa.

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,200
Nice to meet you, too.

85
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,700
I'm Reiko Akimoto.

86
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,240
Ebisu is such a lucky name.

87
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,520
Yes.

88
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,920
You can say hello to me.

89
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,620
I'm eating you.

90
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,240
Reiko, water.

91
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,160
Water.

92
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,560
Yes.

93
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,080
Here's some water, Ryo.

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,380
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,120
I was surprised.

96
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,220
What's wrong with you?

97
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,900
Why are you laughing all of a sudden?

98
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,380
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
I'm really sorry.

100
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,140
I'm a laughing person.

101
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,920
There's a limit to a laughing person.

102
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,640
My parents are such a bright family.

103
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,680
I couldn't stop laughing since I was a child.

104
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,220
Thanks to them, I can't get back to my smile.

105
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,980
It's good that you're bright.

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,880
It's too bright.

107
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,800
I can't stop talking about you.

108
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,340
I'm trying to be serious but it's too much to

109
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:52,520
It's so funny.

110
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,000
Ebisu, why did you become a prostitute?

111
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,380
Yes, because of this personality.

112
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,960
I don't want to be a prostitute.

113
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,300
Here, it's katsudon.

114
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,380
You must be hungry.

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,720
If you eat it, you'll be a good girl.

116
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,280
Why is katsudon so popular in this kind of situation?

117
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,360
Ebisu, don't laugh!

118
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,580
But I'm going to talk to my mother in my hometown and make her laugh.

120
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,820
What is this guy?

121
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
Shut up!

122
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,460
Hey, don't do that!

123
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,620
Yes, sir!

124
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,900
I'm in such a state.

125
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,840
Then you're not a police officer.

126
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,400
Really?

127
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,300
You're really something, chief.

128
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,760
Then, Gariotsu, go patrol with Ebisu.

129
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,680
Right!

130
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,520
With me?

131
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,740
Of course. You'll be the instructor.

132
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,260
This laughing bag? Instructor, huh?

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,100
Thank you.

134
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,480
It started again.

135
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,880
Don't laugh. I'm going to patrol.

136
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,480
Hey, patrol!

137
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,320
This guy is useless.

138
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,840
I'm going.

139
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,520
Hey, get a hold of yourself. I'm going.

140
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,640
Walk properly.

141
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,460
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,900
I don't feel well.

143
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,820
You're really something.

144
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,620
I'm not free.

145
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,760
Is that person okay with his work?

146
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,020
If you leave it to Gariotsu, he'll be able to handle it.

147
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,820
Gariotsu, it might be hard.

148
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,980
What's so funny now?

149
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,480
You're not going to patrol, are you?

150
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,260
I'm sorry.

151
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:45,480
Don't be

152
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,540
Sorry...

153
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,560
It's just that...

154
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,920
I can't get that car.

155
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,080
Eddie soany, is it?

156
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,820
What's wrong with the sedan?

157
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,180
Are you sick?

158
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,620
You're laughing at me for nothing.

159
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,360
I'm in pain, you're laughing too hard.

160
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,060
I need help.

161
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,960
You should do something.

162
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,840
I don't know what I did.

163
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,820
Excuse me...

164
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,420
This is not what I intended.

165
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,080
I'll clean it up.

166
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,840
I've been doing it for a while, but I've been indiscriminate lately.

167
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm in trouble.

168
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,100
I'm in trouble, too.

169
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,340
If you go to ask for a rakugo, what are you going to do?

170
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,700
Well, I just saw the signboard at the theater.

171
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,520
It's a mysterious Kobu-en.

172
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,700
Why is the name Kobu-en?

173
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,640
It's strange. I'm sorry.

174
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,760
I can't go because I'm in trouble.

176
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,400
What's going to happen if I go inside?

177
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,320
Then, if your father Sanpei is alive, you're laughing.

178
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,200
The manga is also laughing for two hours just by touching the boy's jump.

179
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,540
You're having a hard time.

180
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,760
I have been educated to be lucky to laugh.

181
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,600
I will blame my parents.

182
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,480
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,760
What's the matter? Why are you laughing all of a sudden?

184
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,040
I'm sorry. I can't stop laughing.

185
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,820
You're making a fool of yourself.

186
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,280
Don't mess with me.

187
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,640
Hey, what's wrong?

188
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,540
I was hit by a laugh in the face.

189
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,620
Of course. The people of the lower town are short-tempered.

190
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,040
Don't be nervous and follow me.

191
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,760
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,120
I'm sorry. I laugh when I see you.

193
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
It's an accident.

194
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,520
Are you all right?

195
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,480
Somehow...

196
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,260
Are you all right?

197
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,080
Don't laugh.

198
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,400
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,780
Sir, I'm sorry, but this is...

200
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,300
Can you deliver it to the Onigawara village?

201
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,640
All right.

202
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,140
Ebisu, deliver this light.

203
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,900
No way.

204
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,520
I can't go to the funeral with this face.

205
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,620
Just leave it as it is.

206
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll verify the accident.

207
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,020
But...

208
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,600
Go.

209
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,220
Yes, sir.

210
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,760
I'm in trouble.

211
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm the worst at being nervous.

212
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,380
No.

213
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,200
But it's my first job since I've been fired.

214
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,960
I have to endure it somehow.

215
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,080
I'm sorry.

216
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,720
It's me.

217
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,980
It's nothing.

218
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,140
It's me.

219
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,200
Thank you.

220
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,560
Thank you for your help this time.

221
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,720
You're welcome.

222
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,460
Thank you, Also.

223
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,320
Hey Mama, that child looks great.

224
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,980
Master Kofuku's

225
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,300
Master Kofuku's

226
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,400
Master Kofuku's

227
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,960
Master Kofuku's

228
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,020
Master Kofuku's

229
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,440
Master Kofuku's

230
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,140
Master Kofuku's

231
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,160
Master Kofuku's

232
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,400
Master Kofuku's

233
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,480
Master Kofuku's

234
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,260
Master Kofuku's

235
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,840
Master Kofuku's

236
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:32,700
Master Kofuku's

237
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,380
No more!

238
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,120
Good, good.

239
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,040
It's good that you're not badly injured.

240
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,600
Even so, Ebisu is late.

241
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,080
Thank you, I'm late.

242
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,000
What's with that face?

243
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,420
You got hit again?

244
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,500
I always buy a gift certificate except for the lucky seat.

245
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,360
What a useless guy.

246
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,780
It's not funny at all.

247
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,280
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,440
Even Ryotsu couldn't get it.

249
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,040
He's walking with the bomb.

250
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,180
But he can't patrol.

251
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,820
His work in the station is difficult.

252
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,040
Let's go to the other place.

253
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,640
Um...

254
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,120
What's wrong, Ebisu?

255
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,420
Don't be so flustered.

256
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,020
Actually, I'm about to faint.

257
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,480
The toilet is in the back.

258
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,880
Go to the toilet.

259
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,280
Go to the toilet.

260
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,020
Go to the toilet.

261
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,440
Escape.

262
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,200
And this is how I call you.

263
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,560
I'm sorry...

264
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,440
I will ask you again.

265
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:16,720
Alright.

266
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,360
Let's go.

267
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's go.

268
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,520
Let's go.

269
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,570
Thank you.

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,100
Let me walk with you.

271
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,360
I'm going to get a heart attack!

272
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,300
Hey, Reiko! You're not the only one who's laughing!

273
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,000
It's because Ebisu-san laughs so much!

274
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I can't believe my jokes, which have been made fun of by the others, have been accepted so much!

275
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,460
It's the best!

276
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,920
I can't stand it!

277
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,820
Hey, don't laugh! You're just making your father laugh!

278
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,240
Even if you say that...

279
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,540
Ebisu-san, are you sure you don't have to go to the bathroom?

280
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,360
That's right!

281
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,040
I'm a little short, so I'm going to say "I'm short!"

282
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,700
I'm going to burst!

283
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,280
What's going on?

284
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,320
I don't like it. What have I done?

285
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,000
You're laughing.

286
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,760
It 's because you 're going to the bathroom!

287
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,500
It seems that Ebisu 's laughter draws good luck to everyone.

288
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,480
Even if you laugh at your dad's funny jokes, you won't get good luck.

289
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,320
What?

290
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,640
Hey! It's a joke!

291
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,740
Hold on.

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,640
Even if I can't patrol, I might be able to use this.

293
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,480
It's almost time to pee and pee.

294
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,280
Ebisu-kun, would you like to go to the library with me?

295
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,200
Yes.

296
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,760
What are you going to do, Chief?

297
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,420
It has nothing to do with you.

298
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,280
Nakagawa, Reiko, you guys take care of the rest.

299
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,060
Yes.

300
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,620
Hayashi, don't smell anything.

301
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,320
Hey, I'm going out too.

302
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,240
Senior!

303
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,140
Ryo-chan, you're...

304
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,320
Chief-chan, you're...

305
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,020
How about this?

306
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,900
Friday, today's lunch is a fried egg.

307
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,480
Saturday, it's been a while since I went home, so I'm going to eat gobu-sata.

308
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,680
That's not funny.

309
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,780
Sunday, I'm not going to wake up until noon today.

310
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,180
Why is this dad joke so funny?

311
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,380
It's true.

312
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,580
Monday, I'm not going to read anything other than Jump.

313
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't think you can read anything.

314
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,180
That's right.

315
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,620
He's using Ebisu to make dad jokes and make us get angry.

316
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,580
Ohara-kun, what are you doing here?

317
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,820
Chief!

318
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,460
Actually...

319
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,220
What?

320
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,180
I'll get angry no matter what kind of joke you say.

321
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,900
Really?

322
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:06,940
Yes.

323
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,880
As long as Ebisu-kun is here, you will definitely get angry.

324
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,540
I'll try to make you laugh too.

325
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,160
I see.

326
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,320
I see.

327
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,360
Then, one more thing.

328
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,760
I forgot my hat and I got a hat.

329
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,600
I got it.

330
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,500
I've been making so many jokes.

331
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,440
How is it?

332
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,320
I told you.

333
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,980
Then, one more thing.

334
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,740
Wednesday, I'm going to the garden to plant trees.

335
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,780
I can't stop laughing anymore.

336
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,560
It's so painful.

337
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,480
Thursday, I'm going to put on an umbrella in the rain.

338
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,180
He's going to die.

339
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,200
Wonderful, Ohara-kun.

340
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,680
I can't stand it anymore.

341
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,020
I can't stand it anymore.

342
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,480
I can't stand it anymore.

343
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,440
What?

344
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,420
Is it okay for a police officer to make dad jokes while he's working?

345
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,500
You want to be laughed at too, don't you?

346
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,460
No.

347
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,400
I'm jealous because we are the ones who are taking over.

348
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,140
Right, Ohara-kun?

349
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,600
That's right, chief.

350
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,660
It's not like that.

351
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,700
Ebisu, you are also you.

352
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,940
Come here.

353
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,660
I have a stomachache.

354
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,500
I won't eat.

355
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,200
It's okay.

356
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,520
We took over the job.

357
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,440
Chief, it's okay.

358
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,760
Our jokes are holding everyone's laugh.

359
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,260
Even if Ebisu-kun is not here, it's okay.

360
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,140
No, it's not.

361
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,220
That's right.

362
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,820
Then, one more time.

363
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,120
The train announcer said this.

364
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,520
Please wait a while until you arrive in Chiba.

365
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,120
That's a bad joke.

366
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,320
The worst dad joke.

367
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,160
Really.

368
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,820
Hello.

369
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,000
I said please wait a while.

370
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,100
It's not funny without Ebisu-san.

371
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,400
Let's go, everyone.

372
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,040
Ebisu, you didn't join the police to become the head of the club, did you?

373
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,660
Well...

374
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,980
You did it to protect the safety of the citizens and fight against evil, didn't you?

375
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,780
Yes.

376
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,900
Then don't laugh again.

377
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,640
That's impossible.

378
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,660
It's the same as being told not to breathe.

379
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,800
Shut up.

380
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,980
If the police were laughing, the citizens wouldn't trust you.

381
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,700
I'd like to ask you something.

382
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,260
Yes.

383
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,560
What is it, grandma?

384
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,640
What's wrong with you?

385
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,400
Why are you so flustered when people are in trouble?

386
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,260
What?

387
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,780
Mr. Omawari.

388
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,480
Is there a Sky Mansion around here?

389
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,700
Yes.

390
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,280
It's that brick-colored building.

391
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,520
Oh, is that so?

392
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,180
Thank you very much, Mr. Omawari.

393
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,500
Look.

394
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,920
It's because you're flustered that you're like this.

395
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,300
Listen.

396
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,520
Don't laugh.

397
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,680
If you can't do it, you're out of luck.

398
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,360
I guess I'm not fit for the police.

399
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,380
I hate parents who are so flustered.

400
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,140
You're probably depressed, but you're smiling.

401
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,860
I'm already...

402
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:41,900
Stop being a cop.

403
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,060
Mr. Omawari, this is bad.

404
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,080
The robbers are coming.

405
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,820
The female employee is a hostage.

406
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,000
Robbers?

407
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
I shouldn't laugh at this time.

408
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,900
That's right.

409
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,280
What?

410
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,420
The robbers are hiding in the fourth floor?

411
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,200
Okay, I got it.

412
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,780
I'll be right there.

413
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,980
Nakagawa, come with me.

414
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,260
Reiko, contact the office.

415
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,340
Davis.

416
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:19,820
Senior.

417
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,020
How many criminals are there?

418
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,000
One.

419
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,260
But he has a gun.

420
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,540
One?

421
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,660
Okay, I'll convince him.

422
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,480
Hey, criminal.

423
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,260
It's the police.

424
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,440
The brick-colored building is already surrounded.

425
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,720
We can't escape.

426
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,660
Give up and behave yourself.

427
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,440
Shut up.

428
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,160
There's a hostage here.

429
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,620
We'll be caught easily.

430
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,380
It's dangerous to jump into it.

431
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:42,880
Damn it.

432
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,840
Is there any good idea?

433
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,040
What?

434
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,700
Okay.

435
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,420
Let's convince Davis.

436
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,320
What?

437
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,180
Me?

438
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,200
If you, the laughing Jogo, convince him while laughing, the culprit will be Hirumu.

439
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,180
In the meantime, Nakagawa and I will do something.

440
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,860
But don't laugh at me.

441
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,500
It's okay. Go away.

442
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,100
That's right.

443
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,720
What are you doing?

444
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,700
I'm trying to convince you.

445
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,000
Who's laughing at me in such a tense state?

446
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,620
You're kidding me.

447
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,520
If you laugh more, this guy's head...

448
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,640
You said there would be a hole in the wall, didn't you?

449
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,980
Don't laugh.

450
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,620
I'm serious.

451
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,700
Even if you say that...

452
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,240
I said don't laugh.

453
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,700
Why did you say that?

454
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,400
Because it's really funny.

455
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,380
I didn't know this was a model gun.

456
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,140
Damn it.

457
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,240
What? It was a model gun?

458
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,080
Didn't you laugh at me?

459
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,680
Stupid culprit.

460
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,980
Don't laugh at me.

461
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,620
Damn it.

462
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,280
There's still a trump card.

463
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,500
Look at this.

464
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,060
Dynamite!

465
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,960
Damn it! I can't jump in with this!

466
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,080
Hahaha! He even prepared dynamite!

467
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,420
Hahaha! But he forgot the lighter and couldn't tell the

468
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:11,780
video line!

469
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,240
Hahaha!

470
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,520
I forgot it.

471
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,760
Ah!

472
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,860
Hahaha! I can't believe I really forgot!

473
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,080
Hahaha!

474
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,060
Help me!

475
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,620
Hahaha!

476
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:29,720
Hahaha!

477
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,240
Hahaha!

478
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,380
Very good.

479
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,320
Hahaha!

480
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,360
Hahaha!

481
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:32,540
Hahaha!

482
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,700
Hahaha!

483
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,100
Haha!

484
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,320
What happened?

485
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,220
Hahaha!

486
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,460
Hahaha!

487
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,300
Its done!

488
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,020
Hahaha!

489
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,740
Hahaha!

490
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,360
Hahaha!

491
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,080
Haha!

492
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,520
Hahaha!

493
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,260
I was laughing too much and fainted.

494
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,480
You're really amazing.

495
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,900
What? Ebisu quit?

496
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,700
He made a lot of money, why?

497
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,280
He said that the police wouldn't let him.

498
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,520
He quit the police because he quit the police service.

499
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,020
What?

500
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,580
There was a department that wanted him because he played a role in Ebisu's performance yesterday.

501
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,800
He was assigned to that department.

502
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,580
I didn't know there was such a funny man.

503
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,020
Maybe this is a laughing voice.

504
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,480
It's not just a joke.

505
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,900
When an incident happens on the land,

506
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,200
it's all over the place.

507
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,400
The special detective is the leader of the Three Glasses.

508
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,460
Kaipan Dekan.

509
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,440
It's been a while.

510
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,520
The chief of the police station in front of the park.

511
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,120
So it's you, Kaipan Dekan.

512
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,680
What are you here for?

513
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,100
We have new friends in the special detective department.

514
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,520
So we're here to introduce them.

515
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,640
New friends?

516
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,460
Come in.

517
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,880
Laugh all you want.

518
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,500
Hello, everyone.

519
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,480
This is Ebisu.

520
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,120
So you're the one who said you wanted Mr. Ebisu.

521
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,480
Of course.

522
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,880
He's my chief detective.

523
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,120
You're working in this outfit.

524
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,880
Unbelievable.

525
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,180
I can't stop laughing.

526
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,040
That's why.

527
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,400
I knew it.

528
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,540
This is the only place where you want Mr. Ebisu.

529
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,820
I'm counting on you, Laugh-Dekan.

530
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,980
Yes, Kaipan Senpai.

531
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:02,660
Thank you, Mr. Ebisu.

532
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,980
It was funny today.

533
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,520
It was so fun.

534
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,240
No problem.

535
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,000
Please take care of Mr. Ebisu.

536
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,980
How will it reflect in your eyes?

537
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,140
After a fight, you always give me a short kiss

538
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,160
You, with tears in your eyes, were so dear to me

539
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,560
In that way, how many things can I get

540
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,400
With such irreplaceable things?

541
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,920
In my whole life, how many things can I get?

542
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,620
You are me and I am you

543
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,220
That's all that I need to be satisfied

544
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,940
You, see, just laughing

545
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,900
I felt that I was healed of any suffering

546
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,380
I felt that I was healed of any suffering

547
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,880
I felt that I was healed of any suffering

548
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,900
Were you all looking forward to the Trump battle?

549
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,100
Wasn't it interesting?

550
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,100
All right, everybody, get invited.

551
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,700
It's the Trump competition.

552
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,520
Wait, you don't notice that the anime is all about Trump.

553
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,240
Next episode, "Fight! Trump'sterrorism Changingcorporation"
