1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,600
When you watch TV

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,300
Make sure you keep your room light and keep your distance

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:25,220
It's like someone is calling you

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,200
After the rain

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,880
I walked back and forth

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,420
I reached out to my mom

7
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,760
I felt something strange at that time

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
So I tried walking on the black rail of the arcade

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:54,820
I tried walking on the black rail of the arcade

10
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,220
Everyone was a kid at least once

11
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,340
But everyone has forgotten

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,200
A politician with a big face

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,820
And a blue aunt in front of their eyes

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,180
Turn around and look at that corner

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,800
You'll see everyone

16
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,500
There's a wall over there

17
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,260
There's a turtle

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,520
Everyone, come to our town

19
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,600
Thank you!

20
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,660
Now I have no choice but to defeat you!

21
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,540
It's a mysterious treasure!

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,800
The two beauties have started to fight because of their fate!

23
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,120
Marilyn is the most popular actress in Hong Kong

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,600
The master of martial arts who can defeat a cow with one blow!

25
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,940
The best female prostitute in the world!

26
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,460
Jody is the leader of the Great War

27
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,000
She defeated a bear with her bare hands

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:11,400
And is the best female prostitute in the world!

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,200
The best female prostitute in the world!

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,220
The battle is now on the way to Hong Kong!

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,840
The best beauty in the world!

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,060
B-1 Grand Prix 1998

33
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,420
Hong Kong Grand Final!

34
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:22,800
First place!

35
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,260
Great! Great!

36
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:26,860
It's the best!

37
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,380
The rest is currently being filmed

38
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,540
It really is a disaster

39
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,760
It's a big deal that the double date between Volvo and me

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Now we can make a big profit

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,760
I won!

42
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,980
The prize is a 100,000 per percent win rate

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,780
This time it's 200,000 including the risk of death

44
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,380
What!?

45
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,060
Listen to me

46
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,400
This project is only around 15 minutes

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,820
Plus, you can get a plus 10% for fighting fans.

48
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,560
Plus, you can get a plus 5% for foreign fans.

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,840
You can get a total of 30%.

50
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,680
I'm a man too! I'm waiting for the best frame!

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,600
Alright, I'm ready to go.

52
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,680
I'm counting on you, Ryouto-chan!

53
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,280
The End

54
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,280
You really came to Hong Kong?

55
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,020
Yes. From now on, Bobby and I will be living here alone.

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,880
Marilin-san!

57
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,780
That blonde lady came.

58
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,340
She said she wanted to see you.

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,340
I won't let her touch you.

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,660
Right, Bobby?

61
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,880
I can't stand it!

62
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
Why me?

63
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,540
Don't think too much. You're just a record holder.

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,700
We have about 2 hours left until Hong Kong.

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,540
I'm sorry, everyone.

66
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,340
This happened for my sister.

67
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,960
This happened to her for the sake of our marriage.

68
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,720
At least you should be thinking twice before having a double date.

69
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,000
I-I didn't mean that...

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,380
That's all right, but it's what you asked for.

71
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,680
Don't make excuses!

72
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,920
It's Jody-san's flight attendant.

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,100
Give me back my Volvo!

74
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,180
Volvo is America's pride!

75
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,360
Give me back my Volvo!

76
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,860
Thanks to everyone!

77
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,440
They even moved the boat for Bobby and me.

78
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,180
For Jody's sake!

79
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,880
If that's the case, we'll go to the ends of space!

80
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,280
Yeah!

81
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,560
This is getting serious.

82
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,240
We have to go to Hong Kong and persuade Marilyn to return Mr.Volvo.

83
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,960
It's not easy to persuade her.

84
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,900
The winning rate is 30%.

85
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,220
It costs 6 million.

86
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,060
Ah! My sister's house is over there!

87
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,200
Wow! It's a big palace!

88
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,460
As expected of the best actress in Hong Kong!

89
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,660
No good. That's too small for a battle.

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,160
Senpai, what are you talking about?

91
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,280
Oh, nothing.

92
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,340
Hey, Nakagawa, fly over that house.

93
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,080
Y-yes, sir.

94
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,600
W-what's this?

95
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,820
It's fine. It's fine.

96
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,160
Well then, we'll head over there.

97
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,700
Eh? Head over there?

98
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,680
Ryo-sama!

99
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,100
Ryo-sama!

100
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,480
If you pull the string, the parachute will open!

101
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,480
Don't drop the camera.

102
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,880
As expected of the best actress in Hong Kong.

103
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
At times like this, this is it.

104
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,500
One, two, three.

105
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,160
Wow.

106
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,080
It's a real YAMU茶.

107
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,220
Take as much as you want.

108
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,360
I am eating.

109
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,500
It's good.

110
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,160
For sure.

111
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,680
Aichi!

112
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,260
What?

113
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,840
You're selling the fight between Marilin and Jody to the TV station?

114
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,520
Shh! You have a big voice.

115
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,520
That's why I brought you here as a cameraman.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,580
I'm not kidding!

117
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,500
If you two fight, it'll be a big deal again!

118
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,780
I'll do it before we part ways.

119
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,720
No way! I'm going home!

120
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,280
Hey, wait!

121
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,960
Ugh, you idiot...

122
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,620
Ah!

123
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:16,420
Huh?

124
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:16,500
Huh?

125
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,320
What's wrong, Honda?

126
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:18,780
Hey!

127
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,380
Ah!

128
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,320
What's going on?

129
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,420
You're talking about the table in the yard?

130
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,840
Ah, help me, senpai!

131
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,100
Huh?

132
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,160
I'm busy looking for a cameraman.

133
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,360
The cameraman I brought from Japan ran away.

134
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,860
No way!

135
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,200
Ah, I wonder if he's anywhere.

136
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,620
That great cameraman...

137
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,080
He's here! He's here! He's here!

138
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:44,700
What?

139
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,800
Really?

140
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:45,900
Huh?

141
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,340
What did you say?!

142
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,740
I can't believe he ran away so soon.

143
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,320
He already ran away.

144
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,760
That's why I'm asking for your help.

145
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,440
Wah!

146
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,880
Never say such a thing.

147
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,920
Hey, you stupid black kitty.

148
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,480
!

149
00:07:59,480 --> 00:07:59,600
!

150
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:02,960
Huh?

151
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,400
!

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,300
it cost 6 million!

153
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,660
I will not allow it!

154
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,700
!

155
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,200
Ah! Where's the sound?

156
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,340
Huh?

157
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,460
Hmm?

158
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,000
Leon!

159
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,460
Leon! What's wrong? Is something wrong?

160
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:31,800
Listen, if you talk about me, I'll eat your tail.

161
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,440
Leon, it seems like your body is full of scratches.

162
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:48,800
Over there? I was looking around and I slipped my foot and fell down the cliff.

163
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,140
Then I happened to pass by and fell into the circus lion cage.

164
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,620
We got into a little fight.

165
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,420
Yeah, I don't mind if you're a lion, but if this blonde lady comes, I'll kill her.

166
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,340
You have to beat her thoroughly.

167
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,960
Okay, okay.

168
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,940
Bobby, I'm going to go out to make a reservation for the wedding.

169
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,860
Are you getting married?

170
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,700
Of course. You and I.

171
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:29,360
Zen, hurry up. I'm going to make a reservation for the best wedding, so look forward to it.

172
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,500
Marilin and I are getting married?

173
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,020
Yes.

174
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,720
I'm getting married.

175
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,360
If we get married, we'll live in this house.

176
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,780
If I have children, we'll play in this garden.

177
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,680
That might be a good life.

178
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,660
You're so naive, Bulbul.

179
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,080
Ryo-ryotsu, why are you here?

180
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,700
Hi.

181
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,560
Jody is heading over here to get you back.

182
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,480
What?

183
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,500
So Jody asked me to come and get me back?

184
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,580
No, I came to show you this.

185
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,200
What?

186
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,460
Ta-da. It's a nude photo book of a popular housewife.

187
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,680
Here.

188
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,960
No way!

189
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,180
No good.

190
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,600
Okay, I'll take you there.

191
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,380
What? You're not going to wait for Jody to come here?

192
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,720
This place is too small for two people to fight.

193
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,520
It's more like Hong Kong.

194
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:33,580
It's not like Hong Kong.

195
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,480
At least, you'll get 18 percent of the view.

196
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,580
What about...

197
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,360
She'll be taken to a lion-baum garden to feed you.

198
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,800
What?

199
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,820
It's a great place to fight.

200
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,320
You'll get 25 percent of the view at least.

201
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,000
You can eat this dish.

202
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,220
Why?

203
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,400
You'll eat some gourmet food.

204
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,180
The plus is 3 percent.

205
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,940
No way.

206
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,420
No way!

207
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,340
I'm back.

208
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,520
I'm back.

209
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Honda, tie me up with a rope.

210
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,860
Yes, sir.

211
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,360
Like this?

212
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,420
Okay, put your head forward.

213
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,800
Like this?

214
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,360
This is bad, Marilyn!

215
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,260
Why are you here?

216
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,920
Where's Bobby?

217
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,220
Jody took a friend and took Volvo.

218
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,720
What?

219
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,080
We came here to stop Jody's rampage,

220
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,260
but we didn't make it in time.

221
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,840
That blonde girl...

222
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,760
She said she'd go to the Lion Balm Garden

223
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,560
to celebrate her arrival in Hong Kong.

224
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,640
The Lion Balm Garden?

225
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,820
Hey, Honda, get up!

226
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,040
Hey, Honda, get up!

227
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,040
I'm sorry, Volvo.

228
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,960
I'll take him with me.

229
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,760
So you were wearing underwear.

230
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,360
My precious fiancée was kidnapped by a Yankee woman

231
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,560
from the U.S. Navy.

232
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,100
The enemy must take the Lion Balm Garden back!

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,900
Yes, sir!

234
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Hurry, Honda!

235
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,020
Hey, Kurohio!

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,220
I need your help.

237
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,240
Honda, get on this.

238
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,240
Don't call me by that nickname!

239
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,900
Don't you wake me up!

240
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,340
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,880
Her brother's brother,

242
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,720
goodbye,

243
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:39,740
goodbye,

244
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,340
goodbye,

245
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,380
Let's fly, Mr. Ryosu! Hold on tight!

246
00:12:51,520 --> 00:13:05,720
All right! Go, go!

247
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,080
Rin! Rin!

248
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,920
-Senpai! -Honda!

249
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,540
-Ke-chan! -There's no one inside.

250
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,600
There's not a single car!

251
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,800
Where did everyone go?

252
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,580
Here they come! Johnny's aircraft carrier!

253
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,300
Hey, Johnny!

254
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,440
Hey!

255
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,180
Hey, Mr. Ryosu!

256
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,600
There's someone who's suddenly coming in!

257
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,880
The aircraft carrier won't stop suddenly!

258
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,600
What? Bobby is in the Lionbaum Garden?

259
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,560
Yeah, I've been checking it with my own eyes.

260
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,700
Marilyn is totally alone.

261
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,300
I won't forgive you! Bobby is my fiancé.

262
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,040
I'll definitely get him back!

263
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,800
Be careful! Marilyn's guardmen were surrounding you.

264
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,520
I'm a professional bodyguard.

265
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:15,620
I'm a soldier.

266
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,060
Hooray!

267
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,520
Honda, take this aircraft carrier!

268
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,140
Yes, sir!

269
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,520
And take the soldier maniacs, too. Plus 2%.

270
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,860
Bobby will be in here for sure.

271
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,860
Search thoroughly!

272
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,540
Yes, ma'am!

273
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,360
Yes, ma'am!

274
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,160
All right!

275
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,800
I'll take this camera.

276
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,660
What's your camera position like now?

277
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,180
Huh?

278
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,260
What?

279
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,460
Charge!

280
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,860
Melissa, protect her!

281
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:56,680
Yeah!

282
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,640
I found you, you slut actress!

283
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,620
Who? This character's just like a nurse.

284
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,660
Don't worry!

285
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,460
Good, good, good. It's finally time.

286
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,640
I guess I need to get a sound effect here.

287
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,700
Alright, let's go!

288
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,920
Give me back my Bobby!

289
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,580
Go, go, Johnny!

290
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,680
Mr. Marilyn, fight!

291
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,660
Yay!

292
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,920
That was really intense!

293
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,980
No, it's not.

294
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,880
The beauty contest is a regular one, but I can't get my head around it.

295
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,340
I can't do that military uniform and the martial arts.

296
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,460
I'm hiding my nice body.

297
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,300
Alright.

298
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,880
W-What are you doing?

299
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,860
Go for it!

300
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,780
What kind of battle is this?

301
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,840
I can't believe my clothes are getting torn just by the casta.

302
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,520
Alright, good.

303
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,320
Now, it's Marilyn's turn.

304
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,760
Go for it!

305
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,460
I'm going for it!

306
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,580
Go for it! Go for it! Go for it!

307
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,300
This is...

308
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,240
This is the painting I've been waiting for!

309
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,880
This is not even a 40% chance of winning!

310
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:58,080
I-I can't believe that's the Hon-dara-ken.

311
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,340
I called for you.

312
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,200
Why?

313
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,960
To make the battle more flashy.

314
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,600
W-What is this?

315
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,940
I can't believe...

316
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,260
I'm Hon-dara-ken's general,

317
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,020
Asato Bandai!

318
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,140
Father!

319
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,500
I heard you're important.

320
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,480
Who's your enemy?

321
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,000
This woman!

322
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,060
Miss, there's a good Cantonese restaurant nearby.

323
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,480
Do you want to eat with me tonight?

324
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,760
W-What?

325
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,980
I'd be happy if you could tell me your cell phone number.

326
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,340
and tell me your present time.

327
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,520
Father!

328
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,900
That woman is my enemy!

329
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,460
I'm here!

330
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,900
Th-This music...

331
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,040
Papa!

332
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,680
I heard that you're the most important person, so I came running.

333
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,020
I salute Colonel Bokuryu!

334
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,400
Hm.

335
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,400
Yai! Yai! Yai! Yai!

336
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,800
It's cowardly to do a proper appearance!

337
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,640
What?

338
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,000
Get lost!

339
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,620
Who is this?

340
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,440
My enemy's father.

341
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,080
Who is your enemy?

342
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,480
That woman!

343
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,360
Hm.

344
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,680
It's a terrible wound.

345
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,040
Oh, young lady. You've come to the right place.

346
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,500
This is a wound that was shot in Vietnam.

347
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,700
This is a wound from the war in Auckland.

348
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,500
Furthermore, this is a wound from the war in Wangan.

349
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,900
And this is...

350
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,720
The wound that was scratched by my wife.

351
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,860
This is my wife.

352
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,180
She's beautiful, isn't she?

353
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,460
Let's go.

354
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,120
I can't let myself start bragging about my family.

355
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,980
Then I'll do the same.

356
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,840
My wife is beautiful, isn't she?

357
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,020
You're lying!

358
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,720
A man like you can't have such a beautiful wife!

359
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,880
Your photo is a fake one!

360
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,840
Hm?

361
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,180
I won't forgive you for insulting a soldier!

362
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,820
You're...

363
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,640
Ah!

364
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,700
This is...

365
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
P-P-P-Pineapple!

366
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,620
Ru-ru-ru-ru...

367
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,660
Ruby...

368
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,460
I-I...

369
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,700
C-C-C-C...

370
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,120
I-I...

371
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,920
Ka-ka-kamakiri...

372
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,880
R-R-Ringo...

373
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,760
What are you doing, damn it, father?

374
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,740
Bu-B-B-Burinin...

375
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,680
Ah, damn it!

376
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,620
You're an idiot.

377
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,840
I won't forgive you, you bastard!

378
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,620
I'll beat you to death.

379
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,580
That's my line.

380
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,140
Let's go, young men!

381
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,140
Huah!

382
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,600
Hahaha, you...

383
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,060
What?

384
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,440
What?

385
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,080
Yeah!

386
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,500
Ah!

387
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,360
I'm sorry!

388
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,180
No!

389
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,880
Alright, enough!

390
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,500
Make it more flashy!

391
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,900
Honda, get it!

392
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,360
Yes!

393
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,080
Alright!

394
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,700
I'll do it too!

395
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,060
Yeah!

396
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,080
Yeah!

397
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,160
Yeah!

398
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,280
So dangerous!

399
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:39,980
Honda!

400
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,720
Ha-ta!

401
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,060
Are you okay?

402
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,180
Yeah, it was dangerous.

403
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,640
Are you okay?

404
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,740
Yeah, thank you.

405
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,320
A swindler like you saved people.

406
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,060
You...

407
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,200
I'm surprised.

408
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,740
Hmm, I never thought a villain like you could save me.

409
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,560
You're a fraud?

410
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,800
A villain?

411
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,200
Who would do that?

412
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,640
Good, good!

413
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,540
Now you have a 50% view!

414
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,720
That's 10 million!

415
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,440
What's 10 million?

416
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,080
Huh?

417
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,500
Argh!

418
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,220
W-Why are we here?

419
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,380
You're not going to notice this much noise, are you?

420
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:22,680
Huh?

421
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:22,840
Huh?

422
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,060
What's in this bag?

423
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,940
Argh! I'm not giving it to him!

424
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,800
Wh-Wh-What are you doing?

425
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,280
Polino?

426
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,740
Ryo-sama?

427
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,880
What are you doing?

428
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,900
What's going on?

429
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,860
Get rid of him!

430
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,300
Ah, that's...

431
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,160
Oh, hello?

432
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,400
I did it, Ryochi-chan!

433
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,660
I got the Sunday Golden!

434
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,440
Now I have a 30% view!

435
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,040
I'm waiting for the Jody vs. Marilyn video to be completed!

436
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,720
Ryo-chan, what's going on?

437
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,660
Huh?

438
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,540
I-I think it's a wrong call.

439
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,120
That's not it.

440
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,400
We want to ask you something, too.

441
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,020
Huh?

442
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,540
What happened to the battle between you two?

443
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,760
More importantly, I want to ask why Bobby is here.

444
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,280
W-Well...

445
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,880
You don't have to know that.

446
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,880
You're really lucky for having me.

447
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,760
W-Wait...

448
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,120
I can understand if you tell me.

449
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,300
Don't get your head around the world!

450
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,660
Oops!

451
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,900
You jerk!

452
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,660
Cheers!

453
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,640
Cheers!

454
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,620
I don't know about this but this is the centenar old friend!

455
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,820
You both are...

456
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,280
How can you...

457
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,460
Sheesh...

458
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,660
If you think you can control people in TV...

459
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,560
You're just retarded!

460
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,380
Basically.

461
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,960
Alright, let's get along with each other from now on.

462
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,220
Speaking of which, Bobby!

463
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,820
You're the cause of this!

464
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,820
Hey, I like you.

465
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,280
Me too. I think I can become good friends with you.

466
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,900
Since we're here in Hong Kong, I'll introduce you to some good restaurants.

467
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,780
Oh, fantastic.

468
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,960
Then, let's go.

469
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,220
Let's go.

470
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,700
Hey, wait!

471
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,660
Are you leaving me behind?

472
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,920
Papa, please be more considerate.

473
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,640
You too, dad.

474
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,240
Hey, Jody!

475
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,360
Leave it to me, Rin!

476
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,620
By the way, why did you come to Hong Kong?

477
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,980
Help me!
