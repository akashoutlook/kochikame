1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,280
Japanese presupç´¯

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,440
I was looking forward to a day in Nakakawa

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,220
If I kick a stone, I could soar

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,240
I wonder if I'm going to go to the gym where I was saving money

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,080
I was laughed at as it was

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,580
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,940
Katsushika is a one-way street with a single grumble

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,100
The cityscape is just as gentle

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,400
From the waterfront of Tongari-boshi

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,020
The sun sets to Taishakuten

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,420
Tomorrow will end like this

12
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,920
Katsushika

13
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,500
But I lost my happiness again

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,100
I realized it

15
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,300
Because I'm an idiot

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,440
The stormy baseball tournament

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,360
Isn't this Aikawa Yuki?

18
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,900
I'm a big fan

19
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,480
What?

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:44,740
What?

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,280
I'm coming to the charity concert at Kameyari Bazaar in two weeks.

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,720
Lucky

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,960
I got my autograph

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,700
I'll get it

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,080
That's my senior

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,600
Please look at this

27
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,380
What?

28
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,120
You're doing a charity concert at Kameyari Bazaar?

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,720
Lucky

30
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,520
What?

31
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,360
I have to come two weeks later?

32
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,020
What do you mean?

33
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:10,560
What?

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,060
I heard that he double-booked the office for misunderstanding.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,660
Kameari Shopping Street and Minami Shopping Street are not very good friends.

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,340
What are they going to do?

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,920
They are going to settle the score with a soccer game.

38
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,760
A soccer game?

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,340
Speaking of which, the people from Kameari Shopping Street were practicing earlier.

40
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,260
What?

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,040
Ah, it doesn't matter if I beat one or get to meet Yuki-chan.

42
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,980
No, I can't!

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,480
I want to forget that Yuki-chan brought me here.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,680
Hurry!

45
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,560
Is your reservation still okay?

46
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,880
You're welcome.

47
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,220
He picked up the tree.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,920
Kiyohara!

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,300
Are you really Kiyohara?

50
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,900
Why are you here?

51
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,860
Actually, my son's classmate's father's,

52
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,980
the president's wife's,

53
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,140
and his grandmother's distant relative

54
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,440
played against Kiyohara in the Little League.

55
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,340
That's why they're helping out the store.

56
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,940
Now he's a member of the shopping street.

57
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,680
I see. I'll do my best in the next match.

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,180
I see.

59
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,560
It's obvious that Kiyohara will win.

60
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,260
I'll root for you, president.

61
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,700
I'll ask for your autograph.

62
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
Leave it to me.

63
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,820
I'll leave it to you.

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,280
What?

65
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,620
It's Kiyohara?

66
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,040
Yes.

67
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,820
I saw it on TV.

68
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,660
Mizuhara is so cowardly.

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,120
He's playing baseball and playing baseball.

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,560
What's he going to do?

71
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,560
What are you going to do, Ozaki?

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,700
He's playing baseball.

73
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,680
He's got no chance of winning.

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,160
If he's a substitute, I'm a substitute too.

75
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,300
I can't lose to him in the next match.

76
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,860
Still, he's not a substitute.

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
I guess there's no one who's good at baseball.

78
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,440
Well, I'll do it.

79
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,100
I don't know how I'm going to win tomorrow.

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,000
I must do what I thought was right.

81
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,200
What if Kiyohara does it now?

82
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,540
Yes.

83
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,100
He's a substitute.

84
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,700
Another such a shame.

85
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,000
I never thought I'd be this good at baseball.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,300
He's a substitute?

87
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:08,660
Next time you come here, this place will be a shame.

88
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:08,700
He's the only one who can fight against Kiyohara in our town,

89
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,660
with his strong physical strength and life force like a cockroach.

90
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,980
Ryochi Kankichi!

91
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,100
Hey! Go home!

92
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,280
You idiot!

93
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,720
You can't even fight against a member of the Kusaya team!

94
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,360
If we win, we'll be able to see Aikawa Yuki-chan up close.

95
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,880
Even if Minami Shopping Street wins, we'll be able to see her.

96
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,600
I knew it. He's not going to let us win easily.

97
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,060
Let's use our best move.

98
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,540
This is the total amount of debt we owe the shopping street.

99
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,340
You have to pay it back immediately.

100
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,120
You're so annoying! I told you I'd wait for the bonus!

101
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,160
Well, what do you think?

102
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,040
Pay it back now!

103
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,460
That's right!

104
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,900
That's right!

105
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,860
That's right!

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,440
That's right!

107
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,280
That's right!

108
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,840
That's right!

109
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,740
I get it! I get it!

110
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,620
We can pay it back!

111
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,560
You're going to pay it back, huh?

112
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,340
However, if we win the match, we'll have to pay off all of my debts.

113
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,460
That's the condition.

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,620
What?

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,360
At least 20%!

116
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,000
No, 50%.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,460
No!

118
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,000
Then 80%!

119
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,060
No, no, no!

120
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,580
What?!

121
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,220
I'm going to pay it back now!

122
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,560
Alright! I'll pay it back!

123
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,760
I understand how you feel about the shopping street being rebuilt.

124
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,600
We're going to do our best for the shop.

125
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,260
Paying off all of our debts.

126
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,480
No, no, no, no, no, no!

127
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,940
Um, why am I coming on board?

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,100
The traffic in the shopping street is making me worried.

129
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,620
I've never played baseball!

130
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,380
Let's do the game of Aikawa Yukihai-Kameari Shopping Street Versus Kameari Minami Shopping Street!

131
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,660
We'll have a match!

132
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,680
On the first floor,

133
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,060
Kameari Minami Shopping Street.

134
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,120
Number 1,

135
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,700
Carl Lewis,

136
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,380
in Sarashina Soba.

137
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,820
Come on!

138
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,020
Nice!

139
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,360
The superstar of the field,

140
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,900
Carl Lewis!

141
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,020
It wasn't just Kiyohara!

142
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,200
My daughter's friend's cousin

143
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,520
met Carl through the internet.

144
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,360
Hey, come on!

145
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,040
Come on!

146
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,940
Even if 100 meters and running is the best in the world,

147
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,680
baseball is a man of the field!

148
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,340
It's a must!

149
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,220
Nice!

150
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,640
I got it!

151
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,480
What the?

152
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,960
I got it!

153
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,760
Nice!

154
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,660
Number 2,

155
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,240
Kamiho Date,

156
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,160
This time,

157
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,300
he's a female tennis player!

158
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,420
I wonder if he also knows Mr. Mizuhara.

159
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,220
No, I don't!

160
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,800
Hey!

161
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,820
Don't make fun of a tennis player!

162
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,360
I'll shoot!

163
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:52,900
Team!

164
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,220
Good! You've won!

165
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,380
This time for sure!

166
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,620
Number 3. The part-time job of the Sekiguchi Kometen. Takanohana.

167
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,720
Takanohana, do your best!

168
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,980
What? There's still more?

169
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,700
Senpai! Look!

170
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,280
That's the professional soccer player, Maezo,

171
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,200
and the professional basketball player, Michael Jordan!

172
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,960
There are only top athletes!

173
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,240
You're so dirty!

174
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,320
You're using a professional player

175
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,960
for a match against a store!

176
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,680
You're breaking the rules!

177
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,240
What are you saying?

178
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,820
We're all people working at the store!

179
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,320
You're not a clerk, Ryo-san.

180
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,560
You're the one who's breaking the rules!

181
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,100
You're making up excuses!

182
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,820
You're the one who's making up excuses!

183
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,580
You're the one who's making up excuses!

184
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:50,980
You're the one who's making up excuses!

185
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,860
If you hit your body and make everyone stand up,

186
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,060
I'll shoot you!

187
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,520
I'll shoot you!

188
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,720
I'll shoot you!

189
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080
Dead Ball!

190
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,020
Oh, it didn't work at all.

191
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,960
I practice hitting my body every day.

192
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,640
Number 4. The part-time job of the Mizuhara Gang. Kiyohara.

193
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,860
Kiyohara, do your best!

194
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,840
Kiyohara, do your best!

195
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,280
Kiyohara, do your best!

196
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,600
Number 5!

197
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,620
Hit me!

198
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,200
Professionals don't use that kind of deep ball!

199
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,980
father!

200
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,240
father!

201
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,380
father!

202
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,460
father!

203
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,980
Son of a bitch!

204
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,560
Son of a bitch!

205
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,100
Four!

206
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,820
Four!

207
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,840
Dad!

208
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
Dad!

209
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,860
What's wrong with you?

210
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,000
I've never been so beaten in a single round.

211
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,820
I've never been so beaten in a single round.

212
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,420
There's too much power difference.

213
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,900
I should quit.

214
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,240
Don't talk nonsense.

215
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,220
I'm in debt.

216
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,640
I can't give up like this.

217
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,700
But, Senpai, look at that.

218
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,520
What?

219
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,680
It's the great league's NOMO.

220
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,300
It's the great league's NOMO.

221
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,460
Honda, even if you die, come out on the ring!

222
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:22,840
Honda, even if you die, come out on the ring!

223
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,720
No way...

224
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,340
Grable!

225
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,260
Strike!

226
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:36,800
Strike!

227
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,700
Hey, break the hand!

228
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,360
Strike!

229
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,620
Strike!

230
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:42,820
Strike!

231
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:43,880
Strike!

232
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,320
Strike!

233
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,240
Excuse me.

234
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,580
Hey, hey, that won't make it into the match.

235
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,240
Hey, hey, that won't make it into the match.

236
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,560
Let's take a break.

237
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,500
Yes, sir.

238
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,080
Come on!

239
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,340
I can shoot with this!

240
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,000
It's a right-mine hit!

241
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,760
Maezono!

242
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,320
What?

243
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,820
That's a right-mine hit!

244
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, no!

245
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,880
I'm...

246
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,340
I'm...

247
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,600
A home run!

248
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,480
Ha ha.

249
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,440
Ah!

250
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,180
Is that the Bo Takatobi's Bouboo?

251
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,620
No, it isn't.

252
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,040
Out!

253
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,020
Three outs change!

254
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,640
Come on, come on!

255
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,920
Brrr!

256
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,280
NEGGIE!!

257
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,020
Ta-da!

258
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,840
Ha!

259
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,160
Whoa!

260
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,540
âª âª

261
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,980
âª âª

262
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,040
âª âª

263
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,360
âª âª

264
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,460
âª âª

265
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:25,740
âª âª

266
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:25,860
âª âª

267
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,060
âª âª

268
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,240
âª âª

269
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,320
âª âª

270
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,420
âª âª

271
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,760
âª âª

272
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,400
Huh?

273
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,620
Rain?

274
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,200
Listen, it's finally raining now!

275
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,360
This game's over!

276
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,600
What?

277
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,340
What's going to happen?

278
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,600
We win.

279
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,480
Our game's worth 23 points.

280
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,420
What?

281
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,300
Or are we playing

282
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,700
Can we turn the tables?

283
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,040
Let's give up already.

284
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,640
That's right.

285
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,320
We can make another chance to call Yuki-chan.

286
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,080
No!

287
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,980
At this rate, the dream of zero debt will disappear.

288
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,520
Well, the match ends here.

289
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,820
Wait!

290
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,100
The match is still halfway through!

291
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,420
The engine is finally running!

292
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,600
Ryo-san, I understand how you feel, but...

293
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,500
You guys!

294
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,400
You said you would never lose today's match!

295
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,920
Is that what you really wanted?

296
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,940
And the other pro athletes!

297
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,880
You can't say you're a true sportsman if you can't escape this rain!

298
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,120
You're a pro, so you have to fight to see what the conditions are!

299
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,060
What are you talking about?

300
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,260
Think about the situation!

301
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,100
It's okay, Mizuhara-san.

302
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,260
We're also pro athletes.

303
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,120
We have the will to win.

304
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,080
I understand.

305
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,620
Let's do this until the end.

306
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,820
Don't stop no matter what happens!

307
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,400
But if we continue...

308
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,080
No, it's about you.

309
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,420
You might have a plan.

310
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,980
If you're in a bad condition, it's my fault.

311
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,980
For now, let's just run away.

312
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,460
And...

313
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,660
Hurry it up.

314
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,220
If you're in a bad condition, you're no match for me.

315
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,860
What's the time limit?

316
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,420
30 seconds in the air!

317
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,720
Don't give up!

318
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:52,900
Let's have a look...

319
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,320
If you're faster, we're more than happy!

320
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,100
You're faster, have a proper fight.

321
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,600
You're slow and then you want to miss!

322
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:58,760
It's the end.

323
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,520
Chisato...

324
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,700
Ah!

325
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,040
Ah! My hand slipped!

326
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,480
What was that?

327
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,120
Of course, it was intentional.

328
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,080
He immediately showed his true power.

329
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,460
What's this?

330
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,700
It's weird.

331
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,840
This skinny...

332
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,480
Turn, turn.

333
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,040
I did it! I got one point back!

334
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,840
I did it! I got one point back!

335
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:43,440
I did it! I got one point back!

336
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,880
I won't lose another point!

337
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,320
A Bunshin Makyu!

338
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,560
Strike, Buster!

339
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,140
Strike, Buster!

340
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,580
It's dirty!

341
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,820
The mud is also thrown up!

342
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,020
Is there any proof that I did it on purpose?

343
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,740
I'm sorry, Kiyohara.

344
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,600
I didn't mean to,

345
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,500
but I'm sorry.

346
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,600
I just got mud on my hand with this rain.

347
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,920
Please forgive me.

348
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,800
Yes, we both have bad conditions.

349
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,680
B...

350
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,960
In this situation,

351
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,120
Senpai is so lively.

352
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,640
Oh, no!

353
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,280
What's going on?

354
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:25,960
It's not easy to win.

355
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,000
Friends, come here.

356
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,720
Will we be able to win?

357
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,420
We have to win this battle.

358
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:33,580
Buster...

359
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:33,660
It's okay.

360
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,860
We won!

361
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,580
After this,

362
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,220
we should work together to turn the situation around.

363
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,780
Right before we leave this mess.

364
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,860
There is no escape.

365
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:43,800
Please.

366
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,700
Then we'll be able to win.

367
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,280
e...

368
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,660
The end.

369
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,760
Don't be discouraged.

370
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,500
Why?

371
00:17:59,500 --> 00:17:59,800
Yes!

372
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,560
A big storm and a stormy storm warning has just been issued.

373
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,180
If you are in a car, please evacuate to the emergency shelter!

374
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,680
The river is overflowing!

375
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,500
We can't keep on racing!

376
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,980
Let's end this!

377
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,600
If you're okay with losing, then let's end this!

378
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,040
Don't be silly!

379
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,300
We're still winning!

380
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,880
But the game is still on our side.

381
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,680
We've been chasing them up to the third point!

382
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,340
I told you we wouldn't stop the game no matter what!

383
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,840
We're not done yet!

384
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,240
Senior!

385
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,280
Mr. Honma and the others are going to be swept away!

386
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,740
I don't care!

387
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,920
Even if we're not enough for two or one, we can still play baseball!

388
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:58,860
Hey!

389
00:18:59,500 --> 00:18:59,840
Mr. Honma!

390
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,060
This is a decisive victory!

391
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,840
Please evacuate!

392
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,380
Calm down!

393
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,880
Just move forward!

394
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,760
Calm down!

395
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,000
Calm down!

396
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,100
Help!

397
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,360
Mr. Honma!

398
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,580
We're being swept away!

399
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,240
Save us!

400
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,180
Mr. Honma!

401
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,820
Are you all right?

402
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,020
Mr. Ronda!

403
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,060
Well, I was swept away by the waves on the 8th floor.

404
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,940
Are you still playing baseball?

405
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,480
Help me!

406
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,520
What a bunch of people.

407
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,580
Help me!

408
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,540
Running in the middle of the night! No, I mean, a swimming home run!

409
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,980
Iwasaki, I'm counting on you!

410
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,560
Yes!

411
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,260
Iwasaki, the best swimmer!

412
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,300
Ronda!

413
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,720
Oh, my God!

414
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
I did it! I'm in the top!

415
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,160
Ryo!

416
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,100
It's dangerous there!

417
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,480
Please evacuate immediately!

418
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,240
Don't be silly!

419
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,800
I'm in the top!

420
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,560
I've been chasing you for 15 years!

421
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,940
You can't stop me here!

422
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:29,960
What?

423
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:32,920
Help me!

424
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,160
Help me!

425
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,880
Help me!

426
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,360
Help me!

427
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,800
If the pitcher is gone, we win!

428
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,620
I'm still here!

429
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,060
The pitcher has experience in high school.

430
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,480
As expected, you have come out, Kiyohara!

431
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,340
Kiyohara Kiyohara

432
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,480
Kiyohara Kiyohara

433
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,640
Kiyohara Kiyohara

434
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,100
Ginga!

435
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,380
Gross!

436
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,460
Kiyohara!

437
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,000
Ginga!

438
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,800
Kiyohara!

439
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,800
Kiyohara!

440
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm here!

441
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,200
Hi!

442
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:10,960
Kiyohara!

443
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,220
How about you?

444
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,900
Hi!

445
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:25,020
Mr. Kiyohara!

446
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,200
Kiyohara!

447
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,300
Kiyohara!

448
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,620
Kiyohara!

449
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,980
The two directors are being dragged away!

450
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,380
Hurry up and save them!

451
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,500
They're still fighting.

452
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,400
By the way, what happened to the match?

453
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,340
I don't know.

454
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,940
Ryo...

455
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:50,060
Here I come!

456
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,440
Come at me!

457
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,400
Yaaay!

458
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,660
You fools!

459
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,700
We did it and goodbye!

460
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,540
He really said it. He really did say goodbye to the homerun!

461
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,920
OK, OK. I believe what Ryo said.

462
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,540
So that makes it the final decision for Yukiyuki Aikawa to come to my Kameari Shopping Street.

463
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,760
Wait a minute! There is no one who can prove what Ryo said!

464
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,360
There's no one who can prove Ryosan's home run.

465
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,020
The judges have all been thrown into the 9th floor.

466
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,900
You can't believe what the police officer says.

467
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,080
You're the one who always says not to believe what Ryo says.

468
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,400
My debt is on the line!

469
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,920
It's a big problem!

470
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,180
It's a big problem!

471
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,100
Thanks to the heavy rain yesterday,

472
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,560
Yuki couldn't come home from school.

473
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,640
Then, what about today's event?

474
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,100
It's the same thing.

475
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,560
Let's go home.

476
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,740
Let's go to work.

477
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,560
Hey, wait!

478
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,020
What about my debt?

479
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,780
Ryosan, I'm sorry, but please forget about this.

480
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,840
No way!

481
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,580
At least 50%...

482
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,140
No, 20% or even 10% is fine.

483
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,860
Please make it cheaper.

484
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,620
The court has been decided on Nakoto,

485
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,580
and he's given his relatives an invitation.

486
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,360
What are you thinking, dad?

487
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,240
Maria!

488
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:11,700
You're a man!

489
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,320
You can't get married!

490
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,460
You're preparing a parade for the Samba Carnival!

491
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,780
Next time on Dengeki Kekkon!

492
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,840
Ryotsu Kankichi!

493
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,700
See you!

âª It's said that a woman who can't fall in love is a woman who can't fall in love. âª

498
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,380
âª There are many things I want to do. âª

499
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:52,540
âª I want to ride a bike through the vast desert. âª

500
00:24:52,540 --> 00:25:00,280
âª I want to be more free than a bird. âª

501

âª A lady's dream that changes at the speed of a full moon. âª

00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:15,440
âª It's my love, sorry, wait. âª

503

âª The brightness of the future in the panorama âª

âª The brightness of the future in the panorama âª

510
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,000
I was able to get a lot of points.

511
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,760
I'm glad I was able to get a lot of points.

512
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,940
I'm glad I was able to get a lot of points.

513
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm glad I was able to get a lot of points.
