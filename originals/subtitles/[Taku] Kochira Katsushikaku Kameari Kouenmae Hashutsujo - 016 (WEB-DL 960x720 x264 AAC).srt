Hey, hey.

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,840
Is this really our way?

23
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,720
Yes.

24
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,000
Maybe we can take this path from up this went,

25
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,640
even though we didn't even see a car navigation system yet...

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,480
We haven't seen anything from the other side.

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,880
How does it look there?

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,200
What do you think, Honda?

29
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,060
It's definitely a one-way street.

30
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,460
But, boss, are you really commuting from here?

31
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,400
Yes. The JR, the station, and the bus.

32
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,960
It takes another 20 minutes to walk.

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,960
It takes 2 and a half hours to get there.

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,760
5 hours to get back?

35
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,060
You're getting a little too far.

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,040
By the way, Ryo-chan.

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,780
What did you buy for your boss?

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,720
This.

39
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,740
It's a secret until we arrive.

40
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,400
What?

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,600
We all gave each other money, so you can tell me.

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,640
Don't worry.

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
I chose it specially.

44
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,240
There's no doubt about it.

45
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,860
That's not what I mean.

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,440
The people who give presents don't know what they're sending.

47
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,480
That's strange.

48
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,180
That's right.

49
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,240
I'll just say it's the best thing ever.

50
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,240
Boss, you'll be so happy when you see this.

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,460
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,080
No, you're not.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,200
Wait, when did you enter the apartment?

54
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,780
It should be around the same time now.

55
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,940
What an intensive scene, though.

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,360
Hey.

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,540
What's happened, boss?

58
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,700
Oh.

59
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,220
Boss.

60
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,020
Senpai!

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,640
Um, I'd like to ask you something.

62
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,020
Yes?

63
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,780
Do you know any houses called Ohara?

64
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,360
Ah, that's about 1 km away.

65
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,760
Really? If you don't mind, can you drive me there?

66
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,120
I'll take you there.

67
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,260
But it's just a one-way street. There's no need to worry.

68
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,140
Don't say that. It's just a one-way street.

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,720
Oh, it's so beautiful.

70
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,680
Get off. He'll take you.

71
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,000
What? What should I do?

72
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,120
You're walking so fast.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then you don't have to show me around.

74
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,820
Um, I don't want to be on your car.

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm sorry. Please wait.

76
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,180
Get off.

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,240
Senpai.

78
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,560
You can take this car for 5 people.

79
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,440
Shut up, Nakagawa. I don't like narrow cars.

80
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,240
Ryo, you look so pitiful.

81
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,160
Reiko, sit in the front.

82
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,140
Honda!

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,340
Don't you think it's wrong to make me wait?

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,260
No, no.

85
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,700
Shino, don't get on. Get off.

86
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,720
Here you go.

87
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,080
Why did this happen?

88
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,800
Why did this happen?

89
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,580
Then,

90
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's celebrate your boss's birthday.

91
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,040
That's right.

92
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,920
This is also a piece of the world.

93
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,100
It's a lot of work.

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,840
I had to go to the mountains for a holiday.

95
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,700
Oh, my.

96
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,480
I built a house where this raccoon would come out.

97
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,840
Excuse me.

98
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,840
Do you live around here?

99
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,440
Yes.

100
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,960
Well,

101
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,320
Even so,

102
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,500
I can't believe you're celebrating my birthday.

103
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,340
You're really buttered by your subordinates.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,580
That's right.

105
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,900
With hard work and hard work,

106
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,240
I don't do anything.

107
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:12,920
boring,

108
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,760
I'm really buttered by the story.

109
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,180
What the heck?

110
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
That's what you think.

111
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,580
You have to work under people like that.

112
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,040
What a shame.

113
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,000
But you don't want to bother people.

114
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,620
In Senpai's case,

115
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,660
He's been bothering you, doesn't he?

116
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
I've been troubled.

117
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,020
They're going to be here soon.

118
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,100
Oh, over there.

119
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,520
I see. So this is the manager's house.

120
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,660
A small veranda,

121
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,140
a garden I made by force,

122
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,140
and a garden.

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,900
However...

124
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,480
I guess I was able to send

125
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,700
the reflection of my sweat and tears

126
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,700
to build this tiny house.

127
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,060
Oh, right.

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,240
You have to send it to your home.

129
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,200
No, I don't.

130
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,680
I'm here, too.

131
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,380
What?

132
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,120
Because this is my home.

133
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,060
What?

134
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,060
So you mean...

135
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,120
Could it be...

136
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:12,960
Yes.

137
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,900
I'm Hirobi, the daughter of a man

138
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,080
who's been holding, yelling, and stinking

139
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,460
and not listening to his boss.

140
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,060
Welcome.

141
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,560
Oh, you're...

142
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,200
The manager?

143
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,120
Yes.

144
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,860
So...

145
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,440
You've known about it?

146
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,160
Yes.

147
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:27,860
I've heard a lot about you

148
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,180
from my father.

149
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,820
I've been very respectful

150
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,760
of you since the day I was born.

151
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,000
You're really like a police officer's mirror.

152
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,420
Yes.

153
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,320
It's okay.

154
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,200
Don't force yourself.

155
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,400
Because my father

156
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,440
is really like that.

157
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,720
Y-Yes, he is.

158
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,560
I'm so happy!

159
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,840
Really?

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
Hey, Honda's here, too.

161
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,480
I'm home!

162
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:01,720
Hey, Dad!

163
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,080
Your guests are here!

164
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,160
Hm?

165
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Is there someone here?

166
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:05,920
Oh!

167
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,360
Oh, hello, hello.

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,680
You guys!

169
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,400
What are you doing here?

170
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,480
What do you mean?

171
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,180
I'm sure you've been doing your best

172
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,040
to help your cute subordinates.

173
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,780
I'm a thousand times more cute than you.

174
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,220
Oh, welcome, everyone.

175
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,380
I'm sorry.

176
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,100
We were all so busy.

177
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,860
Thank you.

178
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,660
Hm.

179
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,460
Well, you may leave.

180
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,600
See you later.

181
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:29,800
See you later.

182
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:31,860
See you later.

183
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,860
Well, Chief, you're a great guy.

184
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,120
The building of this entrance

185
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,560
is very well organized,

186
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,320
and you're a very nice person.

187
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,200
Hm?

188
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,180
And the taste of the wall painting

189
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,800
makes the guests feel more relaxed.

190
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,080
You're not getting up!

191
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:51,980
Huh?

192
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,220
What are you talking about, Dad?

193
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,960
You brought us here.

194
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,800
Come on, Ryotsu, get up.

195
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,420
Hehehe.

196
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,100
I can't believe you're so cute.

197
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,240
I shouldn't have said that

198
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,560
you had a cute daughter.

199
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,000
Hey, Ryotsu,

200
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,800
I'm telling you,

201
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,600
don't get upset over nothing.

202
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,480
I don't think Hiromi would be so kind

203
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,520
as to treat a cowardly man like you.

204
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,920
Well, I'm a cowardly man, after all.

205
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,460
I'm not as good as you.

206
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,520
Wh-What?

207
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,180
Dad, stop it.

208
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,560
This isn't a work place.

209
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

210
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,180
Tee-hee.

211
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,040
Tee-hee.

212
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,820
Tee-hee.

213
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,080
Tee-hee.

214
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,500
What's he doing here?

215
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,480
Why did he come all of a sudden?

216
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,240
Oh, is he really ungrateful?

217
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,200
Huh?

218
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,000
Happy birthday, Dad.

219
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,540
H-Happy birthday?

220
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,100
Congratulations, Mayor!

221
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,340
Congratulations!

222
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,780
Congratulations.

223
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,220
Congratulations, Mayor.

224
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,980
Alright, Dad.

225
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,160
What?

226
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,780
What?

227
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,900
Mucho!

228
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,680
Has anything happened?

229
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,020
S- Bayern.

230
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,740
Ah, everyone, thank you.

231
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,680
Congratulations!

232
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,740
Then you guys,

233
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,020
I'm going to have to do something to celebrate my birthday.

234
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,900
Ah, boss, are you crying?

235
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,040
I-I'm not crying, idiot!

236
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,680
Yes, father, this is from me and my mother.

237
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,440
Oh, leather shoes.

238
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,300
Hmm, I'll use them carefully.

239
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,660
Boss, this is a small gift from us.

240
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,900
What is it? It's quite big.

241
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,220
After all, what did you buy?

242
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,740
What is this?

243
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,860
How is it, boss? It's nostalgic, isn't it?

244
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,780
We're having a nostalgic candy fair in the department store.

245
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,780
Look, there are two balls and a cotton ball,

246
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,080
a silver ball cannon, a pachinko,

247
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,900
a kombu, a sauce, and a squid suzuke.

248
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,260
And this Bakchiku.

249
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,520
In the past, it was called a Nibi, but it was a bigger one.

250
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,060
Boss, is that all the money you've collected?

251
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,000
Of course.

252
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,120
Well, if you have 20,000 yen, you can buy a lot of things.

253
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,500
You didn't know?

254
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,400
Yes, I didn't know that you would choose the present yourself.

255
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,640
Hmm, I knew that I had to leave it to Ryo-chan.

256
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,340
It was a mistake to leave it to Ryo-chan.

257
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,480
Hey, what is this?

258
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,800
What is it? You don't even know what a cotton ball is?

259
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,500
Okay, look.

260
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,700
You can take it like this.

261
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,700
Wow, that's interesting.

262
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,760
A cotton ball is something you put your hips in like this and do this.

263
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,940
Are you going to lose to the boss?

264
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,220
What?

265
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,880
Hmm, this has gotten out of hand.

266
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:03,980
Huh?

267
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,860
Tsk.

268
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,920
Tsk.

269
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,440
Tsk.

270
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,680
How was that?

271
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,680
Hahaha.

272
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:13,960
Ah...

273
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,320
Oh...

274
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,620
Ahem...

275
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,580
Well, guys.

276
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,240
Thank you so much for today.

277
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,720
This is a gift, anyway.

278
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,100
I'm so happy that you celebrated my birthday.

279
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,620
This is a gift, anyway.

280
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,980
I was so absorbed in reading the script.

281
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
That's right.

282
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,540
I'd like to offer everyone a cup of tea as a token of gratitude.

283
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,260
Tea?

284
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:53,060
What's this room?

285
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,340
There's nothing here.

286
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,920
This is the tea room.

287
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,300
It's where we drink tea.

288
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,360
Tea room?

289
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,640
It's a small house, but you made this room just to drink tea?

290
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,200
Ryo, you have to sit here.

291
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,740
Really?

292
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,260
What is this?

293
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,380
Here.

294
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,420
Thank you for taking care of me.

295
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,300
You're welcome.

296
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,120
Ouch.

297
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,380
You can't touch it right away.

298
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,560
Wait until the manager comes.

299
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,500
I'm not going to touch it.

300
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,720
Then please wait a moment.

301
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,080
Ryo, do you know?

302
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,180
When you drink tea, you have to slowly...

303
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,400
I know that much.

304
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,700
I have to turn it around three times.

305
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,120
You're stupid.

306
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,880
If you turn it vertically, the tea will spill out, right?

307
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,500
Uh-huh.

308
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,740
I'm sorry, Shibata.

309
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,300
I went to the tea room, but it's empty.

310
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,960
It's still empty.

311
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,640
I'm sure the manager is in a hurry.

312
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,240
I'm saying this because I'm sorry.

313
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,060
Go to sleep.

314
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,480
You should sleep all night.

315
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,320
No, I'm drinking tea.

316
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,280
What is your fault?

317
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,780
It's just that there is no sound inside the room.

318
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:26,680
"I love you"

319
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,180
"I love you too"

320
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,920
"Homura san, are you OK?"

321
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,940
"My feet are numb..."

322
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,620
"I'm not sure about you..."

323
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,680
"Here's some sweets."

324
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,420
"I speak of the devil! I got the food you ordered!

325
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,460
"Then now I would like to..."

326
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,400
"Hurt!"

327
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,960
Hey, you!

328
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,140
Huh?

329
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,520
You know nothing about the heart of tea!

330
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,780
You don't have to do anything, just sit there quietly!

331
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,880
Hmm, I understand.

332
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,780
Anyway, I'll give you a taste of my proud tea bowl.

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,280
Tea bowl?

334
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,980
This is what I value the most right now.

335
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,260
Oh my!

336
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,780
I found it when I was traveling to Kyoto.

337
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,640
I really wanted it, so I bought it thinking I'd use it for the rest of my life.

338
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,880
It's a black-and-white tea bowl.

339
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,340
It looks pretty good.

340
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,660
It's a work of art.

341
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,780
Oh, I see.

342
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,940
The black luster is wonderful.

343
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,980
I'll give everyone tea with this tea bowl.

344
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,780
Tea bowl, huh?

345
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,820
What kind of stupid thing is that?

346
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,720
Ryo-ryotsu!

347
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,660
Hey, you!

348
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,400
Stop it!

349
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:51,880
I'm fine.

350
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,400
Let me have a look.

351
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,340
Oh!

352
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,400
Ah!

353
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,460
Ah!

354
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,160
Oh!

355
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,360
Oh!

356
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,620
Oh!

357
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:01,860
Oh!

358
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,360
Oh!

359
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,900
Chief, that was a close call.

360
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,160
That's what I mean by a good catch.

361
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,600
Idiot!

362
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,040
You don't have to worry about it.

363
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,020
This tea bowl is worth 400,000 yen!

364
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,340
...or buy anything!

365
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,880
What?! ¥ 400,000?!

366
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,760
It's life-threatening, isn't it?!

367
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
Hm... Well, in this world there is ...

368
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,980
...something worth undetectable for you!

369
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,200
Huh...

370
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,380
It was quite an effort.

371
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,720
I didn't want to see too much pillow.

372
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,540
The old man and the new man

373
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,380
The old man and the new man

374
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,060
U-uh...

375
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,500
It was really delicious...

376
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,860
The old man and the new man

377
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,560
Ah, you weren't careful.

378
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,760
Just prepare a proper meal.

379
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,840
Next...

380
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,440
The old man and the new man

381
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,360
Keep the tea ready for the operation.

382
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,140
He's a king.

383
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,000
I prefer the tea to the swing.

384
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,140
Hmph, yes you are the king.

385
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,800
...it might be more suitable.

386
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,080
But I've already prepared the meal, so hold on a little longer.

387
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,140
Dad?

388
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,320
The phone is ringing.

389
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,720
I see.

390
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,440
Well then, Ryotsu, wait.

391
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,420
Don't touch the teacups no matter what.

392
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,580
Got it?

393
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,060
I got it.

394
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,680
Are you sure you're alright?

395
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,020
I'm fine.

396
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,980
Good grief.

397
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,640
What's with the 400,000 teacups?

398
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,800
If they're so big, you could have put them on your bed.

399
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,840
But I was so nervous drinking tea with 400,000 teacups.

400
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,960
Tea tools are so simple, and everyone has their own.

401
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,320
This is it.

402
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,860
This is just right for cleaning your ears.

403
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,040
Senpai, that's not good.

404
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,380
That's right.

405
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,820
That's right.

406
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,020
What?

407
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,720
I don't care.

408
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,580
Well, I'll set you up to pay the tax.

409
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:23,660
The real work is to just keep on writing, like a washing machine.

410
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,480
Ah, go around, ah, go around.

411
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,120
Hey, stop it.

412
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,700
Ah, go around, ah, go around.

413
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,240
Ah, go around, go around.

414
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,100
Ryo-chan, stop it.

415
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,160
Ah, go around, go around.

416
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,420
Ah, go around, go around.

417
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,920
Senpai.

418
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,260
Ah, it hurts.

419
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:45,640
It hurts.

420
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,460
I'm a bit upset.

421
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,740
Huh?

422
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,480
Ryo-chan.

423
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,260
Senpai.

424
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,260
Eh?

425
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,160
W-why?

426
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,300
Ah!

427
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,220
W-w-what?

428
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,080
Finally.

429
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:02,980
It's broken.

430
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,340
I-it's broken so easily.

431
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,220
How dare you...

432
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,440
I'm sure the manager was believed!

433
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,120
Wait!

434
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,160
Oh, sorry to keep you waiting.

435
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,840
Hmm?

436
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,860
Ryo-chan, what are you doing?

437
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,640
Huh-huh-huh...

438
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:18,800
Whoops...

439
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,040
But the manager-senpai is such a wonderful kid.

440
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,140
Huh?

441
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,280
What's the big deal?

442
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,020
Yes, I know.

443
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,360
My hands are so rough, I don't feel like hand-shake.

444
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,460
Really?

445
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,380
Really? Then I'll make tea with it, so give it back soon.

446
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,800
No, no, no.

447
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,540
Please let me interfere for a while longer.

448
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,720
No, no, no.

449
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,080
It's not good to let you hold it.

450
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,340
Now, give it back soon.

451
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,340
Just a little longer.

452
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:51,840
No.

453
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,680
Really, just a little longer.

454
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,500
Hey, Ryotsu, stop it.

455
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,180
What's that?

456
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,580
Hey, wait, Ryotsu.

457
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,200
Don't wait.

458
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,240
Is the tea party over?

459
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,080
I'm preparing for the barbecue.

460
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,800
That's...

461
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,780
Oh, barbecue.

462
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,740
It'll be ready soon.

463
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,680
Yes, thank you.

464
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,880
Where are you, Ryotsu?

465
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
I'm right there.

466
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,160
Here, give me the teacup.

467
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,640
Hey, Ryotsu.

468
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,520
Look, Chief.

469
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,880
If you look at it in nature, it's even more beautiful.

470
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,120
This teacup.

471
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
I don't care about that.

472
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Give it back soon.

473
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,400
What's the matter?

474
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,600
Oh, well...

475
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,420
You're rude to your guest.

476
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,780
Come on, Ryotsu.

477
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,400
Please eat.

478
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,320
I'm sorry.

479
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,960
I'll forgive you if you give it back now.

480
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,440
Come on, give it back now.

481
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:50,920
Really?

482
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,020
You'll forgive me if I give it back now?

483
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,020
Yeah.

484
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,200
Men don't have a second opinion.

485
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,660
What should I do?

486
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,720
Please give it back.

487
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,320
It's easy to break the teacup.

488
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,820
What if something happens to Maichi?

489
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,480
You'll get a refund.

490
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,820
You're such a fool.

491
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,600
You're like a child.

492
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,980
You can't eat it.

493
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,380
It's okay, man.

494
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,640
Can you please let her have that teacup for a while?

495
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,900
You're such a fool.

496
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,500
How dare you call your daughter a fool?

497
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,220
I'm sorry.

498
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,980
That's all right.

499
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,760
Mr. Honda,

500
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,880
that's going to burn.

501
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,860
I'll eat it.

502
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,220
Ryo, why aren't you eating it?

503
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,540
It's so delicious.

504
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,240
That's right. You'd better eat it now.

505
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,920
Let me eat it.

506
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,280
I refuse.

507
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,520
Hey, Ryo.

508
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,200
Here, drink it.

509
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,600
I won't refuse.

510
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,880
It's not something to drink beer with.

511
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,460
It's not a big deal.

512
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,120
Don't say that to my big brother.

513
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,000
Don't say that to my big brother.

514
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,780
It's fine. Here.

515
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,440
Here.

516
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,960
Your meat is burnt.

517
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,240
What was that?

518
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,140
What did you say?

519
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,640
I think I saw two bowls.

520
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,520
Are you drunk?

521
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,580
That's not true.

522
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,760
Show me the bowls.

523
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,580
That's...

524
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,300
That's...

525
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,400
That's...

526
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,200
Ryo, what did you do with those bowls?

527
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,520
I can't stand it when a guy like you

528
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,460
turns an important bowl into a toy.

529
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,700
Hey, give it back.

530
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,060
Wait, Ryo.

531
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,460
No, no.

532
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,060
You're not going to wait, are you?

533
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,240
I'm not going to wait.

534
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:56,620
Idiot.

535
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,300
You're so annoying.

536
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,460
Ryo, this way.

537
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,200
Hey, Ryo.

538
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,180
That bowl...

539
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,580
That bowl...

540
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,480
You broke it because of the chief.

541
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,060
You broke it because of the chief.

542
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,520
You broke it because of the chief.

543
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,040
because it was my treasure.

544
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,980
What do you expect from me tomorrow?

545
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,040
What do you expect from me tomorrow?

546
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,900
Hey, Dad, don't be so sad.

547
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,680
You can buy a new one, okay?

548
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,580
Oh, it's good.

549
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,420
Ryo!

550
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,140
What? I'll eat it all by myself.

551
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,280
Ryo, you have to apologize.

552
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,260
The chief will feel sorry for you.

553
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,380
Chief, something that has a shape will break someday.

554
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,700
That's the truth of all things.

555
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,240
Anyway, let's eat meat. It's delicious.

556
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,740
I don't need it. You eat it.

557
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,280
Then, I'll hold back.

558
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,320
Ryo, you're so annoying!

559
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,780
Chief, actually...

560
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,000
Oh, idiot, stop it!

561
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,000
That's what I meant.

562
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,600
What?

563
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,480
Chief, I was being too aggressive.

564
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,940
Ryo, you're so...

565
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,540
Unforgivable!

566
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,580
Chief...

567
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,260
Hey, Chief!

568
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,060
I can't eat barbecue!

569
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,860
Stop it!

570
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,580
Hot, hot, hot!

571
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,760
Well, Ryo is selfish.

572
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,900
It's your birthday, Mr. Hiromi.

573
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,860
But it seems like you're enjoying it, Dad.

574
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,080
Ryo's Sumi-be-yaki.

575
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,780
Hot, hot!

576
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,260
This is the best present for me.

577
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,680
Chief, please forgive me!

578
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,500
Nakagawa, Reiko, Honda, Mr. Hiromi!

579
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,600
Mr. Hiromi, help me!

580
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,760
Height 167 cm, weight 71 kg, and both eyes are 2.0.

581
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,700
Chief, are you going to challenge this perfect body?

582
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,620
Of course!

583
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,520
If you really want to compete, come from anywhere.

584
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,040
Next time on the Gokiburi Great Race.

585
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,080
Nice to meet you!

586
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,940
Even if I try to stop the clock,

587
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,620
time will pass by.

588
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,820
Don't look away,

589
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,780
don't look back.

590
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,820
Let's live with a smile on our faces.

591
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,600
Even if it rains today,

592
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,760
even if it rains today,

593
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,240
tomorrow will be sunny.

594
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,280
Bye bye!

595
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,220
Bye bye!

596
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,600
Let's wash our hands.

597
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,060
That's the worst thing.

598
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,420
Bye bye!

599
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,300
Oh yeah!

600
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,440
Oh yeah!

601
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,140
Let's live the way we like.

602
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,380
There's good things.

603
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,200
The signboard is waiting outside the door.

604
