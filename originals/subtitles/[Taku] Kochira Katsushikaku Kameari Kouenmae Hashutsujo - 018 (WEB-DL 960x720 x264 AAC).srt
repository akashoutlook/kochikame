It's true.

75
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,980
Well, that's a honor.

76
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,900
For the interview.

77
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,840
Now, now. The man of the year, please go and interview him.

78
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,200
Yes.

79
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,500
I'll go to Patroni.

80
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,300
I'll go to Patroni.

81
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,280
It's only for illegal parking.

82
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,180
Oh, that's right. That's right.

83
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Anyway, illegal parking is illegal.

84
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,260
Hmph. You remember, right?

85
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,940
Sen-senpai, what are you going to do?

86
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,980
Hahaha. I'm cooperating with the interview.

87
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,280
You idiot, I'll show you everything.

88
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,660
Here, there, and here.

89
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,080
And here, too.

90
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,100
If you do that, you'll be the best one, senpai.

91
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,040
That's right. That's right.

92
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,840
You don't understand how I feel.

93
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,420
Sen-senpai...

94
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,400
I'll tell you what I mean by my message.

95
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,520
Get out of here.

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,020
What?

97
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,060
Hurry up. They're coming.

98
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,300
Okay, I'm going.

99
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,600
Here's the cheese.

100
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,700
Got it! Don't underestimate me!

101
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,460
I'm not worried about falling anymore.

102
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,040
I'll think about it.

103
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,660
Thank you for your cooperation.

104
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,340
Thank you very much.

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,060
Well, what can I do for you?

106
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,740
Hm?

107
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,500
Well, the interview is over.

108
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,840
Hmph.

109
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,140
Nakagawa-san, Reiko-senpai, thank you for coming.

110
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,840
Here, don't forget the important camera.

111
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,040
That's not ours.

112
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,940
Hmph.

113
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,680
Huh?

114
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,480
Who are you talking to?

115
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,420
Ohara-buchou, thank you for your hard work.

116
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,020
Oh, no way. The president's...

117
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,740
Oh, that's my camera, Ryo-chan.

118
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,480
Oh, I forgot.

119
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,400
I was looking for it.

120
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,520
Huh?

121
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,160
Sen-senpai...

122
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,240
Ryo-chan, what are you going to do?

123
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,640
I'm going to take a break.

124
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,620
I'll leave the rest to you, Nakagawa, Reiko.

125
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,940
It's going to take a long time.

126
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,340
It's only five or ten years.

127
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,900
Ryo-tsu!

128
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,500
Ryo-tsu is here!

129
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,900
Chief, what's wrong?

130
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,420
Ryo-tsu, where are you?

131
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,680
I'm going on patrol.

132
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,800
You idiot!

133
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,980
Go wherever you want!

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,920
Don't ever show your face again!

135
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,180
You're fired!

136
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,020
I don't need a coward like you!

137
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,020
No way, chief.

138
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,840
This is a deep problem.

139
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,840
Chief, you're joking, aren't you?

140
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,620
I'm not joking.

141
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,620
You're fired!

142
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,460
No way!

143
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,500
Nakagawa, Reiko, explain it to me.

144
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,940
Bye, Ryo-chan.

145
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,700
Huh?

146
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,380
Huh?

147
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:12,640
Ugh!

148
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,540
Nakagawa! Reiko!

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,480
You guys betrayed me!

150
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,440
You guys are so mean!

151
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,540
Hey! Open up!

152
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,960
If you don't open it, this gate is going to break!

153
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,060
If you don't make me angry, then what's going to happen?

154
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,560
Huh?

155
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,000
Ryo-kun made this cake, and it's delicious!

156
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,980
If you want, I can still make some!

157
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,380
Huh?

158
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,140
Ryo-san, the tarts you've saved up,

159
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,400
you should return them now.

160
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
W-wait for me!

161
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
I'll pay you next time!

162
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,760
If you lose, you get...

163
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,540
- A bonus! - A bonus!

164
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,860
Nagagawa! Reiko!

165
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,220
Help me!

166
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,080
Oh, there you are.

167
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,480
That's my camera.

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,780
Give it back.

169
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,320
Chief!

170
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,960
This is a good camera.

171
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,600
It's a Nikon F50.

172
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,360
I wanted one too.

173
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,700
You're very good at this.

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,600
I'm not used to it.

175
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,240
I forgot how to take the film out.

176
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Is that so?

177
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,520
I'm glad.

178
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,840
I didn't know you forgot it in the exhaust.

179
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,540
If they find out, it's a big problem.

180
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,680
Will that be enough?

181
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,060
I'll give it back to Genzo.

182
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,640
Genzo, you're...

183
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,420
Shut up!

184
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,840
Chief, you must be joking!

185
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,040
I'm not joking!

186
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,840
You're fired!

187
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,060
Wait!

188
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,020
Where are you going?

189
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,860
The shopping street.

190
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,480
No, not there.

191
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,100
I'm not going to take a 20 yen bill for a print.

192
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,820
I'm not a consumer.

193
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,580
Is there a cheaper store?

194
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,980
Yes.

195
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,120
I know a 0 yen store.

196
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,320
Don't lie.

197
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,780
Will 0 yen be enough?

198
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,260
Yes.

199
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,420
It costs 24 yen.

200
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,380
The cost of one print is 600 yen.

201
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,360
The most expensive one is the one for the grill.

202
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,640
About 3 percent of that is 180 yen.

203
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,500
The other one is for the drug and human resources.

204
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,840
Even if you subtract that 40 percent,

205
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,980
the remaining 3 percent is 180 yen.

206
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,900
I understand.

207
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,980
I'll hand over the photo to the traffic police tomorrow.

208
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,200
I'll ask them to bring it to you by 10 am.

209
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,780
Leave it to me.

210
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,900
I'll definitely bring it to you by 10 am tomorrow.

211
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,300
Okay.

212
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,700
Let's make this brilliant proposal of a school police officer.

213
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,960
We will be riding in the train,

214
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,300
riding the train,

215
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,340
riding the train,

216
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,340
...

217
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,200
...

218
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,800
...

219
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,380
...

220
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,600
...

221
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:51,620
...

222
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:51,800
...

223
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:51,920
...

224
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,580
...

225
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,860
...

226
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,460
I'm so tired.

227
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,160
You failed!

228
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,360
What?

229
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,500
Well, my face is gone, so it's a success.

230
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,920
But what about the president's photo, Ryo?

231
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,200
I think he said it was in Kyoto.

232
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,360
What?

233
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,240
I think the next newspaper said he'd post a photo of President Ohara's trip to Kyoto.

234
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,140
Really, Terai?

235
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,880
Yeah.

236
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,500
You're out of luck, Terai!

237
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,400
Well, I can imagine.

238
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,480
He took a lot of pictures without any characters in Kyoto's name.

239
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,320
He doesn't remember what he took.

240
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,780
He can't be fooled with a copy of the picture.

241
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,360
Will it work that well?

242
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,280
It'll be fine. He won't find out.

243
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,320
Huh?

244
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,400
Yes, this is Kameari Park Exhibition.

245
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,540
Is Ryo here?

246
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,340
Yes, Buzio. What's up?

247
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,240
Oh, Ryo.

248
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,480
I forgot to tell you, but the print is here.

249
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:52,900
I'll ask you to print it.

250
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,400
I took it with the most handsome boy in Kyoto.

251
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,240
You took it with him?

252
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,380
The president of the Home Department took it.

253
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,160
It might be on the newspaper.

254
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,740
It's an important photo.

255
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,880
I'll ask him to print it clearly.

256
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,020
Okay, leave it to me.

257
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,280
I'm fired.

258
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,660
You're fired!

259
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,940
I can't fool him with a picture.

260
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,700
If it's a bad CG, he'll see through it soon.

261
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,320
It's your fault! Do something!

262
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,940
I don't care.

263
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,120
You're the one who took a picture of me.

264
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,880
That's why it happened.

265
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,220
But he's my senior.

266
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,040
When I was fired, you were fired too.

267
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,240
You had a long life as a policeman, Nakagawa.

268
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,780
I-I understand.

269
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,120
Boss Bonus!

270
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,340
Let's go to Kyoto.

271
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,860
I'm at work now.

272
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,700
If you're getting off, you can do it yourself.

273
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,460
You're so reckless.

274
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,240
You remember the picture I took with the president of the Home Department in Kyoto, don't you?

275
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,600
Of course, it's what happened last week.

276
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,840
Then I'll ask you to print it clearly.

277
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,800
Yes.

278
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,240
What do you think, Nakagawa?

279
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,060
I've sent all the data about the president.

280
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,680
All I have to do is wait for him.

281
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,540
Hey, it's him.

282
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,040
You're fired.

283
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,680
I'm surprised.

284
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,580
Well, I think it's the tie-dye of the brown line.

285
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:24,940
Yes.

286
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,780
Oh, that's it.

287
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,280
What about the color?

288
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,980
Well...

289
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,080
It's clear!

290
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,320
This color is close.

291
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,460
Yes, that's it.

292
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,820
Let me go!

293
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,040
The rest is to be prepared by the staff of our company tomorrow.

294
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,380
I'm sure it will be somehow.

295
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,020
I'm sure it will be somehow.

296
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,380
Finally, we arrived.

297
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,240
Captain!

298
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,220
Captain!

299
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,720
When did you arrive?

300
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,400
Senior.

301
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,140
Yes?

302
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,660
It's a doll made of the data sent by the helicopter just now.

303
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,640
What? A doll?

304
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,900
It's perfect if you're deceived.

305
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh?

306
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,140
Oh, I see.

307
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,640
The color is bright and the texture is good.

308
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,280
It's well made.

309
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,400
I don't think it's a doll.

310
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,780
It's a form latex used for special effects.

311
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,020
I can't look at it unless I see it close.

312
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,660
This face.

313
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,620
The director is nervous to stand in front of the camera.

314
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,280
But why did you make it like this?

315
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,280
Don't ask unnecessary questions!

316
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,080
But...

317
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,640
I prepared it.

318
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,460
Senior, the staff who will cooperate with the shooting has arrived.

319
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,340
Yes.

320
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,180
Thank you!

321
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,960
Good-bye!

322
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,180
Good-bye!

323
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,080
This is everyone?

324
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,420
Yes.

325
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,360
Good-bye!

326
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,580
I think Maiko-san is where I thought that I was.

327
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,480
Welcome.

328
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,120
It's been a week, Spar.

329
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,540
Oh, that time!

330
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,280
All right, everyone?

331
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,780
The shooting begins!

332
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,340
.

333
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,520
How is it?

334
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,420
Exaggeratedly, this is just like a peacock.

335
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,820
Great! Let's take a picture!

336
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,140
Here we go!

337
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,640
The next is Kamogawa!

338
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:11,680
It's a bird!

339
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,100
Recently, our special effects staff has been participating in the super-project of painting in computer graphics.

340
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,680
Is it okay to say that it's "Tatsumaki of the Dinosaur"?

341
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,200
Yes.

342
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,540
Well, if it's for this, you can go to the escape room in the evening.

343
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,200
I've been waiting.

344
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,140
Please enjoy.

345
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,820
Now, please eat.

346
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,420
I thought it was a photo shoot, but it's amazing that there's even a food truck.

347
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,180
It's common in American photo shoots.

348
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,820
This is delicious.

349
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,380
Yes. He used to be the chief of the General Staff at the Sheraton in Hong Kong.

350
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,900
I took him out.

351
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,480
Um, where should I put the chief?

352
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,600
No, Chief Ohara took a photo of the duck, so it won't fit in the river.

353
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,800
Say that quickly!

354
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,420
There's no chief!

355
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,600
I think...

356
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,900
Where the duck flies...

357
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,160
It's the duck!

358
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,940
Let the duck fly!

359
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:09,980
Yes!

360
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,300
Thank you!

361
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,360
Hmm...

362
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,160
What's wrong?

363
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,520
I thought it was where the duck was swimming.

364
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,580
Hey! It's swimming!

365
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,540
It was a hot pot, wasn't it?

366
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,140
It's a hot pot! Hot pot!

367
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,460
I can't.

368
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,980
I don't feel like it was a duck...

369
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,780
Don't do that!

370
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:33,900
Don't you remember clearly!

371
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,080
Fire...

372
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,280
If you attack like that, you won't be able to remember what you remember, senior.

373
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,600
Ah, ah, ah!

374
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,520
It's a koi! It's a koi!

375
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,560
There are three koi! There's no mistake!

376
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,740
It's a koi! Prepare a koi!

377
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,740
Fire!

378
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,080
Fire!

379
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,780
Fire!

380
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,400
Fire!

381
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,700
Fire!

382
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,160
Fire!

383
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,680
Fire!

384
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,160
Fire!

385
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,680
Fire!

386
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,400
How is it?

387
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,060
Yes. It looks fine.

388
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,700
Fire!

389
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,200
Fire!

390
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,220
Fire!

391
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,020
Fire!

392
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,200
Fire!

393
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,300
Fire!

394
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,540
Fire!

395
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,440
It's hot!

396
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,580
Fire!

397
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,880
Fire!

398
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,220
Fire!

399
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,380
Fire!

400
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,220
Fire!

401
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,080
Alright, one more.

402
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,360
Easy win.

403
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,620
Hey, don't be so nervous.

404
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,800
You're too slow.

405
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,900
But, at that time, the Kanzakura behind was full.

406
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,520
Make the cherry blossoms full.

407
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,660
Yes!

408
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,440
And the old man tour was about 50 people.

409
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,480
50 old men extra.

410
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,660
Yes!

411
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,960
And the sunset sky was as much as I could see.

412
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,600
Idiot!

413
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,920
Don't say it when it gets dark.

414
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,500
Excuse me, sir.

415
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,280
Can you do the sunset?

416
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,800
I can't do it in this darkness.

417
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,980
Let's do something about it.

418
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,640
I don't know.

419
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:27,900
Oh!

420
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,520
This one!

421
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,620
This one is the sunset sky of that day.

422
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,600
Turn off the shutter!

423
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,340
Yes.

424
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,380
It's all over now.

425
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,120
Yeah.

426
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,080
You did a good job too.

427
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,040
Good work.

428
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,400
He didn't have to shave off anything.

429
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,580
Shut up!

430
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,400
Even though it's a doll,

431
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,620
it's a shame that you think there are two O'Hara chiefs.

432
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,560
Line 12, 21:34.

433
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,300
Tokyo station, Nozomi 304.

434
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,980
We managed to make it to the last bullet train.

435
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,660
We'll arrive at Tokyo station by 12:00.

436
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,660
When we get home, Genzo will be all relaxed.

437
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:26,780
It's the last train.

438
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,760
What's that?

439
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,680
I found another photo.

440
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,120
What?

441
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,300
I forgot to take the most important photo of the Buddha.

442
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,360
Wait!

443
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,720
Yes, I got it.

444
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,920
No good.

445
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,620
The film crew has just left for Alaska.

446
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,680
What about the helicopter?

447
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,760
The engine broke down and they're leaving in Nagoya.

448
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,680
We won't be able to fly for 2 to 3 hours.

449
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,660
Damn it.

450
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,300
We have no choice but to take it ourselves.

451
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,940
Senpai, did you find it?

452
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,880
I don't know how much you'll make me suffer.

453
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,380
No!

454
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,760
Senpai, where did you find it?

455
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,040
Open it!

456
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,880
Open it!

457
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,120
Show me the Buddha!

458
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,520
Open it!

459
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,680
Hey!

460
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,240
Hey!

461
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,020
Hey!

462
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,680
This Buddha looks like Senpai.

463
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,020
I want to see it!

464
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,860
This is not just a Buddha statue.

465
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,240
One thousand years ago, it was published as a Buddha statue.

466
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,340
It's one of the most valuable Buddha statues ever.

467
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,200
Open it!

468
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,480
Show me the Buddha statue!

469
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,860
Why do you need it in such a late time?

470
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Show me the Buddha statue!

471
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,220
This is the first time in thousands of years.

472
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Don't you dare say such a ridiculous thing!

473
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,020
I'll beat you up!

474
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:48,900
Open it!

475
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,380
O-O-O-O-O-O-O…

476
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,680
Open it!

477
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Damn it! I'll get you if you do this!

478
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Senpai, this is bad.

479
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,520
This is illegal.

480
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,800
That's not what I'm talking about!

481
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,080
Who's there?

482
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,380
Senpai!

483
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,220
Let's get out of here!

484
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,620
Get out of here!

485
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,480
Let's get out of here!

486
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,320
The security is very strict.

487
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,900
You're giving up?

488
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,000
No, but the next thing I see is the 1000 years later.

489
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,420
Did you come up with a good idea?

490
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,260
I see.

491
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,960
You have a plan, don't you?

492
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,380
Yes!

493
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,720
What is it?

494
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,060
Damn it! Why do I have to do this?

495
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,780
Amazing!

496
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,580
You're just like him!

497
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,020
Really?

498
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,440
It'd be nice to think of something else.

499
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,960
Well, the time is up.

500
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,760
Let's get rid of these.

501
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,400
First, turn around and stretch out your body.

502
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,380
The right arm goes behind your neck and towards your left cheek.

503
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,520
And your fingers go through your mouth.

504
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,060
It feels like this...

505
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,960
Take a closer look.

506
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,440
The thumb of your left inch shows you just youropsis.

507
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,720
Why is that?

508
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,940
The left arm is facing the nose of the nose from the inside of the leg that was once assembled.

509
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,640
The right eye is looking north, and the left eye is looking south.

510
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,800
Hurry up and take it!

511
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,860
I'll take it.

512
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,720
What the hell is this?

513
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,300
Last Door

514
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,920
Ryo-chan isn't coming back, is she?

515
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,740
It's true.

516
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,600
Huh?

517
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,940
Hey Ryo-tsu, are you here?

518
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,620
Well, that's...

519
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,400
What?

520
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,380
Did you set the wrong camera?

521
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,220
That's right.

522
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,220
Though I did put it in the wheel,

523
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,940
I totally forgot that I put it back in just before I went out to get it.

524
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,680
Is that so?

525
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:44,860
Ma'am!

526
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,700
I put it in!

527
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:47,900
I did it!

528
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,040
Chief, I've got a picture!

529
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,560
You're Ryo-chan.

530
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,320
Ryo-chan?

531
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,520
What's with the outfit?

532
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,420
Look! It's the Chief's picture!

533
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,660
A picture?

534
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,960
This is...

535
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,500
...two of me.

536
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,260
Why?

537
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,200
The pose and everything is exactly the same.

538
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,280
But the details are a bit different.

539
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,680
What do you mean?

540
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,520
You're up to something again, Ryo-chan.

541
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,300
No way, Chief!

542
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,760
You did it! The final picture!

543
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,200
Look forward to the next Aoshin-go!

544
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,420
Damn you!

545
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,940
Stop it!

546
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,680
Now, let's have a talk, Ryo-chan.

547
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,300
Chief, wait a minute!

548
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,160
There's something wrong with this!

549
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
I don't want to talk to you.

550
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,480
Aren't you just right in front of me?

551
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,020
You're the food critic!

552
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,060
You eroded many stores with your unruly presence.

553
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,200
You have a soundtrack for bad food!

554
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,500
I'll be your opponent next time!

555
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,340
