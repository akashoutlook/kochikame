1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,180
"Long Time No See"

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,500
When you watch TV, make the room bright and try to step aside.

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,240
If you're poor, come to me,

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm not here, but don't worry.

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,840
I'll take care of it.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,740
Look at the blue sky,

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,220
white clouds.

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,980
You'll find a way out eventually.

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:57,240
When you're jobless,

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,000
Come to me!

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not here, but don't worry

12
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:11,960
Look, the red cloud is burning

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,320
It'll be all right

14
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,580
You know, right?

15
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,460
You know, you know!

16
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,720
If you know, then shut up and follow me!

17
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:43,160
The Anger of the Fortress

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,260
What? A present for Chief Ohara?

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,220
This time, I'll receive the 35th award of the metal.

20
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,080
So, what do you think is the best gift?

21
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,440
Of course, the cash.

22
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,200
No gift that is worth the cash!

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,500
But, something that will stay in your memory...

24
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,520
I've been remembering all the money I've received since I was five years old.

25
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,760
That's about the same as mass production.

26
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,380
After all, something that remains in shape is better.

27
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,600
Is that so?

28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,620
Hey, what about a bronze statue?

29
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,500
A bronze statue?

30
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,080
No, no, no!

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,520
A middle-aged man's naked face is just disgusting!

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,120
It's not naked, Senpai!

33
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,260
It's a statue of the emperor!

34
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,400
Oh, I see.

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,300
It's not funny just imagining a pose of the emperor naked.

36
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,960
Where are you going to put such a thing?

37
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,580
Hey, let's make a bronze statue secretly now,

38
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,480
and give it as a present on the day of the awards ceremony.

39
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,580
That sounds great!

40
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,000
Wait!

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,180
You can't make it without your own help, right?

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,240
Oh, is that so?

43
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,620
I think you put a straw in your nose,

44
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,340
and then you harden it with a iron,

45
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,760
and then you raise your shoulders.

46
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,300
You have no choice but to do it secretly while you're asleep.

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,560
That's how you make a life mask, right?

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,420
It says that you can make it if you have a few photos.

49
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,860
Oh, really?

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,280
Well then, let's go order right away.

51
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,180
Right.

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,980
Wait, wait!

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,600
What?

54
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,120
If I were you,

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,100
I would be able to make a face of the mayor without looking at the photos.

56
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,320
I can make it cheap.

57
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:23,920
No!

58
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,200
It's not like you're making a plastic model.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,020
I've always done it like that,

60
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,360
and I've left it to my seniors.

61
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,480
Have you ever done it properly?

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
It's best to leave it to a professional!

63
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,980
Got it?

64
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,400
Damn it.

65
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,260
You're copying me on stereo.

66
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,820
I think this photo is good.

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,380
It looks good.

68
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,480
That's because you're the mayor.

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,480
This one looks more like you.

70
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,040
See?

71
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,380
This is a picture of the mayor's anger that you took before.

72
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,980
This is not good.

73
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,580
I think the mayor's face is the most angry.

74
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,220
That's because you're always angry.

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,620
You're usually very angry, Mayor.

76
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,480
I don't think this is good.

77
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,960
Then, I'll choose this photo.

78
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,260
It's decided.

79
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
Terai, you'd better choose this photo.

80
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,460
How persistent.

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,540
Okay.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,800
I'll accept your request.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,780
Eh?

84
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,880
Have you received the photo of that person?

85
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,160
Yes.

86
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,160
Is this okay?

87
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,280
Yes, it's fine.

88
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,940
Then, please enter it with this.

89
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,700
Yes.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,780
Enter?

91
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,860
In this workshop,

92
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,840
based on the photo,

93
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
we create a prototype with 3D computer graphics.

94
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,180
Eh?

95
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,860
It's quite high-tech.

96
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,660
It's already done?

97
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,520
It's amazing.

98
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,640
It's realistic.

99
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,400
Is it okay?

100
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,580
Like this.

101
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,580
Well,

102
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,600
I think you should tighten your mouth a little more.

103
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,460
Yes.

104
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,940
That's more like a policeman.

105
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,700
Like this.

106
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,300
Yes, yes.

107
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,220
It's like that.

108
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
The mayor's personality is well expressed.

109
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,100
There is kindness in the strictness.

110
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,400
Then, please enter it with this.

111
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,120
I understand.

112
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,820
It seems interesting.

113
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,100
Please try more things.

114
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:23,980
Yes.

115
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,720
Oh, Ryo-chan.

116
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,180
Senpai likes new things.

117
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,720
Then, it will be completed in about two weeks.

118
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,660
Understood.

119
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,800
Senpai, I'm going home.

120
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,320
Please go home first.

121
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,300
I'll be back after observing a little more.

122
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,000
Ryo-chan, don't get in the way.

123
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,620
I understand.

124
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,240
I have to go.

125
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,620
But everyone has the same expression when they are competing.

126
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,160
You are too serious.

127
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,420
It's not interesting at all.

128
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,180
It's usually a souvenir, so there is no choice.

129
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,080
Do you want to make something more unusual sometimes?

130
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,400
Well, there is no such thing.

131
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,580
Do you want to make this expression?

132
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,200
It's interesting.

133
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,600
I have never made such a competition of expression.

134
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,380
I know.

135
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,260
Even professionals think so.

136
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,460
I can do it, too.

137
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,320
I was saying that this picture is better.

138
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,520
Is that so?

139
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,420
Yes, let's make a sculpture with this picture.

140
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,000
But what is the order?

141
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,040
This one expresses the nature of the head of the club well.

142
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,520
This one is definitely better.

143
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,600
But...

144
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,500
I said it was interesting.

145
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,860
I said I wanted to make something like this.

146
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,060
That's...

147
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,040
You're an artist, aren't you?

148
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,820
Are you satisfied with making such boring things?

149
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,700
But this is work.

150
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,760
I'm going to make it as ordered.

151
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,130
Where did the pride of being an artist go?

152
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,820
Did the passion for that burning creative disappear?

153
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,640
I'll do it!

154
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,960
I've been making sculptures for 35 years.

155
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,440
I'll make a masterpiece that includes my life and marriage.

156
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,400
I have to come like that.

157
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm going to make a sculpture.

158
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,820
I'll do this here.

159
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,840
You're a professional.

160
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,880
That's right.

161
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,800
I'll change my clothes.

162
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,280
How about this?

163
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,540
You're good at it.

164
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,720
And the hat.

165
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,380
Great!

166
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,860
Are you done?

167
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,960
It's only been three days.

168
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,560
You rode on the glue.

169
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,020
You made it in a blink of an eye.

170
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,140
It's a great work.

171
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,780
Look.

172
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,700
This is President Ohara, isn't it?

173
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,300
What are you talking about, Ryo?

174
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,280
Nothing.

175
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,260
You are misunderstanding President Ohara.

176
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,940
I changed him into the right president.

177
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,780
As expected, at that time, I shouldn't have left a senior and left him alone.

178
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,460
This is not President Ohara.

179
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,220
I have a longer relationship.

180
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,340
This is the correct.

181
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,500
I told you before, it's because Ryo-chan is getting angry.

182
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,440
That's why it's the real leader's appearance.

183
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,660
Even if it's close to the real leader's appearance, I can't give you this as a present.

184
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,780
Did you forget? This is the 35th anniversary present of Chief Ohara.

185
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,920
I see.

186
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,440
I want you to look at yourself again in this opportunity.

187
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,520
There's no one who would be happy to get this!

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,620
I have no choice but to get it redone.

189
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,280
I can't show it to the chief.

190
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,160
Hey, what are you going to do with this?

191
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,260
Ryo-chan will take responsibility and dispose of it.

192
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,460
Certainly, I'm not happy if I get it myself.

193
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,980
I'll sell it somewhere.

194
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,620
I see. How about 10,000 yen?

195
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,820
What? Is that all?

196
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,780
Please color it a little more.

197
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
20,000 yen.

198
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,700
It can't be helped. I'll do it.

199
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,400
What's this hand?

200
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,980
So you'll take it with 20,000 yen, right?

201
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,900
What are you talking about? I'm the one who gets the money.

202
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,140
What do you mean?

203
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,880
This store is buying expensive goods.

204
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,860
There's no way this will sell.

205
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,100
20,000 yen is the amount of withdrawal.

206
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,420
If you don't like it, you can take it.

207
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,080
You'll take it home, right?

208
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,620
I got it. I won't ask you again.

209
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,020
I know it's a bit much, but there's no other place I can take it.

210
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,360
What's that?

211
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,380
It's a gift for Ryo.

212
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,440
What should I do with such a thing?

213
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,940
It's perfect for the interior of the cafeteria.

214
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,900
Please don't do that.

215
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,380
How about a bath? It'll make the hot water come out.

216
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,260
No, it's disgusting.

217
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,920
Then, let's decorate the entrance of the dorm

218
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,600
with a symbol statue.

219
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,620
No, no, no.

220
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,380
No one will come near.

221
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,240
I didn't think you'd hate me so much.

222
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,440
Here we go.

223
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,640
I can't help it.

224
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,860
I'll leave it in my room.

225
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,880
It's true that it's not good for you.

226
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,240
I'm hungry.

227
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,760
What?

228
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,160
What?

229
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,180
I'm hungry.

230
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,900
I'm hungry.

231
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,920
I'm hungry.

232
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,480
What is this?

233
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,660
What?

234
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,820
This is chief's statue.

235
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,920
I surprised it.

236
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,660
I put the statue there.

237
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,460
The Foreign Secretary has come to Ryo's place.

238
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,060
I was too nervous.

239
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,120
I was too nervous.

240
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:54,880
Really?

241
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,260
Are you after me?

242
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,840
Yes.

243
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,160
Huh?

244
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,500
I can't calm down because of the chief's surveillance.

245
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,960
I'll turn around.

246
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,120
That's good.

247
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm worried about him suddenly turning around.

248
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,540
I'll cover my eyes.

249
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,380
How about this?

250
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,740
Well then...

251
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,640
Don't look at me like that!

252
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,860
Now I'm relieved.

253
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,020
Where should I put it?

254
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,760
This part of the room is a blind spot.

255
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,360
I might get a bruise.

256
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,960
I don't want to get hurt.

257
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,740
Ryo-sama, you've made too much meat.

258
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,700
Let's eat together.

259
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,280
Oh, what are you doing?

260
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,720
Don't scare me.

261
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,140
Actually, the statue...

262
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,680
Statue?

263
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,540
That's what it was.

264
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,920
Then tonight I'll stay in your room.

265
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,320
I'll give it to you.

266
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,280
Why do you say that?

267
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,840
Because I don't want to be alone with the statue.

268
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,780
Oh, I see.

269
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,000
I want to be with you.

270
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,240
I want to be with you.

271
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,280
Tonight I'll protect you.

272
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
Wait a minute.

273
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,000
That's not good.

274
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,240
Why?

275
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,480
It's not good.

276
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,880
Because you're a man.

277
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,740
Ah!

278
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Well, it's better than being alone with the statue.

279
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,800
Ryo-sama!

280
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,160
This is the third time.

281
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,760
This time I slept next to you.

282
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,000
Shall we change the place?

283
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,680
Please.

284
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,300
Good night.

285
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,260
Yeah.

286
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,180
Now I can finally sleep.

287
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,940
Let's go back to the hotel!

288
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,840
The second night's so special!

289
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,460
The next day

290
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:54,180
There has been a terrible storm.

291
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,860
Delirious.

292
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,820
Ryo-sama, have a good day!

293
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,620
I'm completely out of sleep.

294
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,240
It's all thanks to this guy.

295
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,000
This is the last resort.

296
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,500
Don't get me wrong.

297
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Don't scare me.

298
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,640
Ryo-sama!

299
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,460
Ryo-sama!

300
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,060
How long are you going to sleep?

301
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,900
What are you so surprised about?

302
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,020
What? Is it real?

303
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,320
What are you talking about?

304
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,340
It's nothing.

305
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,000
You can't sleep while you're working.

306
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,660
No matter how many times a major incident happens, it's inevitable.

307
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,300
I understand.

308
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,980
This is terrible! It's a murder!

309
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,740
What did you say?

310
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,040
What did you say?

311
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,960
There are dead bodies in that garbage dump!

312
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,600
Really?

313
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,700
Ryo-san, head to the scene immediately. I'll contact the station.

314
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,280
Understood!

315
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,480
Hurry up!

316
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,680
There!

317
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,740
There's a huge corpse in the trash bag!

318
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:12,980
Look!

319
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,080
What's this place?

320
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,740
Isn't it amazing?

321
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,800
It's not amazing at all! That's a statue!

322
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:22,920
It's a statue!

323
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:23,840
What?

324
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Damn it, that cat's doing it!

325
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,960
Ryo-san, where's the corpse?

326
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,940
No, there's no corpse anywhere.

327
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,120
What?

328
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,660
It looks like a corpse.

329
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,800
No, no, it's a mistake.

330
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,560
It looks like he thought a mannequin was a corpse.

331
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,080
See?

332
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,120
Then show me that mannequin.

333
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,840
I have to write a report.

334
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,360
A report?

335
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,180
If it's a report, I'll write it myself.

336
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,580
But...

337
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,860
Leave it to me.

338
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,920
Come to think of it, isn't this a garbage dump?

339
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,100
I'll dispose of this properly.

340
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,140
What the hell did he do?

341
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,660
There!

342
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,600
Now I'm relieved.

343
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,220
I won't see him again.

344
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,520
Oh, welcome back.

345
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,860
Oh, grandma, I'm home.

346
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,240
Ryo-san, how are you?

347
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,440
Oh, well.

348
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,680
That statue is gone, so I can sleep...

349
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,380
Huh?

350
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,480
What's wrong, Ryo-san?

351
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,180
A, a statue is walking on its own!

352
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,100
A statue?

353
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,440
Oh, I brought it.

354
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,300
What?

355
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:55,060
It was closed today, and it was chasing a gang of robbers, and it went into the scrap yard.

356
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,220
I lost sight of it, but I found this.

357
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,040
This statue is exactly like Chief Ohara, isn't it?

358
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,260
I thought this would be a great gift for you, so I brought it home.

359
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,980
I see.

360
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,980
Why do you do such a useless thing?

361
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,460
I'll take it.

362
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,920
I'll take it.

363
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,200
I'll take it.

364
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,280
I'll take it.

365
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,340
I'll take it.

366
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,280
I'll take it.

367
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,700
I'll take it.

368
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,300
Don't ever come back!

369
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,620
I hope you're okay this time.

370
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,160
What's that?

371
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,960
What?

372
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,480
What?

373
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,580
Why is it here?

374
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,620
Yeah.

375
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,420
I left it here.

376
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,820
Sakonji, I think you went to the judo camp.

377
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,520
I just came back.

378
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,840
Actually, I was running along the beach this morning,

379
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,580
and this was shot up by the beach.

380
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,360
It was just like Chief Ohara's, so I thought I'd get hit and left it.

381
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,980
It's not funny at all!

382
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,780
What's going to happen to that statue?

383
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,980
Probably the air will come out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and fall into the sea.

384
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,660
As expected, it won't come back.

385
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,540
Now I can finally rest assured.

386
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,240
Ryotsu, are you there?

387
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,220
What's up, Volvo?

388
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:36,960
I'm sorry.

389
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,140
I was about to go to bed.

390
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,180
Don't say that.

391
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,440
I brought you some overseas souvenirs.

392
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,860
Oh, I see.

393
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,340
You said you were going to America on your vacation.

394
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,300
What are the souvenirs?

395
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,820
Alcohol or food?

396
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,680
This is a funny story.

397
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,920
It just came down from the sky just before I returned.

398
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,660
From the sky?

399
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Don't be surprised.

400
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,880
What?

401
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Did you make a statue of Ohara?

402
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,140
It is a sculpture of the Chief Ohara.

403
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,800
Are you still working on it?

404
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,420
The 35th anniversary of the metal ceremony is tomorrow, though.

405
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,980
It will be completed in the night and will be delivered directly to the venue tomorrow.

406
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,560
I heard that the first one that I made was a retake, so it took me a long time to get it.

407
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,300
What about the first statue?

408
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,840
Do not talk about that!

409
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,160
Don't get mad at me!

410
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,200
Could it be that you still have it?

411
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,840
Please don't let Chief Ohara notice it.

412
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,560
That's right. No matter how generous Chief Ohara is,

413
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,480
if he sees that statue, he'll get angry.

414
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,420
I know!

415
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
I want to do something about it as soon as possible.

416
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,540
Just bury it.

417
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,920
Bury it?

418
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,720
That's right.

419
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,200
In a place where no one can see it.

420
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,580
How about the Jukai?

421
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,240
The Jukai of Fuji.

422
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
You can't find it there for a rare cause.

423
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,720
This is it.

424
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,920
Let's bury it.

425
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,640
It would have been better if you buried it from the beginning.

426
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,140
There's a fear you'll find it if it's shallow, so bury it as deep as possible.

427
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,080
At this rate...

428
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,800
It's about time it was buried.

429
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,020
I was about to die.

430
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,160
I was buried in front of the statue,

431
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,180
so I don't know if it was suicide or murder.

432
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,680
Alright, if this is all I have,

433
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,500
I'm definitely safe.

434
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,820
Bye!

435
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,400
Hehe, this is the end.

436
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,700
Don't hesitate and get up!

437
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,200
This is the end!

438
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,860
One, two, three, four, five...

439
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,020
Chief Ohara's statue

440
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,160
has been successfully built.

441
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,520
Good. We were right on time.

442
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,820
Ryo will be greeting us, right?

443
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,660
Yeah, leave it to me.

444
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,380
You've been working hard.

445
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Yeah, I don't have to worry about anything anymore.

446
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,860
Wh-what is that?

447
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,880
A-a hot spring!

448
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,980
A hot spring is coming out!

449
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,760
From now on,

450
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,260
Chief Ohara Daijirou

451
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,640
will hold a 35-year

452
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,400
award ceremony!

453
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,900
Hurry up!

454
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,580
The ceremony is about to begin!

455
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,380
Yes, sir!

456
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,200
The ceremony is about to begin!

457
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,180
The ceremony is about to begin!

458
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,260
Chief Ohara Daijirou

459
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,760
has celebrated his authority

460
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,820
as the Head of the entire police force

461
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,060
of the Katsuchika Prefecture

462
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,440
for years on end.

463
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,640
Time's running out.

464
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,220
Next up,

465
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,360
there will be a total of

466
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,800
Nagaga!

467
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,460
Not yet?

468
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,540
That is...

469
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,380
Oh, here it comes!

470
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,240
Thank you for waiting!

471
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,220
Thank goodness!

472
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,680
We finally got together.

473
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,760
Then, senpai, I'm counting on you.

474
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,080
Leave it to me!

475
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,620
Thank you for waiting!

476
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,440
The presenter is a long-standing relationship with President Ohara.

477
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,120
Ryozu Kankichi, 13 years old!

478
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,820
Ah, ah...

479
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,140
President Ohara, 35 years old. Congratulations.

480
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,680
Ah, ah, thank you.

481
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,560
When I think about it,

482
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,860
the one who taught me, who was not sure of my right or left,

483
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,740
was President Ohara, who sometimes was kind and sometimes was strict.

484
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,640
Because of my youthfulness, I sometimes got arrogant and arrogant.

485
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,700
But deep in my heart, I was proud of my older brother and my parents.

486
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,500
Ryozu...

487
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,560
I was kind in my insensitivity,

488
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,620
and I had a sense of dignity.

489
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,740
The fact that I was kind and generous to him,

490
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,340
was indeed a mirror to a policeman.

491
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,740
He is my ideal.

492
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,300
So I decided to present the ideal policeman, President Ohara,

493
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,100
as a statue.

494
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,480
Please look.

495
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,400
This is the ideal of President Ohara.

496
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,240
Ah!

497
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,100
Ah!

498
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,460
Wha, what?

499
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,800
Why is this here?

500
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,960
I should have put it here.

501
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,500
I see.

502
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,380
That's your ideal.

503
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,760
Ryotsu.

504
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,260
I'm going to keep going in the ideal form.

505
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,300
I'm scared of the real thing.

Wow! Memory sight?

514
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:38,500
Why do I have to travel through a country to find memories of Reiko?

515
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,800
Wow, that's a lot of people!

516
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,560

00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,880
Alright, this is a trip to find the Kua-Kata!

Next time, "Reiko's Summer Memories"!
