2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:17,280
I look up at the sunset floating on the river.

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,820
When I kick the love stone, it flies to my shoes.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,600
I wonder if I should go to the place I was saving money for.

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,760
I was laughed at for being a good girl.

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,700
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I only get a penalty.

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,700
The cityscape, which doesn't change even a single yawn, is strangely kind.

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,800
I wonder if I should go to the place I was saving money for. I wonder if I should go to the place I was saving money.

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,380
From the waterfront of the Tungani-boshi,

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,940
to the Taishakuten,

11
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,120
the sunset falls.

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,920
Tomorrow it's already over, isn't it?

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,500
I lost my happiness again because of the Katsushika-shiba.

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,840
I realized

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,500
I'm such an idiot.

16
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,280
The following is a true story.

17
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:43,980
The high-tech equipment police officer Bergman who raised and educated the mayor for 1 billion yen.

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,560
Hey, you.

19
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,040
Explain it to me.

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,580
Yes.

21
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,620
German police education is excellent,

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,780
and his ability to pass the 4-year training in the top class.

23
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,920
German police education is excellent, and his ability to pass the 4-year training in the top class.

24
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,840
One of these people's clothes has a stolen wallet.

25
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,880
Now, Bergman! Arrest the criminal!

26
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,140
Let's do it!

27
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,440
Brrrr...

28
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,840
Hahahaha!

29
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,560
Oh, he shook his head.

30
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,420
That means he's not the culprit.

31
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,420
Go on!

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,440
Hahahaha!

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,560
He's acting different again.

34
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,620
When the culprit does this...

35
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,160
Hahahaha!

36
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,500
Hahahaha!

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:37,580
What?

38
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,140
He's using the dog's body to give me cancer!

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,600
Hahahaha!

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,380
Hahahaha!

41
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,200
Hahahaha!

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,680
Hahahaha!

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,580
Hahahaha!

44
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:48,600
Hahahaha!

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,620
Even though Bergman is hurt,

46
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,180
he's trained to stop the culprit!

47
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,660
He's trained to stop the culprit!

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,340
Oh!

49
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,820
Let's take a look at the arrest

50
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,540
with the surveillance camera!

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,760
Oh!

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,740
Oh, this is great!

53
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,940
It looks like they're actually following him.

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,240
It looks like they're actually following him.

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,700
The faces of the three

56
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,980
and the results of the search

57
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,980
The evidence of the crime is recorded every day, and is a very useful evidence for the trial.

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,480
You can also use a microphone to send messages, and you can also record the voice of the scene.

59
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,220
He's fast!

60
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,040
The speed of the criminal is like a car!

61
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,900
He can jump over 5 meters of wall!

62
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,420
Damn! What a persistent dog!

63
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,940
Hey, watch out!

64
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,060
Watch out!

65
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,500
Bergman is fearless!

66
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,780
Amazing!

67
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:56,400
He's good at swimming.

68
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,040
Stop running away! It's a game!

69
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,880
Here it comes!

70
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,240
Ouch!

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
There it is!

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,640
Bergman's ultimate move

73
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,860
Moon Salt!

74
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,520
Ouch, that hurts!

75
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,320
Let go of me!

76
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,860
Let go of me!

77
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,580
Let go of me!

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,060
Let go of me!

79
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,340
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

80
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,000
As you can see, we've caught the culprit from the three of them.

81
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700
It's impossible to escape from this Bergman.

82
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Well, he's really a great dog.

83
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,660
He's spent 1 billion yen on this, isn't he?

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,680
I'm honored that I was chosen to train this dog.

85
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,260
I'd like to choose a partner for the Bergman of that training institution.

86
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,700
Please choose one.

87
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,800
I have a lot of great people in my town.

88
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,860
All of the results of the Katsushika office,

89
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,180
such as personality, blood type, star fortune, and love,

90
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
are all included in the computer.

91
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,520
The computer will choose the best partner for Bergman.

92
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,060
I see. That's logical.

93
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,680
Then, let's go.

94
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,280
Who would be a good partner for a dog like this?

95
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,820
I've decided.

96
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,720
The partner for Bergman is this person.

97
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,880
Ryozu Kankichi, the general manager.

98
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,900
What?

99
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,980
What?

100
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,700
Why is Ryozu here?

101
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,980
Is this some kind of town?

102
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,160
Congratulations, Ryozu.

103
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,880
This is truly a great honor.

104
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,040
Well, well.

105
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,340
I hope you'll do your best.

106
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,740
The future of Japan is at stake in your founding.

107
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,500
Ah, ah.

108
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,300
I can't say anything with this.

109
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,240
Seriously.

110
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,520
Sigh.

111
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,800
The first dog of Japan and its partner,

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,480
the general manager of Ryozu.

113
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,440
Well then, I'll entrust Bergman to you for two weeks from today.

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,640
This is the Bergman's life schedule.

115
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,560
Huh? What is this?

116
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
He lives a more regular life than humans.

117
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,160
It seems like people will be disappointed to see this.

118
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,640
Listen to me, Ryozu.

119
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,920
You spent 1 billion yen on this, right?

120
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,160
This doesn't mean I won't come right back.

121
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,280
Okay, okay.

122
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,720
I understand.

123
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,020
It was just a dog and two dogs.

124
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,100
Hey, what's going on?

125
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,000
It's 4 P.M.

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,280
So it's time for Bergman to run.

127
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,660
Don't run away so early.

128
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,620
Ryozu can't get any better.

129
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,800
Really.

130
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,400
Hey, how long are you going to run?

131
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,480
-ハイリ

132
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,120
-ノ

133
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,080
-ハイリ

134
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:34,140
-キヨーナヤツ

135
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,920
Huh?

136
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:43,920
Good morning.

137
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,560
It's 2:00 a.m.

138
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,140
The court order for the day before yesterday...

139
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,500
I've been running all day!

140
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,880
You're so fast, Ryo!

141
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,400
Congratulations, Senpai.

142
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,720
I've been running since early in the morning.

143
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm so tired.

144
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,700
I can't even wake up.

145
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,560
I wash my face.

146
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,680
I brush my teeth.

147
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,880
What is this?

148
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,300
This is the monitor of Bergman's tracking camera.

149
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,700
It's a small version of the one you saw at the Katsushika library yesterday.

150
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,160
You can monitor videos within 2 km radius from Bergman's camera.

151
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,600
Reiko is filming.

152
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,940
That's amazing.

153
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,460
I'll play with this tracking camera for a while.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,140
I'm just looking at the monitor.

155
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,800
Listen to me.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,620
I'm so smart because I only studied in Germany and Japan.

157
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,340
I'm going to drink beer to the monitor.

158
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,640
I was thinking about you.

159
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,220
You can't be a freebie.

160
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,620
What?

161
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,040
Do you want to drink this beer?

162
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,900
Here.

163
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,960
Do you like beer?

164
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,120
All right.

165
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,140
Drink, drink.

166
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,440
What?

167
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,500
You want me to drink more?

168
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,900
Yes.

169
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,820
You often get stronger as a human being.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,320
Your mouth is different too.

171
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,940
Maybe this guy,

172
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,180
can have you drunk to death.

173
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,800
Alright, here.

174
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,480
Alright, drink up.

175
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,280
Nice.

176
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,020
Good.

177
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,240
Go!

178
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,980
*Au! Au! Au! Au!*

179
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,280
I did it!

180
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,600
*Hee hee hee hee!*

181
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,980
I'll save it for later!

182
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,460
*Au!*

183
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,440
*Au!*

184
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,440
There's a dog!

185
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,160
*Au!*

186
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,040
Oh no! I found it!

187
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,020
*Au!*

188
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,340
*Au!*

189
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,340
*Au!*

190
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,780
*Au!*

191
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,160
*Au!*

192
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,320
*Au!*

193
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,180
*Au!*

194
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,280
*Au!*

195
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,620
*Au!*

196
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:23,680
*Au!*

197
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:23,980
*Au!*

198
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,780
*Au!*

199
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:24,920
*Au!*

200
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,020
*Au!*

201
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,220
*Au!*

202
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,420
*Au!*

203
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,480
*Au!*

204
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,260
Don't make a fuss!

205
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,360
*Au!*

206
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,580
*Au!*

207
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,340
*Au!*

208
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,020
*Au!*

209
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,480
*Au!*

210
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,720
Berlgman! Come back! Berlgman!

211
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,140
Eh?

212
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,960
Oh my-

213
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,260
What's wrong!?

214
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,720
Ah! No, I'm just that!

215
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,580
This time, we'll let you wait!

216
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,460
*Au!*

217
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,320
*Uu*

218
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,340
*Uu!*

219
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:44,520
*Au!*

220
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,920
*Au!*

221
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,160
*Au!*

222
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,740
It's not true!

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,680
It's not true!

224
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,340
It's a mess!

225
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,360
Wait, seriously!?

226
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,460
Ah, eeeeh!

227
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,760
*Au!*

228
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:54,840
*Au!*

229
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,400
*Au!*

230
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,960
*Au!*

231
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,240
*Au!*

232
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,960
*Ohh!*

233
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
*Ohh!*

234
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,340
*Au!*

235
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,660
I think I drank too much.

236
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,420
This is totally for two days.

237
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,520
I'm in trouble.

238
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,120
Seriously, this is ridiculous.

239
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
You're the worst.

240
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,480
Huh?

241
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,060
Ryotsu.

242
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:11,460
Huh?

243
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,320
Ah, Chief! Good morning!

244
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,660
Ah, oh...

245
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,800
Huh? Is something wrong with Bergman?

246
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,060
It's ridiculous!

247
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,820
See, as you see, he's in a good mood.

248
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,200
Really?

249
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,980
Then let's get him to do the investigation.

250
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Huh? What's the investigation?

251
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,180
The investigation?

252
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,520
There was someone who tried to use a dog to look for a woman.

253
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,160
Ridiculous.

254
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,500
He's so mean.

255
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,780
He wouldn't allow someone to use a dog.

256
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,380
Y-Yes, that's right.

257
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,360
He's the worst, isn't he, Bergman?

258
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,980
He said he wouldn't allow someone like that.

259
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,440
That's right.

260
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,820
This is the stolen item that the culprit left behind.

261
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,240
What?

262
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
Ridiculous. Ridiculous.

263
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,220
The culprit told Bergman to use the smell that was left in the hole

264
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,040
to find the culprit.

265
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,420
He's going to make the culprit smell the smell of the culprit.

266
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,460
Oh, I see!

267
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,960
Now, Bergman, this is the culprit's smell.

268
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,040
Hey, hey, you don't understand that easily.

269
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,380
Well, it's a house worth a billion dollars.

270
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,440
Okay, now, go, Bergman.

271
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

272
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,520
Huh?

273
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,640
What's wrong?

274
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,520
Huh?

275
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,540
He's trying to make me laugh.

276
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,280
Now, Bergman, it's work. It's work.

277
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,420
What? What?

278
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,940
I see.

279
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,420
You've figured out the culprit's purpose.

280
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,980
Head, Ryotsu, the inspector.

281
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,020
We're going to investigate the culprit with Bergman.

282
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,080
Yeah, we're looking at the monitor right now.

283
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,900
Do it well.

284
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:35,880
Huh?

285
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,100
Ryotsu, don't get in the way of Bergman.

286
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,280
I... I'll do it.

287
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,340
Okay.

288
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,200
The last night's bath was a mess.

289
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,720
Bergman's been like this for two days.

290
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,840
How can we get him out?

291
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,360
Hey, Ryotsu!

292
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,320
What are you talking about?

293
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,700
Don't be serious!

294
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,200
He's not even talking much.

295
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,360
Huh?

296
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,980
Oh, no.

297
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,860
I think I saw him somewhere.

298
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,160
Who's this guy?

299
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,400
I found him!

300
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,020
This is the man!

301
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,300
The thief of the national order,

302
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,100
Kaido Heno 56!

303
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,080
What?

304
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,840
Really?

305
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,100
Ryotsu!

306
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,540
That man is the Kaido Heno 56 of the national order!

307
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,220
That's right!

308
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,720
Wait!

309
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,480
I forgot about Bergman.

310
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,960
Hey, wake up!

311
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,400
He's in my way.

312
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,140
Look!

313
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,000
Ryo is making a fuss.

314
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
He's much faster than yesterday.

315
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,400
And he's not looking.

316
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Hey, Ryotsu!

317
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
What happened to Bergman?

318
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,760
Did something happen?

319
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,180
No, nothing.

320
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,020
I'm fine.

321
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,380
That bastard!

322
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,700
Hey, jump, Bergman!

323
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,420
I can't do it.

324
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,300
Where am I?

325
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,460
What's that?

326
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,180
Hey, are you all right?

327
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,940
Yeah.

328
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,460
Hang in there, Bergman!

329
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,260
You're heavy as a sewing doll.

330
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,520
He's moving so much.

331
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,600
Yeah.

332
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,400
It's weird.

333
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
That damn staircase!

334
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,460
Yes!

335
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,780
All right.

336
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,640
Here I go!

337
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,500
Oh!

338
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,380
It's heavy!

339
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,760
Get out of the way!

340
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,800
He's running away!

341
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:16,920
Run!

342
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,840
You're under attack!

343
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,680
Here comes Bergman!

344
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,760
That was a great jump!

345
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,940
Alright! I did it!

346
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,260
You finally woke up!

347
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,500
Alright, Bergman! Arrest the culprit!

348
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,160
Arrest the culprit!

349
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,180
Hey! Don't get so agitated! Calm down!

350
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,140
Hey! You're being seduced by a female dog!

351
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,660
Get back here!

352
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,100
What's wrong, Ryosu? Is something wrong?

353
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,820
N-No, it's nothing.

354
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,940
Run away!

355
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,660
Wait, you bastard!

356
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,640
Damn it!

357
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,480
I have no choice but to do this in place of Bergman!

358
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,680
This is so hard!

359
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,240
What's wrong? You're too slow, Bergman!

360
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,460
Speed up!

361
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,460
Stop!

362
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:38,640
Let's do it again!

363
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,500
They're going down the stairs!

364
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,500
What's wrong, Bergman?

365
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,440
Hey! Are you okay?

366
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,900
I'm fine.

367
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
It's not you. It's Bergman.

368
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,820
He seems to be fine.

369
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,480
What happened to number 56?

370
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,180
Ow!

371
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,240
Ouch!

372
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,320
Wait, you bastard!

373
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,320
Bergman, cross this pipe!

374
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,040
What? A pipe?

375
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,080
Hurry up! The culprit is running away!

376
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,620
Yes, yes, I understand.

377
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,860
Go, Bergman!

378
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:25,620
What's wrong? What are you mumbling about?

379
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,040
Ouch!

380
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,620
Hurry up, Zenka! Hurry up!

381
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,740
Ouch!

382
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,560
He fell!

383
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,540
It's okay.

384
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,620
Bergman is good at swimming.

385
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,640
Ouch!

386
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,420
I hit my head on the river.

387
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,760
No! I'm being washed away by the river!

388
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Bergman!

389
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,100
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

390
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,720
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

391
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,240
Ryoji! Is Bergman okay?

392
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,740
He's fine!

393
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,640
I told you he's not you!

394
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,900
He's fine!

395
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,280
Where's the culprit?

396
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,640
I see.

397
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,880
Ouch!

398
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,660
Ouch!

399
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,260
You bastard!

400
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,980
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

401
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,500
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

402
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:55,900
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

403
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,480
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

404
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,040
I've been

405
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,080
Oh, no!

406
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,980
I did it! I got the bird!

407
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,360
Good. Well done, Bergman!

408
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,040
Thank you, sir!

409
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,300
You're not the one who's great!

410
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,200
Well done, Bergman!

411
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,080
Good, good, good.

412
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,360
Huh?

413
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:27,980
Huh?

414
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,900
Huh? This dog...

415
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,580
Could it be...

416
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,600
Oh, I knew it!

417
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,240
Chief, this dog is Bergman!

418
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,200
What?

419
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,540
Then who just took the No. 56?

420
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,020
Chief, it's Ryo-chan!

421
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:43,980
What?

422
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Ryo-chan is following the camera.

423
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,460
This is No. 56, the most famous dog in Japan.

424
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,520
Please take him to the Katushika Shrine.

425
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Yes, sir!

426
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,160
Thank you!

427
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,100
Chief, this is Ryo-chan.

428
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,760
I just brought No. 56 to the pato car.

429
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,660
I see.

430
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,680
Well done.

431
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,680
By the way, Ryo-chan, I can't see your face.

432
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,760
No, no.

433
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm here, chief.

434
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,280
Oh, where's Bergman?

435
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:16,820
Huh?

436
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:17,840
Oh, no.

437
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,900
He's trying to trick me.

438
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,000
Ryo-chan, you're gonna get caught.

439
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,280
Wait!

440
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,040
He's gonna have a good time.

441
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,840
That's why I'm gonna make him do it.

442
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,400
Huh?

443
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,400
All right, Ryo-chan.

444
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,700
You will continue patrolling the city with Bergman.

445
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,320
Yes, sir!

446
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
The women aren't aware of this yet.

447
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,860
Oh, no.

448
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,760
This is not a dog fight.

449
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,220
This is Ryo-chan's view.

450
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,500
What is this?

451
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,080
No, it's an edgy movie.

452
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,420
He's watching silently.

453
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,580
What a mean guy.

454
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,640
Oh, he's moving.

455
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,140
Yeah.

456
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,280
This is the time table of the movie.

457
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,780
What?

458
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,300
Oh, he's writing down the time for the movie.

459
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,980
What a guy.

460
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,820
Huh?

461
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,080
Ryo-san, what are you doing?

462
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,020
What are you doing in that outfit?

463
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,260
A fire!

464
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,340
Seriously.

465
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,020
Huh?

466
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,960
Where is it?

467
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,900
The switch!

468
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,300
What is this?

469
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,620
This is terrible.

470
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,240
The minister left his precious safe in there.

471
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,760
What should I do if it burns?

472
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,540
Huh?

473
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,700
Ryo-chan.

474
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,720
Bergman, I'm sure the fire will die out.

475
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,480
Call the guard to get the safe.

476
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,040
Eh?

477
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,480
Chief, that's so pitiful.

478
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,700
Don't say that yourself.

479
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,760
Chan, chan, chan, chan.

480
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,180
Bergman said no.

481
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,560
Go, or what.

482
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,340
Is Bergman a fake?

483
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,940
No, not at all.

484
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,800
I'll let you go now.

485
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,220
Damn it, you're such a bad boy.

486
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,260
Are you all right?

487
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,280
Are you not afraid?

488
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,560
Go.

489
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,460
He really got in.

490
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,060
Senior.

491
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,400
Ryotsu.

492
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,080
This is a very heavy and hot safe.

493
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,640
Do your best, Bergman.

494
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,080
He's a good one to play alone.

495
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,240
Bergman.

496
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,600
Hey, Bergman.

497
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,540
Did you come back here?

498
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,840
I was worried about you.

499
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,360
You suddenly disappeared from the inn.

500
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,120
All right, all right.

501
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,780
Oh, you were so worried.

502
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,360
Yeah, of course.

503
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,680
Bergman and I are one body.

504
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,420
I see.

505
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,760
So, Froyo.

506
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,140
Did you go with him?

507
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,580
No, I didn't.

508
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,120
I didn't go to the bathhouse.

509
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,600
What are you talking about, chief?

510
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,340
Takagawa.

511
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,300
Play this tape.

512
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,860
All right.

513
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,320
Oh, that's...

514
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,020
Wait a minute.

515
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,740
That's because Bergman sweated.

516
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,420
I feel like I went to the bathhouse.

517
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,700
What?

518
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,000
A dog!

519
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,780
I found it!

520
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,720
Senior.

521
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,260
You made Bergman drink beer, didn't you?

522
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,740
It's the same as Ryo-chan.

523
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,960
Well, well, well.

524
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,080
I don't like it.

525
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,280
It's a real trouble that it looks like my voice.

526
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,040
I'm scary!

527
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,100
I'm scared!

528
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,680
I'm a pervert.

529
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,220
I'm scary!

530
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,140
I'm scared!

531
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,960
I'm a pervert.

532
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm a pervert.

533
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,520
I have to admit that there are similar voices and forms.

534
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,240
I have to admit that there are similar voices and forms.

535
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,180
You idiot!

536
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,540
No matter where you look, this is Ryosu!

537
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,580
You're the one!

538
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,420
Rumors say that I'm a woman who can't fall in love

539
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:19,460
But there are so many things I want to do

540
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,620
I am me

541
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,020
I want to run in the wild desert on my bike

542
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,720
I want to be free more than a bird

543
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,120
I want to be free more than a bird

544
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,400
I want to be free more than a bird

545
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,340
I want to be free more than a bird

546
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:51,580
I want to be free more than a bird

547
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:57,540
I want to be free more than a bird

548
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,020
I wish I had wings

549
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,000
I want to be free more than a bird

550
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,340
I want to be free more than a bird

551
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,320
I want to be free more than a bird

552
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,720
I want to be free more than that

553
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,580
I don't regret it

554
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,540
I'll stop being like that

555
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,680
I'll remain as female

556
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,400
Love is beautiful

557
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,540
The first battle

558
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,260
The third battle

559
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,180
The sixth battle

560
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,200
The eighth battle

561
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,220
The eleventh battle
