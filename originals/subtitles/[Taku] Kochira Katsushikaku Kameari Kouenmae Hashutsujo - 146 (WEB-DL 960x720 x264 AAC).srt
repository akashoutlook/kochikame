1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,380
"The End of the Rain"

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,620
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,720
Make sure to lighten up your room

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,560
And try to keep your distance

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:25,240
It's like someone's calling

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,100
After the rain has stopped

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,100
You look back and walk

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,180
I'll hold your hand

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,640
I felt it at that time

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,540
A strange feeling

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,640
So I tried to walk

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,180
On the black tile outside the arcade

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,260
Everyone was a child once

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,400
But

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,460
Everyone has forgotten

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,300
A politician with a great face

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,800
And a blue aunt above their eyes

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,500
Turn around and look

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,260
At that corner

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,840
You'll see everyone

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,560
There's a turtle there

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,380
There must be a turtle

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:27,880
There's something green

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,560
Everyone come to our town

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,620
Thank you!

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,380
Bonus Battle

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,920
Bonus Battle 4

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,240
Bonus Battle 4

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,460
Bonus Battle 4

30
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,780
Bonus Battle 4

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,560
Bonus Battle Four

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,800
Every one here is with us

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,180
No, the fish shop is still...

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,200
Sorry for being late.

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,160
Did your wife run away again?

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,000
That girl...

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,380
If she fails to pay the debt this year,

38
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,520
she'll be in trouble!

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,760
She left her kid behind!

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,880
This is bad.

41
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,680
Let's do something about it this year.

42
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,880
Now, the 27th episode.

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,040
The

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,780
What are you listening to, senpai?

45
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,900
It's just a joke.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,380
If Chief Ohara finds out, he'll scold us.

47
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,340
Shh!

48
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,360
The people in the shopping district are talking about my bonus.

49
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,780
I was so sorry last year.

50
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,660
No way, senpai.

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,020
Are you crazy?

52
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,720
Don't say anything bad about it.

53
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,380
When I went to the plum shop to get the defective product,

54
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,120
I found a plastic bottle I made in the middle of the play.

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,520
It contained a small-sized plastic bottle.

56
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,560
This is called "unfeasibility".

57
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,220
You must have done it on purpose.

58
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,220
That's right.

59
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,260
I think it's Ryo-chan's fault for not paying the debt.

60
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,440
Why don't you just give it back to him?

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,860
I didn't say I wouldn't give it back to anyone.

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,580
But I've already decided what to buy with this year's bonus.

63
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,440
The world's first double-speed robot robot.

64
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,380
Robotta-kun.

65
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,340
Oh, it's the one that's been a hot topic on TV.

66
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,280
It's a limited edition, so the competition rate was extremely high.

67
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,300
But I managed to get a purchase ticket.

68
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,480
All I have to do is deposit the money.

69
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,900
By the way, Sakonji has applied for a super limited edition Saori version.

70
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,300
He deposited the money with his salary the other day, so it should arrive soon.

71
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,800
What are you going to do with that?

72
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,820
It's bound to be a luggage soon.

73
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,220
Shut up!

74
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,860
The robot will come into the house without waiting for 21 years.

75
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,720
Don't you think it's great?

76
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,220
It doesn't have to be Ryo-chan's house.

77
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,020
You don't know what a man's romance is.

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,240
Debt is more important than romance.

79
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,260
So, what's the plan this time?

80
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,340
It's an important part.

81
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,900
Before that, I have something to tell everyone.

82
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,400
What's wrong with you? You look so serious.

83
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,260
Did something happen?

84
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,820
At the end of this bonus battle, I'm retiring.

85
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,200
What?

86
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,340
What?

87
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,720
What's wrong, senpai?

88
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,100
What do you mean by retiring, Mr. Plum?

89
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,280
Retiring?

90
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,340
I'm thinking of moving to the countryside by building this shop.

91
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,720
Are you serious?

92
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm not old enough to retire yet.

93
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,100
Why?

94
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,840
Actually, my shop has been in red since recently.

95
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,520
What?

96
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,960
Recently, I've been pushed by the game, so I can't sell my Promo.

97
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,900
Oh, today?

98
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,040
Originally, I started this shop because I love Promo.

99
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,800
I didn't feel like buying a business.

100
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,880
So I thought it would be better.

101
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,580
Hey, you're giving up too soon.

102
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,420
Where's your usual patience?

103
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,460
That's right.

104
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,760
Who can compete with Ryo-san except for Mr. Plum?

105
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,660
It's the same for every shop.

106
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,260
Let's work hard.

107
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,160
I've been trying to make my wife run away many times, but I'm still working hard.

108
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,920
It's decided.

109
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,000
Mr. Plum.

110
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,360
That's all I have to say.

111
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,560
Let's resume the strategy meeting.

112
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,020
He's going to disappear.

113
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,120
What?

114
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,520
Don't you think it's better to let Ryo know about this?

115
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,960
Y-Yes.

116
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,940
Ryo-san is not a demon.

117
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,640
If he hears that Mr. Plum is retiring, he might give you a flower.

118
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
I see.

119
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,420
Stop it.

120
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,840
But...

121
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,180
At the end, I want to compete with Ryo.

122
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,800
No hands.

123
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,200
I'm retiring.

124
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,480
I'm just talking about this.

125
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,240
I don't want to be disrespected by Ryo-san.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,720
Mr. Plum.

127
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,220
You are a man.

128
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,340
I didn't know Mr. Plum would retire.

129
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:31,880
Senior.

130
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,020
I have to give you a flower this time.

131
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,680
Don't be silly.

132
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,660
He said he doesn't want to be disrespected.

133
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,260
Mr. Plum, this is the last time.

134
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
You can buy the robot anytime.

135
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
It's a limited sale.

136
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,440
I don't know if I can buy it.

137
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,280
Senior.

138
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
It's my bonus.

139
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
I'll buy it no matter what.

140
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,880
Oh.

141
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:05,080
Ryo-san, I got the bonus.

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,340
Who gave it to you?

143
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,540
Who gave it to you?

144
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,820
I'll get the bonus this year.

145
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm tired of hearing that.

146
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,760
This year.

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,740
This year.

148
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,920
This year.

149
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,160
This year.

150
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,040
...

151
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,620
...

152
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:41,920
Here it comes!

153
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:42,740
Here it comes!

154
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,080
Here it comes!

155
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:45,920
Here it comes!

156
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,080
Oh!

157
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,920
You got it!

158
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,900
The Toshin Dai 2nd Hoku Robot!

159
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,060
Yeah, it seems it's being shipped in the order of the number of tickets.

160
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,660
Ryotsu, you should hurry up and get it ready.

161
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,160
I know.

162
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,560
Hurry up and do something!

163
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,480
You'll be surprised.

164
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,520
Saori!

165
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,600
Saori?

166
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,000
What is it, Tatsuo?

167
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,900
Ah! Saori!

168
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,380
You just replied.

169
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,480
I didn't reply.

170
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,580
This was a dream of the Doki-Memo fans.

171
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,000
I should have been called by my real name, Saori.

172
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,000
You're a robot.

173
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,460
No! I'm the real Saori!

174
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,900
You're totally wrong.

175
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,840
Hey, I don't think you're just a robot that replies.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,120
No, I'm not.

177
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,280
Watch me.

178
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,040
Hey, Saori.

179
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,900
Tea.

180
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,680
I understand, Tatsuo.

181
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:34,900
Huh?

182
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,980
Here you go.

183
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,780
Thank you, Saori!

184
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,600
Oh, your moves are surprisingly smooth.

185
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,580
Hey, let me try something else.

186
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,600
Then, Saori, one more cup of tea.

187
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,040
I understand, Tatsuo.

188
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,640
Here you go.

189
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,700
Thank you, Saori!

190
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,340
It's the same as before.

191
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,280
Let me try something else.

192
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,580
Then, Saori, two more cups of tea.

193
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,360
Okay, I got it.

194
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,260
Here you go, Tatsuo.

195
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,300
Wow!

196
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,000
Wow!

197
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,600
Thank you, Saori!

198
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,860
Hey, I can't believe it's only this.

199
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:13,980
Hey, I can't believe it's only this.

200
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,580
Hey, I can't believe it's only this.

201
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,420
No, I just got it today.

202
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,400
There are still a lot of things I have to do.

203
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,380
Saori, clean up the room!

204
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,160
Hey, Saori, clean up the room!

205
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,360
What? I don't understand.

206
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,540
Saori, I don't understand.

207
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,380
Then, Saori, rub your shoulders.

208
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,560
What? I don't understand.

209
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:31,920
I don't understand.

210
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,780
Hmm?...

211
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,040
Saori, wash your face!

212
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,480
Saori, rub your fals aqui!

213
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,600
Saori, brush your teeth!

214
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,300
Eh? I don't understand, Saori.

215
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,620
Eh? I don't understand.

216
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,960
Eh? I don't understand, Saori.

217
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,820
This isn't like you can't do anything!

218
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,000
You talk a lot...

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,680
Oh yeah, please stop!

220
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,280
I'm going crazy.

221
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,120
This isn't like only tea dolls.

222
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,080
They've always existed...

223
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Like you know anything.

224
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,160
Look at this one.

225
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,720
It's the same manual.

226
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,540
Look at it.

227
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,740
It's just a matter of programming one of the actions.

228
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,700
What do you mean? Do I have to read it like that?

229
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,900
Then shall we cancel it?

230
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,080
Cancel?

231
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,360
If we cancel it, we'll have a bonus.

232
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,940
No, no, what are you going to do with your kindness here, Ryo Tsukakichi?

233
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,000
W-What's wrong?

234
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,380
I'm not going to cancel it!

235
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,320
I'm going to buy it for sure!

236
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,580
I-I understand!

237
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,040
The next day

238
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,260
Ryo-san, are you there? We have a visitor.

239
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,500
Y-Yeah.

240
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,640
Huh? You guys!

241
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,080
Actually, I've been stopped by Plamorya-san.

242
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,660
I thought I'd put you in Ryo-san's ear.

243
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,880
Actually, after the bonus delivery battle this time...

244
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,740
What's going on?

245
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,840
I'm busy! I don't have time to be your opponent!

246
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,140
Hey, Ryo-san, listen to me!

247
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,480
What's wrong?

248
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,800
Hey, Plamorya-san is...

249
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,060
I said I'm busy! Go home!

250
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,860
I can't help it. I think we should withdraw for today.

251
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,320
That's right.

252
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,280
Sorry about that.

253
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,540
You're non-covert, so today we're taking care of business!

254
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,040
I'm busy tomorrow, so I'll leave it to you the day after tomorrow.

255
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,080
Got it.

256
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,280
Then look, I'll make sure you're on time tomorrow, okay?

257
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,500
I'm on it.

258
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:50,640
Excuse me.

259
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,960
Good job today.

260
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,580
Ehh...

261
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,000
Err...

262
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,440
Well...

263
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,600
Let's see...

264
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,300
Ryo-san!

265
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,640
Ryo-san!

266
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:06,940
There was no one who could understand what I was talking about.

267
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,740
What's wrong? The shelves are all messed up.

268
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,220
Well, I was just about to sort them out.

269
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,680
I see.

270
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,520
Ah. I found it.

271
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,840
This is it.

272
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,520
What is this?

273
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
This is the one you wanted.

274
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,160
Isn't this a figure for promotion?

275
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,740
I'm a mania, so I would give you 100,000 yen for it.

276
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,680
I'm a mania. I told you I would never let you go. Why?

277
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,700
Even if you leave it, it will become your luggage.

278
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,460
You should give it to the person you want, right?

279
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,400
You won't get any money. Don't worry.

280
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,880
It's a plum.

281
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,780
However, you will have to pay the bonus for the past time.

282
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,760
I know.

283
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,120
Don't worry.

284
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,340
We will give it to this mania.

285
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,900
That's nice.

286
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,180
Isn't it a plum?

287
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,140
But it's the Mania.

288
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,120
What is the Mania?

289
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,080
I just told you, it's a good idea to leave it here.

290
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,340
You are mistaken.

291
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,600
If you bring along many plums here,

292
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,700
This is Nico Nico Ryo.

293
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,800
I'm ready to deploy.

294
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,860
I'm ready to deploy.

295
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,120
It's finally time, Mr. Plamo.

296
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,100
When this match is over...

297
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,320
Grandma.

298
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,160
Please let me concentrate on this match today.

299
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,580
Please.

300
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,260
Mr. Plamo, you're a man.

301
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,780
We'll send you to the camp.

302
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,360
According to the information from the reliable source, Mr. Ryo's bonus payment date has been revealed today.

303
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,280
Since last year, Mr. Ryo's bonus has been transferred to the bank.

304
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,540
But, based on his personality, he will withdraw from the full-time course immediately.

305
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,500
Don't let that happen. Take all this.

306
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,000
This year, we will win this bonus battle no matter what.

307
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,200
I pray for your consideration.

308
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,600
That's all.

309
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,340
I'll catch Mr. Ryo no matter what it takes.

310
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,760
This is the plan.

311
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,080
This is the last year for Mr. Plamo.

312
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,640
This year alone is for the sake of Plamo.

313
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,560
Excuse me.

314
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,640
Show me your face.

315
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,860
What is it?

316
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,400
It's a different person.

317
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,360
I see.

318
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,220
Wait a minute!

319
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,940
Show me what's in your bag.

320
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:50,880
This?

321
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,740
W-What's this?

322
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,880
It was on TV.

323
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,600
It's a two-speed walking robot.

324
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,280
This is it?

325
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,340
Okay.

326
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,260
I'll take it.

327
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay.

328
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,760
They're so stupid.

329
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,360
They don't even realize I'm here.

330
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,840
See you.

331
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:16,980
Ryo.

332
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,040
You didn't do anything strange to Saori, did you?

333
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,260
I don't think so.

334
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,020
I'm sorry.

335
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,800
If you're going to do such a thing, go to the bank right away.

336
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,000
Saori.

337
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,760
Take it.

338
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,880
This is my report!

339
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,380
Saori is coming.

340
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,740
Saori is coming.

341
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,040
Yes, sir.

342
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,680
I thought you would come to the bank only after 1 am because of Mr. Ryo.

343
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,440
I thought you would come to the bank only after 1 am because of Mr. Ryo.

344
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,400
I thought you would come to the bank only after 1 am because of Mr. Ryo.

345
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,320
Nico Nico, are you still here?

346
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,760
I'm still here.

347
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,980
Did someone come out?

348
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,520
A big man was helping me last year.

349
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,140
Maybe he was in the action market.

350
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,140
He was helping me last year.

351
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,600
Sakonji?

352
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,020
Yeah.

353
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,660
Soso, do you have any luggage?

354
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,040
Oh, I checked the contents, but it was a robot from Toshin Dai.

355
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,340
A robot from Toshin Dai?

356
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,200
Get into Niconico right away!

357
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,440
Get into Ryo's room!

358
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,420
I'll be right there.

359
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,380
What's wrong?

360
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,260
Ryo may have escaped.

361
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,100
How is it?

362
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,840
It seems like he's here, but...

363
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,300
What?

364
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,180
Shut up! I'm sleepy!

365
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,640
See? That's ridiculous.

366
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,700
Shut up! I'm sleepy!

367
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,860
Ryo! Ryo! Ryo!

368
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,420
Hey, Mr. Pramoya!

369
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,340
Shut up! I'm sleepy!

370
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,560
Even if you fool other people, I won't be fooled!

371
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,420
P-Pramoya!

372
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,960
Shut up! I'm sleepy!

373
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,000
Shut up! I'm sleepy!

374
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,400
I knew it.

375
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,840
Shut up! I'm sleepy!

376
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,900
I'll contact the people in front of the bank immediately.

377
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,640
Ryo is coming!

378
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,260
Ryo is coming!

379
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,640
Ryo is coming!

380
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,500
Oh, what?

381
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,820
Don't let him escape!

382
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,660
This is the last fight!

383
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,940
I'll catch him!

384
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,740
I'll catch him!

385
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,100
What are you doing?

386
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,200
Kaori!

387
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,340
Now, get involved, Ryo!

388
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:30,700
Now, get involved, Ryo!

389
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,140
He's not here!

390
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:33,960
What?

391
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,860
I-I can't believe it!

392
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,640
I see.

393
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,000
He's not that far away yet.

394
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,680
Go find him.

395
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,540
It seems Ryo has escaped.

396
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,440
Let's go, too.

397
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,880
Let's go, too.

398
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,880
Ryo!

399
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay!

400
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,980
You changed the bank account!

401
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,460
Did you withdraw all the money?

402
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,860
Yes!

403
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,840
I have it in my pocket!

404
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,860
Huh?

405
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,240
P-Pramoya!

406
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,200
What are you doing here?

407
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,120
I found this in Ryo's room.

408
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,600
That's how I found it.

409
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,020
Damn it! I'll catch you!

410
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,540
You fool!

411
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,100
You think you can escape?

412
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,160
It's Snow Mobile!

413
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,160
I've prepared something like this.

414
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,360
Get ready!

415
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,640
Damn it!

416
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,960
You can't use your usual power with this snow.

417
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,100
You're going to regret it!

418
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,260
Damn it!

419
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,080
Get him!

420
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,360
Wait!

421
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,020
Why are you coming here?

422
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,540
Don't tell me!

423
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:21,900
Don't tell me!

424
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,840
My bonus!

425
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,640
Pramoya!

426
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,840
Hey, are you okay?

427
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,520
Oh, it's Ryo.

428
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,080
He's broken his leg.

429
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,200
I can't keep chasing him.

430
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,040
Pramoya!

431
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,280
I can't beat Ryo.

432
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,420
I'm sorry.

433
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,880
Pramoya, you...

434
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,240
But I don't regret it.

435
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,600
I can fight with such a powerful opponent.

436
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,860
It's the pride of my life.

437
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,680
Thank you, Ryo.

438
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,000
Pramoya!

439
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,500
Ouch!

440
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,320
What's wrong, Ryo?

441
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,520
He's broken his whole body in shock.

442
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:12,860
I have to find him now.

443
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,200
Or, maybe I can just take him to the hospital.

444
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,880
But Ryo.

445
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,900
Damn it!

446
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,080
There should be my bonus over there, if I looked.

447
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,640
Too bad!

448
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,460
I have to back to the hospital.

449
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,300
I should have told you.

450
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,500
I feel sorry!

451
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:28,980
If you need a doctor,

452
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,360
you should go to the field.

453
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,320
There's no doctor in our village.

454
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,940
It's tapi...

455
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,840
Sorry, Saori.

456
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,560
Saori...

457
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,720
I can't believe you're in my eyes...

458
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,920
Come back to me, Saori!

459
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,560
I got it, Da-chan.

460
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,320
Sa-Saori!

461
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,080
Huh? Hey!

462
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,780
Where are you going?

463
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,720
Saori!

464
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,520
Whoa! That's...

465
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,440
We did it! We caught Ryo-san!

466
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,220
It's Flamaya-san's year-end victory!

467
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,900
You're a man after all!

468
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm going to make money!

469
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,500
You!

470
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,220
You're lying about moving to the countryside!

471
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,340
I didn't say anything like that to Ryo-san.

472
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,900
Huh? But the store...

473
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,960
We were just preparing for the remodeling.

474
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,080
These days, games are more popular than plastic models.

475
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,860
Why did you think I was retiring?

476
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,300
Did you steal it?

477
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,600
Huh?

478
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,440
Well, you noticed that I was being stolen and acted.

479
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,980
I'm sorry.

480
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,600
Don't worry about it!

481
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,900
The others will come too!

482
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,680
No, they won't know.

483
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,580
The allies are the first to attack the enemies.

484
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
Then, about the retirement...

485
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,280
It's all a lie...

486
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,480
Oh, I know!

487
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,320
The old man's father and grandfather were doing a shop there.

488
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,280
That's a real edukkko!

489
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,000
Huh?

490
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,580
Then there's no way he's in the countryside!

491
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,780
You tricked me!

492
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,200
Shut up!

493
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,280
It's worse if you get tricked!

494
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,320
Now, you'll get a bonus this year!

495
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:07,960
Now, you'll get a bonus this year!

496
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,900
Now, you'll get a bonus this year!

497
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,680
Oh my!

498
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,600
You think you can get away with that?

499
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,480
I won't!

500
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,300
Just because I never hurt a guy can't mean I won't do anything.

501
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,860
Don't you ever say something like that again!

502
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,340
You think this game is bored and obnoxious?

503
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,520
You said that Basudan was a whole human being!

504
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,200
Who said that Basudan was a whole human being?

505
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,580
You're late!

506
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,440
You're late!

507
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,640
You're late!

508
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,600
The next day

509
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,080
Where did it go?

510
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,000
Saori!

511
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,300
Here you go, Dacchan.

512
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,200
Over there!

513
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,940
Stop the machine now!

514
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,520
What are you doing?

515
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,440
No!

516
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,480
What's wrong?

517
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,500
My bonus was turned into chips!

518
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,840
Sakonji, it's your fault!

519
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,140
Saori!

520
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,120
Why did you do that?

521
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,240
You're too upset to get angry.

522
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,720
That's right.

523
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,880
Then, can we get angry?

524
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,720
You tricked us, Plum!

525
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,920
Please, stop.

526
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,940
I had to take the bonus.

527
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,620
It was Ryo's fault.

528
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,480
You're the one who lied!

529
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,300
I don't care.

530
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,240
Ryo!

531
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,260
Ryo!

532
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,100
I'll win next year for sure!

533
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,680
Stop it!

534
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:57,960
You should retire!

535
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,360
Stop it right now!

536
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,040
I'm sorry.

537
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,000
What happened?

538
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,440
The cars and people around us are frozen close.

539
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,040
Time stops, almost.

540
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,480
Hey, what's up with you guys?!

541
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,360
You can't just call us aliens, right?

542
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,260
Next time, we'll see how time stops in Japan.

543
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,960
Bus stop!

544
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:18,780
Don't forget to subscribe!

545
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,200
