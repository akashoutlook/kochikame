Kaoru Satake

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,500
I look at the rising sun floating in the middle of the river

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,820
If I kick the stone of love, it goes flying over my feet

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:32,280
I wonder if I'll go and save up

00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,080
I laughed at the fact that it was just a

A... Okay!

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,520
When I meet you next time, I'll be sure to.

47
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,420
Thank you so much!

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,100
Ah, no need for that.

49
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,400
It's our job to help the residents.

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,800
We're all adults. We help each other when we're in trouble.

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,440
Thanks to Mr. Tamedaore, we can use our working hours efficiently.

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,720
Hard! Hard! Zex Hard!

53
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,720
Yahoo! I finally got it!

54
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,380
Ohara!

55
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,940
What the hell is that idiot doing?

56
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,760
Awesome! It's the Zex Hard!

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,740
I got it!

58
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:00,920
I finally got it!

59
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,380
I was so desperate that I gave up!

60
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,200
Wow!

61
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,960
Awesome!

62
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,020
I was so surprised. I thought I had it in the morning, but I was actually going to buy this.

63
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,540
Yeah, I saw it on Hachioji's

64
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,260
I can't help but get it.

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,300
What's that plastic model? Is it a bonus?

66
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,680
That's the biggest sale of Zex Hard.

67
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,560
It's got data chips in it, and if you connect it to the game console, it's the same as a plastic model.

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,580
Ryo, let's play a match.

69
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,660
Let's do it!

70
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,080
Okay, wait. I'll make it right away.

71
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,140
Awesome!

72
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,260
So fast!

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,740
That's enough.

74
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,180
Zex Hard!

75
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,660
Okay, I made it!

76
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,420
What's that all of a sudden?

77
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,360
Chief!

78
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,400
It's a good thing that you're playing with such a toy during your work.

79
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,960
I don't want to, Chief.

80
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,360
Chief! I'm just saying that I value the relationship with the citizens.

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,360
What?

82
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,420
Chief, what are you doing?

83
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,220
I don't think that's a good excuse to use.

84
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,560
Please stop, Chief!

85
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,900
Shut up! This is a good thing to do!

86
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,300
My seniors have a lot of business to do.

87
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,720
What a bad boy.

88
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,460
Ryo said he had to go to Hachioji by bicycle to buy it.

89
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,640
What?

90
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,420
Renko, you're so stubborn.

91
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,760
You idiot!

92
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,000
What's that?

93
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,060
It hurts, it hurts.

94
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,380
Ryo, can I borrow your Zaxxard?

95
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,820
I want to borrow it!

96
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,120
Wait, I'll do it myself!

97
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,460
If you really want to care about the relationship with the citizens,

98
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,800
then help me with the business of the restaurant next to the office!

99
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,380
No, Chief!

100
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,180
It has nothing to do with the police!

101
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,180
Don't worry!

102
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,780
I'll ask the chief to treat you to a special pay.

103
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,460
Did he have any pay left?

104
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,760
That's not true, right?

105
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,420
I asked Mr. Ohara about it.

106
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,000
The chief is so stubborn!

107
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,620
This is the center where you can work.

108
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,500
What is this?

109
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,600
It's like a communication command center.

110
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,000
This is the center where you can work.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,280
Thank you for your cooperation.

112
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,240
The first floor of the fourth floor, Kameari 4th floor.

113
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,660
The third floor, Kameari 4th floor.

114
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,900
The fourth floor is very heavy.

115
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:31,760
The fourth floor is very heavy.

116
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,140
The fourth floor is very heavy.

117
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,900
You'll be waiting at the exit.

118
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,420
What is this?

119
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,760
It's like an eel dormitory.

120
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,320
The fang is in charge of Katsushika-shi.

121
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,220
What?

122
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:41,960
I'm going to the office?

123
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,640
You know best about the store, right?

124
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,300
Of course, but...

125
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,920
- But... - Please wait on seat 13.

126
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,100
OK.

127
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,220
Please take care of me.

128
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,120
Cheers!

129
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,420
This is it, eh?

130
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,700
It's pretty cramped.

131
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,460
Please accept the tale of farming from the sender.

132
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,280
Here it is.

133
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,620
Number 13 coming in.

134
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,400
On display.

135
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,580
Oh, wow! It's like a secret robot and anime place!

136
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:37,540
By Number 13, takeoff!

137
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:37,620
Let's go!

138
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,360
I can't stop!

139
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,760
Ryo!

140
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,620
I'm here to eat!

141
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,840
Yes, I'm here to eat!

142
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,360
Where's the ramen?

143
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,260
Hey, give me the ramen!

144
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,200
Leave it here!

145
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,380
Don't spill it!

146
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,820
I'll wait for the ramen!

147
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,200
Ryo!

148
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,680
I'm sorry for being so rude with just one ramen!

149
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,260
Where's the ramen?

150
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,600
Yes, it's mine!

151
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,120
I'll take it myself!

152
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,040
I see.

153
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,660
This is just right!

154
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,880
This is easy!

155
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:31,920
Isn't it?

156
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,760
Here it comes!

157
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,960
Ryo!

158
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,540
Kankichi!

159
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,640
What are you doing?

160
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,220
You guys should go eat!

161
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,540
Thank you very much!

162
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,420
Hey!

163
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Don't come in!

164
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,460
What?

165
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,320
Come and get it!

166
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,140
No, I'm saying, do something yourself!

167
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,800
You say whatever you want!

168
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,000
You stupid girls!

169
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,780
Take that!

170
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,060
What are you doing?

171
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,320
What are you doing, you bastard?!

172
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,120
You're so pushy!

173
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,120
Stop it, it's time for the ramen!

174
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,860
Next, the fried rice!

175
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,800
The fried rice!

176
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,820
How's that?

177
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,240
Did you remember?

178
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,460
Here you go!

179
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,860
Hey, Yoko!

180
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,060
Remember!

181
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,900
I'll find you, Mr. Ohara!

182
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,060
Sorry to bother you!

183
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,480
I'm sorry to bother you!

184
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:24,780
I'm sorry to bother you!

185
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,640
Sorry to bother you!

186
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,980
Sorry to bother you!

187
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,380
I'm sorry to bother you!

188
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:29,820
I'm sorry to bother you!

189
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,040
I'm sorry to bother you!

190
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,540
Hello, Ryo!

191
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,140
Tell us your name!

192
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,820
I don't know!

193
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,540
There has to be one! Tell us!

194
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,600
I said I don't know!

195
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,440
Here you go, "Katsudon."

196
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,240
Thanks a lot!

197
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,820
This "Katsudon" will change your mind!

198
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,880
I can't eat this virus!

199
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,880
Hey, you!

200
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,580
Trying to mess up my food!

201
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,920
What the hell are you doing?

202
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,020
You!

203
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,760
What's wrong, Ryo-san?

204
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,280
This is bad!

205
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:00,960
Shut up!

206
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,840
Don't get in my way!

207
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,780
I'll show you what's really bad!

208
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,380
Saki, try it!

209
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
Hey, who said I could eat it!

210
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,520
I still have miso soup and takoyaki!

211
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,000
You're overdoing it, Ryo-san!

212
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,160
I can't tell which is better!

213
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,300
S-Save me, Mr. Kaiji!

214
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,760
Just stop it already, Ryo-san!

215
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,480
It's still in the bowl!

216
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,880
I'll tell you the names of the accomplices, but you have to do something about him...

217
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,180
You know what I mean!

218
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,340
You have to pay for the broken bowl!

219
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,800
I know, I know, Mr. Ryo!

220
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,840
You should be a good servant to the one who pays for it.

221
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,620
Cheers!

222
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,580
I'm done eating!

223
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,060
Oh, no one's here.

224
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,380
What should I order?

225
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,020
A special one-bite cutlet and five rice?

226
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,920
Are there any customers?

227
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,700
I'm getting hungry.

228
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,240
I'm working hard without eating lunch.

229
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,840
This is a natural rule.

230
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,200
It's delicious.

231
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,900
As expected of a special cutlet!

232
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,600
If there was one more, I wouldn't know.

233
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,160
I'm already full, so I'll have some more.

234
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,660
I ate it!

235
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,180
I really ate a whole cutlet.

236
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,820
I have no choice.

237
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,780
I'll reduce the amount of soup and cabbage according to the amount of cutlets.

238
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,320
And the rice too.

239
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,820
Yeah.

240
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,180
This is the real cutlet and rice.

241
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
It's a super-diet food.

242
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,980
It's just right considering your big appetite.

243
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,840
What a good-natured subordinate I am.

244
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,880
Oops, I forgot.

245
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,900
Oh, no!

246
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,760
The plate you put in such great care!

247
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,660
I can't help it.

248
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,240
I'll use the yakisoba plate to trick him.

249
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,760
He won't notice for a while.

250
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,560
What's this?

251
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,340
This is my death certificate.

252
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,800
It's hidden in such a place.

253
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,640
I'll dispose of it in secret.

254
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,060
Maybe there's something I've collected.

255
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,340
No, next to the book...

256
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,400
Oh, no! He's back!

257
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,980
I'm also...

258
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,120
It's not good to go out right now.

259
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,960
I'll hide it here for now.

260
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,380
This man is the most troublesome person in our book.

261
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,160
I wish he could be a clerk as it is.

262
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,100
Damn it!

263
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,860
He's so mean!

264
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,420
The delivery has arrived.

265
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,920
What? What's the lack of this amount?

266
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,180
It's Ryo's doing.

267
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
He's the only one who can imitate this childish thing.

268
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,640
Sir, the plate that was baked by Arita...

269
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:32,980
What?

270
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,960
The plate that was used for delivery has been replaced.

271
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,840
What?

272
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,000
That's the one we received from the head of the district.

273
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,760
Oh, I can't help it that it's locked here.

274
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,400
Who is it?

275
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,080
Ryo?

276
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,600
Damn it!

277
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,640
I can't take it anymore!

278
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,540
Damn it!

279
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,460
Ohara!

280
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,780
Are you alright, Ohara?

281
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,480
How could you escape from that place so quickly?

282
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,900
Damn you, Ryo!

283
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,420
I knew it.

284
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,600
I knew this is the best place.

285
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,540
Is it alright for you to sell oil at such a place, Ryo?

286
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,520
You're so stupid to do this.

287
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,080
You can't do this anywhere else!

288
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,320
Look! I've made some barley tea for you.

289
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,420
Phew!

290
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,160
I'm so sorry.

291
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,520
I should have been more careful.

292
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,120
Oh, it's hot!

293
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,600
It's hot!

294
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,340
Ryo!

295
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,440
Thank you for your hard work.

296
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,040
You're welcome!

297
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,520
Oh, thank you.

298
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,180
Huh?

299
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,020
Huh?

300
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,220
Are you sure?

301
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,660
What are you doing here?

302
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,000
What?

303
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,840
Nakagawa!

304
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,360
It's not mine.

305
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,060
It's not mine either.

306
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,420
It's mine.

307
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,600
So I'm the one who's collecting plates?

308
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,040
Ryo, you're delivering again? You look busy.

309
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,920
No, I'm not!

310
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
What's with you?

311
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,160
You're eating so much.

312
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,460
You should be a part of the collection.

313
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:12,480
You should be a part of the collection.

314
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,220
I'm collecting only plates.

315
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,240
I have to take care of what I left behind.

316
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,860
Modern people must know what they're doing.

317
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,440
The importance of food!

318
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,760
But he's a super-yontil, right?

319
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,520
Wow!

320
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,100
Wow!

321
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,940
Oh, what kind of kind people are they?

322
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,740
They're so meticulous.

323
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,860
They're so hardworking.

324
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,220
Who are you?

325
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,860
Who made you do this?

326
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,980
You made a sacred bowl in place of a dishcloth!

327
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,980
You?

328
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,980
No, Ryo.

329
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,300
You're a scoundrel.

330
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,840
It's not mine.

331
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,720
It's not mine.

332
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,260
Who did this?

333
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,360
It's not mine!

334
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:12,840
It's not mine!

335
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,500
You!

336
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,460
Sorry.

337
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,100
I'm sorry.

338
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,240
I was just being hostile.

339
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,480
What a scoundrel!

340
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,320
Even if the Lord allows it, the Lord's sister can't do it!

341
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,440
Watch your mouth.

342
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,380
Yes...

343
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, come on, I can't do this anymore.

344
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,020
Since I've been fired on that catapult so many times in a day,

345
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,580
I've lost my mind!

346
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,040
Hey, Yotsu! What the hell have you done?

347
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,360
The whole country has been complaining about you.

348
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,160
Don't worry about that. I did it properly.

349
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,540
Don't lie to me!

350
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,780
Chief!

351
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,560
I'll take all the reports you've done.

352
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,000
I heard you went around everywhere, not just the office.

353
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,400
No, that's because the attitude of the people is too cruel.

354
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,260
You idiot!

355
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,140
You're living the most selfish life in Japan,

356
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,000
and you have no right to criticize people's attitudes.

357
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,080
I don't know what you're thinking,

358
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,980
but I'm going to deduct your salary for bothering this shop.

359
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,740
No way!

360
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,200
If you're paid for your work,

361
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,880
you don't know why you're working.

362
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,540
I don't know why you're working.

363
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,000
Then, you have to be serious about it.

364
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,740
Apologize, Yotsu!

365
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,580
No, no, no, no.

366
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,380
It hurts, Chief!

367
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,840
Well, Mr. Ohara,

368
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,400
you don't have to do anything.

369
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,640
No, if you have any problems,

370
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,920
please contact me.

371
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,060
I... I understand.

372
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,580
This time, I'm introducing Mr. Ohara,

373
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,360
and I want to get even a little help.

374
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,440
Yes, thank you.

375
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,960
Excuse me, sir.

376
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,880
Excuse me.

377
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,480
Thank you.

378
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,780
Mr. Ohara is working as a cop.

379
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,180
You don't have to work.

380
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,240
I don't know why he has to work all the time.

381
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,580
I don't know why he doesn't work.

382
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:25,960
You don't have to work.

383
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,500
I will tell you what I mean.

384
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,420
You, you will not get any job after that.

385
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,580
You'll have another job.

386
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:31,760
How about that?

387
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,860
What does that make you?

388
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,860
I had a bad feeling when I was called by Senpai.

389
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,900
This shop is quite good.

390
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,180
Oh, it's a guest. Honda, go!

391
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,780
Manager, please come to the reception room immediately.

392
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,700
The head of the Kazushika branch, Ohara, is here.

393
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,180
What?

394
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,560
You're having a reception from overseas?

395
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,300
Yes. I know it's impossible to come to the reception room tomorrow.

396
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,120
But I'd like to use this place.

397
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,480
I see.

398
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,560
Oh, it's not about me.

399
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,280
It's a request from Mr. Ohara, not anyone else.

400
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,200
Let's do something about it.

401
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,420
Then...

402
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,660
Yes, leave it to me.

403
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,280
Thank you very much.

404
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,540
This is a chance to revenge!

405
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,140
What?

406
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,300
All the members of the national team are on leave?

407
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,200
Yes, I just got a call.

408
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,860
They suddenly got sick and are on leave.

409
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,040
Oh, what's going on?

410
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,520
There's a reception at the Kazushika branch today.

411
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,480
I found a hand-out construction in the shop building.

412
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,240
I'll have to take a break tomorrow.

413
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,200
Don't worry about it.

414
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,000
There's actually someone who used to work for the head of a famous hotel.

415
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,500
Really?

416
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,540
Yes.

417
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,820
And he once beat up the iron men in a cooking competition.

418
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,920
What?

419
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,480
I'm putting a knife in his hand right now, but he'll come to me as soon as I ask him to.

420
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,360
Please call him immediately.

421
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,080
I understand.

422
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,900
Leave it to me.

423
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,620
However, he hates to be seen cooking.

424
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,920
Please don't go into the kitchen, even if you're the manager.

425
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,960
I understand.

426
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,360
I swear I won't peek.

427
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,980
You're late, Mr. Cook.

428
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,580
There's no way someone like you would be here.

429
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,700
What?

430
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,180
Then what are we going to do with today's dish?

431
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,580
I'll cook it!

432
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,020
I'll make it!

433
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,380
I'll make it!

434
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,880
I'll make it!

435
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,700
I'll make it!

436
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,520
I'll make it!

437
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,500
I'll make it!

438
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:49,900
I'll make it!

439
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:49,960
I'll make it!

440
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,620
I'll make it!

441
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,280
I'll make it!

442
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,260
I'll make it!

443
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,420
I'll make it!

444
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,680
I'll make it!

445
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,080
I'll make it!

446
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,560
I'll make it!

447
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,020
I'll make it!

448
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,020
I'll make it!

449
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,320
I'll make it!

450
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll make it!

451
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,140
No!

452
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,620
What are you talking about?

453
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,380
I can't believe it.

454
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,680
I can't believe it.

455
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,500
What?

456
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,020
You changed your mind!

457
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,560
That's why I cried.

458
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:20,680
Hahaha!

459
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,800
Chief, let's eat.

460
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,640
Oh, that's right.

461
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,680
Oh, you're doing it seriously.

462
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,480
Of course.

463
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,720
What is this, Ryotsu?

464
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,240
It's our special menu.

465
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,980
There are top chefs in this restaurant.

466
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,420
Please try the most delicious food you can eat.

467
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,860
Please eat before you wake up.

468
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,760
Then, I'll start eating.

469
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,420
What is this soup?

470
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,420
Ryo, what kind of soup is this?

471
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,980
The chef said that this is a special recipe

472
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,620
that uses French cooking techniques to make a soup

473
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,460
that is full of unique flavors.

474
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,200
Oh, that's right.

475
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,580
Next dish.

476
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,480
Oh, I love sushi.

477
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,240
There's chocolate inside.

478
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,800
It's a traditional Japanese dish.

479
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,800
It's a combination of sushi and yogurt.

480
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,920
The top is made of cocoa.

481
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,240
Please enjoy the taste of Japanese food.

482
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,900
He's eating.

483
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,620
Everyone ate well.

484
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm sure he'll be satisfied.

485
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,580
I have a feeling that a top chef is cooking.

486
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,440
The bottom of a human is not good.

487
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,240
Okay, I'll prepare the next dish.

488
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,380
Oh, tempura.

489
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,140
It's a tempura with jelly, gummi, and natate cocoa.

490
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,580
Please enjoy the unique texture.

491
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,380
Please, the chief and the chief, please eat.

492
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,220
Actually, it's nothing.

493
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,160
It's a spicy steak.

494
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,220
It's not spicy.

495
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,160
It's super spicy.

496
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,120
Meal is crazy, isn't it.

497
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,420
It's a mix of sweet and bittersweet đượcal.

498
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,900
Oh, that's great.

499
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,020
I thought it was something inside.

500
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,940
What's that smell on the floor?

501
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,240
What's that?

502
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,780
Mr. Ohara!

503
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,040
Did you have a good time?

504
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,420
Oh, it was a unique dish.

505
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,160
I'm just surprised.

506
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,020
I'm happy to be pleased with you.

507
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,240
I'm so glad.

508
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,240
Ryo-tsu's acquaintance is a chef.

509
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,840
So I've never eaten it.

510
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,540
What?

511
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,960
Actually, all of my cooks are on leave for 9 seconds.

512
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,420
What's wrong?

513
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,620
Damn you, Ryo-tsu!

514
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,660
Dessert is a flower-flavored cake.

515
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,740
It's a taste that pops in your mouth.

516
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,200
And put a lot of cream on it.

517
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,740
It's a cake I made.

518
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,280
You can't make it smoke.

519
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,660
I'm so excited just imagining what's going to happen.

520
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,600
Is that so?

521
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,260
Ryo-tsu!

522
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,420
Chef!

523
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,420
It's you again!

524
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,720
You're not going to eat it?

525
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,360
I won't forgive you for today.

526
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,240
If this happens, I'll have to apologize to everyone.

527
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,160
What should I do?

528
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,960
What's wrong with you?

529
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,280
You're so ungrateful!

530
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,300
It's just a preemptive act!

531
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,800
It's a fire!

532
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,440
Don't panic! It's the fire extinguisher!

533
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,260
Yes, sir!

534
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,760
Ryo-tsu, get the gas back.

535
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,820
Yes, sir!

536
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,360
Hot.

537
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,260
Chief, look! I got it!

538
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,780
I thought I was going to die.

539
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,040
Ryotsu!

540
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,100
Chief, are you okay?

541
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,140
You bastard!

542
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,260
You bastard!

543
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,580
Please stop, chief!

544
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,140
Everyone makes mistakes!

545
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,600
Your existence is the mistake!

546
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,500
Please stop!

547
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,160
So this is what happened.

548
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,920
Chief Donra.

549
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,380
I'm glad I got to introduce you.

550
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,300
Don't ask me.

551
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,840
I know what you want to say.

552
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,900
Ryotsu!

553
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,760
You bastard!

554
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,180
Chief, please stop!

555
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:57,740
It was not on purpose!

556
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,340
Please help me!

557
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,840
The money for the letters...

558
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,880
...was buried in the grave.

559
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,980
The lights in the room disappeared.

560
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,260
The traitors...

561
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,640
I don't think anyone believes in ghosts anymore.

562
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,960
But I want to see the real ghost.
