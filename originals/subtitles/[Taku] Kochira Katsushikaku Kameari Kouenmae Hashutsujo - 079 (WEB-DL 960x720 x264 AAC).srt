00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:22,960
I take off my love rock and jump to the foot

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,620
To how far I can go

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:30,700
I wonder if I can go

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,720
So I'd save money

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,540
I was just anhad it

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,500
I was laughed at

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,340
Somewhere we don't feel better

00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,000

As expected of the Motor Festival.

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,040
But, who is the person that sent us the invitation?

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,380
That's right. Ryo-chan, who doesn't have a car, might not be very close to us.

25
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,520
I have a car, too.

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,640
Countach, Mustang, King Tiger, and...

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
Aren't they all plastic models?

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,460

Ouch!

43
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,640
You're driving so badly!

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,680
I can't believe it!

45
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,040
I knew it. Cafe au lait smells like art.

46
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,280
I know the man.

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,120
Eizaki Korosuke.

48
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,920
Professor Eizaki!

49
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,840
He's making such a fuss again.

50
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,680
I'll show you how to get out of here.

51
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,940
Bonjour, Monsieur Nakagawa.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,380
How are you?

53
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,640
Mademoiselle Raikou.

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:29,920
Hey!

55
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,280
You're a man who knows everything!

56
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,820
You're a mountain gorilla.

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,620
Who's a gorilla?

58
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,680
Are you from Beijing?

59
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:39,980
No!

60
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,700
I'm Japanese!

61
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,860
That's a French joke with Esprit.

62
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,760
You know what?

63
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,560
The ancient Cro-Magnon people

64
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,880
went south in 1868

65
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,260
and were discovered in France.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,780
France is a country of history and art.

67
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,680
Hey!

68
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,240
You're so hot!

69
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,500
What's with that outfit?

70
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,320
Dracula?

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,340
No.

72
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,660
This is the royal thief

73
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:05,740
that France has created.

74
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,360
Alcène Lupin!

75
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,480
Lupin?

76
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,200
In the Middle East,

77
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,940
there's a royal thief called the Mouse Kid.

78
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,860
What the hell are you doing?

79
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,280
Lupin is not a vulgar pronunciation.

80
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,900
It's "Lupin"!

81
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,180
Isn't that "France Pan"?

82
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,740
Oui.

83
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,680
In France, this pan is used for fighting.

84
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,940
That's ridiculous.

85
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,920
Anyway, Nakagawa-kun, Miss,

86
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,580
are you still riding a Ferrari or a Porsche?

87
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,380
Y-Yes.

88
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,880
Well,

89
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,240
you can be a French car.

90
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,540
Citroën, Renault, Peugeot...

91
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,840
There's love and art in the French car!

92
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,340
It's totally different from the other day.

93
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,560
Jaguar and T-Time

94
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,640
were all over the UK.

95
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,440
What?

96
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,420
France is the country

97
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,620
that is full of the scent of Europe.

98
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,540
Professor, when is France?

99
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,620
I've been teaching in Sorbonne University

100
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,680
for two weeks.

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,440
You've been in France for only two weeks?

102
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,600
Even so,

103
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,440
the flow of the world is still in my ears.

104
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,460
The mountain pass of Montmartre

105
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,600
where all the painters from all over the world gather.

106
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,660
No!

107
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,320
No, no, no, no, no!

108
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,300
And then I sit in a cafe

109
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,800
and say this way:

110
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,160
"Mademoiselle,

111
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,240
I'm a silver plate."

112
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,620
Shut up!

113
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,020
You just have to admit that

114
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,100
the place where you came in

115
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,000
when you fell off the stairs

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,160
was all for nothing!

117
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,060
Damn!

118
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,500
-Neg-! -Senpai, please stop!

119
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,220
It would be terrible if we had a duel again like this!

120
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,140
I know, but I don't feel like fighting anymore.

121
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,000
It's so stupid.

122
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,440
By the way, professor, who gave you this invitation?

123
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,700
Wimsh, exactly. I invited you.

124
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,000
My invention is also on display at this show.

125
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,060
And that's...

126
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,520
Nare-da!

127
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,540
What's that?

128
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,460
Ladies and gentlemen, the 21st century is the era of tanks.

129
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,940
And so, I developed a revolutionary tank machine, the All-Aimed.

130
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,200
You're just playing with tanks, aren't you?

131
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,560
You!

132
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,680
Do you know why Napoleon attacked Russia?

133
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,300
I don't know!

134
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,500
I don't know, either!

135
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,540
Then, you amateurs, keep quiet!

136
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,480
Even though it looks like this, it's not just a tank machine!

137
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,100
It detects the car body with a top lens,

138
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,100
and analyzes the car's dirt by computer.

139
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,860
It sprays water and special detergent from 50 places to remove the dirt.

140
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,040
And it can move anywhere with a caterpillar!

141
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,540
In other words, this robot, Zenjiro-kun, is a moving tank machine with brains!

142
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,760
Oh, amazing machine!

143
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,200
I see.

144
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,440
It can move by itself, so it can finish the tank machine by just parking it.

145
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,440
Is it really that good?

146
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,380
Then, let's try it out.

147
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,840
Zenjiro-kun, start the tank machine course.

148
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,360
The switch has been turned on.

149
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,360
It detects the car body and returns the tank machine.

150
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,280
All you have to do is blow it with the AdWord Merit Pipe.

151
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,740
Oh, my God!

152
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,060
Oh, it's Horo!

153
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,700
Then, it's an open car.

154
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,100
I forgot to put Horo's stopper on.

155
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,220
Check complete.

156
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,400
I'm washing it.

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,420
I'm washing it.

158
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,040
The tank machine is starting to discharge.

159
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,060
Help!

160
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,900
Oh, my eyes!

161
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,180
What a terrible guy.

162
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,860
This is not the time to say such things.

163
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,980
We have to help him quickly.

164
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,460
It's terrible.

165
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,380
The work is finished.

166
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,980
The work is finished.

167
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,160
Hey, old man, are you all right?

168
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,580
The detergent is melted and I can't see well.

169
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,600
Are you all right?

170
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:12,720
Can I make it up to him?

171
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,040
Hey, look!

172
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,860
No...

173
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,680
This was the first time I had another coffee at a cafe.

174
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,620
It's not the first time to be filled with water...

175
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,660
Did you understand?

176
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,940
Just like this, you can clean your room and clothes at the same time.

177
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,700
I showed him that I can do it.

178
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,820
Ugh...

179
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,140
You're talking about your stupidity of hating the bucket again!

180
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,020
Under the sky of Paris, the Seine flows.

181
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,820
That chanson I heard on Champs-Élysées was his.

182
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,400
You bastard!

183
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,800
Sen-Senpai!

184
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,460

199
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,380
Hm?

200
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,780
Oh, this one.

201
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,780

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,220
No way!

205
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,460
Then how about Zenjudo?

206
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,080
He's moving on his own.

207
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,460
Huh?

208
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,140

251
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,880
He's totally in a good mood.

252
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,820

00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,880

255
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,680
Get up!

256
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,420
He's doing a good job!

257
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,340
It's probably useless.

258
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,560
Zenjido has a self-defense system.

259
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,280
Why would he do that?

260
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,180
In the future, even if it's a machine, it has to protect itself.

261
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,300
Where's the big one?

262
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,320
Let go!

263
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
Don't let go!

264
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,260
Don't let go!

265
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:37,800

266
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,920
Ryo, do your best!

267
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,540
Senpai, hold on!

268
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,560
It's a useless resistance.

269
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,040
You're a genius!

270
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,400

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:51,800
Ryo!

272
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,820
Why are you so weak?

273
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,320
It's a perfect defense system, isn't it?

274
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,560
Don't brag about it. Do something!

275
00:11:59,560 --> 00:11:59,740

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:00,960

You're too kind!

279
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,440
Stop it!

280
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,020
You can't fight like that!

281
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,080
I don't want to!

282
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,160

283
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,320

287
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,020
Hey!

288
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,620
So, what is this?

289
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:27,900
I found it!

290
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,140
Can't you let us do it?

291
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,300
It can't be helped.

292
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:29,420
It's right now.

293
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,540
What are you talking about?

294
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,500
Nobody can stop us!

295
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,620
That's why we're destroying it!

296
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,140
Wash it! Wash it!

297
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,920
Hey! We're getting water out!

298
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,680
It seems they're going to wash the whole venue.

299
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,520
That's not right!

300
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,360
What a disaster!

301
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,480
The venue is running out of water!

302
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,540
Wash it! Wash it! Wash it!

303
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,640
Wash it!

304
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,900
We need to do something!

305
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,320
Professor!

306
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,960
Where did you go?

307
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,020

309
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,560
The war is over.

310
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,820
The war is over.

311
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:24,000
We've done it again.

312
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,280
I can't believe it.

313
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,200
How was it?

314
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,720
We're doing an earthquake search just for this moment.

315
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,420
You did it anyway.

316
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,720
Haha.

317
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,320
It was not my invention.

318
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,000
It was not my invention.

319
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,440
There's nothing like that.

320
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,440
So he's not the most dangerous person?

321
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,580
That's right! There's one more invention left at the second meeting.

322
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,220
Hey, Reiko Nakagawa, we're going home.

323
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,440
If you keep being with him, you'll lose your life.

324
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,260
Senpai!

325
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,320
That's too bad. It's a new virtual game.

326
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,400
A new virtual game?

327
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,060
Then I'll leave Gorilla-kun to you.

328
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,420
Wait!

329
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,480
This is not a game. Let me play it!

330
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,840
This is it!

331
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,100
You said this is it. Is this all you have?

332
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,460
That's right.

333
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,460
But we can't play without a car and a screen.

334
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,700
Don't worry.

335
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,860
Try wearing a helmet.

336
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't think it's dangerous.

337
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Throw it away.

338
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:53,580
Hold the steering wheel.

339
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,100
What is this?

340
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,500
The screen is in the shield!

341
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,100
Try pushing the steering wheel forward.

342
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,180
Like this?

343
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,160
It's running!

344
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,780
This is amazing!

345
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,100
This helmet is a virtual reality goggles!

346
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,500
That's right.

347
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,520
This is the only one in the world.

348
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,140
It's a compact virtual reality drive game!

349
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,100
I'll turn the engine all the way to the top!

350
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,380
Wow!

351
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,060
It's like a real one with stereo headphones built in.

352
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,000
This is pretty good.

353
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,600
Simulation development is a specialty of teachers.

354
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,020
Then show me the example.

355
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,120
The example?

356
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,520
Come on, hurry up!

357
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,180
What?

358
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:42,960
Come on!

359
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,480
I got a hairpin all of a sudden!

360
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,840
Just you wait.

361
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,440
This is a replacement for all the manuals we used in the past!

362
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,280
It's the current showroom!

363
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,800
What is this?

364
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:05,700
T-that's it!

365
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,680
Can't you fill it with bubbles!?

366
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,640
You're not really building a showroom.

367
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,560
Give it to me!

368
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,960
No, it's okay.

369
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,880
Don't try that!

370
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:12,980
Don't you know?

371
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,920
You could've put something.

372
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,980
Wait a minute.

373
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,300
I don't have any!

374
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,440
No?

375
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,900
How did it go?

376
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,660
The lap time for the 4th lap has increased.

377
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,360
I don't know what's going on outside.

378
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,600
This is not good.

379
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,080
If you connect the lines, you can race with 6 people at the same time.

380
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,080
Don't get close to me.

381
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,200
It's amazing when you line up.

382
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,100
It's kind of dangerous.

383
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,460
Let's go!

384
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,360
Go!

385
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,380
It crashed suddenly.

386
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,420
It's dangerous.

387
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,000
It doesn't look like a race.

388
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,020
It's a group of perverts.

389
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,820
It's great, isn't it?

390
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,580
It looks interesting, but it looks dangerous.

391
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,240
It's a problem.

392
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,920
There is no car body.

393
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,700
I'm glad I noticed that.

394
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,680
Everyone notices.

395
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,700
This is what I developed.

396
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:33,420
There are two F1 machines.

397
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,920
Is this real?

398
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,440
Of course.

399
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,280
A man who is particular about real things, Korosuke Ezaki.

400
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,980
By joining the engine, Zenkai, and the real F1 machine,

401
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,500
we can achieve the ultimate virtual reality.

402
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,520
If you accelerate, the virtual video will also speed up.

403
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,600
If you spin or crash, you will be thrown out of the car.

404
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,920
In other words, only I, a real F1 racer, can perfectly handle this.

405
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,620
Then, let's compete with me.

406
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,940
You'd better stop.

407
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,740
You're as skilled as Shoemaker or Ezaki Korosuke.

408
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,020
Are you going to face me?

409
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,660
If you fail, you're not going to go to America.

410
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,220
I will win.

411
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,740
You have to be more gorgeous than me,

412
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,900
Let's see who will win.

413
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,460
No way.

414
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,320
I can't beat you.

415
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:41,680
The even weight can't beat you,

416
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,320
I'm sure you can win.

417
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sure.

418
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,220
The next day

419
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,420
It's spinning!

420
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,740
It's very powerful!

421
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,920
What kind of driving is it?

422
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,320
I think it's going to the audience seat!

423
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,420
It may be killing 4 or 5 people.

424
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,220
It's a very fast car.

425
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,120
Okay, we'll make a difference in this straight line!

426
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,020
It really started to run!

427
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,380
It's a lot of power!

428
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,280
Me too!

429
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,960
Both of them are not aware of Zenkai-kun's fault!

430
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,660
Let's chase after them!

431
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,840
It's a very fast car!

432
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,400
It's a very fast car!

433
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,080
It's a very fast car!

434
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,660
Don't let go, Kei-chan!

435
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,420
I know!

436
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,220
It's very powerful!

437
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,480
It's like it's really running!

438
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,380
It's a very fast car!

439
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,140
It's a very fast car!

440
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,400
Oh no, it's coming!

441
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,900
It's the red light!

442
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,820
The ground especial corner!

443
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,020
Why is it making a noise?

444
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,220
It's one of the best cars in the world!

445
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,480
It's a high-speed corner!

446
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,020
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

447
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,620
I have a bad feeling!

448
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,580
How long it will last?

449
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,880
Maybe..

450
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,120
...when the battery runs out or when the game's over..

451
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:53,860
Oh!

452
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,960
Now it's the crossroads!

453
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,540
Arrrh! It's still a curvy road!

454
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,180
I-I can't go!

455
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,300
It's stuck in the sand-trap!

456
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:05,820
We're stuck in a trap!

457
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
The stop light was on the way down.

458
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,260
The train's coming!

459
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,020
It's the god of death!

460
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,700
If it's not a game, neither of us can do it!

461
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,720
Hey, Tsukoryo!

462
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,060
I think we're almost there.

463
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,660
Let's do this!

464
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,220
Let's get out of here!

465
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,880
Wow! That was super fast!

466
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,060
We're going to win!

467
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,900
What was that?

468
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,920
Well...

469
00:21:51,920 --> 00:22:04,260
This is bad!

470
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,280
The race is over!

471
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,860
We're in the race track!

472
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,460
We're in the fourth corner of the track and are about to enter the straight line.

473
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,260
The battle is...

474
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,500
Whoa! It's the F1!

475
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,720
There are two F1 machines running!

476
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,320
What happened?

477
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,100
This is...

478
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,600
They're still running!

479
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,080
What's going to happen?

480
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,220
They're doing a great job, but...

481
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,500
Is the goal too close?

482
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,860
Whoa! It's a great virtual!

483
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,840
There's a horse running in the race track!

484
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,580
The race track is running smoothly!

485
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,900
How do you like it?

486
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,320
But I remember making a simulation.

487
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,220
What?

488
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,880
Don't let the goal be too close!

489
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,380
No!

490
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,340
No, that's not true!

491
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,860
Huh?

492
00:22:50,860 --> 00:23:03,140
- It's moving! X3 - - I

493
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,080
am victorious! - What are you talking about? I am victorious!

494
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,160
Amazing!

495
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,980
It's a real battle!

496
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:16,900
Perfect!

497
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,120
What's going on?

498
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,260
The game is over, but it's still a race!

499
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,720
Hey, this isn't virtual!

500
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,620
They're back in reality!

501
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,640
The audience has been

502
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,320
Well, I'll go with this.

503
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,360
Dan!

504
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,200
Hey!

505
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,060
Don't run away!

506
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,380
Oh, nice!

507
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,460
Silver!

508
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,300
Blah!

509
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,460
Blah!

510
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,520
Blah!

511
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,500
Blah!

512
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,780
Blah!

513
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:01,920
Blah!

514
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,660
Blah!

515
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,580
What a face, Chief!

516
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,040
Look at those gyoza flowers!

517
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,820
Do these flowers cost so much of a price?

518
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,300
Fine!

519
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,140
I'll raise enough flowers for you!

520
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,640
There's so much to do at the back garden!

521
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,560
Look at the goldfish!

522
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,020
I'll be meeting you on Funtou Harasakaryo!

523
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,220
See you there!
