1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
"Taiko Sensei"

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,740
When watching TV, make sure the room is bright and see how far you can get.

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,720
The poor thing, come to me!

4
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,900
I'm here too, and I'm worried.

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:35,880
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,320
They'll be alright in a while

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,480
They'll be alright in a while

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,220
If you don't have a job, come to me

9
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,460
I don't have one, but don't worry

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,280
Look, it's burning

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,060
The red cloud

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,740
They'll be alright in a while

13
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,560
You understand, right?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,280
You understand, you understand

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,700
If you do, just shut up and follow me

16
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,640
If you do, just shut up and follow me

17
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:43,660
How'd you like to drink your own sake?

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,040
How'd you like to get drunk?

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,180
How'd you like to get drunk?

20
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,160
Greetings, great ancestors!

21
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,400
Greetings, great ancestors!

22
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,840
What's that?

23
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,780
The old man that was caught with just a glass of sake is calling the Ryotsu of Asakusa?

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,080
I don't know. I don't know.

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,700
I don't know. That old man...

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,840
Could he be...?

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,180
Okay, I'll go anyway.

28
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,940
Ah, Mom.

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,520
Where did the old man from Kanbei on Tsukuda Island go?

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,180
Ah, he said he was going to Morujibu.

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Morujibu?

32
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,700
It's a very high-class place, isn't it?

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,200
Then, the place where he ate and drank without permission is unrelated to me.

34
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,600
That's right, he'll come back to visit, right?

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,240
Well, I'm busy, so I'll cut it, Mom.

36
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,980
If you don't take care of your ancestors, you'll get a punishment.

37
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,620
Okay, okay.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,340
So, have you found out where the old man is?

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,680
Anyway, what he's saying is meaningless, and he says he was born in the 6th year of the Kaiei.

40
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,940
Kaiei? What's that?

41
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,040
Speaking of the 6th year of the Kaiei, it's probably the year of the Edo period.

42
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,160
But that would make him 160 years old this year.

43
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,220
What?

44
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,740
My grandfather used to call me Ryotsu Tamekichi, but I guess he doesn't have a heart.

45
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,920
Tamekichi? I've heard of it somewhere.

46
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,300
He's your relative, right?

47
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,560
I don't know.

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,580
Anyway, please help me for a while until we find that old man.

49
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,540
Then, I'll go back to the dressing room.

50
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,400
Why do I have to find an old man who ate and drank without permission?

51
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,960
It's not unrelated.

52
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,960
It's me.

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,480
Honoyama!

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,320
Ryotsu Tamekichi is your grandfather?

55
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,880
This is the end of the relationship.

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,980
What?

57
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,260
Old man?

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,080
He's been creating trouble every day.

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,120
He was a very important person, but he's still a child who will escape from heaven.

60
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,660
Escape?

61
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,180
Listen, you, his grandson, will be responsible for finding Tamekichi immediately.

62
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,440
Me?

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,400
That's your job.

64
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,700
Look at this.

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,420
You'll go to hell after the second origin.

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,360
If you go to hell, you'll be a turtle forever.

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,900
You'll be in hell forever.

68
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,160
Hell?

69
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,600
But if you find Tamekichi and give him to me, I'll give you your rights.

70
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,960
What's this?

71
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,120
Where is this place?

72
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,200
Ginza?

73
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,820
This is Ginza?

74
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,240
Before I knew it, it looks like the west.

75
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,200
Everyone's dressed up.

76
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,900
I see.

77
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,440
I'm back to life.

78
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,060
I'm doing it on a daily basis, so I'm giving you a reward.

79
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,560
Finally, I'm in heaven.

80
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,200
Don't stretch out.

81
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm going to die.

82
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,500
In other words, an old man who has lived through the end of the Edo period is wandering around there.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,120
But you're a magician, aren't you?

84
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,460
Can you catch him?

85
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,740
It's a very difficult job to find someone who is not from this world.

86
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,340
And it's dangerous to bring him back to my head.

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,300
Don't listen to what you're saying.

88
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,320
What?

89
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,740
In other words, the reason why Tamekichi escaped to heaven is your responsibility.

90
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:25,880
If you don't bring him back before your boss finds out, he'll be in trouble and your head will be in danger.

91
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,000
That's what I'm saying.

92
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,040
I gave up.

93
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,840
What?

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,960
What's wrong?

95
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,140
I gave up looking for that old man.

96
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,300
I gave up.

97
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,080
What?

98
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,780
Wait, wait, wait.

99
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,060
Not only the end of the Edo period, but also the reward.

100
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,180
If you do that, I'll find you.

101
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,720
I'm going to be in trouble.

102
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,000
If you don't want to.

103
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,980
Wait, I got it.

104
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,620
What do you want?

105
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,300
The Edo period until now will be the end of the Edo period.

106
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,200
In addition, there will be no Edo period for 100 years.

107
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,080
What?

108
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,640
I don't think I can do that.

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,560
You're not a man.

110
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,760
Then...

111
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,380
I got it.

112
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,960
Then the contract is signed.

113
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,060
Yeah.

114
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,060
But the car has been moving for a while now.

115
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,040
What?

116
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,140
Yeah.

117
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,540
I tried to avoid the old man who suddenly jumped out of the car, but when I stepped on the brake, the car behind me crashed.

118
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,040
I tried to avoid that old man, but when I stepped on the brake, the car behind me crashed.

119
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,080
Old man?

120
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,360
Hey, what kind of old man were you?

121
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,080
Um, in a kimono...

122
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,620
I was in a pink photo.

123
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:36,980
How was that?

124
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,660
No doubt.

125
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,200
I feel like I'm going to be in big trouble if I don't catch him soon.

126
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,640
He looks good on you.

127
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,160
Yeah, this is also good.

128
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,040
Also, this is a tennis coach who just entered yesterday.

129
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,100
Hey, I'm afraid, but please don't stick to the windows.

130
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,280
What?

131
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,420
Huh? Can I have a udon-kutta-yaoya?

132
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
N-no! Please don't!

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,980
Okay, okay. I'm a strong woman.

134
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,280
The yauya-san and udon-ya-san are also around the traffic light.

135
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,380
Please go over there.

136
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,160
Where's the sake shop?

137
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,200
There is, probably.

138
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,020
I see. Yes, yes, this way.

139
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,620
What the hell are you doing?

140
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,880
Excuse me.

141
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,180
Here are the other new products for this season.

142
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,720
Here are the new products for this season.

143
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,140
It seems that they're not here either.

144
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,420
I was searching for them one by one.

145
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,500
I can't wait. Let's split up and search.

146
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,480
What about your magic wand?

147
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,000
I hurriedly took it out, so I forgot it in the locker of the heaven police.

148
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,760
Then you can't use magic. You're just an old man.

149
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,900
I'm sorry, I'm just an old man.

150
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll get the wand.

151
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,760
If you find a place to stay in the meantime, please catch me.

152
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,780
Can I run home?

153
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,360
Of course.

154
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,760
But there's no better way to find your grandpa.

155
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,180
Huh?

156
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
Oh, I see. It's sake.

157
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,280
Huh?

158
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:02,720
Hello.

159
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,820
Good evening.

160
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,100
It's time for the "Kondate".

161
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,860
This is very polite.

162
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,840
Today, I'd like to make a simple and easy-to-make "omotenashi" dish,

163
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,180
called "chirashi-sushi".

164
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,280
Yes, I understand.

165
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,060
Chirashi-sushi is nice.

166
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,920
You all like it, don't you?

167
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,620
Yes, I love sushi.

168
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,340
Then, I'll take the frozen one.

169
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,880
You can have the ones we buy.

170
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,740
Please prepare the eel.

171
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,980
What? Eel?

172
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,720
Eel...

173
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,060
Sorry, I have something to do.

174
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,600
Grandpa.

175
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,260
What?

176
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,620
It's the TV.

177
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,400
Oh! I feel like I finally met someone I know.

178
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,080
Who are you?

179
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,960
You know...

180
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm the extra of Bakumatsu-den, which is just around the corner.

181
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,140
You can have it.

182
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,640
You...

183
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,020
You!

184
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,320
The Extra of Bakumatsu-den

185
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,760
We can see a lot of documents from that time.

186
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,640
Oh, it's pretty good.

187
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,900
Oh, that's...

188
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,540
Ryoma-san!

189
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,440
I'll return the car later.

190
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,720
Yes!

191
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,920
With this amount of money, we can call that old man.

192
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,460
It's me, Tamekichi from Tsukudaniya.

193
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,920
Did you forget?

194
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,660
I'm the Tamekichi who always followed the death of Ryoma-san.

195
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,800
Please take a good look at this!

196
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,060
Hey, Ryoma-san, please say something.

197
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,400
Sensei, I'm looking forward to working with you.

198
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,100
Oh, yes.

199
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,940
Then, I would like to talk to Professor Oyamada, the organizer and observer of this Bakumatsu-Ten.

200
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,340
I'm Oyamada.

201
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,520
Oh, I'm old now.

202
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,760
I was a 12 or 13-year-old boy at that time.

203
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,440
I don't know, but it's not impossible.

204
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,500
It's pretty good.

205
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,260
You're talking a lot, Ryoma-san.

206
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,500
Hey, old man.

207
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,560
This is a doll made by me.

208
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,340
What?

209
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,400
A doll?

210
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,700
Oh, is this a doll?

211
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,540
Let's interview the visitors.

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,080
Are you also a fan of Ryoma Sakamoto?

213
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,740
No, I'm Tamekichi from Ryotsu.

214
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,400
You like Ryoma Sakamoto, don't you?

215
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,520
I used to go to Ryoma-san's favorite Tsukudaniya Ryotei often.

216
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,480
That's why I like him.

217
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,440
As you see, this is the mother of Bakumatsu.

218
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,780
Now, she left a deep impression on Japanese people.

219
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,440
That's why I went to deliver this doll to her.

220
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,720
Oh, I remember this photo very well.

221
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,040
I was around here.

222
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,760
Do you like Bakumatsu?

223
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,600
Yes, this is the era I lived in.

224
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,800
There's no such thing as like or dislike.

225
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,120
Oh, I remember this.

226
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,640
I used to watch this around here.

227
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,620
The photo is fine.

228
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,960
It looks like a thunder, but it shines a little.

229
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,920
I'm a little afraid.

230
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,900
But I've seen a lot of your pictures.

231
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,920
What? Is that true?

232
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,920
I went to see it when you came to Edo.

233
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,640
I can't believe it, but I'm sure it's not a loss.

234
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,900
Back then...

235
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,420
This is...

236
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,080
It smells like alcohol.

237
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,420
If it's true, I'm going to light a fire to welcome you.

238
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,940
But I'm an old man, so I'll have to drink alcohol.

239
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,820
There's another one here.

240
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,080
I didn't know there was alcohol on the road.

241
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,380
It's heaven.

242
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,440
There's another one there.

243
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
What a dirty drink.

244
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,020
There are legs in ghosts.

245
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,220
Are you done drinking?

246
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,680
Look, old man.

247
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,240
You opened the Ittodaru by yourself.

248
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,500
What? Ittodaru?

249
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,660
It's a little bit left.

250
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,260
It's a scary drink.

251
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
It makes my face red.

252
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,140
What's your name, old man?

253
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,940
Me? I'm Ryoma Sakamoto.

254
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:53,960
What?

255
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,700
No, no.

256
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,600
I'm Ryo and Tamekichi Moshinosuke.

257
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,440
I knew it.

258
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,180
I heard you escaped heaven.

259
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,960
Hanayama changed the order and was looking for you.

260
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,360
Hanayama?

261
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,380
I don't know.

262
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,160
He's the old man of the magician.

263
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,180
He's from the heaven police.

264
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,560
That's him.

265
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,400
He's from the heaven police.

266
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,980
I was drunk at work.

267
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,000
Who are you?

268
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,080
Who are you?

269
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,520
I'm your son, Kanbi.

270
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,740
Your son, Genji.

271
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,240
Ryozu, Kankichi.

272
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,160
Your grandson, Kankichi?

273
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,760
I didn't know.

274
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,920
I don't know.

275
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,360
Because you're born after you die.

276
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,500
Oh, that's true.

277
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,440
Kankichi, is there no more alcohol?

278
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,920
You drank Ittodaru so fast.

279
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,480
There's no more.

280
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,180
Half of it is enough.

281
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,240
I can't drink it, so I'll drink it.

282
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,440
It's better to give it to Hanayama as soon as possible.

283
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,460
This old man.

284
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,440
Mr. Ryoji.

285
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,600
Mr. Ryoji.

286
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,260
I have a precious photo of the explosion.

287
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,420
A precious photo?

288
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Not just a photo.

289
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,500
There are many other things.

290
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,520
It's my treasure.

291
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,780
Please show me the picture.

292
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,900
If you don't mind, I would like to buy it for the appropriate price.

293
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,860
What?

294
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,100
Buy, make money, drink.

295
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,880
I can drink alcohol.

296
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,520
Yes, it's good.

297
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,040
Thank you.

298
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,480
Do you have such a precious thing?

299
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,520
Yes, it should be in the house of Asakusa.

300
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,360
What? Tsukudaniya?

301
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,060
Yes.

302
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,000
Before you go back to heaven, you can make a fortune with this old man.

303
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,800
Is it already the end of the year?

304
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,780
That's right.

305
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,520
If you are tired, it will be autumn.

306
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,780
From today,

307
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,400
I will report "The first store of the year from the end of the year that is open in Ginza".

308
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,480
Are you a fan of Ryo Sakamoto?

309
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,040
No, I am Mr. Tamekichi Ryozo.

310
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,020
I am Mr. Tamekichi Ryozo.

311
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,520
Now, I am ready.

312
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,340
When the old man becomes a monk,

313
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,940
he comes back early,

314
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,480
when he returns, he rides a bull and goes slowly.

315
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:53,780
When he returns, he rides a bull and goes slowly.

316
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,180
I used to go to the temple of Ryouma's favorite tsukuda.

317
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,480
I used to go to the temple of Ryouma's favorite tsukuda.

318
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,300
I used to go to the temple of Ryouma's favorite tsukuda.

319
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,880
You are strange.

320
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,420
I can't believe it.

321
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,080
You are strange.

322
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,640
You haven't changed at all.

323
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,260
You haven't changed at all.

324
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,560
Oh, Kankichi, are you a guest?

325
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,000
You are my mother.

326
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,020
You are Ginji's wife.

327
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,840
You are Ginji's wife.

328
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,400
Yes, I am.

329
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,620
You can go home sometimes.

330
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,960
You can go home sometimes.

331
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,980
That's right. We live in the same Tokyo.

332
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,080
That's right. We live in the same Tokyo.

333
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,520
What?

334
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,720
What happened to your father?

335
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,540
My father died.

336
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,080
What?

337
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,000
What is this?

338
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,460
Is this beer?

339
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,800
You are drinking alcohol again.

340
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,220
You are drinking alcohol again.

341
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,900
Don't be stupid. Beer is like water.

342
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Don't be stupid. Beer is like water.

343
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:49,920
It's Tamekichi.

344
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,360
What's going on?

345
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,800
Don't worry.

346
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,080
Your father is back.

347
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,080
Really?

348
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,760
Yes, he is back.

349
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,760
Yes, he is back.

350
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,100
Mom.

351
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,140
Good morning.

352
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,180
The taste of tsukudani seems to have not changed.

353
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,900
The taste of tsukudani seems to have not changed.

354
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,140
Uncle, is the alcohol good?

355
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,640
Yes, it's good.

356
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,120
I see.

357
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,460
I'm glad.

358
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,960
What is it?

359
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,740
There was nothing in the garden.

360
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,120
What is it?

361
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,580
Hey, Uncle.

362
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,060
I'm looking for something to eat.

363
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,160
I'm looking for something to eat.

364
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,380
Help me.

365
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,080
It's time to come to the mountain.

366
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,960
What are you looking for?

367
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,760
It's a treasure.

368
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,980
A treasure?

369
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,320
A treasure?

370
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,300
Hey, that's it.

371
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,380
What? Really?

372
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,200
I'm coming.

373
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,140
Then, let's see.

374
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,840
Then, let's see.

375
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,360
It's a photo.

376
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,800
It's quite old.

377
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,220
A chocolate?

378
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,840
It's nostalgic.

379
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,360
What is this?

380
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,420
Sassanoha?

381
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,080
Sassanoha?

382
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,620
It's all nonsense.

383
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,700
What is this photo?

384
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,240
This is a photo taken by Ryoma.

385
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,340
What is this photo?

386
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,360
What is this photo?

387
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,220
It's me.

388
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,420
Is that so?

389
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:25,560
Is that so?

390
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,200
Is there a photo of Ryoma Sakamoto?

391
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:29,940
Is there a photo of Ryoma Sakamoto?

392
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,620
No, there isn't.

393
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,300
No, there isn't?

394
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,180
Don't make a fuss.

395
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,380
Well, let's see the other one.

396
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,580
Well, let's see the other one.

397
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,720
This is...

398
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,860
Oh, that one.

399
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,380
That's the one of Saseki Natsume.

400
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,580
Saseki Natsume?

401
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Saseki Natsume?

402
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,400
Saseki Natsume?

403
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,720
This one looks like a piece of paper.

404
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,240
This one looks like a piece of paper.

405
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,620
It's Higuchi Ichiyo's.

406
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,580
Is Higuchi Ichiyo the one who drew that bamboo comparison?

407
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,080
You're so stupid, Kawa.

408
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,060
Is that Ichiyo's manuscript?

409
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,460
No, it's not.

410
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,060
No, it's not.

411
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,040
What is this?

412
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,980
It's a letter from Higuchi Ichiyo.

413
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:17,840
What?

414
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,980
It's a leaf of a sassanoha cut by the Prime Minister of Japan.

415
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,000
It's a leaf of a sassanoha cut by the Prime Minister of Japan.

416
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,940
What is this?

417
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,500
It's a chocolate I drank last night.

418
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,020
I'll be off then.

419
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,040
I'll be off then.

420
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,360
Wait a minute.

421
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,500
If I search more, I'll find more treasures.

422
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,320
If I search more, I'll find more treasures.

423
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,340
There are many of those of that era.

424
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,960
I'm not just saying they're old.

425
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,060
I'm not just saying they're old.

426
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
If you find real treasures, please contact me anytime.

427
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,880
If you find real treasures, please contact me anytime.

428
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,820
Then...

429
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,960
I don't mind.

430
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,320
Thank you for your help.

431
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,720
Damn it!

432
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,220
I didn't know there was an old man like that.

433
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,020
I didn't know there was an old man like that.

434
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,820
Where did he go? The toilet?

435
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,300
He's so useless.

436
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,800
You're right.

437
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,380
You know, the old man left the back door.

438
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,700
What?

439
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,860
That's strange.

440
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,900
I think it's around here.

441
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,180
What's wrong?

442
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,360
He's here!

443
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,700
Oh, old man!

444
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,840
Hey, Kankichi!

445
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,100
Old man!

446
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,980
You're worried if you disappear!

447
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,480
There's no Shinnanoya.

448
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,300
When I came here, I always had a drink with a drink.

449
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,280
When I came here, I always had a drink with a drink.

450
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,800
Shinnanoya?

451
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,300
This is a convenience store.

452
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,580
Oh, are you going back to your hometown?

453
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,560
Oh, I see.

454
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,320
This is a bar.

455
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,700
Yeah, I can't do business with just alcohol these days.

456
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,820
Was Shinnanoya the name of the bar?

457
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,560
No.

458
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,080
No, I'm from Mikawa.

459
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,520
Wait.

460
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,680
The bar my grandfather used to run was Shinnanoya.

461
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:55,980
The bar my grandfather used to run was Shinnanoya.

462
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,940
The bar my grandfather used to run was Shinnanoya.

463
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,320
I knew it.

464
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,860
Then, the bar that the classmate Yasu opened was near Shimidagawa.

465
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,760
I see.

466
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,320
Then, where is Kiku?

467
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,280
He's over there.

468
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,340
I see.

469
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,600
He's a customer.

470
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,340
Then, see you later, Ryo.

471
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,120
Kiku!

472
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,620
Grandpa, that's 100 years ago.

473
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,020
Nobody lives here anymore.

474
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,480
Nobody lives here anymore.

475
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,860
It's boring.

476
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,520
Nobody knows me.

477
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,660
It's boring.

478
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,240
Aren't you happy to meet your grandson?

479
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,780
Hanayama!

480
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,680
I found you.

481
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,340
Take me to heaven.

482
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,420
I want to drink more.

483
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
I don't want to go home yet.

484
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,480
I don't want to go home yet.

485
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,320
Wait, my grandfather is here.

486
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,980
I don't want to go home yet.

487
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,880
I don't want to go home yet.

488
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,720
I don't want to go home yet.

489
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,980
I don't want to go home yet.

490
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,960
I have a request before I take my grandfather home.

491
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,040
What is it?

492
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,840
It's not your business.

493
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,560
It's another request.

494
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,020
Then, do it.

495
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,780
It's only 15 minutes.

496
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,820
Then, let's go.

497
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,100
Yes, sir.

498
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:09,500
Go!

499
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,340
Go!

500
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,600
Oh, Ryoma.

501
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:14,960
What's up?

502
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,460
Are you Ryoma Sakamoto?

503
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,020
Mr. Ryoma.

504
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,380
Who are you?

505
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,740
I am Tamekichi, a tsukudaniyan.

506
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,940
Wow, Tamekichi!

507
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,680
He is really a nice guy.

508
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,860
Teacher, it's a problem.

509
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,100
What's the problem for you to rush?

510
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,020
The real one is over there!

511
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,000
The real one?

512
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,840
How is he?

513
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,500
Ito Hirobumu is there. Naosuke Ii is there.

514
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,340
Even Perrin and Harris are there.

515
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,240
Takumoku Ishikawa with the sand of the evil Natsume.

516
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,520
Wow! Yōgai Mori is there.

517
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,020
After that, the woman is Akiko Yosano.

518
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,960
It's like she's dreaming.

519
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,400
It's not a dream.

520
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,020
Oh? Ryo-san!

521
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,200
What do you think? You are all treasure hunters, right?

522
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,160
This venue is full of guests.

523
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,140
No way, you're...

524
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,380
Yeah. There's a little acquaintance in heaven.

525
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,580
Heaven?

526
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,360
It's not a place for you two. Please wait a moment.

527
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,380
Don't push me!

528
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,220
Yasu, I miss you.

529
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,520
I miss you too.

530
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,800
Tamekichi-san!

531
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,820
Oh, Kikku-chan.

532
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,880
I'm glad you're here.

533
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,780
It's a gift from me.

534
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,260
I'm here!

535
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,560
Who are they?

536
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,540
I think they are the popular ones.

537
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,360
Minju-pair.

538
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,120
Someone's come out here.

539
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,800
What?

540
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,440
It's dangerous.

541
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,480
What the...?

542
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,320
It's alright.

543
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:57,800
It's alright.

544
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,280
It's alright.

545
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,300
It's alright.

546
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,140
It's alright.

547
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,520
Isn't it good? Isn't it good? Isn't it good?

548
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,980
Isn't it good? Isn't it good? Isn't it good?

549
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,480
Isn't it good? Isn't it good? Isn't it good?

550
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,740
I didn't know Japan was like this!

551
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,560
No, it's a big deal.

552
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,900
It might have been a mistake to leave the country.

553
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,320
No, it's the right answer!

554
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,900
Isn't it good? Isn't it good? Isn't it good?

555
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,180
We're almost there! We're going to return everyone to heaven!

556
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,900
Wait for me!

557
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,740
30 seconds is enough!

558
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,080
Let me say goodbye to Grandpa!

559
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,460
Okay, hurry up!

560
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,440
Thank you!

561
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,100
Grandpa, it's time to say goodbye!

562
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,760
Oh, is it time already?

563
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,280
Grandpa, thanks to you, I was able to offer a fun obon!

564
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,140
Bring back the obon next year!

565
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,600
I've prepared a lot of drinks!

566
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,560
The time is now!

567
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:59,620
Grandpa, see you!

568
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,260
"A reunion of Belasque and Ryo Sakamoto"

569
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,220
"amas who have lived in the era of The Deceased since the end of the World War 30"

570
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,860
"The oligarchs of the old period have gathered their hearts and minds"

571
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,640
"Due to the occasional festival outburst"

572
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,080
"A path of panic by the lawn"

573
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,940
What? No

574
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,040
Mummy!

575
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,180
You don't have money?

576
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,780
That's not what you promised!

577
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,840
I promised!

578
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,440
I'm fixing the venue and I'm working day and night!

579
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,640
I want to get the repair fee!

580
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,080
Yesterday, you said you met the real Katsu Kaishu and Sakamoto Ryoma!

581
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,960
You were so happy!

582
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,540
It can't be real!

583
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,160
Ugh!

584
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,120
That's why you're so stubborn, you're a bad student!

585
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,880
Damn it!

586
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,920
Senpai, did you have anything to do with this?

587
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,600
Really, Ryo-chan?

588
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,000
N-no, it's nothing at all!

589
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,920
Nothing at all, huh?

590
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,120
Looks like my habit has changed.

591
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,380
That's right.

592
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,060
You're back again!

593
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,760
What?!

594
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,860
I said I'd be back next year!

595
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,280
Yes, welcome!

596
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,840
Yes, welcome!

597
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,740
Yes, welcome!

598
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,080
Please!

599
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,640
Yes, welcome!

600
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,480
Yes, welcome!

601
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:15,800
Please!

602
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,340
Yes, welcome!

603
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,240
Yes, welcome!

604
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,180
Oh, you, you, you, you!

605
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,120
Sorry, could you do it?

606
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,680
Well, I've got to get my jacket wrapped up,

607
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,420
my salad wrapped up,

608
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,340
my everything wrapped up,

609
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,120
what should I do?

610
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,660
Ah, that's right.

611
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,400
Do you have California Maki?

612
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,740
Uh-huh.

613
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
There's no California Maki!

614
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,200
This isn't America!

615
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,180
I'm sorry!

616
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,320
Oh, no!

617
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,460
Um, excuse me.

618
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,820
Welcome.

619
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,420
So, Kushiage, Kakiage, Katsuage, whatever, Ageage, what was it?

620
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,000
My recommendation is...

621
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,580
Just be careful with Katsuage.

622
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,420
Huh? Is that a gag from your dad?

623
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,080
Yes, I'm sorry.

624
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,880
I don't get it.

625
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,300
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

626
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,860
Seriously?

627
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,540
Yes, welcome.

628
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,240
Please come in.

629
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,080
Yes, welcome.

630
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,000
Please come in.

631
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,120
Yes, welcome.

632
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,740
Please come in.

633
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,720
Yes, welcome.

634
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,840
Please come in.

635
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,520
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

636
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,240
I know some people think our dorm is hot,

637
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,580
but it's a mirror building right in front of me.

638
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,380
Shit.

639
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,740
I have to do something about this heat

640
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,480
I will be a firefly before the end of summer

641
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,740
Next time, blow the fire away

642
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,260
Thank you

643
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,880
There is a turtle over there

644
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,640
There must be a turtle

645
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,800
Everyone come to our town

646
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,840
Thank you
