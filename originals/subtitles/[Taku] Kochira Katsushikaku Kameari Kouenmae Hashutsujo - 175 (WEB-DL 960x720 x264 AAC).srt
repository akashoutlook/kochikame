After all, it was impossible for us to feel it.

Don't say that now.

00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,040
Reiko-san!

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,120
That's right. How about selling homemade cakes and cookies?

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,500
If we cooperate together, we can make it in time.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,580
I'll pay for the ingredients.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,900
Reiko is good at that.

00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,720
She's good at that.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,720
She's so noisy that she's sleeping.

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,120
You're bad, Yaban-chin.

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,980
You're here again, you salary thief.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,340
That's my line.

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,240
Ryo-chan, please cooperate.

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,560
Cooperate?

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,520
With them?

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,620
I don't like it.

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,680
With us?

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,040
That's right. Who's cooperating with you?

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,640
Well, you two.

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,820
Komachi-chan and the others are in trouble because the ingredients for tomorrow's bazaar are not collected.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,600

36
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,500
An announcement from Charity Bazaar.

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,240
This is the first time I see something like this.

38
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,160
This poster has been posted a month ago.

39
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,120
Po-po-po-poster!

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,480
This is it!

41
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,080
Ha!

42
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,760
Ha! This is such a poor handwriting!

43
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,100
What is it?

44
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,460
It hurts!

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,040
What is this?

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,760
So lame!

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,280
Bad sense!

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,220
Of course, this won't make the food gather.

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,100
Komachi Kiss!

50
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,260
Reiko!

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,600
Please do something about him!

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,340
The worst! The worst!

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,180
I'm super angry!

54
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,620
It hurts!

55
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,840
Ryo-chan, Kei-chan and I also cooperated.

56
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,860
Ryo-chan has a lot of toys that he doesn't need.

57
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,260
What?

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,080
I'm not kidding!

59
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,260
This is my precious treasure!

60
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,320
There's nothing I don't need!

61
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,160
I make a lot of money by doing buzzers.

62
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,660
You're stupid!

63
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,540
This is a charity buzzer!

64
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,380
You donate all your profits!

65
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,620
Donation?

66
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,400
Why can't I do that?

67
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,860
Egoist!

68
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,060
The worst man!

69
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,460
What?

70
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,960
This fatherless combination!

71
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,740
Ehh...

72
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,600
Man!

73
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,840
Well, well, Ryo-chan.

74
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,100
This buzzer is to help the old people in the town.

75
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,680
When I'm suffering from a bad stomach,

76
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,360
nobody gives me a penny.

77
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,620
What's the point?

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,500
Don't worry, Reiko-san.

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,440
No one buys such things.

80
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,420
You don't have to help me.

81
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,760
Huh?

82
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't be silly!

83
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,380
My collection is limited-time premium goods that fans will drool over.

84
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,700
There are hundreds of thousands of them here.

85
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,100
There's pictures, some of that kind.

86
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,180
They'll be filled with figures and limited-timeramas.

87
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,780
Hey, we don't need any of your wasteful cooperation.

88
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,200
Can you please follow my lead?

89
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,720
Don't come to the bar tomorrow.

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,700
We can't before us.

91
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,900
W-W-What?!

92
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,580
Tch.

93
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,920
I get it now, Ryotsu Kankichi!

94
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,220
gegeben

95
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,880
Shut up!

96
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,140
Our orders are a no-no!

97
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,600
Onee-chan, is it really okay for us to sell these?

98
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,000
What are you...

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,820
We bought everything for this special occasion.

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,720
As expected of you, Senpai!

101
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,660
To help the local residents,

102
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,660
please help the charity bazaar.

103
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,140
Welcome!

104
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,020
We have a lot of things!

105
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,760
Please take a look!

106
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,720
What is it?

107
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,140
As I thought.

108
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,000
What is it?

109
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,600
It's a small bazaar, but it's full of things.

110
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,680
Please take a look!

111
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,180
We sell rare and expensive goods at a very low price.

112
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,520
This is the bazaar of the bazaar, Ryo-chan.

113
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,420
How is it?

114
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,860
Mister!

115
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,100
Mister!

116
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,080
How much is this?

117
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,620
It's a limited edition.

118
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,320
8,000 yen.

119
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:55,920
What?

120
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,880
8,000 yen?

121
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,240
Hey!

122
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,680
8,000 yen is cheap!

123
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,520
How much is this?

124
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,520
It's 500,000 yen.

125
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,460
If you miss this, you'll never be able to buy it again.

126
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,240
That's right!

127
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,600
It's a big deal!

128
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,520
It's really a great deal!

129
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,900
Senpai, it's a little too expensive.

130
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,240
Don't be silly!

131
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,480
It's a free gift.

132
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,980
And it's very expensive.

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,620
Welcome.

134
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,560
How are the platters?

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,760
The soap set is cheap.

136
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,820
And the towel set.

137
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,280
The seaweed and bonito are also good.

138
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,700
They don't sell at all.

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,080
Don't you think you have plenty of time?

140
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,540
Ryo-chan, Kichi!

141
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,340
What are you doing here? I told you not to come!

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,920
All these things are just leftovers from the house.

143
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,560
All these things are just leftovers from the house.

144
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,560
All these things are just leftovers from the house.

145
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,640
All these things are just leftovers from the house.

146
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,140
No one will pay attention to such a trifle.

147
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,440
Shut up!

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,020
It can't be helped.

149
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,120
Everyone only donated this.

150
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,840
Naoko!

151
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,300
Well, after all, no one really helped you guys.

152
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,280
That means...

153
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,000
What?

154
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,660
You're saying that you're the one who collected the better things.

155
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,060
Of course.

156
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,980
You can say anything you want with your mouth.

157
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,360
Well, then let me show you my ability!

158
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,620
Let me see!

159
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,320
Gotcha!

160
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,120
You shouldn't be eating so easily!

161
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,100
What's going on?

162
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,720
What did you give to Buzzer?

163
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,540
A towel set.

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,280
A towel? What did you say?

165
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,940
A towel set.

166
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, a towel set.

167
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,800
Honda!

168
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,100
You did give him an F40, didn't you?

169
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,780
What?

170
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,340
Y-Yes, I did.

171
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,200
A Ferrari F40...

172
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,300
50 million is ridiculous.

173
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,900
And you're young, Nakagawa.

174
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,180
What did you give him?

175
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,000
A towel set.

176
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,100
Naoko donated 50 bags of branded products, didn't you?

177
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,360
I guess you're right.

178
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,420
What did you give him?

179
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,360
A towel set.

180
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,020
What did you give him at the Buzzer in Kameido?

181
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,100
Well, well...

182
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,160
It was a million yen worth of home appliances.

183
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,920
Yes, a million yen worth of home appliances.

184
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,780
What did you give him?

185
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,720
He gave me a towel.

186
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,800
Oh, really?

187
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:42,900
What?

188
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,060
A towel set.

189
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,880
What did you give him?

190
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,120
A towel set.

191
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,200
That's a lot of money.

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,700
But you should have given him a fullgomery.

193
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:56,980
That's the right thing to do.

194
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,020
Oh, that's too much money.

195
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,700
I have to give him a towel set.

196
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:00,980
And he said I shouldn't give him one.

197
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,360
The first我們 expensive item in Japan,

198
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,480
you should give me a towel set!

199
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,900
Stop it. I finally got a bonus.

200
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,460
I think there's a high-class cognac here.

201
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,320
What's wrong with that?

202
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,280
Don't hide the goods from the guests.

203
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,240
Let's spit it all out at this time.

204
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,460
Let's also take this gold pie.

205
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,180
This is a high price because it's a muku.

206
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,180
It's a high price.

207
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,660
I think this will make you a good man.

208
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,740
Thank you for your cooperation.

209
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,160
Devil.

210
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,020
What did you get?

211
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,320
A pair of soaps.

212
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,240
A pair of soaps.

213
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Is that a problem?

214
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,880
Honda.

215
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,000
You donated a Rolex watch, didn't you?

216
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,460
Yes.

217
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,820
I also gave you a bonus and gold pie.

218
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,800
You're a big man.

219
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,140
By the way, what did you ask for?

220
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,620
I was thinking about it.

221
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,120
Please give me that.

222
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,500
There's a comfortable golf set.

223
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,540
Wait a minute.

224
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,680
I can't do this.

225
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,940
Can I bring you something like this today?

226
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,100
Can I?

227
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,520
That's...

228
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,120
I'm on duty.

229
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,880
Who did you tell me I saw the mayor on a job?

230
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,940
What if the mayor hears us?

231
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,960
Thank you for your cooperation.

232
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,600
Thank you.

233
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,700
Even though I haven't used it yet.

234
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,520
I'm very grateful for your cooperation.

235
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:53,600
Please forgive me.

236
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,680
Please forgive me!

237
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,220
It's my fault!

238
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,060
My fault!

239
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,920
I still have to pay the loan!

240
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,260
Onii!

241
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,720
You're really a senior.

242
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,000
If you do this, you'll make a lot of money.

243
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,120
I'll show you my real buzzer!

244
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,300
Come on, come on, have a look.

245
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,580
This is the department store on the corner.

246
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,720
Akagiya-san, Shirakiyasan, Kurokiya-san.

247
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,440
I'll give it to the lady with the beanie.

248
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,320
500,000 yen is a good deal.

249
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,500
That's a charity buzzer today.

250
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,780
I'll give you that much.

251
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,640
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,200
Oh, Rolex.

253
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,000
How much is this?

254
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,320
It's 10,000 yen.

255
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,680
10,000 yen?

256
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,720
Is it real?

257
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,120
You can't sell fake things in the police.

258
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,360
Here's 10,000 yen.

259
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,960
Thank you.

260
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,820
What's this fishing rod?

261
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,080
What's in here?

262
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,280
This is 10,000 yen.

263
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,900
Really?

264
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,480
Really.

265
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,780
I won!

266
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,460
I sold it!

267
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,560
Me too!

268
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:56,960
Me too!

269
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,520
Me too!

270
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,180
What's this?

271
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,840
Me too!

272
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,540
Here you go, darling.

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,640
Thank you.

274
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,000
Here's 10,000 yen.

275
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,180
That's easy.

276
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,720
That's right.

277
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,580
Please push the button.

278
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,760
I still have some food.

279
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,520
Thank you.

280
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,140
Here you go.

281
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,220
I'm hungry.

282
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,640
And this is a present for you, вып

283
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,300
Thank you!

284
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,540
Cheers!

285
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,660
Thank you.

286
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,000
Is this really 10,000 yen?

287
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,400
Yes.

288
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,460
It's free, so it's a foundry.

289
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,780
I'll take this.

290
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,040
I'll take this.

291
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,020
Please do.

292
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,940
What's the matter?

293
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,900
There are so many plant goods.

294
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,460
The traffic traffic 20's got it from their boyfriend.

295
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,540
I got it from a friend.

296
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,620
That's right!

297
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,540
This is something that's not opened.

298
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,140
How do you know what's inside?

299
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,980
Because I have the same thing.

300
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,780
You'll know when you get a lot.

301
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,580
Be the man who sent it.

302
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,660
Because I don't need it.

303
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,600
Hey!

304
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,620
I don't feel like I'm a man to you.

305
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,800
You're a loser.

306
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,020
You're in the way of a non-popular person.

307
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,440
Go over there.

308
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,500
What?

309
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:10,880
What?

310
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,560
This is the power of public transport.

311
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,860
No way!

312
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,760
A woman from Katsushika is popular.

313
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,860
What are you doing, Honda?

314
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,900
What's wrong with the store?

315
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,300
That's...

316
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,920
There's no more stuff to sell.

317
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,480
How much is the sales?

318
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,000
Well, well...

319
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,340
About 250,000 yen.

320
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,840
All right.

321
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,720
Shine your 알

322
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,020
Shine your 알

323
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,480
Shine your 알

324
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:01,720
Shine your 알

325
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,600
Shine your 알

326
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,080
Shine your 알

327
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,480
Shine your 알

328
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,800
Shine your 알

329
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:06,900
Shine

330
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,240
Shine your 알

331
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,020
Shine your 알

332
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,100
Shine your 알

333
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,120
Hello, poor people. Long time no see.

334
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,240
There you are!

335
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,720
That's...

336
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,620
Shiratori Reiji!

337
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,200
Come on! Get out of here!

338
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,440
Ah! Oh no!

339
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,880
Oh, I got caught again.

340
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,060
Hello, super poor Ryo-tsu.

341
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,560
Please turn my Porsche into a parking lot.

342
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,600
I'm not a parking lot driver!

343
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:41,700
Huh?

344
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,360
Reiko, thank you for inviting me today.

345
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,180
Huh?

346
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,240
You're a charity buzzer, aren't you?

347
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,020
If you tell me, I'll help as much as I want.

348
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,580
I-I see. Then I'll help you.

349
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,120
Please tell me as much as you want.

350
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,700
Um, the card is a little...

351
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,900
What? You can't use it?

352
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,280
You're as stupid as ever.

353
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,300
I hate waiting for you!

354
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,540
Oh!

355
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,760
By the way, Reiko.

356
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,180
I made a

357
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,420
If you want to help so much, why don't you do it?

358
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,620
It's almost sold out.

359
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,020
It's almost sold out.

360
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,440
It's almost sold out.

361
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,020
It's almost sold out.

362
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,080
It's almost sold out.

363
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,380
I just want to help a charity.

364
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:29,700
I just want to help a charity.

365
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,860
It's 3,000 yen, though.

366
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's 3,000 yen, right?

367
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,800
It's 3,000 yen, though.

368
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,500
Uh, hey, it's not the money for toys.

369
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:35,960
It's 3,000 yen, though.

370
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,180
If you come to my company later, I'll exchange it for cash.

371
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,240
It's 3,000 yen, though.

372
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,820
Cute Cinderella.

373
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,180
What's this?

374
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,700
Lend it to me. Lend it to me.

375
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,760
I want it so much, I'll give it to you.

376
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:47,820
I want it so much, I'll give it to you.

377
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:47,940
I want it so much, I'll give it to you.

378
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,200
Please!

379
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,440
Look!

380
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,220
Huh?

381
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:54,560
Huh?

382
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,940
I have 28 years!

383
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,060
Huh?

384
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,300
Well, then this is the key.

385
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,660
Now you're the owner.

386
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

387
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,480
This is my Porsche!

388
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,120
Unfortunately, the ownership of this car is now 300,000 yen, and it's transferred to him.

389
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,560
Don't mess with me!

390
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,440
Hurry up now!

391
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,560
Hey, look!

392
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,420
My Porsche...

393
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,680
I'll go get the high-heeled belt later.

394
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,540
Damn it!

395
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,200
You're starting again!

396
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,040
In that case, I'll have you help me out.

397
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,060
Aromani's suit!

398
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,000
Purnari's watch!

399
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,760
Miragamo's shoes!

400
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,180
All of them are 100,000 yen!

401
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,280
Thank you for the purchase!

402
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:49,940
Mama!

403
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,060
Now we're 100,000 yen up!

404
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,920
Hehehehehe...

405
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,080
Welcome!

406
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,120
Huh?

407
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,880
How about a homemade cake?

408
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,900
Ow!

409
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,820
It's a mini-pato-shaped cake!

410
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,900
Please buy a cake!

411
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,960
Wow!

412
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
It's so pretty!

413
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,320
So pretty!

414
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,540
Now, you're here, but...

415
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,040
Sorry.

416
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,600
Sorry.

417
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:26,680
Sorry, but this is funny.

418
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,600
Oh, it's no big deal...

419
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,700
Yay!

420
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,080
He win!

421
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,060
Kei's live Sachio suit!

422
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,140
which is super hot!!

423
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,420
I wonder how it feels, the fresh beacon of sweat and fumes!

424
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,020
That's a real thing?

425
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,160
It's not a costume or something!

426
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,820
Look closely!

427
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,780
There's a name tag!

428
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,560
It's all in here, right?

429
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,980
That's our uniform!

430
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,220
Wait! What are we going to do with our uniforms?

431
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,760
Let's go home!

432
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,920
Thank you for the gift!

433
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,080
Thank you for your cooperation.

434
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,020
That criminal!

435
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,940
I'm going to be a fool this time.

436
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:18,800
Chief!

437
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,700
I'm going to be a fool this time.

438
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,260
I'm going to be a fool this time.

439
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:20,540
You idiot!

440
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,360
Go get it!

441
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,160
Yes!

442
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,600
I'll cool your head down!

443
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,680
Nice try!

444
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,060
Don't think we're done with this game.

445
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,120
Are you still going to do it?

446
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,740
Today, we're going to introduce you to a wonderful product.

447
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,940
Here it is.

448
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,480
This is a gotaku with no perforations.

449
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,460
This is a gotaku with no perforations.

450
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,280
What is this?

451
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,960
This is a gotaku that Decaplio used in the Titanic movie.

452
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,380
This is a gotaku that Decaplio used in the Titanic movie.

453
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,600
This is a gotaku that Decaplio used in the Titanic movie.

454
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,260
What?

455
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,620
Is it that amazing?

456
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,640
It's a lot more expensive than you think.

457
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,660
How much is it?

458
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,460
It's 4,800 yen.

459
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,220
What?

460
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,700
It's 4,800 yen.

461
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,320
This is cheap!

462
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,380
I brought it from my senior's room.

463
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,320
I brought it from my senior's room.

464
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,580
What is he going to do next?

465
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:15,900
What is he going to do next?

466
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,640
Next up is this seat belt.

467
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,580
This is a gift from a monkey-hungry actor.

468
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,700
Now you can wear a huge-hungry belt.

469
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,300
I'm wearing a belt today, too.

470
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,000
That cheater!

471
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,080
Let's just leave him be.

472
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,560
I don't want to lose to a guy like him!

473
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,380
You're going to help me?

474
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,660
Of course I will.

475
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,840
Say anything.

476
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,220
Actually...

477
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,640
Actually...

478
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:39,720
Actually...

479
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,580
Actually...

480
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,460
Actually...

481
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:47,600
Actually...

482
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,340
There's something I got for my birthday.

483
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,720
How much are you going to sell it for?

484
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,840
Ummm...

485
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,140
3,000,000 yen.

486
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,160
What!?

487
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,420
Isn't it too expensive?

488
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,840
I wonder if so.

489
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,620
How about 1,000,000 yen then?

490
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,120
Oh, my.

491
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,100
What?

492
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,000
8 million!

493
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,960
You only have 8 million yen.

494
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,640
Don't you have any other money?

495
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,420
8 million!

496
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,300
You and Reiko are very close.

497
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,280
8 million!

498
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,240
8 million!

499
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,580
8 million!

500
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,740
There's not much left to sell.

501
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,240
There's more!

502
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,900
A Japanese-style room, a Western-style room, a kitchen, and a toilet.

503
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,520
It's all for one person.

504
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
It's a real bargain.

505
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,800
It's true that 25 million yen is cheap.

506
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,300
Please sell it.

507
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,800
Me too!

508
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,060
I don't know.

509
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,980
Now it's 3 million yen.

510
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,440
This is a property that used to be a police station, so it's very sturdy.

511
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,120
How about a helicopter?

512
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,460
It used to be a police station, so the bathroom and the dining room are big.

513
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,080
I sold it!

514
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,980
Sold it!

515
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,980
He's so persistent.

516
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,740
I think we can just split it.

517
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,820
That's right. There's nothing left to sell.

518
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,560
I definitely don't want to!

519
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,300
Hey.

520
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,120
I'm not going anywhere.

521
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,900
Senpai!

522
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,380
This is the last game.

523
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,320
I'm looking forward to it!

524
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,900
So, how do we play?

525
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,780
Baseball.

526
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,160
Baseball?

527
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,100
It's not just a baseball.

528
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,180
The one who loses the rock-paper-scissors buys the other person's clothes.

529
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,740
This will be the final.

530
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,980
That's great.

531
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,920
But if you want to play, I'll go with you.

532
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,260
I'm looking forward to it!

533
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,620
Then, let's play baseball!

534
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:42,940
Let's start the game!

535
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,940
Okay, let's get started!

536
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,000
Baseball!

537
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:50,960
If you want to play baseball,

538
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,360
you have to have a chance like this.

539
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,500
What's that?

540
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,080
Safe!

541
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,620
A good night's sleep!

542
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,700
I won!

543
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,500
You lost!

544
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,460
You won.

545
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,500
The one who won will pay, right?

546
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,420
I see.

547
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,440
Yes, 10,000 yen.

548
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:08,900
Oh!

549
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,260
I'll beat you.

550
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,940
The buzzer boos!

551
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,420
What's going on?

552
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,160
What's with that?

553
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:17,860
I don't know.

554
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,620
I won!

555
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,320
I lost!

556
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,140
Yes, 10,000 yen!

557
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,940
Now it's the final!

558
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,280
Alright!

559
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,960
If you want to play baseball,

560
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,640
you can get a blind shot like this.

561
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,740
And the winner is...

562
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,740
YAYAYA!

563
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,120
The winner is...

564
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,200
YAYA!

565
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,160
He did it!

566
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,600
Take that!

567
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,260
Take that!

568
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,100
Take that!

569
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,040
Take that!

570
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,060
Take that!

571
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,820
Here's 10,000 yen.

572
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,820
Can you take it out now, Komachi?

573
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,660
If you don't follow the rules, I'm going to win!

574
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,920
I'm taking it out!

575
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,920
You can take it out.

576
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,740
Komachi...

577
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,380
Wait!

578
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,400
Not just the

579
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,560
"Kokannomokkori"

580
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,020
Special Detective Kaipande

581
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,460
is here!

582
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,460
You!

583
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,260
I understand the situation.

584
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm here, so it's all good.

585
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,860
Let's go!

586
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,800
Let's go!

587
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,160
Seishi!

588
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,880
I'll sew your skin instead of Lady's.

589
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,040
No way!

590
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,300
What?

591
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,820
What?

592
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,280
What?

593
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,060
I don't want to!

594
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,340
You can't help it!

595
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,840
In the end, the game didn't work out.

596
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,760
The buzzer earned 200 million yen,

597
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,500
and the old people went on a boat trip around the world.

598
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,060
They went on a luxurious trip to Myanmar.

599
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,320
And...

600
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,420
Shizu, I can find you.

601
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,200
See, you.

602
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,920
Come here, Kaipande.

603
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,740
Get me married.

604
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,900
You don't have a wife, do you?

605
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,760
Oh, you!

606
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,520
Qualifies with the yerba?

607
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,620
Yeah.

608
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:26,920
it's the going of the report.

609
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,220
Yes, sir, sir!

610
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,940
No, no, no, no, no!

611
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,700
I don't want to comin' here.

612
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:34,780
I don't like this!

613
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,880
Mr. Saiki, how are you going to take responsibility?

614
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,240
Don't worry, President.

615
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,400
Next, if we hold the "Katsushika Shoin Salvation Charity Bazaar",

616
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,160
200 million or 300 million will be gathered immediately.

617
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,300
I'll pay for it, so don't worry.

618
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,960
And the revenue will be a lot.

619
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,280
Idiot!

620
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,620
Someone please save me!

621
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,240
"Katsushika Shoin Salvation Charity Bazaar"

622
00:24:35,080 --> 00:25:04,560
"Katsushika Shoin Salvation Charity Bazaar"

623
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,300
"Katsushika Shoin Salvation Charity Bazaar"

624
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,100
"Katsushika Shoin Salvation Charity Bazaar"

625
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:16,340
"Katsushika Shoin Salvation Charity Bazaar"

626
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,880
The Olympics are almost here!

627
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,600
It's about time for me to wake up!

628
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,020
I used all the money I had from the sun!

629
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,480
Wait! If I use the super powers of the sun,

630
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,160
I'll have a huge profit after I pay back the money!

631
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm smart!

632
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,000
Next time on "Toumin Keikan Futatabi"!

633
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,840
Thanks for watching!
