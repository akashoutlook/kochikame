1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,140
I look at the sunset that floats on the river

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,340
and fly to the corner of Koishi

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,480
I kicked the stone and flew to the corner

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,720
and asked the head of the taiko who was jogging

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,280
"It's still as it is"

7
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,620
He laughed at me

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,360
I'm fine somewhere

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,300
Even if I get lost, I have money

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,240
I'm not angry

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,180
The cityscape is mild

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,420
The crows are crying

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,520
The sound of the ponzu is dull

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,160
Yeah!

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:50,800
I'm alone

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,320
Can you see it?

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,980
From the tapestry of a striped hat

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,620
to the taishakuten

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,900
The sunset falls

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,860
Tomorrow will end soon

21
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,760
I lost my happiness again

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,060
I'm an idiot who noticed

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,680
Yeah!

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,260
Finally, the taught me

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,720
A handsome boy

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:26,780
I got a job

27
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,280
Huuu

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,760
Huh?

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,020
Well, what a good day

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,880
Why don't you get a job on this day?

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,600
Eee

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,300
Yeah!

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,200
Too early for work, Ryou

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,620
Chief

35
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,200
Chief is early for work

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,440
What time do you think it is now?

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,840
What?

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,560
I told you to go to work on time yesterday and the day before yesterday.

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,740
No, no, why?

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,180
Why is this happening?

41
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,020
Is it because of what I do every day?

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,500
Or is it because of the wrong training I have for the chief?

43
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,240
You idiot!

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,180
Goodbye, Mr. Ryo.

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,280
The Great Strategy

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,880
How many times do I have to be late to get home?

47
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,940
If you don't have the guts to work seriously, quit your job.

48
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,860
No way.

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,140
When I think of someone like you as my subordinate, I cry out of pity.

50
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,260
You don't cry.

51
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,780
I'm just a role model.

52
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,200
Enough. Get to work now.

53
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,060
Yes.

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,160
You're so noisy every day.

55
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,420
Hey, senpai.

56
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,040
What?

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,580
That's my seat.

58
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,540
What?

59
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,200
Senpai's seat is over there.

60
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:46,860
What?

61
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,220
I had to move it.

62
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,740
What?

63
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,140
What's going on?

64
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,920
The chief said that a person who doesn't work doesn't need a desk.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,120
Are you having a problem, Ryo?

66
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,500
No.

67
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,460
Let's get to work.

68
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,020
Let's get to work.

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,400
Let's get to work.

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,340
Hey, Reiko!

71
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,820
What?

72
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,000
What?

73
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,640
I'm working right now.

74
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,880
Don't get in the way of my work.

75
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,940
What do you mean, "working right now"?

76
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,760
You were just scribbling.

77
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,580
What?

78
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,320
Now, get out of my way.

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,140
Get out of my way.

80
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,120
I'm home.

81
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,420
I finally got to buy the famous triangle-shaped taiyaki.

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,100
Oh.

83
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,200
You did a good job.

84
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,380
I lined up a lot.

85
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,740
Here, chief.

86
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,640
Oh, sorry.

87
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,600
Reiko, too.

88
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,300
Thank you.

89
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,540
Thank you.

90
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,180
Here, Nakagawa.

91
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,420
I'm sorry.

92
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,340
This is my...

93
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,240
Oh, my.

94
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,820
It's mine.

95
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,520
Why don't I have my own taiyaki?

96
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,840
I'm sorry, Ryo.

97
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,420
I forgot.

98
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,580
How dare you take advantage of me!

99
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,260
Stop it, you idiot.

100
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm talking about taiyaki.

101
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,960
I don't care, Ryo.

102
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,860
I'm talking about taiyaki.

103
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:14,920
It's fine since everyone's eating.

104
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,740
But I'm the only one who's not eating.

105
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,440
What a child.

106
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,640
No way.

107
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,720
Can you eat before you go to work?

108
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,020
You don't have to make taiyaki for someone like that.

109
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,280
That's a little too much.

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,260
Even if you take care of me a little longer...

111
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,900
Shut up.

112
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,480
I'm telling you, "If you can't do your job,

113
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,420
you're making troubles every time."

114
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,040
Why can't you take care of him?

115
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,760
But you've gone.

116
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,400
If I'm gone, no one will be in trouble!

117
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,800
No, I mean, it's better for me to be safe in this escape room!

118
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,780
Do you understand, you big idiot?!

119
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,980
What kind of people are they?

120
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Hey, Ryōki Kanjichi!

121
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,740
Don't get in my way!

122
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,840
Get off the bridge!

123
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,440
I'm free to go anywhere I want!

124
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,780
What kind of people are they?

125
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,080
They're like people wearing clothes in a funeral!

126
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,460
Have a look!

127
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,400
You're so annoying!

128
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:18,840
You're so annoying!

129
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:18,980
You're so annoying!

130
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,060
Go away!

131
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,020
Go away!

132
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,120
You're so annoying!

133
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,920
I'll teach you a lesson!

134
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,820
We're the Shoten Gai Alliance.

135
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,060
We're the Shoten Gai Alliance.

136
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,120
We have decided not to sell anything for the last ceremony.

137
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,540
We have decided not to sell anything for the last ceremony.

138
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:45,960
What?

139
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,720
Everyone is in trouble because the sales have dropped.

140
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,200
I can't stand it if they bring the products they usually sell.

141
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,160
I can't stand it if they bring the products they usually sell.

142
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,760
I haven't sold anything yet!

143
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,500
I haven't sold anything yet!

144
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,240
Anyway, unless you pay all the money you've been paid,

145
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,440
I won't sell anything.

146
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,460
I won't sell anything.

147
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:00,660
No way!

148
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,800
I'm back!

149
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,340
I'm back!

150
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,160
Damn, they're too much!

151
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:07,700
Damn, they're too much!

152
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,300
Hey, Honda!

153
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,580
Hey, Honda!

154
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,480
What's wrong?

155
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,260
Mr. Haruna!

156
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,880
What's your problem?

157
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,080
What's your problem?

158
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,720
Damn it, Honda!

159
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,780
Damn it, Honda!

160
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,420
You stupid dog!

161
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,160
You stupid dog!

162
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,620
Damn it!

163
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,000
Damn it!

164
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
You made fun of me!

165
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,800
You made fun of me!

166
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,260
Damn it!

167
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,380
Shelima!

168
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:43,580
Form now and then!

169
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,140
Damn it, I'm stupid!

170
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,660
Damn it, I'm stupid!

171
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,760
I'm stupid!

172
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,240
Damn it!

173
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,920
I'm stupid!

174
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,300
I'm a stupid dog!

175
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,820
Damn it!

176
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,260
I'm a stupid dog!

177
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,720
Damn it!

178
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Damn it!

179
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,840
Damn it!

180
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,600
*sigh*

181
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,380
*sniff sniff*

182
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,580
Ouch!

183
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,700
What's wrong, Senpai? You suddenly became serious.

184
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,940
I wonder if you've been able to handle what happened yesterday.

185
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,860
Is it because I forgot to buy the taiyaki?

186
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,480
Hmph. It won't last for three days anyway.

187
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,960
Here it is.

188
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,160
All the money you've been paying?

189
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,540
Yeah. I just thought it would be enough for the plastic shop.

190
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,200
Check it out.

191
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,820
Oh, that's true.

192
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,660
Everyone else, please wait a little longer.

193
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,240
I'll pay for the next payday.

194
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,100
I'm really sorry about that.

195
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,600
*sniff*

196
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,640
*sniff*

197
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,620
The patrol results are all good.

198
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,100
If you're a citizen, go straight down this road.

199
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,580
Eh?

200
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,620
Ryo-chan, this case-

201
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,340
Yeah, I did it.

202
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,220
Hey, I got a call.

203
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,760
Thank you.

204
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,560
You're still not going home?

205
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,200
I want to finish this report by today.

206
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,880
*sniff*

207
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,740
*sniff*

208
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,900
*sniff*

209
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,120
*sniff*

210
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,140
*sniff*

211
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,860
Where am I?

212
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,400
Madam!

213
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,720
I'm on patrol at Ryotsu Police Station.

214
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,140
*sniff*

215
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,520
*sniff*

216
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,920
*sniff*

217
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,200
It's been two weeks today.

218
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,200
I wonder what really happened.

219
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,520
Is it because I forgot to buy the taiyaki?

220
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,340
*sniff*

221
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,640
Senior, what really happened?

222
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,580
What?

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,540
It seems like the other people here are very serious,

224
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,540
Are you going to get sick?

225
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,640
No, no, that's not it. But what is it?

226
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,780
Well, I have a lot of things.

227
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,580
A lot of things.

228
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,680
A lot of things?

229
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,380
Senpai!

230
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,380
I bought some takoyaki, but you don't eat it!

231
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,020
Oh, you're Honda.

232
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,720
What's wrong? You're so clean.

233
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,960
It's like moving.

234
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,120
It's like moving.

235
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,020
It's weird that I clean my room.

236
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,280
No, no, that's not it.

237
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,800
Oh, yeah. Let's do this to Honda.

238
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,080
What? Isn't this your new shirt?

239
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,500
I told you I wanted it.

240
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,700
Is this really okay?

241
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,420
Yeah, I have to organize my luggage a little.

242
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't want to make a mess.

243
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
What is it?

244
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,800
No, no, it's nothing.

245
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,540
Ohara, I have a question.

246
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,140
Is it true that Ryotsu Kan-Kichi will quit this place?

247
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:45,940
What?

248
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,840
Is it true that Ohara asked you to take over Ryotsu?

249
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,080
I don't know! I don't know the rumor.

250
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,180
Then what's that all about?

251
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, there's that rumor going around in the book.

252
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,280
Even if that's what they say...

253
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,740
Here you are.

254
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,060
Excuse me.

255
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,940
Chief, the signs are gone.

256
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,420
I have something to tell you about Ryotsu.

257
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,180
Just in time.

258
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,620
I wanted to ask you something.

259
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,280
It's said that Ryotsu is leaving the Katsushika office.

260
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,220
What does that mean?

261
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,500
Oh, well, actually, I don't know either.

262
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,120
So I came to the director's office...

263
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,240
Hmm...

264
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,840
It seems that Ryotsu is working very hard here.

265
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,900
I wonder if it has something to do with it.

266
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,480
Well, what do you think?

267
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,540
Hmm...

268
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,260
Oh...

269
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,020
Yes, it's here.

270
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,400
Oh, Mr. Inspector!

271
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,020
Oh!

272
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

273
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,860
Oh, Ryotsu Kankichi.

274
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,380
Oh, yes.

275
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,840
Certainly, Ryotsu is working hard here.

276
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,120
What is that?

277
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,560
I order the transfer from the Katsushika office to the Ryotsu Kankichi Police Station.

278
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,380
Ryotsu is moving?

279
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,200
Oh!

280
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,860
What?

281
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,580
What?

282
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,220
Ryotsu is moving?

283
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,260
Oh, there was a phone call from the police officer.

284
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,580
It seems that it was decided about half a month ago.

285
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,940
It seems that the power and strength that the people of Ryotsu have lost has stopped in the eyes of the director.

286
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,740
Then maybe Mr. Ryotsu...

287
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,900
Oh, it seems that he was talking about it every day.

288
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,140
So...

289
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,700
Senpai was thinking about various things as a senpai.

290
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,080
But he didn't even keep it a secret from us.

291
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,040
Well, anyway, it's a good thing for the director.

292
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,580
Let's send it out with pleasure.

293
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,240
Yes.

294
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,620
I'm back from patrol.

295
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,180
Is there any problem?

296
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,880
Good job.

297
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,660
Yes.

298
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,800
Hmm.

299
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,300
Hmm?

300
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,160
What?

301
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,560
Oh, no, that's...

302
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,920
Senpai, good news for the director.

303
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,660
Congratulations on your return to the director.

304
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,160
Congratulations, Ryo-chan.

305
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,300
Congratulations, Ryo-san.

306
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,280
Congratulations, Ryo-tsu.

307
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,040
Oh, I see. I got it.

308
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,100
It's not like water. Why didn't you tell me?

309
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
Oh, it's hard to say.

310
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,100
I've always been a nuisance at this station and caused everyone trouble.

311
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,760
So when I heard that I was going to be gone, I thought that everyone might be happy.

312
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,200
I thought I wouldn't be happy.

313
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,820
But that's fine.

314
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,100
Originally, everyone was a seed that I planted.

315
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,600
Director Ohara, and everyone else.

316
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,380
It's only a few days before we can be at this Kameari Park.

317
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,860
Please take care of us until then.

318
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,140
Ryo-san, you're going to be gone from the Katsushika office.

319
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,400
I see.

320
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,440
Oh, but don't worry.

321
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,860
I'll pay the bills properly for everyone before I go.

322
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,860
Oh, it's okay, Ryo-san.

323
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,160
Huh?

324
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,180
I talked to everyone, but for the celebration of Ryo-san's return to the director,

325
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,800
I decided to make the debt small.

326
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,640
Huh?

327
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,500
I did a lot of work for Ryo-san, and he's probably the best at Kameari Shoten.

328
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,860
So please give me some money for moving in.

329
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,300
Oh, no. It doesn't have to be that much.

330
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,240
That's fine.

331
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,960
Now, take it.

332
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,260
Yes, sir.

333
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,760
But this and that is...

334
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,840
It's fine. It's fine.

335
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
Huh? Where's my desk?

336
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,880
Senpai, please use this.

337
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,520
Oh, is that okay?

338
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,320
Yes. The director gave me permission.

339
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,320
You're only a little while away from being in this Kameari Park.

340
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,200
Please clean up the rest of your work in that seat.

341
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,200
Thank you, Director Ohara.

342
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,420
I'll do my best to work hard.

343
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,200
Hm?

344
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:53,920
Hm?

345
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,000
Hmm, I guess this is a more comfortable seat.

346
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:56,960
Bye!

347
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,840
Ryo-san, I'm sorry about last time.

348
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,240
I bought some Taiyaki from "Sankakuya."

349
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,000
Huh?

350
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,120
If we get forced to leave without eating Taiyaki,

351
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,840
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

352
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,480
You're too much.

353
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,000
Now, Ryo-san, please try some.

354
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,140
I see.

355
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,540
Well, I'll try speaking my mind.

356
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,900
Mm-mm.

357
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,500
How is it?

358
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,060
Oh, it's very delicious. That's good.

359
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,720
Thank goodness!

360
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,960
Here.

361
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,380
Reiko.

362
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,660
Thank you, Reiko.

363
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,300
Reiko's tea is the best!

364
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,900
Ryotsu.

365
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,460
Yes.

366
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,000
Go to the head office and do your best.

367
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,620
Yes.

368
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,740
I've been strict with you since the beginning.

369
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,320
But this is for your own good.

370
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,380
I know.

371
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,440
I'm very happy.

372
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,500
I was able to work under a person like you.

373
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,140
It's thanks to you that I'm here now.

374
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,200
I'll never forget your kindness.

375
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,420
Hey, Ryotsu.

376
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,760
Don't say such things.

377
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,260
You're mean, Chief.

378
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,120
I'm not saying anything.

379
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,600
I think so from the bottom of my heart.

380
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,040
Well, fine.

381
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,940
Let's just leave it at that.

382
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,100
Yes.

383
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,720
Thank you.

384
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
But, Chief.

385
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,820
You really seem a little relieved.

386
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,880
You're not carrying anything like me.

387
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,460
Don't be silly.

388
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,600
I didn't mean to do that.

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,920
You don't have to force yourself, Chief.

390
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,580
If I'm gone, the depot will be peaceful.

391
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,480
Well, that's...

392
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,520
Oh, no.

393
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,700
I can't believe I'm moving.

394
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,160
I can't believe I'm moving.

395
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,440
But the voice of the police officer is very effective.

396
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,700
I just used the voice scrambler to talk, but I was deceived.

397
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,560
Who's going to disappear?

398
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,660
Let's enjoy this state for a while.

399
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,920
I'm going to have fun with this.

400
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,580
Well, I've been looking at Ryotsu lately.

401
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,480
What?

402
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,580
What's wrong with you, Chief?

403
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,260
I'm not sure.

404
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,920
I was just about to be a child by the way, but I suddenly became an adult.

405
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,640
And as I thought about raising this depot, I suddenly felt lonely.

406
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,260
We're the same, too, Chief.

407
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:45,420
We've been through a lot of bad things, but when I thought there was nothing to be teased about, I somehow...

408
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,820
Ryo-chan is really going to be gone, isn't he?

409
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,240
You mean he's gone?

410
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,880
I've always been involved in a lot of trouble, but now that I think about it, it seems like everyone had fun.

411
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,560
I thought it was normal for you to be in this dressing room.

412
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,720
I can't imagine a dressing room without you.

413
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,060
What are you crying about?

414
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,020
Yo, Komachi, Naoko.

415
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,940
What, you primitive?

416
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,560
What?

417
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,960
Nothing. I was bored.

418
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,520
Oh, a new blue light.

419
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,640
Which one?

420
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,280
The number one man I don't want to marry again?

421
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,520
This time, the Ryotsu-Kankichi Police Station will be moved to the main office.

422
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,180
Then, a souvenir from the Katsushika Library...

423
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,200
What is this?

424
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,820
It's nothing.

425
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,740
You guys...

426
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,800
What?

427
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,100
Even if you're not here...

428
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,000
Wait, what?

429
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,220
I'm not sad.

430
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,300
I'm not sad at all!

431
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,240
That's right.

432
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,360
Go to the main office or wherever you want to go.

433
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,260
You're... you're...

434
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,600
Damn, this is not funny.

435
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,460
This is like I'm a villain.

436
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,120
Huh?

437
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Are you going to drink?

438
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,460
Damn, that's too much.

439
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,300
I can't believe I'm suddenly gone.

440
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,400
Really.

441
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,820
I can't stop you somehow.

442
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,520
You idiot!

443
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,640
What are you talking about?

444
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,200
This is a good point for the main office.

445
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,000
If you think about Ryo's happiness,

446
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,740
it's right to let you go.

447
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,320
I know, but...

448
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,200
I just can't.

449
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:47,920
I can't do this anymore.

450
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,900
I don't have the bonus money to compensate for it.

451
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,640
I was looking forward to receiving this.

452
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,860
You guys...

453
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,340
Actually about Ryo's matter...

454
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,160
Everyone loves him...

455
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,940
Don't cry!

456
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,580
A grand man like you is disgusting!

457
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,680
Damn it.

458
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,880
How'm I gonna do it?

459
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,960
Again, give me your money!

460
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,320
Give me your money!

461
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:13,740
"Ryotsu's move is over"

462
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,580
"Ahh, this is not funny"

463
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,720
"This guy and that guy"

464
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,520
"Ryotsu's move is over"

465
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,060
"It can't be helped, it's about time to go to bed"

466
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,920
"Tomorrow, I'll tell the president that"

467
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,740
"Ryotsu's move is over"

468
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,680
"That's it, the plan is over"

469
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,300
"Ahh, this is not funny, damn it"

470
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,200
"I'm going to sleep"

471
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,140
"Before anything happens"

472
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,940
"Let's get this over with"

473
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,000
"Huh, what's going on?"

474
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,560
"W-What is this?"

475
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,980
"Oh, the main character of the day"

476
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,360
"It's the senior's farewell party"

477
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,060
"Everyone who is related to Ryo-chan has gathered"

478
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,120
"W-What?"

479
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,520
"Oh, I see"

480
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,300
"Oh no, it's already a big deal"

481
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,700
"This won't help the plan"

482
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,360
"What should I do?"

483
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,160
"Well, then, it's time to have"

484
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,820
"Ryotsu Kankichi-kun's farewell party"

485
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,860
"First, I'll send this message"

486
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,280
"to my colleague from the dispatch office"

487
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,760
"Nakagawa Keiichi Akimoto Reiko"

488
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,460
"Ryo-chan"

489
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,020
"Senpai"

490
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,600
"Congratulations on your return to the capital"

491
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,200
"Congratulations"

492
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,420
"Ugh, no"

493
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,940
"Actually, I had a dream this morning"

494
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,540
"Huh?"

495
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,100
"I had a dream that Ryo-chan's departure was a lie"

496
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,680
"W-What?"

497
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,080
"If it's true, how happy would I be?"

498
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,360
"No, no, actually, Reiko"

499
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,240
"But that's not the case, right?"

500
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,160
"I'm sure the farewell with Senpai was painful"

501
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,540
"and you had such a dream, right?"

502
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,940
"Ugh..."

503
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,100
"Next, greetings from the members of the shopping street association"

504
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,040
"Next, a gift from the two traffic officers"

505
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,080
"And a farewell song by the subordinate"

506
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,320
"And a farewell song by the subordinate"

507
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,220
"And a farewell song by the subordinate"

508
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,460
"And finally, from Daijirou Ohara, Ryo-chan's direct superior"

509
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,580
"a farewell speech"

510
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,360
"Ryo-chan, it's finally time to say goodbye to you"

511
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,580
"Captain"

512
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,660
"I've been thinking about you since the day we met"

513
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,260
"I've been thinking about you since the day we met"

514
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,900
"When you're gone, I feel lonely"

515
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,360
"But I have countless memories with you"

516
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,900
"So I'm fine"

517
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,020
"You should also do your duty... do your duty well"

518
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:43,800
"Ugh..."

519
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:44,760
"Ugh..."

520
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,700
"Ugh..."

521
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,680
"Ugh..."

522
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,780
"Well, Chief, actually..."

523
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,100
"So, I'd like to do my best to have a good time with Ryo and Kanki"

524
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,300
"Ryo and Kanki, good job!"

525
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,440
"Good luck!"

526
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,300
"Good luck!"

527
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,240
"Good luck!"

528
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:08,760
"Good luck!"

529
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,240
"Good luck!"

530
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,040
"Good luck!"

531
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
"Good luck!"

532
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,140
"Good luck!"

533
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:14,660
"Good luck!"

534
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,280
"Good luck!"

535
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:15,660
"Good luck!"

536
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,240
"Good luck!"

537
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:16,840
"Good luck!"

538
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,160
"Good luck!"

539
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:18,900
"Good luck!

540
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,060
"Good luck!

541
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,420
"Good luck!"

542
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,220
"Good luck!"

543
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,760
"Good luck!"

544
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,280
"Good luck!"

545
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,440
Mr. Ryokan!

546
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,140
Huh?

547
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,020
Ryo-tsu will take care of you this time.

548
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,520
I don't know about that.

549
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,360
But I called you the other day...

550
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,700
I didn't call you.

551
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,080
Ryo-tsu!

552
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,340
Ryo-tsu!

553
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,500
You found out?

554
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,760
I'm glad you found out.

555
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,480
I was thinking about what to do without getting caught.

556
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,720
And everyone,

557
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,280
and the Kameari who love me,

558
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,420
and everyone,

559
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,320
don't worry.

560
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,940
I'll be here forever!

561
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,760
Ryo-tsu Kan-kichi will never die!

562
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,960
Huh?

563
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,140
What's going on, everyone?

564
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,240
As you all hoped,

565
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,940
I can stay here forever, right?

566
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,380
I'm glad you're happy, too.

567
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,500
Ryo-tsu!

568
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,380
Ryo-tsu!

569
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,240
Ryo-tsu!

570
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,840
You rotten genius!

571
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,260
Ryo-tsu!

572
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,360
No!

573
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,860
Ryo-tsu!

574
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,320
Ryo-tsu!

575
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,380
Ryo-tsu!

576
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,480
Ryo-tsu!

577
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:36,540
I'm so happy!

578
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:36,660
I'm glad you came,

579
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,660
but I definitely need you here at least once.
