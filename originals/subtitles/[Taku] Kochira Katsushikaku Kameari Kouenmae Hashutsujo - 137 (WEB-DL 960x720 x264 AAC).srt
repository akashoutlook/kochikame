1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,960
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,060
Make sure the room is bright and look away

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,840
Hello, goodbye

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,920
Goodbye, goodbye

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,780
If you live just for the night

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,500
You'll be home soon

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,080
Don't panic

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,940
In this small town

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,040
Where are you going?

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,320
Hurry up and turn around

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,780
Maybe

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,720
You're a better person

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:54,780
Than me

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,640
If there's someone

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,860
If there's someone

17
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,420
If there's someone

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,420
Let me hear it

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,420
Let me hear it all night

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,140
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,720
Da, da, da, da, da, da

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,940
I don't hate waiting

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,700
Because I'm a woman on a camel's back

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,800
I don't want to lose

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,040
I'm a woman on a camel's back

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,840
I've loved you

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,080
I'm in love

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,180
I'm a woman on a camel's back

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:35,240
I'm a woman on a camel's back

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,900
It's no good!

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,860
There are three of them in the village!

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,520
Help!

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,120
Help me!

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,280
Help!

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,320
Help!

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,720
Help me!

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,040
Help me!

38
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,920
"The Greatest Shinkai SOS"

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:03,940
"The Greatest Shinkai SOS"

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:04,800
"The Greatest Shinkai SOS"

41
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,200
"The Greatest Shinkai SOS"

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,300
"The Greatest Shinkai SOS"

43
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,060
Hey, Ryotsu!

44
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,280
You ate shaved ice during work, didn't you?

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,260
No, not at all!

46
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,860
Then, show me your tongue.

47
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,100
Huh?

48
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,260
What?

49
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,300
Look. Your tongue is green.

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,740
What? You idiot!

51
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,120
Do your work seriously.

52
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,120
It hurts. I keep getting bad comments.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,220
Your tongue is too green.

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,380
Your tongue is too green.

55
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:30,980
What's wrong with you?

56
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,560
You ate shaved ice with three people just now!

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,720
Reiko,

58
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,680
show me your tongue.

59
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,780
What?

60
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,580
It's not colored.

61
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,080
We ate ice strawberries.

62
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,060
They're normal strawberries.

63
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,240
You're so dirty.

64
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,120
Ryo,

65
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,380
Why do you eat shaved ice every time?

66
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,320
Huh?

67
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,700
Ryo,

68
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,240
I'm poor since I was small.

69
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:58,900
I'm poor since I was small.

70
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,480
I'm poor since I was small.

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,120
I've been attracted to shaved ice since I was little.

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,740
I've been attracted to shaved ice since I was little.

73
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,220
Really?

74
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,360
Yes.

75
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,700
I've been spoiled by poverty.

76
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,660
When I ate shaved ice when I was young

77
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,480
I was the cheapest ice water expert.

78
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,140
What is ice water?

79
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,360
It's sugar syrup.

80
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,860
It's colorless.

81
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,380
Did they have such a thing?

82
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Sugar water is like a beetle.

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,960
It was a great era.

84
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,480
So I always ate ice melon.

85
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,920
This is all because of poverty.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,740
I wonder if there's any money in the bank.

87
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,940
What?

88
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,540
What?

89
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,560
A treasure worth 20 billion yen?

90
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,280
The Shuin Line that sank in the Edo period was full of gold.

91
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,920
It's been a long time since the place where the Ogasawara River sank.

92
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,840
It's a bit romantic.

93
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,740
It's like a 10,000-meter-long sea.

94
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,080
20 billion yen?

95
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,340
I'm a fast learner, but I can't do it in the 10,000-meter-long sea.

96
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,380
Well?

97
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,140
What's this?

98
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,640
Dear people.

99
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,860
The sea is beautiful.

100
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,020
Professor Ezaki?

101
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,940
Isn't it you?

102
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,380
I'm moving around on a railroad, and I don't want to be spotted.

103
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,660
Where is the sea in the Tentacles?

104
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,520
You need to know that the sea is the source of all life.

105
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,800
It's the source of life. Even if there is no sea in front of you, you can hear the sound of saltwater if you close your eyes.

106
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,900
The sea is the home of humanity.

107
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,580
Apparently, he did everything in the world and now he is in the sea.

108
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,720
That's right.

109
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,620
Oh, no. It's time for tea.

110
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,660
The man of the sea drinks only small tea.

111
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,400
Why does small tea belong to the man of the sea?

112
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:09,980
I don't know.

113
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,080
So I have a question for you, Gorilla.

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,120
How many percent of the total area of the Earth is the sea?

115
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,000
What does that look like and what does that question have to do with it?

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,080
Well, I think 70% of the Earth is the sea.

117
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,620
That's Nakagawa-kun!

118
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,200
To be precise, 70.8% is the sea.

119
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,160
2.42 times the land area is the sea.

120
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,320
So what?

121
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,240
So what?

122
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,440
What the hell are you talking about?

123
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,460
The man of the sea must understand the sea.

124
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,580
The flat seabed around the land area,

125
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,800
the part that suddenly falls into the deep sea from the coast to the ocean,

126
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,000
what do you call it?

127
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,220
It's the continent.

128
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,160
Then what is this?

129
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,040
You're not looking at the Ancho-go, are you?

130
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,280
Anyway, our future cannot be told without the sea.

131
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,000
You're overreacting.

132
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,060
That's why, Gorilla-kun,

133
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,960
you need your unbiased vitality.

134
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,700
What are you talking about?

135
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,640
It seems you've finally got to the point.

136
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,720
Let me be frank with you.

137
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,180
This is the invention of Professor Korosuke Ezaki.

138
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,720
I will give you the honor of wearing the first suit of the deep sea!

139
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,280
Deep sea suit?

140
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,460
That's right.

141
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,260
The deep sea suit I invented can move freely even at a sea level of more than 10,000 meters.

142
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,300
I hope you like it.

143
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,980
Your name is Mr. Kankichi Goro.

144
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,700
Gorilla can be written down in history as Ryotsu.

145
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,460
Stop using the middle name Gorilla!

146
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,420
I'm not joking.

147
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,260
It's not funny.

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
I've thought you were doing something terrible with your invention.

149
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,880
You're already a Gorilla.

150
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,440
Oh, nice joke.

151
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,860
Gorilla-kun is already a Gorilla.

152
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,780
Let's go to the sea.

153
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,500
Let's go to the sea.

154
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,540
I told you I don't like it.

155
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,220
You don't understand.

156
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,720
Wait a minute.

157
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,900
Could it be that the deep sea suit is...

158
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,040
Is it?

159
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,500
This is the story.

160
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:23,320
Ah, I like the sea.

161
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,380
I'm glad you took a break.

162
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,120
The chief and Mr. Torai will be in trouble.

163
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,980
What can I do?

164
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,320
I'll have a 200 billion yen coin when I get home.

165
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,700
I'll tell you what, I'll go and get it myself.

166
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,340
I won't ask you for a single penny.

167
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,060
If we get caught by Ryo-chan, the sea romance will be a profit.

168
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,940
It's okay, I won't get it.

169
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,180
He's saying that, but he's expecting a lot.

170
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,860
Oh, sea, the sea is so wide.

171
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,540
Oh, the sea is my hometown, isn't it wonderful?

172
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,500
Right, Aodaisho-kun?

173
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,840
Aodaisho?

174
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,080
I'm thinking of a series of Aodaisho by Yuzo Kayama.

175
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,460
Tanaka Kunie, from the north, did the rival Aodaisho.

176
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,380
I thought it was Shinji Maki from the Ukulele Band.

177
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,600
But Ryo-chan, it doesn't feel like Aodaisho at all.

178
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,400
Then let's do this.

179
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,900
Because I'm a gorilla in the sea, I'll call you Sea Gorilla-kun.

180
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,460
You have no sense of naming at all.

181
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,380
It's tea time.

182
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,940
Hmm, I don't think it's a good idea to call you Sea Gorilla.

183
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,620
I think a tropical drink would suit you well.

184
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,900
The man from the sea wasn't a turtle, was he?

185
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,340
Anyway, Senpai, it's about time for the Tsunbo-tsuji Line.

186
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,740
Hmm, it seems that we're the best.

187
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,760
As expected of the high-speed line in Nakagawa.

188
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,160
Hey, you crazy beast.

189
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,580
Hey, Ezaki.

190
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,180
Ezaki Korosuke.

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
Maybe I should call you Wakadai-sho?

192
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
You can't do that.

193
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,680
Hmm, what a good-for-nothing guy.

194
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,620
He's pretty good at it.

195
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,460
Well, it can't be helped.

196
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
Hey, Wakadai-sho!

197
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,820
Hmm? You read it, Sea Gorilla-kun?

198
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,020
As expected.

199
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,900
Senpai said he wanted to start experimenting with suits soon.

200
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,900
I thought so, too.

201
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,080
Let's start experimenting.

202
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,620
This is the new suit I invented.

203
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,840
It's called 8823-1.

204
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,600
This is just a suit.

205
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,300
I'm a waiter at the Ryugu Castle.

206
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,540
Don't worry.

207
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,500
The fabric of the suit is waterproof even in heavy rain.

208
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,460
You can't get drenched in this!

209
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,720
It's a joke.

210
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,880
I don't know how serious you are.

211
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,540
Then, let's start over.

212
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,460
This is the new suit I invented.

213
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,760
It's 8823-2.

214
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,120
It's like a snowman.

215
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,720
If you dive about 10 meters deep, the water pressure increases by one volume.

216
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,400
That is to say, the water pressure increases by 1,000 kilometers.

217
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,920
The water pressure is 1 ton per centimeter square meter.

218
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,940
Even 1 ton?

219
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,240
The water pressure is prevented by this suit 8823-2.

220
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,480
Even if its shape is like a snowman, its function is wonderful.

221
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
That one looks great.

222
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,960
Ryo-chan, it suits you.

223
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,080
I'm not lying.

224
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,200
But this is really heavy and difficult to move.

225
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,260
Yeah, because it weighs 20 tons.

226
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,220
20 tons?

227
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,940
I'm going to fall!

228
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,360
It's okay. It's got a weight on the bottom, so it won't fall.

229
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,980
Wow, that's funny!

230
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,880
Hey, stop it already!

231
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,240
I have to get up!

232
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,320
I'm tired.

233
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,940
Don't you have a better idea?

234
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,260
Don't worry.

235
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm going to make sure I get this one right this time.

236
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,400
Shinkai Suit 8823-35!

237
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,680
It's a real one!

238
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,460
Oh, it's a real one.

239
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,760
This is going to be a real dive.

240
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,060
Of course!

241
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,200
If you have one, get it out of the hole!

242
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,060
This is going to be easy to move.

243
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,960
It's like a space suit.

244
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,800
The unknown deep sea is the same as the universe.

245
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,680
It's mysterious.

246
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,140
This 8823-35 is designed to withstand the water pressure of 10,000 meters.

247
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:16,900
It should be.

248
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,360
Hey, wait!

249
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,040
What do you mean "should be"?

250
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,660
It should be.

251
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,040
You must have done a water pressure experiment.

252
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,780
It was my bath.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,560
Don't compare a bath with 10,000 meters!

254
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,160
Umigori Runa, you shouldn't be saying such a funny thing.

255
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,340
Look at that!

256
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:33,820
Huh?

257
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,800
It's the official investigation team's ship from the newspaper.

258
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,420
Oh no!

259
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,780
We're going to be left behind!

260
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,080
Two billion! Two billion!

261
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,840
Stand by, OK!

262
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,400
Now, please, Umigori Runa!

263
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,240
I wonder if he's going to be okay.

264
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,220
Yeah.

265
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,140
According to the data we've used, it should be okay even at 20,000 meters.

266
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,660
Really?

267
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,260
It's going to be okay.

268
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,680
If anything happens to him, he'll be back alive.

269
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,780
I'm nervous.

270
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,140
I'm nervous.

271
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,360
I'm nervous.

272
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,380
I'm nervous.

273
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,760
7,800...

274
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,920
8,000...

275
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
8,000...

276
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,700
Hey, hey!

277
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,860
Are you really going to be okay?

278
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:28,800
This...

279
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,240
Oh!

280
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,140
It's a sea fish!

281
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,680
It's a sea fish!

282
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,360
It's a sea fish!

283
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,880
It's only a sea fish, isn't it, Umigori Runa?

284
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,680
Don't be so silly!

285
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,720
Your suit is going to be torn apart!

286
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,380
Haha!

287
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,700
It's going to be okay!

288
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,560
Maybe.

289
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,400
Hey, don't say maybe!

290
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,880
The water pressure is at 9,800 meters.

291
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,880
It's about time to get to the bottom, Senior!

292
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,720
Ryo, can't you see anything?

293
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,200
I can't see anything yet!

294
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:54,740
Ah!

295
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,320
Ugh!

296
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,740
Ryo, what's wrong?

297
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,240
It seems that it's arrived at the bottom of the sea.

298
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,080
Yes!

299
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,840
It's a success!

300
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,940
Is there any water leaking somewhere?

301
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,860
Is the heart moving?

302
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,940
Of course!

303
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,340
How about the sinkhole?

304
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,800
Can you see around you?

305
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,060
Sinkhole?

306
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,620
Well...

307
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,500
That's strange.

308
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,940
I can't see anything like that.

309
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,440
What?

310
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,420
What's wrong, Senior?

311
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:19,580
What?

312
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,380
What?

313
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,340
What is that?

314
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:23,720
What is that?

315
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,200
What is that?

316
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,660
Be careful.

317
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,180
It may be an unknown creature living in the deep sea.

318
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,320
Unknown creature?

319
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,520
What should I do?

320
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,240
Okay.

321
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,520
I'll just shut up and let it eat me.

322
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,980
If I do that, I'll be sure it's a creature.

323
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,120
Don't joke around at a time like this!

324
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,280
Ugh!

325
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,200
It's coming over here!

326
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,080
Stop it!

327
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,600
I won't be good at eating!

328
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,760
Go over there!

329
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,780
Sh! Sh!

330
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,260
Ah!

331
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,380
Ah!

332
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,020
Ah!

333
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,200
Ah!

334
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,000
Stop!

335
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,360
Stop!

336
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,540
Stop the car!

337
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,000
Just watch me!

338
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,500
What!?

339
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,040
It's the furthest thing in the area!

340
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,580
Hey, watch me!

341
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,140
There's only a few left!

342
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:05,940
Don't give up on it!

343
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,140
You're definitely the strongest one!

344
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,080
I can't be too quick!

345
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,860
I can't take it anymore!

346
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,300
It's scary!

347
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,000
Why was the aradama there?

348
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,880
Come on!

349
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,400
Use this knife!

350
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,080
*Bang!*

351
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,580
*Bang!*

352
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:20,660
*Bang!*

353
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,500
AAAAAAHHHHH!

354
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,720
-S-Senpai! -Ryo-chan!

355
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,200
Umigurira-kun! What happened? Answer me, Umigurira-kun!

356
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,820
*Bang!*

357
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,640
This was so close...

358
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,940
Who is this unknown creature?!

359
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,160
It's the Unmanned Survey Team!

360
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,160
But it even has a missile in it...

361
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,800
It seems that you've seen me again, Umigurira-kun.

362
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
By the way, the blue button is a self-destruction device.

363
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,180
Where are those idiots who self-destruct at the bottom of the ocean?

364
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,900
I found it! It's a submarine!

365
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,020
The explosion just now showed that it was buried in the sand of the sea.

366
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,920
It's all calculated.

367
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,000
You did it, Ryo-chan.

368
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,640
Then, let's find the treasure!

369
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,720
Let's go!

370
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,540
This was taken before the video of the unmanned survey ship was cut off.

371
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,940
What's this?

372
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,580
It looks like a creature, but it's actually a human or a gorilla.

373
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,320
But it's a 10,000-meter deep sea.

374
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,420
Perhaps this is a great discovery of the century.

375
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,800
This mysterious creature is called the Underworld Genjin.

376
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,820
Let's investigate thoroughly!

377
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,260
Understood.

378
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,220
All right, let's get off the survey ship!

379
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,920
I'm going, too!

380
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,340
Roger that!

381
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,380
To be continued

382
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,340
That's right.

383
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,240
It's a long-standing submarine.

384
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,920
With this, a million gold coins will be mine!

385
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,780
Gold coins, gold coins!

386
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,260
Ouch!

387
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,180
Ryo-chan, what's wrong?

388
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,820
Ouch! I tumbled!

389
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,440
No! You tumbled!

390
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,680
Nice joke!

391
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:09,940
Joke!

392
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,340
Don't laugh! It's echoing in the suit!

393
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,460
No, no, no!

394
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,920
Who told you to find something like that?

395
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,260
It's the Gold Coast! The Gold Coast!

396
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,320
I know that without you telling me!

397
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,000
Gold Coast!

398
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,440
Gold Coast! Where are you?

399
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,200
Two billion yen!

400
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,960
What's this?

401
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,420
Gold Coast!

402
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,620
I found it! It's the Gold Coast!

403
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,560
You did it, Gorilla!

404
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,300
It's the Gold Coast!

405
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,800
You can't carry it all at once.

406
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,580
This is the romance of a man in the sea.

407
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,040
I'll pack it in my backpack as much as I can.

408
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,520
I see. It's a backpack.

409
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,460
My hand won't reach its back!

410
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,500
Crap!

411
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,280
There's a blood vessel in its structure!

412
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,520
Ouch! My arm!

413
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:09,920
Ouch!

414
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,580
It's a miscarriage.

415
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,560
All right.

416
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,940
I thought I'd finally get one out.

417
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,660
Now it's time for this Magic Hand!

418
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,580
It's so slippery that it's hard to grab it!

419
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,540
This is the Tsunbo Line.

420
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,440
Doctor, shall we start the investigation?

421
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,500
The Gold Coast worth two billion yen won't run away.

422
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,340
First, we need to find the Underworld.

423
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,340
Yes, sir!

424
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,400
If we can capture the Underworld alive,

425
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,040
we can make a world-wide discovery.

426
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,640
It might be the Nobel Prize.

427
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,820
This is the New Underworld!

428
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,820
Damn it! It's worth two billion yen!

429
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,340
Where are you, Underworld Genjin?

430
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,680
See, see! You're a good boy, Genjin-chan!

431
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,380
What's going on?

432
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,860
Something seems to have jumped on this ship!

433
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,980
No way! It's the Underworld Genjin!

434
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,480
What do you think, you bastard?

435
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,720
Da... Da... Da...

436
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,500
Wh... Wh... Wh... Wa...

437
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,320
P... P... P...

438
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,340
Damn it! What a brutal guy!

439
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,280
Drop it!

440
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,000
Roger!

441
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,140
Huh!?

442
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,740
What a Society-Gun, huh?

443
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,040
This is easy to get down easily!

444
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,000
W... Where's the Underworld Genjin?

445
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,560
Wh... Where's the Underworld Genjin?

446
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,980
C... Can't be! It's the Underworld Genjin!

447
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,140
Hurry and catch it!

448
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,160
Conversely, after the group is captured,

449
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,940
a capture wire will be fired.

450
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,800
And then...

451
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,040
ч…

452
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,220
...

453
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,020
Hey, what are you doing?

454
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,380
Let go of me!

455
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,440
Oh no! Ryo-chan's...

456
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,560
Ume Goryera-kun, press the button on your arm.

457
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,320
This can't be a self-destruction operation!

458
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,000
No! Hurry!

459
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,520
This is...

460
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,920
What's this?

461
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,600
It's a diamond cutter. There's no way it's a wire!

462
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,340
Alright!

463
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,620
Ah, the wire's been cut!

464
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,340
No, it's going to escape!

465
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,960
I-I can't do anything about that!

466
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,520
You're doing a great job, huh?

467
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,400
I'll pay you back this time!

468
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,540
What's this?

469
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,160
It's a floating body! A floating body! Hurry!

470
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,720
Look at this!

471
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,360
My butt's shaking!

472
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,880
Slowly, slowly!

473
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,100
You're going to be surprised!

474
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,260
It's gone.

475
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,840
As expected of you, senpai. You're really good.

476
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,880
Alright, Ume Goryera-kun.

477
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,060
With all the money you have, you're going to be a floating body.

478
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:38,320
I'll get it!

479
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:38,780
You got it?

480
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,160
Yeah!

481
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,200
With all this money!

482
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,340
Now I'm a rich little man, too!

483
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,140
For the sake of the whole world!

484
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,000
With all the money, I'm going to have my paradise!

485
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,420
Ah ha ha ha!

486
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,000
Ryo-chan!

487
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
There's something coming near!

488
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,880
Be careful!

489
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,500
What? About what?

490
00:19:59,520 --> 00:19:59,900
Where?

491
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,300
It's there, Ryo-chan!

492
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,020
W-wait, you idiot!

493
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,060
No good...

494
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,080
But he hasn't bathed in a week!

495
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,660
You're so unruly, you shark!

496
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,900
I'll kill you!

497
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,640
I can't stand this guy!

498
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,640
Hey, get me out of here!

499
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,720
What a troublesome guy!

500
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,160
Get him!

501
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,580
Get him!

502
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,220
Professor, we have to get him out of here!

503
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,900
I know, but this is a full speed!

504
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,940
Senpai!

505
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,100
Idiot! Don't bite me like that!

506
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,080
Ryo-chan, what's wrong? Ryo-chan, Ryo-chan!

507
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,000
The cable's out!

508
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,840
Senpai!

509
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,040
Senpai!

510
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,240
Senpai!

511
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,840
Hey, the gold is heavy and it's sinking!

512
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,240
If I don't throw it away, I'll die!

513
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,100
No, I can't!

514
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,780
For the sake of gold, I'll definitely take this thing home!

515
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,360
Hey, here he comes again!

516
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,280
The persistent guy!

517
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,780
Huh?

518
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,280
Hehehe, just watch!

519
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,800
Hehehe, it's a great idea, just like Professor Tondemo's idea!

520
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,820
Huh? What's going on?

521
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,980
10 seconds until the self-destruction!

522
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,900
That's the self-destruct device!

523
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,300
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

524
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,800
That's why I said I didn't want to hear Professor Tondemo's invention!

525
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,140
4, 3, 2, 1!

526
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,920
Open!

527
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,380
AHHH!

528
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,120
Senpai!

529
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,980
Ryo-chan!

530
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,160
The Sea Gorilla was self-destructing…

531
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,280
N-no way…

532
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,800
Ryo-chan…

533
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,120
WHY?!

534
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,000
WHY?!

535
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,680
Why?!

536
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,000
WHY!?

537
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,120
WHY?!

538
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Ryo-chan!

539
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,160
Senpai!

540
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,580
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

541
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,620
You're safe, right?

542
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,820
Of course!

543
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,860
I'm glad. I was worried.

544
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,220
You got the treasure, but you can't die here.

545
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,580
Then, what about the gold?

546
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,540
I might not get 2 billion, but I'll bring it as much as I can.

547
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,720
I can't believe it. It's a miracle of the sea.

548
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,100
Hey, hey, don't take it without permission. I took this gold with my life.

549
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,940
No way!

550
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,520
This is all mine. Okay?

551
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
Let's go home.

552
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,160
It's a happy ending this time.

553
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Yahoo! I'm rich now!

554
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,580
What? That gold was all fake?

555
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,980
Yes. It was just a gold paint.

556
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,300
A few years ago, a ship used for a movie was sunk near there.

557
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,360
The gold and the skull were also small tools for the movie.

558
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,520
No way!

559
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
Then, what about my hard work?

560
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:27,920
What's going to happen?

561
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,240
It's going to be a disaster, Sea Gorilla.

562
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,240
What's going to happen next, Super Beast?

563
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,520
This is it! The submarine engine has been discovered!

564
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,040
We should go back to the sea to capture this thing.

565
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,240
Professor Ezaki, no matter what you think...

566
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,940
Isn't it Ryo-chan?

567
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,740
What?

568
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,520
Super Beast, I'm in a bad mood right now.

569
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,540
Who's the sea? I'm never going to go!

570
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:55,840
What about us?

571
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,000
No way!

572
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,460
What?

573
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:12,480
