00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,800
Let's Go Home

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,900

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:23,880

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,940
I was looking for a good day to sleep

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,900
When I kicked the love stone, it flew into my shoes

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,940
I wonder if it's a joke

8
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:50,340
I was laughed at as it was

9
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,100
Even if I try to cheer up, I have a bad luck

10
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,940
I have a bad luck

11
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,860
The city is so gentle

12
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,720
From the water tank of the Tungari-boshi

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,320
To the taishakuten

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,660
The sun goes down

15
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,840
Tomorrow will end like this

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,940
I lost my happiness again

17
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,580
I realized it

18
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,700
Because I'm an idiot

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,500
This is Komachi

20
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,140
Inside

21
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,800
Right here

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,060
I'm sorry

23
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,740
I'm sorry

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:00,740
Come on

25
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,040
My heart is about to burst

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,860
Go out

27
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,900
Come on

28
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,300
Come out

29
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,520
Jump

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:10,700
Jump

31
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,420
Jump

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,800
Jump

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,620
Jump

34
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,720
Oh, Komachi.

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,020
So that's why you're with the tough village farmer.

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,160
What?

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,000
I forgot!

38
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,460
He was with us, too!

39
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,540
You guys...

40
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,660
You're not that bad...

41
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,820
Huh?

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,700
What are you talking about, Dad?

43
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,380
Huh?

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,820
Ryotsu-san, I'm a good daughter, but...

45
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,000
Please take care of Suenaga.

46
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,080
What?

47
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,760
That's a misunderstanding!

48
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,160
If everyone sees this photo,

49
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,760
my credit will drop so much!

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,060
W-What should I do?

51
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,700
Hey, look, everyone!

52
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,380
What? What's going on?

53
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,400
What's going on?

54
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,260
What's going on?

55
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,940
What's going on?

56
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,620
Look at this!

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,620
It's a two-shot of Komachi and Nakagawa-san!

58
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,680
What?

59
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,980
No way!

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,420
They're helping each other!

61
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,580
Wow!

62
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,740
Right?

63
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,000
Komachi, what's going on?

64
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,780
I took a picture of them when I went back home for the summer vacation.

65
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,080
What?

66
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,440
With Nakagawa-san?

67
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,600
Don't tell me...

68
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:49,900
Just the two of us?

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,080
Hmm...

70
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,000
Wow!

71
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,420
That's amazing!

72
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,700
There are so many two-shot photos with Nakagawa-san!

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,980
Komachi, normally when you go to your boyfriend's house,

74
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,780
it's a pretty good time, right?

75
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,140
What do you think?

76
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,740
Tell me!

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,980
It's not like that!

78
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,120
I heard that there was a meeting at your house.

79
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,180
So I wanted to ask Nakagawa-san to go.

80
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,300
Then did you summon him as your boyfriend?

81
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,420
No!

82
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm so shocked!

83
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,160
That's what I'm saying!

84
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,180
It's so hard to be a girlfriend!

85
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,840
I'm so jealous!

86
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,760
I want to kill him!

87
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,560
It's so hard!

88
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,300
Well, I guess...

89
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,280
I'm calling the traffic police.

90
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,200
Hello, this is the traffic police.

91
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,260
Oh, Mom.

92
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,880
Yes, me.

93
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,900
What?

94
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,460
Are you going to Tokyo?

95
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,900
Oh, on Sunday, the day after tomorrow.

96
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,100
And then,

97
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,620
did you get along with that boyfriend?

98
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,020
That boyfriend?

99
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,480
Nakagawa-san?

100
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,760
Nakagawa-san?

101
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,440
Nakagawa-san?

102
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:01,980
Nakagawa-san?

103
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,720
Yes, that's right.

104
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,700
It's about Ryotsu-san.

105
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,380
Mom, don't misunderstand!

106
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,580
This is bad.

107
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,680
Everyone thinks it's about Nakagawa-san.

108
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,180
I can't even say the name of the city governor.

109
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,680
I can't even say the name of the city governor.

110
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,620
I talked to my dad about it.

111
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,140
He's a manly man and a good guy.

112
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,600
That's why you're not that close with him.

113
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,400
He's a man?

114
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,840
This is...

115
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,840
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,520
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,100
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:40,880
I'm sorry.

121
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:40,940
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,320
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,420
I'm sorry.

124
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,480
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,160
I'm sorry.

126
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,660
Now I'm sorry.

127
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,500
Now I'm sorry.

128
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,560
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,540
I said it's a bad ring.

130
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,730
I'm sorry.

131
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm sorry.

132
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,500
I'm happy today.

133
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,360
I'm sorry.

134
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
I don't know.

135
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,220
I've only heard it by myself.

136
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,120
Is it good to be close with them?

137
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,560
I should go to sleep.

138
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,360
It's late.

139
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,440
I'm a good-for-nothing, so...

140
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,220
Wait! I'm here!

141
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,060
What are you doing, you primitive?

142
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,640
Sh-sh-sh...

143
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,480
I'm a stray dog!

144
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,600
Dogs are much better.

145
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,980
The number one thing you hate!

146
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,220
The number one thing you don't want to marry!

147
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,640
The number one thing you don't want to be in a relationship!

148
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,100
The number one thing you don't want to date!

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,160
The number one thing you don't want to be in a picture!

150
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,780
The number one thing you don't want to be in a relationship!

151
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,340
What did you come here for?

152
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,260
You're all playing with each other.

153
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,320
I came here to complain about this!

154
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,480
Don't do anything unnecessary!

155
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,000
I think that's...

156
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,940
When I went to Komachi's countryside...

157
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,100
What is it? What is it?

158
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,420
I see.

159
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,640
You're playing with a panorama.

160
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,680
Everything I see is clearly cut out.

161
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,160
If I'm not there, it looks like a trip between lovers.

162
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,700
Right?

163
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,080
I can't believe I'm with you now.

164
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,880
It has nothing to do with me.

165
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,280
There's no one who can help me with that newspaper article!

166
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,380
You're asking me to do something about it, aren't you?

167
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,680
Right?

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,060
It's a bad thing!

169
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,160
What?

170
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,600
I'm telling you that you can't do anything about it.

171
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,720
What's worse, you'll lose, and...

172
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,540
I'll erase this article and put a apology on it.

173
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,700
I'll put a apology on it and put a apology on it.

174
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,440
What?

175
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,080
If you don't like it, it's okay.

176
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,900
If you don't like it, it's okay.

177
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,120
If you don't like it, it's okay.

178
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,860
But my mouth is very light.

179
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,400
But my mouth is very light.

180
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,420
I understand. I understand.

181
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,140
I understand.

182
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,180
We'll be right there.

183
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,080
We'll be right there.

184
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,900
We'll be right there.

185
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,020
I said we understood, didn't I?

186
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,520
We'll be right there.

187
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:06,540
Then...

188
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,700
It's a secret.

189
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,400
You're so naive.

190
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,100
What?

191
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,160
A picture from the summer vacation in Komachi's countryside?

192
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,040
I have one.

193
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,480
You've seen one before, right, Senpai?

194
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,040
Yeah, I was going to cook some yakimashi for myself.

195
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,420
I was going to cook some yakimashi for myself.

196
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,680
You said you didn't need it at the time.

197
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,920
Here.

198
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,200
Here.

199
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,180
Hey, you changed your mind.

200
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,620
Oh, this is it.

201
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,140
Let's borrow it.

202
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,460
I apologize for the inconvenience.

203
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,480
Did you make a mistake in the list of the hateful ones announced this month?

204
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,820
In first place, Sakonji Tatsunosuke will be the winner.

205
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,740
Why?

206
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:54,960
Why?

207
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,740
How could I?

208
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,260
I thought I could be at ease as long as Ryotsu was around.

209
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,120
Damn it! What's wrong with that woman?

210
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm going to prepare for the upcoming Budō tournament and go to the mountains!

211
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:22,120
What's wrong with that woman? What's wrong with that woman?

212
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,840
I have Saori.

213
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Saori.

214
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,580
Hey, Komachi, what's up?

215
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,540
That's right, that's right, there's no mistake in the list.

216
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,260
The original person was No. 1 straight away.

217
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,960
Huh? Really?

218
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,620
But it's fine.

219
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,000
If you're always together, there's no freshness.

220
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,400
But...

221
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,880
Hey, Komachi.

222
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,880
Why are you here? Again?

223
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,840
Shut up. I have something to do with you.

224
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,720
Shut up. I have something to do with you.

225
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,520
Hey, Komachi, you forgot your wallet.

226
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,100
Could you lend me about 30,000 yen?

227
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,600
What did you say?

228
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,680
You're so annoying! Go home! Go home!

229
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,620
I said you forgot your wallet.

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,820
Oh, right.

231
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,520
You said you were in love with Nakagawa.

232
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,300
What?

233
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,440
You went to your country with him alone,

234
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,560
and you introduced him to your parents, right?

235
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,640
With just the two of you.

236
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,880
Oh, my.

237
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:23,540
Oh, no.

238
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,420
Reiko got it from him.

239
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,980
I-I see.

240
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,920
30,000 yen is fine, right?

241
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,300
You're so smart.

242
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,540
I'm going home, then.

243
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,520
What? You said you could return it anytime?

244
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,320
I see. I'm sorry.

245
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,640
Hey!

246
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,260
What's going on?

247
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,180
You're not like Komachi.

248
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,420
I'm serious.

249
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,260
N-Nothing.

250
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,700
Don't worry.

251
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,260
Don't worry, Kenji.

252
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,780
Hey, what's wrong?

253
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,120
Oh, Ryo.

254
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,420
The minipato has taken over the parking space,

255
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,800
and the pato car can't be stopped.

256
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,360
It's a problem.

257
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,540
If you go to the lecture, you'll be beaten back.

258
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,840
Especially Komachi.

259
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,420
They're so violent.

260
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,600
I'm not afraid of that.

261
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,640
You're saying Ryo is all right?

262
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,820
Yeah.

263
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,320
Leave it all to me.

264
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,320
I can't do anything.

265
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,560
Oh, God of Rescue!

266
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,260
Please, Ryo!

267
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,260
Tell Tsuke and the others to stop the minipato.

268
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,480
Is that all?

269
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,480
Anything else you want to say to them?

270
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,960
We're finished with all the organizing.

271
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,320
Here we go.

272
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,240
N-No way!

273
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,460
Good, good, good.

274
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,080
This way.

275
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,300
What?

276
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,180
If I go to the public place,

277
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,860
is everyone free?

278
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,360
Yes.

279
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,420
I respect that, Ryo.

280
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,620
You said that you wanted to go along with it.

281
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,600
Well, maybe not.

282
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,580
I don't care.

283
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,460
Let me explain.

284
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,640
Oh, you're not that strong, are you, Komachi?

285
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,260
You're in love with Nakagawa, aren't you?

286
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,860
What are you talking about? It has nothing to do with you!

287
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,740
I wonder, Komachi.

288
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,920
I get it. I'll admit it.

289
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,340
Komachi, what are you talking about?

290
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,700
You have to be like that.

291
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:40,720
You have to be like that.

292
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,220
And you have to make sure the entire school is closed.

293
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,820
And you have to make sure Valentine's chocolate is fair.

294
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,300
Isn't that great?

295
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,740
That's great.

296
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,300
Huh?

297
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,040
You really understand, don't you, Komachi?

298
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,580
I think you'll do a good job from now on.

299
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,140
I'll be in your care.

300
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,560
Oh, my. The floor is dirty.

301
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,040
Hey, Komachi.

302
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,640
Oh, come on. Let's blow it clean.

303
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,340
Yeah, yeah. You're so thoughtful.

304
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,900
He's always getting in my way.

305
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
I'm going to be sick and tired of him from now on.

306
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,040
If this goes on, the primitive will be in trouble.

307
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,700
I have to do something about it.

308
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,760
What? Ryo said that?

309
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,560
That's really awful.

310
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,560
As soon as he heard it was a secret, he turned into a devil.

311
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,480
You can do whatever you want if you want to.

312
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm in trouble. What should I do?

313
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,360
In other words, it would be really nice if you and K-chan had a two-shot picture.

314
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,140
But if Nakagawa finds out about this ...

315
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,700
It's okay.

316
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,260
I'll talk to K-chan and take a two-shot picture of you.

317
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,560
Really? Eiko?

318
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,180
That's great.

319
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,260
Leave it to me.

320
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,520
Even so, you didn't say you'd come with us.

321
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
K-chan has a friend from France.

322
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,540
I asked K-chan to show me around.

323
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,740
I told him that he should make a plan in his room.

324
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,440
I see. I thought about it.

325
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,920
That flower watch is very beautiful.

326
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,260
Let's take a picture.

327
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,520
Yes.

328
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,760
Is this okay?

329
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,320
Did you think you could fool me with such a little craft?

330
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,500
Reiko's strategy is very good.

331
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,980
Hmm. Would you like to stick together a little longer?

332
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,040
That would be better.

333
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,320
Really?

334
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,660
Really?

335
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,340
Something like this.

336
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,700
Then let's go.

337
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,060
Yes, cheese.

338
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,420
Oh?

339
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,740
I wonder if I just saw something.

340
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,040
I wonder if I just saw something.

341
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,840
Then let's take it in front of the dinosaurs.

342
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,240
Komachi-chan, a little more to the right.

343
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:23,880
Yes.

344
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,100
Then I'll take it.

345
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,940
Yes, cheese.

346
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:27,580
Yes, cheese.

347
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,440
Is that Ryo-chan?

348
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,640
No way.

349
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,000
This is a haunted house.

350
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,640
It's Ryo-chan.

351
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,100
Komachi-chan, come here for a moment.

352
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,900
This is bad.

353
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,560
Ryo-chan is in the way.

354
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,780
Even in the pictures taken so far, Ryo-chan is reflected in them.

355
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,180
No way.

356
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,980
Is something wrong?

357
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,220
Did something happen?

358
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,120
Not at all.

359
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,240
No, it's nothing.

360
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,340
I'm wondering where we should go next.

361
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,240
In the past, Ryo-chan was the one who got in the way.

362
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,960
In the past, Ryo-chan was the one who got in the way.

363
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,380
Let's go on the gondola, okay?

364
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,140
That sounds good.

365
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,540
Let's go on the gondola, okay?

366
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:13,760
Okay?

367
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,420
Okay, then.

368
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,520
Come on, Kei.

369
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,620
Hurry, hurry.

370
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,140
Yes.

371
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,480
I'm sorry.

372
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,200
I'm sorry.

373
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,840
You're aware of it.

374
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:22,860
You're aware of it.

375
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,020
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:23,780
I'm sorry.

377
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,240
You're aware of it.

378
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,480
I'm sorry.

379
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,940
I'm sorry.

380
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,240
I'm sorry.

381
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,100
I'm sorry.

382
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,920
I'm sorry.

383
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,140
I'm sorry.

384
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,820
I'm sorry.

385
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,140
I'm sorry.

386
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,240
I'm sorry.

387
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,360
I'm sorry.

388
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,720
I'm sorry.

389
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:46,740
I'm sorry.

390
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,760
I'm sorry.

391
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:46,940
That's it.

392
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,720
You're going to be there now, too.

393
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,200
Why are you still running?

394
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,560
Is he staying there?

395
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,700
He's not going anywhere.

396
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:54,880
Just wait for it.

397
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,560
The kappa did it! Over there!

398
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,520
Reiko-san, it's the kappa!

399
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,960
Y-Yeah...

400
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,800
Ryo-chan's doing it.

401
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,360
If this happens...

402
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,680
What are you both in such a hurry for?

403
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,600
If this happens, it's a jet course!

404
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,240
I won't let you get in the way!

405
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,600
Don't think you can escape from me!

406
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,400
Hey, Reiko-san!

407
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,620
Oh, my...

408
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,540
Ow, ow, ow!

409
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,660
Damn it!

410
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,980
Looks like he's exhausted.

411
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,400
He'll be fine if you start running now.

412
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,740
Oh, no! Did I start already?

413
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,400
There's no way to get in the way!

414
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,360
Huh?

415
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,180
There!

416
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,120
Now that you've come this far, you're safe!

417
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,440
Just a little more.

418
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,820
Now!

419
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,620
Hey!

420
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,720
A-A senior is falling from the sky!

421
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,060
Oh, no!

422
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,080
Ryo-chan, don't get in the way!

423
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,920
I can't do that! Give me the camera!

424
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,220
No!

425
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,880
Give it to me, you idiot!

426
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,800
I won't!

427
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,840
I did it!

428
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,300
Now, look at me!

429
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,820
Ryo-chan!

430
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,660
Ow!

431
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,760
Ow!

432
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,060
Ow!

433
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,620
Ow!

434
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:51,920
Ow!

435
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,220
Shh!

436
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,720
Ryo-chan's gone!

437
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,220
Stay here!

438
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,800
Reiko, what's the matter?

439
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,960
I don't have to worry!

440
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,260
I...

441
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,080
Now, open!

442
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,380
Here, cheese!

443
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,700
Whoa!

444
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,920
Senior!

445
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,940
You scared me!

446
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,000
This is historia of your little smile!

447
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,860
Now, open!

448
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,440
I won't!

449
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,320
Ugh!

450
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,220
Ugh!

451
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,640
Ugh!

452
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,720
What about here?

453
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,580
Here, cheese!

454
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,940
So sweet!

455
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,520
Oh, I'm so annoyed!

456
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,220
Ah, a Puri-Kura!

457
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,900
I don't think Ryou-chan will get caught here.

458
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,300
I'll keep an eye on her, so hurry up!

459
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,320
Okay!

460
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,480
Okay!

461
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,300
It's okay.

462
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,720
I can't see Ryou-chan.

463
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,120
Yay!

464
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
We finally got her.

465
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,100
What is this?

466
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,260
What's going on?

467
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,660
*Ryuu-chan is still there*

468
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,580
It's all Ryou-chan.

469
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,680
No way!

470
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,700
What do you think?

471
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,080
I thought it would be like that, so I made a plan in advance.

472
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,820
Oh, no!

473
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,940
What's going on?

474
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,460
Banji is a good kid.

475
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,000
Wait.

476
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,340
Maybe that hand...

477
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,060
If it turns out like this, it's a win or a loss.

478
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,560
*A

479
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,140
Ah, no!

480
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,740
The 500-yen coin...

481
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:52,960
What?

482
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,860
Where is it?

483
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,380
Where is it?

484
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,700
Wait!

485
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,940
Now!

486
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,820
Ken-chan!

487
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,440
Komachi-chan!

488
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,580
*K wobbling*

489
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,400
I did it.

490
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,300
Too bad. I won, Ryo-chan.

491
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,680
Now you're not going to be the one to complain about it!

492
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,660
Damn it! All the hard work I've put in!

493
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,880
Then, I'll take this.

494
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,000
No, it's fine. You can do it tomorrow morning.

495
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,520
I'll do it right away.

496
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,540
My dictionary doesn't have the word "lose" on it.

497
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,260
I'll take this.

498
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,300
Oh, oh, oh. This is it.

499
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,720
If there's a match, there's no way I can win.

500
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,560
You just came here, but where are you taking me?

501
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,680
Don't worry. Just follow me, Mom.

502
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,240
You're really good at misunderstanding.

503
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,440
I'll prove it to you.

504
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,260
Yes, it's done.

505
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,260
Now, Mom. If you look at this, you'll see for yourself.

506
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,160
See? You got it, right? My boyfriend is this guy.

507
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,200
If he's this guy, he's definitely Ryo-chan.

508
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,000
That's right. My boyfriend is Ryo-chan.

509
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,720
Mom, where are you looking?

510
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,400
There.

511
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:52,820
There.

512
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,060
There, there.

513
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,520
Hey, Ryo-chan!

514
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,420
Hey, Ryo-chan!

515
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,260
Hey, Ryo-chan!

516
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,660
There he is!

517
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:02,680
Hey, he's here.

518
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,120
There he is!

519
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,800
Hey, I'm Ryo-chan.

520
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,100
Hey, Ryo-chan!

521
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,180
Hey, you!

522
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,280
You!

523
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,120
Ah!

524
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,100
That's enough!

525
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,160
Kyo-chan switched the part where Kei-chan was reflected on the computer with herself.

526
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,460
I don't know why, but did you have to go that far?

527
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,000
Well, there are many things.

528
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,000
Please help me, mom!

529
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,480
You say that the more you fight, the closer you get.

530
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,940
It's not like that!

531
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,660
I won't forgive you!

532
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,780
If you say you won't forgive me, I will never forgive you!

533
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,420
Help me!

534
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,120
I won't!

535
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,580
You two are really good friends.

536
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,980
Oh, yeah.

537
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,060
You! You! You! You!

538
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,440
You're the only one I can see.

539
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,120
Oh, my mouth! My mouth!

540
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,880
I'm a plum blossom with my whole life!

541
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,920
Oh, my mouth! My mouth!

542
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,860
I've been buried in the ground without eating a single bite.

543
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,040
I will go to Matsudai top and

544
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,660
the next episode, I will go to the cursed plum blossom!

545
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,740
Surprised and screaming

546
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,520
Hullo!

547
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,160
We're going to fight, and we're going to solve the problem.

548
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,120
We're going to get rid of it quickly.

549
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,060
I'm scared.

550
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,480
We're going to decide, and we're going to spark.

551
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,700
We're going to hit, and we're going to put it all together.

552
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,520
We're going to take action, and we're going to fly.

553
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,900
Power is the best thing.

554
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,260
If we all come together here,

555
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,680
If we all come together here,

556
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,320
It's like a dream.

557
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,480
The last energy.

558
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,960
Look at tomorrow.

559
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,200
Believe in yesterday.

560
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,800
If you draw the universe and stand on the ground,

561
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,780
The planet of the turtle will turn into a circle.

562
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,360
This is good, right?

563
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,620
There's no reason to be good.

564
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,700
Hey, don't do this!

565
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,740
I don't want to die.

566
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,120
This is the end of today's story.

567
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,720
Thank you for watching!
