"T-T-When You Watch TV"

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,080
T-T-When you watch TV

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,140
Make the room brighter and try to look away

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:24,940
I look at the sunset floating in the middle of the river

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,860
I look at the sunset floating in the middle of the river

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,680
I kick a pebble and fly to the shoes

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:41,580
I wonder if I'll go to the gym that I used to jog

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,400
I was laughed at as a child

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,840
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,100
I can't do it

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,920
I can't do it

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,740
My

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:55,880
I'm

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,240
coat

T-T-T-T-Table

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,300
This is my

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:16,920
T-T-T-T-Table

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:16,940
Well, let's go

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,280
T- Taking a break

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,300
I went down to theHAHAHA

23
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,760
It's pretty straight

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,760
♪I was so happy that I lost my mind♪

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,420
♪I realized that I'm such an idiot♪

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,700
Gekitou Kankeri Daisensou

27
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,040
How many 8mm tapes do you have?

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,040
Twelve.

29
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,700
How about the smart media?

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,440
16メガが10枚。

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,320
That's enough.

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,620
Don't forget about the 6V Li-ion battery.

33
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,980
I got it.

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,460
Good morning.

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,000
Huh? What are you doing?

36
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,300
I'm going to the beach for my first trip.

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,600
I'm going to take a swimsuit beauty with this.

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,720
It's a once in a year opportunity.

39
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,440
I hope you'll enjoy it.

40
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,620
But this year's trip is to the mountains.

41
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,560
What? What a fool!

42
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,660
I think I saw it on the newspaper.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,420
I think I saw it on the newspaper.

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,200
I think I saw it on the newspaper.

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,880
Every year, the trip to the beach is decided.

46
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,120
But even if you go to the mountains, there is no beauty in the swimsuit.

47
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,280
The beauty's swimsuit is off and you can't see her chest.

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Even if I'm told that...

49
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,020
Can I take all the fun of all men?

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,920
There are people who are not so considerate.

51
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,620
So this time I made it a mountain.

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,080
That voice is...

53
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,540
It's your work after all.

54
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,060
Naoko Komachi

55
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,180
Naoko Komachi

56
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,340
Chie

57
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm not convinced.

58
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,720
Let me ask you why I changed.

59
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,540
I'm completely sorry for you to show us a swimsuit.

60
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,020
Yes, I can see it with your evil eye.

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,780
Who'll see your vulgar body?

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,320
We see in others who wear swimsuits.

63
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,940
Did you say our bodies are vulgar?

64
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,340
I've never seen it. Don't say that.

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,860
Then show me the ocean.

66
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,040
Fine! I'll show you!

67
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,060
Hey, Komachi!

68
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:24,980
What?

69
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,320
No!

70
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,000
You're going to get in his car?

71
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,700
It was just a little bit.

72
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,320
No matter what you say,

73
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,120
this year's trip to the mountains is a success.

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,060
No change.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,740
You're a coward!

76
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,240
You should listen to us too!

77
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,500
You don't have to.

78
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,380
It's already decided.

79
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,880
You don't have to say that.

80
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,500
What?

81
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,560
You're saying that it's a democracy.

82
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,540
But where is democracy in this decision?

83
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,720
And democracy should have a spirit of respect for the minority.

84
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,080
You ignore the opinions of men.

85
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
What is democracy?

86
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,380
I get it.

87
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,220
Then I'll go to the whole office again.

88
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,680
I'll take the survey.

89
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:12,620
Again!

90
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,780
You're good at multiple-pollination work.

91
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,340
You can see the loss of the sea group.

92
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,320
Then what should we do?

93
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,740
Let's have a fair competition here.

94
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,480
Let's decide whether to go to the sea or the mountains.

95
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,020
I got it.

96
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,040
Let's settle this in a competition.

97
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,420
Sounds good.

98
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,740
Ryutsu, what happened to the discussion?

99
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,220
What happened? What happened?

100
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,640
We were supposed to have a competition in the small town, but we couldn't decide the way of the competition.

101
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,240
We were filled with water.

102
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,320
Because Ryotsu Kankichi is terrible.

103
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,020
He always said that judo and baseball are bad.

104
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,520
I'm sure you guys have proposed only the things that we don't like.

105
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,080
It's difficult to have a fair competition.

106
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,540
Why don't we just decide with rock-paper-scissors?

107
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,580
Idiot!

108
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,180
How can we decide the big problem in such a way?

109
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,740
It was dangerous.

110
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,040
It's okay if you don't kick.

111
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,700
It's not a rock-paper-scissors.

112
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,860
Rock-paper-scissors?

113
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,480
I miss it.

114
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,440
When I was a kid, I played with my friends every day.

115
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,260
Nobody lost a rock-paper-scissors game.

116
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,260
They called it "Rock-paper-scissors Komachi."

117
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,920
That's right.

118
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,980
How about a competition with rock-paper-scissors?

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,000
I've done it when I was a kid.

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,240
What?

121
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,600
You're so stupid, Ryotsu Kankichi.

122
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,580
You don't even know that I was called "Rock-paper-scissors Komachi."

123
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:48,940
Fine.

124
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,420
I'll accept that competition.

125
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,500
You're so stupid, Komachi.

126
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,720
When I was a kid, I was called "Ryotsu Kankeri."

127
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,140
I'm a genius of rock-paper-scissors.

128
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,680
Okay.

129
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,140
Let's have a competition with rock-paper-scissors.

130
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,340
Rock-paper-scissors Komachi

131
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,120
Komachi, are you okay?

132
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:07,980
What?

133
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,240
What is rock-paper-scissors?

134
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,100
What? You don't know?

135
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:11,920
No.

136
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,420
I don't know either.

137
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,700
I lived in the United States when I was in elementary school.

138
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,620
What?

139
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,740
It's a game of the countryside.

140
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,100
I've never played it.

141
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,280
I played it, but it was surprisingly minor.

142
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,200
It's a primitive game that primitive people play.

143
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,700
So that's what it was.

144
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,820
Don't be silly.

145
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,580
I played it when I was a kid.

146
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,980
Komachi, have you played it?

147
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,920
I don't know.

148
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,480
I don't know either.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,400
What are you going to do?

150
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
I don't know what to do.

151
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,720
I accepted it once.

152
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,500
Don't tell me to change it.

153
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
I know.

154
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,300
Komachi.

155
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,360
Please tell me the rules.

156
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,200
We can't have a competition if we don't do it.

157
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,480
That's right.

158
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,540
Okay.

159
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,420
Tomorrow, we will gather all the participants and confirm the rules.

160
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,420
Until then, let's gather the members.

161
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay.

162
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,040
Sorry to keep you waiting.

163
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,960
You didn't leave the car.

164
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,420
Look, these are our members.

165
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,940
Teraiya Honda is an experienced driver.

166
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,320
Sakonji and Nakagawa have excellent driving skills.

167
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,740
So, we won't lose.

168
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,260
We have strong players.

169
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,040
Maria.

170
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,240
Maria is also an experienced driver.

171
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,740
She was a man when I was in elementary school.

172
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,660
I did it when I was a kid.

173
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,860
Maria, are you betraying me?

174
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,280
I'm sorry, Ryo-sama.

175
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,920
I really want to be of service to you.

176
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,020
But the sea...

177
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,400
I can't do anything about the sea!

178
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,940
Because...

179
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,740
Because?

180
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,220
Because...

181
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,720
When I wear a bikini, my chest gets sore.

182
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,040
Ugh!

183
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,320
But if you're with me,

184
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,260
whether it's a mountain or a river,

185
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,880
it will be a fun trip.

186
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,560
I want to go to the sea!

187
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,600
And the other one is a stronger skater.

188
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,580
A-ho!

189
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,660
Huh?

190
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,960
You're...

191
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,200
You're...

192
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,680
Volvo Saigo!

193
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,800
Are you trying to betray us, even though you're a man?

194
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,560
Ryo-san, the sea is wonderful.

195
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,340
I really want to go there.

196
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,680
Then why?

197
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,260
I think there's a nice group of girls who go to the sea.

198
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,440
That's wonderful.

199
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,520
You're too naive.

200
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:32,860
I'm not.

201
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,740
You're too naive.

202
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,400
Show yourself.

203
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,300
You're too naive.

204
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,060
You still haven't told me anything!

205
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,580
That's enough, boys!

206
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,600
I'll sink before the nearest bank.

207
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
I see.

208
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,360
How pitiful.

209
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,720
That's it.

210
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,920
In this way, I'm on your side now.

211
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,080
We still have an enemy here.

212
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,720
But I'm still more than good.

213
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,020
The fact that we have two is really strong.

214
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,580
Maybe he can win without showing his true power.

215
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Now, I will explain the rules.

216
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,480
The basic rules are hide and seek.

217
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,120
First, you play rock-paper-scissors to decide who the demon is.

218
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,940
The competition starts when someone other than the demon kicks the can.

219
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,340
The demon picks up the can.

220
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,440
Before the other person can stand in the original place, the other person can hide.

221
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,400
When the demon finds the other person, he will quickly go back to the can and step on the can.

222
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,500
At this time, he must say "Poko-pen".

223
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,900
He must say "Nagagawa Mikke Poko-pen".

224
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,700
What does that mean?

225
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,180
Well, that's...

226
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,280
You don't know?

227
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:43,940
It's a pen.

228
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't care what it means.

229
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,340
It's Poko-pen anyway.

230
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,540
Even in our village, it was Poko-pen.

231
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,660
In my village, we just say the name and step on it.

232
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,040
In my village, we say "Dare dare Mikke".

233
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,360
One, two, three...

234
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,400
Did we step on it three times?

235
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,500
If everyone finds it, it's over.

236
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,700
However, if someone who hasn't found it kicks the can, it's all a joke.

237
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,420
Well, let's try it once.

238
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,120
Rock-paper-scissors!

239
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,800
Rock-paper-scissors!

240
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,400
You're making a mistake.

241
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,720
Okay, let's go.

242
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,640
Are you going to move?

243
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,280
Oh, my!

244
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Oh, no!

245
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,320
Oh, my!

246
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,880
That stupid power!

247
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,160
It's a completely ordinary park.

248
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,880
In a place like this,

249
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,820
I'm sure that the place where the amateur is hiding is a good place to go.

250
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,100
Look for it.

251
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,180
Yeah!

252
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,560
One, two, three...

253
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,400
One, two, three...

254
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,580
Oh, no!

255
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,880
You didn't say "Poko-Penta" just now!

256
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,120
I did.

257
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,300
You didn't lie, did you?

258
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,420
No.

259
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,140
I think I said one, two, three.

260
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,560
Oh, no.

261
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,100
I almost did it when I was a child.

262
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,940
And it seems that you stepped on the can three times.

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm not used to it, so I stepped on it many times.

264
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,880
I've heard that there are some rules for stepping on it three times.

265
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,860
Komachi, you're really...

266
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,940
I've said I've never done it, right?

267
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,720
Well, that's fine.

268
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,740
Today's just a practice.

269
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,220
If you make a mistake in the real game, I'll check it hard.

270
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,620
I got it.

271
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,660
Then I'll resume.

272
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,080
Yeah.

273
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,660
Look for it, Poko-Penta.

274
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,700
Oh, no!

275
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,860
It's dirty.

276
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,980
Is that possible?

277
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,600
It's better not to hide it soon.

278
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,020
Damn it.

279
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,820
I'll give it back in the real game.

280
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,560
I'll find it in the real game.

281
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:56,820
Oh!

282
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,140
I'm going to die of pain.

283
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,000
But with this, no.

284
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,220
It doesn't matter when you play.

285
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:17,100
There's no need to worry.

286
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,700
It was a game.

287
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,520
A game.

288
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:21,980
Yes, it was a game.

289
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,120
Then, that's okay.

290
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,800
Thank you.

291
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:24,940
We have invited director Koizuro

292
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,720
Hello

293
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,560
Is the two of you hoping for the sea or the mountains?

294
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,080
No, I don't care where I want to be

295
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,840
Me too

296
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,220
They were the two who talked in front of the building

297
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,260
Here comes the judge Tetsuo Ishizu

298
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,360
The player is here

299
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,460
Enter

300
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,840
The men's team enters

301
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,780
Ryotsu Kankichi is the captain

302
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,780
Behind him are Keiichi Nakagawa, Hayato Honda, Yoichi Terai and Tatsunosuke Sakonji

303
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,940
You can do it!

304
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,180
It's the sea

305
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,200
The captain is Komachi Ono

306
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,840
Naoko Seisho, Reiko Akimoto, Ai Asato

307
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,220
The score is 1 point

308
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,480
The two teams will go to the sea

309
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:24,600
I can smell the salt

310
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,460
The view is great

311
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,000
Let me explain the rules

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,060
First, the sea team will be the first to find the demon

313
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,640
and the rest of the team will hide

314
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,140
The demon will find the team within 10 minutes

315
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,740
The winner will win

316
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,560
Anyone else will lose

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,340
The competition will be held 5 times

318
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,340
The winner will be given a chance to choose the team

319
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,280
Don't forget the "Poco pen" when you step on the can.

320
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,880
Now, let's go to the first team, Umi team!

321
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,820
I'm here!

322
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,580
I've been waiting for you, Daizo-ryu!

323
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,100
He suddenly hit the ace.

324
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,540
It's okay, he's not going to lose.

325
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,660
Now, the first Umi team, Ryo-tsu Kankichi's captain suddenly appears!

326
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,180
Before the game, Ryo-tsu said he was 200% confident about winning.

327
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,340
Ryo-tsu, could you show us your ability?

328
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:23,940
Let's go!

329
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,060
I'm counting on you.

330
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,360
The game starts!

331
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,060
He hit the ace!

332
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,780
Oh, the last one, Volvo! Are you nervous?

333
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,100
He hit the ace suddenly!

334
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,240
Hurry up and hide!

335
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,560
It's over!

336
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,020
Naoko, Mikke, Poco pen! Volvo, Mikke, Poco pen!

337
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,860
There are two of them!

338
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,580
Let's go into the cage!

339
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,680
They're not hiding far away.

340
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,560
Naoko, Mikke, Poco pen!

341
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,120
Maria, Mikke, Poco pen!

342
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,220
This is amazing!

343
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,120
We found four of them in a blink of an eye!

344
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,260
I wish I could work like this every day.

345
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,060
As expected of a town-suit.

346
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,960
But from my point of view,

347
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,860
this is still far behind.

348
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,760
There are a lot of bags!

349
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,960
You were in for it!

350
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,040
Oh, no!

351
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,920
If you make a gap in the back,

352
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,280
you'll be nowhere to be seen!

353
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,580
Oh, no!

354
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,260
I didn't know you read my movements!

355
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,980
Oh, no!

356
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,520
I found Komachi, Poco pen!

357
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,300
That's all.

358
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,500
We won the game!

359
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,860
Ryo-tsu got them!

360
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,020
He found everyone in just 2 minutes!

361
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,660
It's all over!

362
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,840
No way! I'm not going to lose!

363
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,840
It's not your fault.

364
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,980
That's right. The civilization is a game that is useless.

365
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,280
As long as I don't lose...

366
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,780
Besides, it's not like we're still in a competition.

367
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,160
High school team, the demon is ahead!

368
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,720
Then, as planned, I'll go.

369
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,820
Good luck.

370
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,860
What?

371
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,220
Oh, no, it's fine. Just be careful with both movements.

372
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,720
I know. Leave it to me.

373
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,040
No, I can't win.

374
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,680
There's too much difference in my career.

375
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,300
Begin!

376
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,300
That's it!

377
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,140
Oh, it's Nakagawa-san's trick!

378
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:27,760
Hide!

379
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,900
Well, this way?

380
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,280
You're too aggressive, Naoko.

381
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,100
If you're in that position, you'll easily get the bag.

382
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,340
Oh, no!

383
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,700
Naoko!

384
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,340
Oh, Ryotsu Kankichi!

385
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,520
Your secret spot is deep enough!

386
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,260
Ryotsu was able to get the bag before any demon found him.

387
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,420
Will it play out in a one-sided manner?

388
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,260
I suggest to you that this is what I mean by experiencing the intended situation.

389
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,700
So, Yann Lyoko is gone.

390
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,700
Please begin round two.

391
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,660
Honda, next is your turn. Show me what you've got.

392
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,280
Okay, Senpai.

393
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,020
Okay, this time...

394
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,620
Good luck, Mr. Golubo!

395
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,420
Wait a minute.

396
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,320
I think Maria should kick here.

397
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,080
Me?

398
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,680
I see. You're a former kickboxer.

399
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,800
I see.

400
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,860
Maria, can you show me your shoes?

401
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,500
Hajime!

402
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,140
Here I go!

403
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,760
This is amazing kick power!

404
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,980
It's a ridiculous distance!

405
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,060
Hajime!

406
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,360
What a kickboxer.

407
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,880
But he's too fast.

408
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,860
It can't be...

409
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,040
He's got a metal ring on him!

410
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,800
Does he fly with a metal ring?

411
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,280
It's the same as hitting him with a metal bat.

412
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,160
I see.

413
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,740
He was banned when I was a kid.

414
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,040
I can't believe he's using such a trick.

415
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,180
I found it.

416
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,780
It's late!

417
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,540
I found it!

418
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,560
You're gonna lose to the demon in a short time!

419
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,260
I did it!

420
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,420
If you're a metal ring, you're a gold ring!

421
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,560
It's a metal bat!

422
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,740
Please let me go!

423
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,760
What kind of guy is he?

424
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,400
He's a heavy metal bat and his distance is explosive.

425
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,100
It's a trick made by the power of the primitive.

426
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,700
Akimoto is finally back.

427
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,400
But the time limit is too long.

428
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,320
The two captains were called to judge.

429
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,800
In the future, the act of kicking a can with metal, wood, and stone is prohibited.

430
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,480
It's a ban, after all.

431
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,260
What?

432
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,800
I can win if I do it normally.

433
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,640
The next demon was a monk.

434
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,900
Yeah.

435
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,520
Show me the strength of the experienced.

436
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,100
In this case, the other side is the advantage.

437
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,680
Um, I'll go to the other side.

438
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,720
What is it, Komachi?

439
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,180
I just came up with it.

440
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,280
How about this?

441
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,360
Hurry up and hide!

442
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,240
Hey, Terai, pick it up quickly!

443
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:15,780
All right!

444
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,940
Now, Terai has started the investigation.

445
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,060
I want you to do a thorough investigation.

446
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,640
Ah, Toko-san!

447
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,300
Go!

448
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,040
Pokopen!

449
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,420
Too bad!

450
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,360
It's me!

451
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,440
Ah!

452
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,820
Maria-san!

453
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,640
The demon's defeat due to the difference in people!

454
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,400
Idiot!

455
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,000
It's the basic principle to change your hair and clothes and deceive the demon!

456
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,920
Sorry, I was careless.

457
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,220
Damn it!

458
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,660
I did it, just as Komachi-chan said!

459
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,760
The operation was successful, right?

460
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,200
Amazing!

461
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,600
I'll use my brain a little.

462
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,520
Hey, Komachi!

463
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,380
You're an experienced person, aren't you?

464
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,080
I'm not, right?

465
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,720
I don't know anything about this country-like play, right?

466
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,240
Hmm, is that so?

467
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,220
Whiliyor...

468
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,100
A.

469
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,200
You failed to defeat both the demon and the demon-like heroine!

470
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,180
What the!

471
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,160
I have been shocked that you defeated both of them in one round!

472
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,360
It was close...

473
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,300
Team Uni's final attack failed!

474
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,660
They finally defeated Yume's team!

475
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,540
The last attack of Team Mountain. If the demon loses here, Team Sea wins!

476
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,460
If they win, they will enter the extension of the Sudden Death.

477
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,120
The last demon is Team Mountain's captain, Ono Komatsu!

478
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,560
But, Kankeli has no experience at all. Team Mountain is in a pinch!

479
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:53,860
I can see the sea.

480
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,180
Kon-deki!

481
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,380
If this happens, it can't be helped. Kankeli Komatsu can't lose!

482
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,740
Nakagawa-san, Mikkei! Terai-san, Mikkei!

483
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,220
Poko-pen!

484
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,720
Honde-san, Mikkei!

485
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,240
This is amazing! We'll find him with a fierce momentum!

486
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,700
Sakonji-san, Mikkei!

487
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,440
What!?

488
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,460
Poko-pen!

489
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,620
Ono Komatsu has found four people already! Only Ryouchi is left!

490
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,520
Four people in an instant... Komachi, you're not just a normal person.

491
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,640
But, you're also...

492
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,000
I'll be the last one to laugh! I'll show you the ultimate secret of the city!

493
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,420
Where are you, Ryouchi-Kankechi?

494
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,840
Ryouchi...

495
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,460
A cute cat?

496
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,020
The sound of sandals...

497
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
A duck...

498
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,240
A cat!?

499
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,700
There's no monkey!

500
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,220
Where are you, Ryouchi!?

501
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,680
Stop!

502
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,600
Stop!

503
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,980
It's my house!

504
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,680
I've got a plan!

505
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Senpai, let's go!

506
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,500
Komachi-chan, hurry up!

507
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,060
No, I can't make it in time!

508
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,720
I can see the sea beyond the ship!

509
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:30,840
You're not going to put me on a boat, are you?

510
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,580
Get out of here!

511
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,060
I'm not going to be called Komachi!

512
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,040
Hey, stop!

513
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,800
Takeshi, stop!

514
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,360
Come on, one second!

515
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:40,620
Just stay there!

516
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,400
Don't be afraid!

517
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,800
What?!

518
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:45,900
I'll do it too!

519
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,320
Hey, Brother!

520
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,380
You're not going to make it in time!

521
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:46,560
Why won't you stop, Kiryu?

522
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,560
I'll show you what I've got!

523
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,200
Okay!

524
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,360
Hold your horses!

525
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,480
Hold your horses!

526
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,800
Yeeeeesss!

527
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,040
You betcha!

528
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,460
That's enough! The demon is defeated!

529
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,640
The rock-paper-scissors match is 1 to 0, and the Umi team wins!

530
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,800
We did it!

531
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:11,900
Yay!

532
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,560
We won!

533
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,240
Rock-paper-scissors Komachi!

534
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,580
I lost to a rock-paper-scissors for the first time in my life!

535
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,420
Komachi...

536
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,020
Ugh! I won!

537
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,340
Rock-paper-scissors Komachi

538
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,440
Rock-paper-scissors Komachi

539
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,500
I lost!

540
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,360
Well, the Umi team is having fun.

541
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,180
Yeah, because...

542
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,820
Ryo and Kanki are not here!

543
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,640
Rock-paper-scissors Komachi

544
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,040
I won!

545
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,860
I won because of me!

546
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,520
Let's change the date!

547
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,920
Rock-paper-scissors Komachi

548
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,900

553
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:40,140
I want to be your friend even if it's hot

554
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:46,000
I want to be loved

555
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,620
I feel like we're melting so much that everyone hates us

556
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,600
I want to shoot you

557
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,180
I want to love you

558
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,780
For some reason, love is just cowardice

559
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,400
How many times do I have to force myself!

560
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,140
Please don't hide everything

561
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,740
"There's no secret if it's not real love"

562
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,820
Ohh, I can see! I can see! I can see a future!

563
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,980
I'm the most reviver in the modern world, the great author, Nostrad 18

564
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,760
That's what I'm meant to do!

565
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,920
Come and be a great還有�家 in the Tatsuchika Fiction Library!

566
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,580
You have to come!

567
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,020
Let's predict your future!

568
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,500
Next time, "Nostradios! Daigouge!"

Let's do it!
