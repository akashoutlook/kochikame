Strike!

29
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,120
What did you say?

30
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,380
Did you say that Levald went to Europe?

31
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,660
He wanted to be the main focus of Paris and London.

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,380
He's still a lively old man.

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,960
What?

34
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,520
You're a fake brand manager?

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,560
You're a terrible businessman.

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,000
Japanese people have a strong brand reputation.

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,820
But many people don't know anything about it.

38
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,260
Is our rice okay?

39
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,100
The young lady is making the rice, so it's okay.

40
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,480
Lemon is making the rice?

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,080
She's making it now.

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,720
It's okay.

43
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,720
Niigata Uonuma's Koshihikari.

44
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,360
It's 100%!

45
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,480
Uonuma's Koshihikari is 100%!

46
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,440
That's great! It's real!

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,600
Thank you very much!

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,740
100%!

49
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,140
We're in the next round.

50
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:54,980
Yes.

51
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,120
Sasanishiki is 80%.

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,860
Akitabijin is 10%.

53
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,860
Echigo-Nishiki is 10%.

54
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,280
What?

55
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,540
Sasanishiki is 80%, Akitabijin is 10%, and Echigo-Nishiki is 10%.

56
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,100
What?

57
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,000
We were mixed up after all!

58
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,720
Will mine be okay?

59
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,740
Let's find out quickly!

60
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,780
He's really being very inquisitive.

61
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,380
I'm making rice.

62
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
The rice factory is also in Sotokanda Town.

63
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,980
Don't ask such a thing to a kindergarten student.

64
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,500
Phew. This is the end.

65
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,340
Good work.

66
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,880
Then, next.

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,400
I have a summer zhen preparation.

68
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,220
Please enjoy it.

69
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,720
There are many things.

70
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,540
Summer zhen is the main character of our party.

71
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Which one?

72
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,500
Then, this is the breakfast for today.

73
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,080
Eh? There is more?

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,840
It's hard.

75
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,520
Ryotsu-san.

76
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,980
Could you deliver a lunch box to Matoi while you go to the library?

77
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,320
Eh? Oh, sorry.

78
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,440
I can't go today because of the schedule.

79
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,980
Ah, no. I'll go.

80
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,780
Hankichi!

81
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,700
The preparation is not finished yet, right?

82
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,480
I'm hungry.

83
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,520
I'm hungry.

84
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:18,640
Come on.

85
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,200
Lemon will go to Matoi when he returns from kindergarten.

86
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,340
Really?

87
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,500
Then, I'll leave it to you, Lemon.

88
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,620
Miss, after you finish eating, there will be a meal party for Meiten Ryorikai.

89
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,060
I got it.

90
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Hmm. It's a hard schedule.

91
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,660
Hmm.

92
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,440
Hmm.

93
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,100
Oh, Lemon-chan. You came.

94
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,900
As always, you're cute.

95
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,720
Is Matoi here?

96
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,160
Cute!

97
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,540
Huh?

98
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,560
It's almost lunch time. Let's have lunch together.

99
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,360
Come here, Lemon-chan.

100
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,040
Um.

101
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,860
Sorry, Lemon. I was saved.

102
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,440
Wow, Matoi-chan's lunch box is amazing.

103
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,300
Show me. Show me.

104
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,300
Yeah.

105
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,180
Wow, it looks delicious.

106
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,680
Do you want to eat it?

107
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,380
Huh?

108
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm happy, but I'm on a diet.

109
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,600
How about you, Komachi-senpai?

110
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,960
Me too. Sorry.

111
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,800
I have to go on a diet.

112
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,200
Diet is important, right?

113
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,680
Matoi, what is diet?

114
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,060
It's to lose weight and look beautiful.

115
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,000
Hmm. Do you want to lose weight so much?

116
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,820
Recently, men are more likely to lose weight.

117
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,080
I heard that's good for you.

118
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,540
So I only eat this much for lunch.

119
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,080
I eat this much, too.

120
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
You're so small.

121
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,320
Matoi, Mikan-chan is here.

122
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,120
Hi.

123
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,080
You must be feeling good.

124
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,800
Good job.

125
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,120
You're so fluffy, Mikan.

126
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,600
You're warm.

127
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,860
You're great.

128
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,320
Hi.

129
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:12,760
Hi.

130
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,620
Wow.

131
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,380
You're not warm here.

132
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,260
Oh, dear.

133
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,760
Hey, is that a water bottle?

134
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,560
Hey.

135
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,240
Look!

136
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,820
Look what's here.

137
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,320
Y-You're going to get it right now?

138
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,500
Hmm?

139
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,500
Ms. Cherry, there's another one.

140
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,560
Ah.

141
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:37,660
Huh?

142
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,380
Ah, no, it's nothing. Good night.

143
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,920
What happened?

144
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,920
He was very depressed.

145
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,100
What? He stopped tasting?

146
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,660
That's sudden. I'm in trouble.

147
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,060
Miss, please.

148
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,620
I don't want to eat anything. I don't want to anymore.

149
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,620
What?

150
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,500
What are you going to do with the taste of today's dish?

151
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,460
Who's going to see it?

152
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,760
Calm down.

153
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,820
It's me, Ita-cho.

154
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,240
Oh, Ita-cho. I see.

155
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,220
How is it, Ita-cho?

156
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,700
It's not like this, is it?

157
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,800
Maybe.

158
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,120
Ita-cho, please be confident.

159
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,860
Is it okay?

160
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,480
Anyway, let's all ask him.

161
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,420
Yes.

162
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,960
How is it?

163
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,340
I don't know.

164
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,000
It's difficult.

165
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,040
You can't give him something weird.

166
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,220
Yes.

167
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:52,900
Yes.

168
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,400
It's impossible if it's not Lemon-chan.

169
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,040
Today's dinner is finished.

170
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,000
Can I eat it?

171
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,760
It's not.

172
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,680
It doesn't taste like the flow of Chokanda.

173
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,280
Ita-cho, there's something wrong with Chokanda?

174
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,180
Ah, no, nothing's wrong!

175
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,140
I'm sorry!

176
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,460
I'll do my best!

177
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:21,620
I'll do it!

178
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,100
What is this?

179
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,300
I'm disappointed.

180
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,960
Excuse me, sir. Please wait.

182
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,360
Excuse me. I'm not in a good condition today.

183
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,460
It's not the usual.

184
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,300
The power of lemon's power of listening is amazing.

185
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,100
Excuse me.

186
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,060
Oh, my God.

187
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,880
Matoi!

188
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,720
Where is the lemon? The store is in a panic.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
I recognize that the lemon was an important thing.

190
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,880
Matoi, did you find anything?

191
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Even if you say so ...

192
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,500
Oh, that's it.

193
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,920
Do you have any idea?

194
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,020
Maybe I'm worried about getting fat, so I'm on a diet.

195
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,320
Diet?

196
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,520
I heard about Komachi-senpai's diet.

197
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,340
It's not a kindergarten.

198
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,140
But I haven't eaten much in a while, Lemon.

199
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,700
I'm hungry.

200
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,980
Oh, come to think of it ...

201
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,160
Let's eat!

202
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,400
Thank you for the meal.

203
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,440
Is that all?

204
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,220
Then I'll take this too.

205
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,900
He certainly didn't eat.

206
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,660
But he's not the type to go on a diet.

207
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,640
All right, I'll ask him.

208
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,920
What?

209
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,760
What?

210
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,740
What?

211
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,140
What is it?

212
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,980
Not only eating, but also eating breakfast and dinner.

213
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,960
You haven't eaten well, have you?

214
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,320
What are you talking about?

215
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,260
Are you on a diet, Lemon?

216
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,420
I'm not doing that.

217
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,000
Look at your eyes and answer.

218
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,080
I'm full.

219
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,520
I'm full.

220
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,780
I'm full.

221
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,460
Be honest, Lemon.

222
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,120
I'm full.

223
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,680
I'm full.

224
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,060
I'm full.

225
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm full.

226
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm full.

227
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,480
I'm full.

228
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:14,600
I'm full.

229
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,180
I'm full.

230
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,340
I'm full.

231
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm full.

232
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,580
I'm full.

233
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:21,960
I'm full.

234
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,840
I'm full.

235
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,680
I'm full.

236
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,680
I'm full.

237
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,440
I'm full.

238
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,420
I'm full.

239
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,120
I'm full.

240
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm full.

241
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,620
I'm full.

242
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,320
I'm full.

243
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,440
I'm full.

244
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:36,540
I'm full.

245
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,060
I'm full.

246
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,700
I'm full.

247
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,720
I'm full.

248
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:38,980
I'm full.

249
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,060
I'm full.

250
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,120
I'm full.

251
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm full.

252
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:39,760
I'm full.

253
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm full.

254
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,580
I'm full.

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,460
115 kilograms.

256
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,020
I'll be 165 kilograms by the time I'm 20 years old.

257
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,680
When I grow up, I'll be a sumo wrestler.

258
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,840
No, no!

259
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,120
You're talking about your weight.

260
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,440
You're not counting on getting taller at all.

261
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,820
That's right.

262
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,180
But I don't want to be 165 kilograms!

263
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,780
I'm leaving!

264
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,580
Hey, Lemon!

265
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,880
Lemon!

266
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,820
Everyone...

267
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,940
I'm sorry.

268
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,680
This is for my diet.

269
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,280
Lemon!

270
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,520
I can't eat anymore!

271
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,700
This is bad.

272
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,940
If I keep this up, the Cho Kanda Sushi will collapse,

273
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,300
and I won't be able to work anymore.

274
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,580
You guys, don't panic!

275
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,120
The taste of Cho Kanda Sushi...

276
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,500
is this Ryotsu Kankitsuya!

277
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,220
The taste of Cho Kanda Sushi...

278
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,500
is this Ryotsu Kankitsuya!

279
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,360
the taste of Cho Kanda Sushi...

280
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:49,680
The taste of Cho Kanda Sushi...

281
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:49,860
is this Ryotsu Kankitsuya!

282
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,100
Listen up,

283
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,140
you know what they call food?

284
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,920
It's dashi!

285
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,320
It's dashi!

286
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,760
It's dashi!

287
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,300
I just need to slurp it!

288
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,100
This isn't enough!

289
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,980
Bring more!

290
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,920
All right!

291
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:07,320
All right!

292
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,660
What do you think, Ryo-san?

293
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,820
No! We need something!

294
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,240
That's right! Let's add some sauce!

295
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,720
-What? -What?

296
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,860
Sauce in the soup?

297
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,760
In this city, anything with sauce is fine!

298
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,340
This isn't the way the director wants it to be!

299
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,060
I've changed the seasoning a little.

300
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,100
Oh, no!

301
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,020
Oh, no!

302
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,740
Kan-kichi!

303
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,260
It's over.

304
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,040
Super Kanda-sushi.

305
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,060
Yes.

306
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,180
It's dangerous in here.

307
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,280
Where are you, Ryo-san?

308
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,560
Where are you, Ryo-san?

309
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
What's wrong with you?

310
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,420
You're going to get a head ache if you get this in your ear!

311
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,260
That's true.

312
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
We couldn't do it because we were so dependent on you.

313
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,700
You can't start reflecting on it now.

314
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,340
To get through this situation,

315
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,000
we have to stop Lemon's diet!

316
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,920
But how?

317
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,780
One more time!

318
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,240
One more time!

319
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,480
Leave it to me!

320
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,180
Where did this earthquake come from?

321
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,300
Where did this earthquake come from?

322
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,420
Where did this earthquake come from?

323
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,440
Ryo-san, you called me at the right time.

324
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,780
Actually, I'm developing a new diet machine.

325
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,280
Amazing, Lemon!

326
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,360
It's a diet machine!

327
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,600
Amazing, Lemon!

328
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,820
In the first place, you're gaining too many calories!

329
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,620
Exercise is the best way to lose weight!

330
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,820
First, this!

331
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,880
Exercise is the best way to lose weight!

332
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,620
What's this?

333
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,340
Can't you tell?

334
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,300
It's a running machine.

335
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,320
That's not it!

336
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,560
Why are there lions?

337
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,480
Come on, Lemon.

338
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,300
Try it.

339
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,460
I'm scared!

340
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,680
Kan-kichi, do it for me!

341
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,240
I can't help it.

342
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,500
What?

343
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,180
First, jogging mode.

344
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,740
And then, life-saving mode.

345
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:37,740
This?

346
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:37,860
Oh, no, no, no!

347
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,200
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

348
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,520
You're running too hard like this because it's hard to see, so you're forced to lose weight naturally.

349
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,640
You stupid!

350
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,220
How could I let Lemon use this kind of dangerous tool!

351
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,660
Looks like it's going to be a medication, huh?

352
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,500
Let's move on.

353
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,080
What's this time?

354
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,260
Did you not see?

355
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,900
You're kidding me!

356
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,700
Huh?

357
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,420
Eh?

358
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:04,780
Hm?

359
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:06,780
Ouch!

360
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,660
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

361
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,300
Stop!

362
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,760
-Stop it! -Like this,

363
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,200
-If you burn the fat, you can lose weight in an instant! -Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

364
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,260
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

365
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,060
What are you doing? This is embarrassing!

366
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,680
Now, Lemon-chan, here you go.

367
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,800
I'm not doing anything!

368
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,840
I was stupid to ask Spark to do it!

369
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,200
Then, how about this?

370
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,960
I don't need to explain.

371
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,360
Ignore it and move on to the next plan!

372
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,840
-I'm not doing anything! -I'm not doing anything!

373
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,380
I'm on a diet, after all!

374
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,920
-Diet, diet. -Diet, diet.

375
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,440
Ah, this is...

376
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,000
Senpai, you're the best!

377
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,620
This lobster is the best!

378
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,480
It's even better when you grill the tuna.

379
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,800
You're right! We're grilling super-high-calorie ingredients!

380
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,140
Hey, Lemon, how about we do it together?

381
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,720
-Come on! -Come on!

382
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,160
Come on!

383
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,120
Let's stop dieting and eat together!

384
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,760
Okay!

385
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,120
Lucky, let's stop dieting.

386
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,320
Ouch! What did you say?

387
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,240
The smoke is getting on my eyes, so I came to warn you!

388
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,520
You're so stubborn!

389
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,400
All right, next up is steak with beef shimofuri.

390
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,260
-Aha! -Aha!

391
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
How's that, Lemon?

392
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,080
It's my first time eating such a thick steak!

393
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,740
It's so good!

394
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,140
It's so good!

395
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,880
I've never eaten such a thick steak before!

396
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,760
I've never eaten such a thick steak before!

397
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,880
What was it? Did you say it was "amano"?

398
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,580
It's called "amano-iwato".

399
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,080
Lemon!

400
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,420
You're no good!

401
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,440
Kankichi, what are you going to do?

402
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,760
I still have a plan!

403
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,400
Nakagawa!

404
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,040
Yes?

405
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,080
There's an era drama on TV sponsored by the Nakagawa Group, right?

406
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,600
Um, is it "Gin-san in the Underground Mountain"?

407
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,900
Oh...

408
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,600
It's been a long day.

409
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,700
I want to go to Chikayama.

410
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,180
Don't!

411
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,980
Gin-san in the Underground Mountain!

412
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,420
Why are you so skinny?

413
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,680
I just ordered the popular diet, so...

414
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,060
If you have any complaints, this sakura...

415
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,420
Hey, everyone!

416
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,220
Did you find out how uncool the diet is?

417
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,780
Ouch!

418
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,640
Don't make fun of Gin-san!

419
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,220
That's not good, Ryo-san!

420
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,400
What are you going to do?

421
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,480
Then the restaurant will be destroyed before my mother comes back.

422
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,880
Kankichi, do you have any other hands?

423
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,580
No, I don't have any more.

424
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,760
Welcome.

425
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,020
Hello.

426
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,720
Kankichi's grandfather.

427
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,460
Ryo's grandfather?

428
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,280
That means, an old man?

429
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,060
Nice to meet you.

430
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
One greeting is not needed.

431
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,360
What are you doing here?

432
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,820
I heard that Kankichi is working part-time.

433
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,000
So I came.

434
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,520
Come in.

435
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,140
Hello.

436
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,040
Excuse me.

437
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,720
Father, mother.

438
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,320
Son, son.

439
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,040
No, it's been a long time.

440
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,400
Please have a seat.

441
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,960
Please sit down.

442
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,960
Kankichi, please have a drink.

443
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,640
What do you drink?

444
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,060
Do you have money?

445
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,200
Just a drink is enough.

446
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,040
For the time being, it's beer.

447
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,360
What do you want me to grab?

448
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:31,800
I don't know.

449
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,900
I'm fine with Nami's bowl.

450
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,780
What are you doing?

451
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,900
We are relatives.

452
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,220
You're going to give me cheap, aren't you?

453
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,120
Yoroshiku-kun.

454
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,820
Yes, of course.

455
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,220
I read it.

456
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,320
I heard that Gepard is a layman.

457
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,260
What?

458
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,720
Where did he go?

459
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,400
It's like you're drunk.

460
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,360
I wrote it on your face.

461
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,760
I don't know where I heard it,

462
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,660
but this old man is really a hell of a man.

463
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,760
Well, Ryo.

464
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,720
Everyone,

465
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,540
What would you like to eat?

466
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,720
First, Otoro, Uni and abalone.

467
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,120
I'll have that too.

468
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,800
I'll have the same.

469
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,720
Did you come to destroy the restaurant?

470
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,620
This is today's dinner.

471
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,760
It looks delicious.

472
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,440
It's over in a flash.

473
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,160
What?

474
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,240
You guys don't have money, that's enough.

475
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,100
I don't want to eat.

476
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,820
Bring me a chicken.

477
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,360
And Otoro, hurry up.

478
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,220
Yes.

479
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,740
What's this commotion?

480
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,580
The Kankichi's parents and grandfather are here.

481
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,420
They're here.

482
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,940
There was such a good octopus in it.

483
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,900
That's...

484
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,720
Stop it.

485
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,500
Let's eat.

486
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,820
Don't make it a little bit.

487
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,140
Lemon.

488
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,080
It's not a customer who makes food a little bit.

489
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm sorry.

490
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,040
It's impossible for such a small child to be careful.

491
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,380
Kankichi, dad.

492
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,700
Clean up properly.

493
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
Kankichi, here.

494
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,200
Wait, Lemon.

495
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,280
What, Kankichi?

496
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,560
You're on a diet leaving your breakfast.

497
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,600
It's the same as making food a little bit.

498
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,560
If you say that...

499
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,720
What's wrong with you?

500
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,300
Are you on a diet?

501
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,940
If you do that, you'll become an idiot like him.

502
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,020
You're the idiot.

503
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,480
What?

504
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,980
Lemon.

505
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,660
Matoi, leave this to me.

506
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,040
The boys here don't understand how girls feel.

507
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,400
What's the story?

508
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,660
It was the first time I met Lemon.

509
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,140
I'm the mother of Kankichi.

510
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:57,560
I'm the mother of Kankichi.

511
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:57,580
I'm the mother of Kankichi.

512
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
And I'm the parents' wife, Lemon.

513
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,000
Lemon, could you talk to me for a little while?

514
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,080
When you were a child, your dream was to eat a lot.

515
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,300
You've never eaten?

516
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,700
That's right.

517
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,640
There was a war a long time ago.

518
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,920
Tokyo was also a place of the wild.

519
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,380
It wasn't a time when you were allowed to eat freely.

520
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,360
There was no rice.

521
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,220
I could only eat sweet potatoes or sweet soup.

522
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,120
I even made sweet potatoes in the school yard.

523
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,460
But I was hungry.

524
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,680
So I went to the field with my classmates and ate sweet potatoes.

525
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,820
Did you eat it raw?

526
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,280
Yes. I can't forget that taste.

527
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,800
Lemon-chan is not fat.

528
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,860
She is growing up to become an adult.

529
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,760
Growing up?

530
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,400
Children eat a lot and grow up quickly.

531
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,460
I think everyone is worried.

532
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,000
Everyone?

533
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,860
We are grownups and should eat healthy food regularly.

534
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,040
Your daughter is giving me a feast again?!

535
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,660
I will eat it.

536
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,680
Lemon-chan is coming again.

537
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,260
Sorry.

538
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,920
I eat dinner.

539
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,140
I also lose weight.

540
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,540
Why is food not good?

541
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,820
But dieting is not good.

542
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,180
You have to eat well during growth period.

543
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,360
I think we have passed the growth period.

544
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,280
Dieting is not good.

545
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,080
Welcome.

546
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,860
Eat all the tangerines without leaving any.

547
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,740
Because it is the growth period.

548
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,780
Lemon has changed a lot.

549
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,640
It looks like a noisy old woman.

550
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,060
Ryo, this is it.

551
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,800
1 million yen for the application?

552
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,320
The man told me to give it to Ryo.

553
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,080
What?

554
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,200
I have to go to the gas station today.

555
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,820
Damn it.

556
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,320
I am confused with them.

557
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,860
Damn it.

558
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,180
I will pay for everything.

559
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,900
10 ي.

560
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,540
10 ي.

561
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,180
