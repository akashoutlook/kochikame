Ryo-tsu the King of Invention

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,640
Sauce.

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,860
Soy sauce.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,400
Sauce.

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Soy sauce.

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,240
I don't care who says it, it's the sauce.

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,740
I'm not saying it stupidly. It's soy sauce.

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,220
Good morning, Kanchi.

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,340
What are you making a fuss about in the morning?

34
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,600
I'm talking about what to put on the fried egg.

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,680
You're making a fuss about that in the morning?

36
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,640
Matoi is the sauce, right?

37
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,060
I'm the soy sauce, right?

38
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,040
I'm the salt, though.

39
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,340
What?

40
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,580
Lemon is...

41
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,320
The sauce, right?

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,440
Soy sauce, right?

43
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,840
I won't put anything on it.

44
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,340
Huh?

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,280
The best thing is to taste it as it is.

46
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,600
So, it's decided on soy sauce, right?

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,020
It's not decided, right?

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,560
Then, I'll put soy sauce on my fried egg!

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
I'm the law here.

50
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,020
The sauce has been decided on the fried egg for a long time!

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,460
Hey!

52
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,560
Kanchi!

53
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,060
Hmph, even if it's not super simple sushi, there are places where you can eat other food.

54
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,340
Ryo-tsu is not here.

55
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:28,540
Really?

56
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,060
Are you late again?

57
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,000
I can't help it.

58
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,560
I'll squeeze you when you come out.

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,360
Damn it.

60
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,700
I can't get close to the starting point.

61
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,400
There are bicycles and bugs in my stomach.

62
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,240
There must be something in Ryo's dining room.

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,120
W-what's going on?

64
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,900
Oh, Ryo-san!

65
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,480
What's going on?

66
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,200
Ryo's construction is starting today.

67
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,180
I wrote it on the bulletin board a month ago, right?

68
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,900
I didn't know.

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,800
I put your luggage there.

70
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,480
I'll be taken there by mistake.

71
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,940
I wrote your name on it.

72
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,000
That's not it.

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,100
What's wrong with the food in the dining room?

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Is there something wrong?

75
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,240
I used it up yesterday.

76
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,960
It's going to rot.

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,200
I'm going on a trip from now on.

78
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,760
See you, Ryo-san.

79
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,400
Hey, wait a minute.

80
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,900
What's going on? Food?

81
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,000
Food!

82
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,200
I said so.

83
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,900
I'm hungry.

84
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,920
I'm hungry and my bicycle won't burn.

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,500
It's Naruto.

86
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,140
I can't pick up anything as a human.

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,320
But I can't go home hungry.

88
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,000
Hey!

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
Food for humans!

90
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,780
I didn't have time to be lost.

91
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm going to disturb you.

92
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,560
Welcome.

93
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,200
Do you have a cankichi?

94
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,040
If you are Ryo-chan...

95
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,080
I'm working here for a while.

96
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,060
You have a cankichi here as well?

97
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,660
I'm working here for a while.

98
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,540
You're working here for a while.

99
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,340
You're working here for a while.

100
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,840
I've been working here for a while.

101
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
I've been working here for a while.

102
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,620
I fought with my grandmother yesterday and ran away.

103
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,000
I was worried about you.

104
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,400
I searched everywhere and couldn't find you.

105
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,780
I was worried about you.

106
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,300
I thought you were fine.

107
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,580
I'm a little worried.

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,040
I have to use my hands.

109
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:38,960
I'm hungry.

110
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,740
When I'm hungry, I feel the autumn wind.

111
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,880
What?

112
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,560
It's cold.

113
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,380
That car...

114
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:53,980
It's a coincidence.

115
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,020
If we meet in a place like this...

116
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,440
I knew it.

117
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a coincidence to be in a park on a helicopter.

118
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,360
It is a coincidence.

119
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,720
We've searched the room back in the events of PHS.

120
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,100
Who asked you to do it?

121
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,780
Are you the leader?

122
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,840
No, it's not because someone asked me to do it.

123
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,640
I really did it by chance.

124
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,100
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,040
I was asked by Lemon .

126
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,220
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,360
I was asked by Lemon .

128
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,060
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,680
Too bad.

130
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,660
We're having a party at my home from now on.

131
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,920
You're not coming? There's a lot of food.

132
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,720
I didn't ask Lemon-san to let me eat.

133
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,600
I got it, I got it. I don't care about the reason. Let's go.

134
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,660
I'm at my limit.

135
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,520
I ate it, I ate it. I'm back to life.

136
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,640
That's good. Clean up.

137
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,360
What?

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,200
What?

139
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,200
You don't have to clean up.

140
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,900
It's a high-tech house.

141
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,380
The machine moves just by ringing the button.

142
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,400
I'll do it too.

143
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,060
Show me the TV.

144
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,440
Is it broken?

145
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,580
It has a sound of a finger.

146
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,800
It's not responding to other finger patches.

147
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,620
It's not responding to other finger patches.

148
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:15,840
It's not responding to other finger patches.

149
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,180
TV.

150
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,040
It's broken, isn't it?

151
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,640
No way.

152
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,340
I knew it.

153
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,980
TV. TV.

154
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,560
What's going on? TV.

155
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,800
It's broken.

156
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,400
I don't care. I'll use the ultimate remote control.

157
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,400
The ultimate remote control?

158
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,500
Switch on.

159
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,180
It's just a stick.

160
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,180
Next news.

161
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,080
Super electronic machine.

162
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,760
Isn't this your company?

163
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,120
No.

164
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,580
Super electronic machine announced that it will pay a part of the sales of the actualized product to the developer as a compensation.

165
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,820
What?

166
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,520
Is this true?

167
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,340
What's the point of lying?

168
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,740
How much is the part of the sales?

169
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,340
It depends on the sales amount, but if you develop a big hit product, you can get one million.

170
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,140
One million.

171
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,300
One million.

172
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,500
Is this a 100 billion yen project?

173
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,420
No.

174
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,800
100 billion yen.

175
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,060
If I have 100 billion, I will never regret it.

176
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,520
Let me do it, too.

177
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:24,700
What?

178
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,260
I have an idea for a big hit item.

179
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,120
I have it.

180
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,580
Is it done?

181
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,460
Yes.

182
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,440
Use the title. Safety Box.

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:33,900
safelybox.

184
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,580
Pudding can be eaten.

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,380

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,960
In a family with many siblings, they have had the experience of eating the pudding in the refrigerator.

188
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,200
That is the cause of the development of sibling quarrels.

189
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,540
This is how to solve it.

190
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,100
If you do not enter the number, it will not open.

191
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,620
The pudding is completely protected, and the sibling quarrel is gone, and it is two birds with one stone.

192
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,220
If you press the registered number, it will open like this.

193
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,680
It's a big invention, isn't it?

194
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,720
Who will buy it?

195
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,660
If the siblings go and buy pudding,

196
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,860
The number of siblings in the family is decreasing year by year.

197
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,600
How much did the material cost?

198
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,080
It's cheap. It doesn't cost 100,000 yen.

199
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,320
How many houses have such a large amount of money for 100 yen or 200 yen pudding?

200
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,280
But maybe there are 100.

201
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,860
It's not a story.

202
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,080
There are still many ideas.

203
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,780
Next time you can expect.

204
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,020
Next is this.

205
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,420
Safety box.

206
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,300
No manager.

207
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,960
You see the product development.

208
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,500
How is it different from the previous one?

209
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,360
The opening of the lid is faster.

210
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,100
It's not a story.

211
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,740
I'll show you the real product development.

212
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,820
Product development is like this.

213
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,340
Super small batteries are being developed here.

214
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,000
If this is completed,

215
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,320
All battery-powered machines will be small.

216
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,340
The battery revolution will occur.

217
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,820
Of course, sales will be enormous.

218
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,120
This is a selling product.

219
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,040
I see.

220
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,180
Of course, it takes time to develop.

221
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,580
It's not something you can do in one go.

222
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,200
That's right.

223
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,020
If you understand, go back home quietly.

224
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,260
From now on, I'll stay here and develop the product.

225
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,240
It's okay. I'll develop an overwhelming product.

226
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,320
Then I'll lend you this room.

227
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,640
If you lock it in this warehouse,

228
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,640
It may interfere with the people in our company.

229
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,080
What's this?

230
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,380
It's a talking translation robot.

231
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,720
Talking translation robot?

232
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,440
If you talk in Japanese,

233
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,380
It automatically translates to English and speaks to you.

234
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,880
You can also make English into Japanese.

235
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:43,900
What?

236
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,700
It's not theoretically wrong,

237
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
It didn't work well and was suspended.

238
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,500
What a waste.

239
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,260
If you complete this,

240
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,900
Can I get a reward?

241
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,340
If you can complete it.

242
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,380
Okay.

243
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,620
I'll give you a reward.

244
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,380
Let's get started.

245
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,180
Well, making is rough.

246
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,760
It's impossible to make one up by a clumsy man.

247
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,080
For the time being,

248
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,800
I remodeled as the design figure with the ability that I had in making plastic models.

249
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,660
There it is, the switch.

250
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,420
I'm tired and sleepy...

251
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,140
Stripping.

252
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:19,660
What?

253
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,060
Didn't you talk to him just now?

254
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,920
Yes, I did.

255
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,460
My name is Ryochi Kankichi.

256
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,500
My name is Ryo-tsu Kankichi.

257
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,080
I-I didn't know this was completed...

258
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,840
Yaaay! I'm gonna be a millionaire!

259
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,540
I got it! I can be a millionaire!

260
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,860
Yeah, yeah!

261
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,360
Hm? Wait a minute.

262
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,220
I can't tell if this guy really translated correctly.

263
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll have to ask them.

264
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,740
Translation by: Katsuhiko

265
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:04,840
All right, the chief isn't here.

266
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,980
Hey, Reiko Nakagawa!

267
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,460
Ryo-tsu!

268
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:09,700
Senpai!

269
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,240
Where have you been? You've been working all day.

270
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,680
Chief, you're so slow.

271
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,820
There's a lot going on.

272
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,500
Could you talk to this for a bit?

273
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,720
What's this?

274
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,240
What is this?

275
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,440
Is this a translator?

276
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,440
Is this translated?

277
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,720
It's a talking translator I made.

278
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,440
Is the English correct?

279
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,920
It's perfect!

280
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,580
All right, next, English to Japanese.

281
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,120
Let me do it.

282
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,120
Oh, please. The Chonektai is the switch.

283
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,000
This?

284
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,080
How about some tea?

285
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,440
Oh, it's perfect!

286
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,200
The perfect talking translator is probably the world's first.

287
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,960
It's a global invention, Senpai!

288
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, I see!

289
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,840
Ryo-tsu!

290
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,160
Hey, Chief!

291
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,940
You! What have you been up to?

292
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,860
I've been talking for a long time.

293
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,040
This time, you're out of your mind.

294
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,200
Get over there!

295
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,760
Wait a minute. I've made a great invention of the century.

296
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,300
Don't say that!

297
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,140
I'm telling the truth!

298
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,820
What's this?

299
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,040
What is this?

300
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,520
I spoke!

301
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,960
It's a talking translator robot.

302
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,280
A perfect talking translator has not yet been developed by Docomo.

303
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,060
It's a great invention!

304
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,200
Really?

305
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,480
Yes!

306
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,180
This is the world's...

307
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,500
Oh, right!

308
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,700
Speaking of the world, tomorrow, a party will be held to invite police officers from around the world.

309
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,900
The chief and I are invited.

310
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,880
I'll take you there, too.

311
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,740
Huh?

312
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,860
I'll show you the translator machine I just used.

313
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,620
I'm sure people all over the world will be surprised.

314
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,400
The world's famous person.

315
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,680
The world's famous person?

316
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,620
Not bad.

317
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,960
Ryotsu!

318
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,140
Yeah?

319
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,160
I thought you'd do something great someday.

320
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,340
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

321
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,020
As a boss, I'm sorry.

322
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,440
The switch just now was turned off.

323
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,220
Good morning.

324
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:11,900
Huh?

325
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,080
Didn't you just say "good morning"?

326
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,500
Just in case, I'll adjust it later.

327
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,840
Okay, I'm done adjusting.

328
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,200
Good evening, I'm Ryotsu Kankichi.

329
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,060
This is a pen.

330
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:28,720
What?

331
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,660
No, where did I get it wrong?

332
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,340
It should be as planned.

333
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,260
Okay, I'm okay now.

334
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,460
Tomorrow will be a windy day.

335
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,800
Kameyari, good boy, come here once.

336
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,040
What?

337
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,100
Why is my Japanese coming back?

338
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,920
Okay, I did it.

339
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,380
I'll go to the police station.

340
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,540
I'm a brave policeman.

341
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,400
Stupid, stupid, idiot.

342
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,240
Stupid, stupid, idiot.

343
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,400
Stupid, stupid, idiot.

344
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,140
Stupid, stupid, idiot.

345
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,480
Stupid, stupid, idiot.

346
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,860
I can take it tomorrow if I keep doing this.

347
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,160
So this is the address.

348
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,960
Reiko, Nakagawa.

349
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,780
Ah, senpai, good morning.

350
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,160
You're not going to the party, are you?

351
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,140
You guys have a favor to ask.

352
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,560
It looks good.

353
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,040
Hey!

354
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,440
Ryotsu, this way.

355
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,920
Hey, chief.

356
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,240
Wait a minute.

357
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
I'm going now.

358
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,080
Thank you for your help.

359
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,840
Did you bring it?

360
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,980
It's not here.

361
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,440
Chief, this is the translation robot.

362
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,040
Oh, then let's introduce it to everyone.

363
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,660
Before that, let me eat something.

364
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,100
I haven't eaten anything in my life.

365
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,880
Eat as much as you like.

366
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,340
Then I'll be spoiled by words.

367
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,900
Thank you for the meal.

368
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,220
Thank you for the meal.

369
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,680
With this, can you really translate?

370
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,620
Nakagawa-kun and Reiko-kun have confirmed it.

371
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,160
That's a relief.

372
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,060
Well, all right, let's do it with that person.

373
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,600
Hello.

374
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,820
Translate.

375
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,200
Oh, it's okay.

376
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,380
Oh, yes.

377
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,620
It was this switch, wasn't it?

378
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,740
The switch is in.

379
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,180
It cannot transform by this machine.

380
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,320
This machine.

381
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,480
Can you translate it really?

382
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:18,900
I wonder if I can translate it.

383
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,460
It seems that you have been able to translate well.

384
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,580
Yes.

385
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,980
You are surprised.

386
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,620
It seems that you are deceiving me, but I can feel it.

387
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,640
Eh? You want us to replace the translator machine?

388
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,820
Please.

389
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,660
I accidentally broke it while adjusting last night.

390
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,160
This looks like yesterday's translation robot, but the inside is modified into a transmitter.

391
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,880
You can receive the conversation here, translate it, and talk to me.

392
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,060
Please.

393
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,380
Just today is fine.

394
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,320
If you have time, you can fix it.

395
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,360
It's a big deal.

396
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Let's cooperate today.

397
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,840
Where is your favorite city in Japan?

398
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,040
It's the director's voice.

399
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,740
This time it's English.

400
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,060
Fairly the town, number one police in Japan.

401
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,340
Oh, amazing.

402
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,120
That's right.

403
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,180
What a wonderful machine.

404
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,380
What a wonderful machine.

405
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,540
Thank you.

406
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,480
Thank you.

407
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,160
Oh.

408
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,960
Oh.

409
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,440
It's a really good first impression.

410
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,000
I want to go back to the old days.

411
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,900
Wow, this is pretty cool.

412
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,160
I want to buy one, too.

413
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,380
I'm clueless.

414
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,480
Thank you.

415
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,240
Thank you.

416
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:39,760
Thank you.

417
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:39,860
Thank you.

418
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,080
Thank you.

419
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,900
Thank you.

420
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,720
Thank you.

421
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,520
I see.

422
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,080
In this case, we should answer in French.

423
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,520
That's right.

424
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,060
Andou.

425
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,340
Mes bordeaux, ne?

426
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,080
Ohara-kun, I feel like it wasn't English just now.

427
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,580
Well, it was somewhat French.

428
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,940
Can this machine also translate German?

429
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,620
Can this machine also translate German?

430
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,020
Reiko-san, it's German now.

431
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,700
Ohara-kun, can this machine also translate German?

432
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,760
Ohara-kun, can this machine also translate German?

433
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,400
Well, Ryotsu was just talking about the translation machine.

434
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,980
Well, I think it's okay.

435
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,840
Please talk in various languages.

436
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,940
Translation takes a long time.

437
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:37,360
The boss and the staff have been waiting for a long time.

438
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,000
The boss and the staff have been waiting for a long time.

439
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,740
The boss and the staff have been waiting for a long time.

440
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,440
Boss, what's going on?

441
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,140
Ryotsu, what's this translation machine?

442
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,760
Did you get caught up with me because it's a fake?

443
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,480
How could you think it was a universal translation machine that could translate all languages?

444
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,380
Huh?

445
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,560
This machine is really something!

446
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
It's a wonderful machine.

447
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,920
Who made it?

448
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,520
Oh, it was made by this Ryotsu Kan-kichi.

449
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,060
The man who made it is him, Kan-kichi Ryotsu.

450
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,680
Thank you very much!

451
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,960
Mr. Ryotsu.

452
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,000
Here is something.

453
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,540
I have something to tell you.

454
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,420
You want to be the Prime Minister?

455
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,540
I would like to ask you for your cooperation.

456
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,980
From today, the Main Meeting with the President of the Republic of Shimagoka will be held.

457
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,000
The topic is the all-purpose translator produced by the Ryotsu-Kankichi-Junsa-cho of the Katsushika-cho.

458
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,180
Until now, the translation of the Shimagoka language into Japanese was necessary for all of us,

459
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,720
but Mr. Ryotsu said that if this was the case, the translation would not be necessary.

460
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,400
The all-purpose translator will be displayed at the lunch meeting tomorrow.

461
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,280
What should I do?

462
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,620
I managed to find the homepage of the Republic of Shimagoka on the Internet,

463
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,880
but what is written there?

464
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,300
I don't know.

465
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,680
I don't think there is any Japanese who can understand the Shimagoka language.

466
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,600
Wait a minute.

467
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,560
Does that mean that no one can understand even if I translate it properly?

468
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,620
Then I have an idea.

469
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,020
For the time being, I will choose a phrase from this homepage and create some patterns.

470
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,480
This is the meeting of the Main Meeting with the Republic of Shimagoka and Japan.

471
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,060
Mr. Ryotsu seems to have arrived.

472
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,480
Hello.

473
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,960
I am the All-purpose translator.

474
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,200
I am the developer of this translation robot, Ryotsu Kankichi.

475
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,720
I entered the data in a hurry to support the difficult Shimagoka language, so there is a slight time lag.

476
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,240
The robot will operate on this computer.

477
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,340
No, I thought I would like to talk to you two like this.

478
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,840
Okay, let's put out the third language for the time being.

479
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,140
Oh, finally, I'm glad I got a log.

480
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,100
The Shimagoka translation machine was not completed, right?

481
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,400
What's going on?

482
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,900
If you start talking in Japanese, the Shimagoka language on the homepage will appear randomly.

483
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,580
It seems that the Japanese that corresponds to the Shimagoka language is also typing in the appropriate phrase.

484
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,340
Eh? Then it will be a mess.

485
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,160
The Shimagoka language that comes out of the translation robot is only the words on the official homepage.

486
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,400
Senpai says it's okay, but ...

487
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,220
What? Something is fishy about Kumoyuki.

488
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,880
That's right. It seems that the face of the president is dragged.

489
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,220
Senpai saw it.

490
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,920
This is the official homepage of the Shimagoka Republic called Shimagoka, right?

491
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,980
I don't know what's written there.

492
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,620
Wait a minute, Kei-chan. There is also an English page.

493
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,740
Oh, it's true.

494
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,680
If you click on English ...

495
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,900
What? Kei-chan, this ...

496
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,040
It's not an official homepage. This is a meeting site for Shimagoka language.

497
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,020
Meeting site? Then, Ryo-chan, are you translating what is written on the meeting site to the president?

498
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,120
Yes.

499
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,500
I wonder if you can translate properly.

500
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,340
It's okay. My all-purpose translator is perfect.

501
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,580
I wonder if it came out with bad words.

502
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,280
Anyway, the lunch meeting is almost over. If you go on like this, there will be no complaints.

503
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,320
Genra.

504
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,960
I ...

505
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,860
Sokunto-kun.

506
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,760
What?

507
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,460
You can use the translator.

508
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,480
Yes, yes. Even so ...

509
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,080
Sokunto-kun. Sokunto-kun.

510
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,760
I said you can use it to make fried eggs, but I will choose this one for now.

511
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,340
I leave it to you.

512
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,140
You can use it to make fried eggs. Do you want me to leave it to you?

513
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,420
Then, please use it.

514
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,020
It 's a source when speaking of fried eggs.

515
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:52,100
But there are people who put soy sauce like gepalt, and there are people who only have salt, like Matoi.

516
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,340
Kei-chan, look here!

517
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,500
Here, at the end of the dating site, there's a regular Shimagoka homepage.

518
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,240
There's something like this...

519
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,780
Um...

520
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,140
Shimagokajin is very particular about medamayaki.

521
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,540
You can't just put sauce on medamayaki!

522
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,540
Um...

523
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,840
It's sauce, Ryo-chan!

524
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,040
This is definitely sauce.

525
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,760
Excuse me.

526
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,480
Ah, that's not it!

527
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,060
Huh?

528
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,800
There's a secret ingredient.

529
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,400
Soy sauce.

530
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,100
In other words, soy sauce!

531
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,040
Ryo-chan!

532
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,380
No!

533
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,140
No!

534
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,820
That's not what I meant!

535
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,640
I said no!

536
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
No, I wasn't.

537
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,680
I was just picking randomly.

538
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,340
It's pretty good.

539
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,000
It looks like you're angry, but...

540
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,400
Hahaha!

541
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,520
Shimagokajin has a strong expression of emotion.

542
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,780
President, which is your favorite city in Japan?

543
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,620
Hatayu-no-Yasen, Kata-Sanpai.

544
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,440
What's wrong?

545
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,880
There are too many, I can't choose.

546
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,400
No, no.

547
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,240
Your country is wonderful.

548
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,220
I respect you from the bottom of my heart.

549
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,740
I support your goals.

550
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,520
Shimagokajin has a strong expression of emotion.

551
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,160
So, are you overworking the country?

552
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,540
Is this what I can do?

553
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,000
No, no.

554
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,040
It has nothing to do with me.

555
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,120
Hahaha.

556
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,280
You're humble.

557
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,720
There's something I can do to change you!

558
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,140
I will keep a close eye on the ties of both countries.

559
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,300

I'm the king of Japan!

565
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,800
What's going on?

566
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,820
I guess he didn't understand.

567
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,640
The 500th episode.

568
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,460
The separation of the island and the Republic of Japan.

569
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,380
Why did he put the sauce on it?

570
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,920
He's trying to fool the world with this piece of junk.

571
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,800
He's the king of Japan!

572
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,620
Where did he go?

573
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,900
I'm hungry.

574
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,340
I'm going to eat something.

Wow !

590
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,800
The lightning to each value

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,860
The smoke from her head

592
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,040
She runs but the camera Kiriyoshi: The camera

Well, it's that much better

594
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:37,860

597
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,180

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,860
The water game, the water game

602

Take care of ourselves and become our own company

Nakagawa's been hospitalized?!

615
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,580
It's not a big sickness, of course!

616
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,100
The disease is called "power"!

617
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,020
You just have to laugh, laugh, laugh to the death!

618
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,640
I just need to laugh!

623
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
"Don't laugh, forgive, and please don't!"

624
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,820
There's a turtle there!

625
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,120
Ah, there's a turtle for sure!

626
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,680
Everyone, come to our town!

627
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,880
Thank you!
