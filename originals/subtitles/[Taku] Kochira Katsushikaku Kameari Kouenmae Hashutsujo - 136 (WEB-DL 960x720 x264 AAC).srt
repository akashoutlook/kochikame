1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,980
When you're watching TV

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,020
Make sure the room is bright and keep your distance

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,820
Hello, goodbye

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,800
If you're going to say goodbye

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,180
You can go home right away

7
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,940
Don't panic, in this small town

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,740
Where are you going? Hurry up and turn

9
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,720
Maybe you'll find a better day

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,800
Than me

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,880
If you're with someone

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,600
Let them hear you

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,420
Let them hear you all night

14
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:12,300
I don't hate waiting

15
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,940
Because I'm a Kameza woman

16
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,580
I don't want to lose, I'm a Ginza woman

17
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,780
I've loved you for many years

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,540
I'm a Kameza woman

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,260
Charlie and Kobayashi's Secrets

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,760
Chief Ichinji?

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,660
Yes, I heard you're coming to the office today.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,340
Who's next?

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,060
Kyoko Fukada or Ryoko Hirose?

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,160
Charlie and Kobayashi.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,320
Charlie and Kobayashi?

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:52,940
What's that?

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,780
Are they foreigners?

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,140
The vocalists of a rock band called Visual K

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,900
What?

30
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,520
Chief, what's that?

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,660
Chief Ichinji

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,900
Hello, everyone at the Kameari Park branch

33
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,020
What a flashy guy

34
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,800
Yes, I hope you'll all cooperate

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,940
Charlie, please sign

36
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,040
I've already found it

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,000
It's not enough for the fans

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,460
It's more strange if you're wearing such a flashy band

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,360
If you all want to sign, please do it now

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,480
I don't want to sign

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,220
First of all, Charlie Kobayashi

42
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,200
I've never seen or heard of it

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,860
Ryoko, you're rude to Chief Ichinji

44
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,280
Then, do you know Charlie Kobayashi?

45
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,820
You mean I know him?

46
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,780
Well, that's...

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,580
See, you don't know him, do you?

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
My popularity was a product, after all

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,380
The fans were in Sakura

50
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,800
The CD warehouse must have been returned to the office

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
The CD warehouse must have been returned to the office

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,440
The CD warehouse must have been returned to the office

53
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,180
You're thinking too much, Charlie

54
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,980
You're weak to Visual K in middle school

55
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,560
You know Charlie, right?

56
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,780
Of course, I know Charlie

57
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,460
Yes, I've seen him in TV and magazines

58
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,220
Well...

59
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,220
I don't know him!

60
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,900
It's easy to see

61
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,560
Oh, I remembered

62
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,300
I'm a beautiful girl

63
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,480
By the way, I often saw him in various places

64
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:26,840
Really?

65
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,640
Yes

66
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,740
Of course he's an Osechi

67
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,880
Charlie

68
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,440
Thank you!

69
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,480
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,660
Thank you!

71
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,300
He's quick to recover.

72
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
Hey, you!

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,640
Charlie is a naive and delicate artist.

74
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,320
I'd like you to stop hurting him with such a delicate expression.

75
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,920
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,540
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,700
But this is a very serious matter.

78
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,680
Don't make me laugh, chief.

79
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,440
I've checked all the entertainment information.

80
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,400
And I've given you my honest opinion.

81
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,580
Then, please look at this.

82
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,860
All the visual stuff.

83
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:17,980
Listen.

84
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,780
Among the visual bands that are the mainstream in Japanese music,

85
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,120
Charlie Kobayashi's "With Narcissist" is...

86
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,300
Charlie Kobayashi's "With Narcissist" is...

87
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,740
"With Narcissist" is...

88
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,600
"With Narcissist" is...

89
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Not this.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,280
That's strange.

91
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,620
It's not on anywhere.

92
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,040
I found it!

93
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,500
Where?

94
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,440
Here.

95
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,200
I see.

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,420
It's the visual style that was popular in the boom.

97
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,060
Please call me Shinuchi.

98
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,460
In short, it's the second Senji.

99
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,100
Then, I'll paint the gap between the busy schedule that prevented the recording of the new song,

100
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,700
and the fact that I was the chief of police for a day.

101
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,100
That's right.

102
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,740
It's a chance to meet the fans in person.

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,500
Then, I'll take it.

104
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,580
Kan Shiki!

105
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,300
It's good that my gravure is taken by a cameraman called Kan Shiki.

106
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,580
The gravure is a monochrome photo that can be posted on the Katsushika newspaper's newspaper.

107
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:27,600
"What it was back in the day"

108
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,440
Okay.

109
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,720
The president will decide on an outfit.

110
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,500
"Glass"

111
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,340
How about this?

112
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,240
It's different from the uniform of the Katsushika's newspaper.

113
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,840
It's hard with the visual style.

114
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,460
Yeah.

115
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,280
It's a duty of a man born virtues.

116
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,240
I don't think you guys understand that.

117
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
Why?

118
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,100
You're a visual artist.

119
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,580
I knew it!

120
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,420
I was seen that way by the world!

121
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,980
I... I...

122
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,460
Charlie, stop it.

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,820
What's wrong with saying the truth?

124
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,760
Are you a budget?

125
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,820
Char... Charlie?

126
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,700
The End

127
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:31,920
Thank you!

128
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,500
Let's start filming.

129
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,520
Wait!

130
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,360
What's wrong, Charlie?

131
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,500
I'm a little tired.

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,140
Let's take a rest here.

133
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,740
Okay.

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,760
Okay.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm sorry,

136
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,560
but...

137
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,740
I'm sorry for the photo.

138
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,300
Why?

139
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,180
Nakagawa-kun is also a police officer of this police station.

140
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,040
Actually...

141
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,360
I don't mind, but...

142
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,120
Thank you.

143
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,260
You don't want to be with a beautiful Nakagawa, right?

144
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:09,980
Charlie!

145
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,120
You don't have the confidence to beat Nakagawa with a two-shot, right?

146
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,760
Senior!

147
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,580
What's wrong with being a civil servant?

148
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,440
You're so cool.

149
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,240
Charlie, don't worry about what he says.

150
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,460
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,080
I'll be embarrassed, so don't be a PerchÃ©.

152
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
Ryo!

153
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,800
Please don't stop.

154
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,540
I mean,

155
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,160
What do you mean?

156
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,400
What's wrong with you?

157
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,080
And what about that what you were saying?

158
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,860
Well...

159
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,300
It was a joke.

160
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,960
I can't explain it.

161
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,440
Well...

162
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,000
The next day

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,340
Alright, Charlie, you're good.

164
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,600
You're beautiful. You're cool!

165
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,920
I'm beautiful. I'm cool.

166
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,260
Yeah, you're beautiful. You're not going to lose!

167
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,320
You're not going to lose to anyone!

168
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,620
I'm not going to lose!

169
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,620
I lost!

170
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,940
Visuals that are inferior to ordinary people are not visuals!

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,640
Charlie!

172
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,880
The next day

173
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
The next day

174
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,400
The next day

175
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,680
The next day

176
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,480
You know what?

177
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,740
Charlie, you're the only visual in the country that is inferior to ordinary people.

178
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,360
You're the only visual in the family business industry.

179
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,940
Because you're the only visual in the police department industry.

180
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,020
Me.

181
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,220
Yeah, you!

182
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,940
You're confident ...

183
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,600
I can understand.

184
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,700
You're much more persuasive than usual.

185
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,360
Yeah, this time after Visual Band Festival,

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,260
you can record the ringtone of the Nashville building I have been saying before.

187
00:08:59,460 --> 00:08:59,900
Really?

188
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,040
Then, let's have a shoot immediately!

189
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,100
Okay

190
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,240
Ok, then Nakagawa-san, please...

191
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,100
Yes

192
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,660
After all, why didn't you remove Nakagawa's face?

193
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,600
After all, why didn't you remove Nakagawa's face?

194
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,720
After all, why didn't you remove Nakagawa's face?

195
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,740
Thanks to you, I had fun.

196
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,980
We don't mind either.

197
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,860
Oh, you're the president of the day, taking pictures.

198
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,860
You're an idol, but you're a president of the day, not a president of the three minutes.

199
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,780
George.

200
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,460
Charlie, we're going to rehearse for Rock Fest.

201
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,760
Oh, Charlie.

202
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,660
You misunderstood the visual system.

203
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,800
No, I'm not a visual system, I'm making fun of you, a person.

204
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,780
You're making fun of me, a person.

205
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,240
What's so annoying about me?

206
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,840
Everything, it's so annoying.

207
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,600
What?

208
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,360
Don't say that to Charlie.

209
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,020
Ryo, shut up.

210
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,600
I can't go home with the misunderstanding for my fans and other visual systems.

211
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,980
So, it doesn't matter about other bands.

212
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,980
Stop it, Ryo.

213
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,460
Ryo.

214
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,540
Okay, I'll be with you for half a day.

215
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,640
It's a patrol.

216
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,160
Well, it's been a while since I walked around the town.

217
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,040
It's not bad.

218
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,660
Okay.

219
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,140
Hi.

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,920
Charlie, you're not the only one who comes to me when I say you're a popular artist.

221
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,020
I've been told that fans are in a mood to come to you.

222
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,940
But I'm a commoner from now on, so...

223
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,980
A commoner.

224
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,640
Hey.

225
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,760
I'm a fan of Hena Choco.

226
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,200
Hena Choco.

227
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,600
Well, it's a honest impression.

228
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,120
I'll... I'll...

229
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,660
Charlie.

-Did you find it? -No, it's nowhere.

245
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,880
I haven't even bought one of my books!

246
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,380
Again? Hey, manager!

247
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
That's right! I'm sure I sold all of them!

248
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,340
Charlie, that's right. It's good. I'm sure it's true.

249
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,820
They're a great pair, as always.

250
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,880
What is it?

251
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,900
What? Charlie's profile?

252
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,220
Born in 1978 in London.

253
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,420
Oh, really?

254
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,600
Born between an Italian French father and a Japanese second generation child.

255
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,400
He spent his childhood in Switzerland, Netherlands, and Russia.

256
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,780
After his father died, he moved to Japan, where his mother's hometown was.

257
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,380
He was born in the Shibuya prefecture.

258
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,540
He was forced to predict the mysterious.

259
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,600
He's got a feeling that he's trying to smoke his whole body.

260
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,980
I don't like it. Stop with the weird ideas.

261
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,640
Well, let's sign it.

262
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,220
Excuse me.

263
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,480
Huh?

264
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,420
Sir, that's a book for return.

265
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,380
Would you please not touch it?

266
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,260
What? Return?

267
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,620
It's broken.

268
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,300
Please don't do it!

269
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,900
Tell me who stole it.

270
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,180
It's not like I don't know.

271
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,680
He stole an old book.

272
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,480
You used to know a book I couldn't read.

273
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,880
I read it.

274
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,800
I knew you'd have a book like that.

275
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,860
I was practicing it when I was in high school.

276
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,280
And his father had a big book.

277
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,380
A book that dates from the 19th century.

278
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,160
It's a fantastic book!

279
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,420
Charlie, your imagination has changed greatly.

280
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,100
Where are you?

281
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,600
"A-I-U-E-O"

282
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,700
"Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko"

283
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,440
"Sa-Si-Su-Se-So-Ta-Chi-Chi-Cha"

284
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,820
Charlie, there's my CD!

285
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,340
Of course!

286
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,760
I have one too!

287
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,060
"Chuuko Record Corner"?

288
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,480
20 years ago, a poor folk singer who had only one hit left disappeared.

289
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,080
His name was...

290
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,940
His name was...

291
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,780
His name was Kobayashi Kazuo.

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,760
Charlie Kobayashi, you're 20 years old!

293
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,200
No! I'm not!

294
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,240
We're going to have a rehearsal, so excuse us.

295
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,360
Here we go!

296
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,340
Wait!

297
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,380
No doubt!

298
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,040
Kobayashi Kazuo!

299
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,140
Kobayashi Kazuo!

300
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,380
I know this record.

301
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,220
I remember buying it a long time ago.

302
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,620
It's one of the hit songs of the pre-war folk era.

303
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,700
It's a souvenir of Kobayashi Kazuo's one-shot and one-shot work.

304
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,580
If these two are the same person, they're about the same age as Ryo-chan.

305
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,460
Yeah, the entertainment world is not uncommon for age differences.

306
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,620
They heat up all the profiles and make visual-based band movements.

307
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,460
They hide their faces with makeup and make their new debut.

308
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,780
They're afraid of that.

309
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,500
But if you think about it, it's a great obsession.

310
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,280
It's not like they're trying to do anything.

311
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,720
But it's important for the world to know that Charlie had a different face.

312
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,500
No, there's no need to worry about that.

313
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,120
If the media is trying to sell a story, they'll refuse it.

314
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,260
What?

315
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,820
Charlie Kobayashi's story?

316
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,840
No, no.

317
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,700
He's doing his best, but I don't think his popularity is that big.

318
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,760
Ryo-chan is the worst.

319
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,520
Ryo-san is terrible.

320
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,380
Ryo-chan is terrible.

321
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,700
Ryo-san is terrible.

322
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,020
He's been a police chief for a day, you know?

323
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,420
He's been a police chief for a day, you know?

324
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,540
I told you he wasn't selling.

325
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,060
But he's a poor man, too.

326
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,440
What's wrong?

327
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,020
Isn't that Charlie?

328
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,280
Oh, no!

329
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,320
Are you OK?

330
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,920
What?

331
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,860
Devil!

332
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,780
Devil Yagami!

333
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,140
Don't say such a bad thing.

334
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,580
Don't say such a bad thing.

335
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,420
I heard he wasn't injured.

336
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,280
But why did he get hurt on such a good road?

337
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,760
As soon as I saw the car, I suddenly...

338
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,940
This road is a dead end!

339
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,440
I was scared to see Ryo-san.

340
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,020
Today?

341
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,160
Isn't that noisy manager with you?

342
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,060
The manager went to the venue first.

343
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,760
That's right.

344
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,380
This is not the time to do this.

345
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,600
I have to go.

346
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,540
The car is...

347
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,100
Where are you going?

348
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,920
We're going to the band festival.

349
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,520
Band festival?

350
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,700
Let's go.

351
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,620
What are you doing?

352
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,480
Hello? Charlie, get out of here.

353
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:10,860
Hello?

354
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,360
What are you doing?

355
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,480
I can't let you go to the concert because of me.

356
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,260
I can't let you go to the concert because of me.

357
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,220
I'll watch you get into the venue.

358
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,580
I'll watch you get into the venue.

359
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:25,880
We don't have to go.

360
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,360
We have an equipment car.

361
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,620
Please take the other car with the instrument.

362
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,000
I got it.

363
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,240
I'll go with you.

364
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,680
Hey, don't be so quiet.

365
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:35,940
You idiot.

366
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,660
Get out of here.

367
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,400
Yes, sir.

368
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,800
I haven't said that except for the people of Hashijo.

369
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,940
What does that mean?

370
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,340
We're on Charlie's side.

371
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,600
He's an amazing person.

372
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,800
It's natural that the Japanese visual band is one and the same.

373
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,660
It's natural that the Japanese visual band is one and the same.

374
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,540
I'm putting everything I have to today's concert.

375
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,940
I'll make you a great hit.

376
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,660
Kobayashi, Kazoo.

377
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,840
I'm Charlie.

378
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,260
Nakagawa, get me to the entrance of the dressing room.

379
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,180
It's probably the back entrance.

380
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,840
I got it.

381
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,920
The entrance is open.

382
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,680
I think it should be around here.

383
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,300
It's that.

384
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,760
Then we'll leave now.

385
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,060
I wish you success.

386
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,260
Thank you.

387
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,820
I misunderstood you.

388
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't worry about it.

389
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,780
Nakagawa, get me out of here.

390
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,520
Yes, sir.

391
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,080
See you later.

392
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,920
Kobayashi, Kazoo.

393
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,520
I'm Charlie Kobayashi.

394
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,620
Excuse me.

395
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,360
Oh, you're the driver.

396
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,300
Yes.

397
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,600
This is the left side that went right after this.

398
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:36,960
Thank you.

399
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,700
You're welcome.

400
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,460
A lot of superstars walked this corridor.

401
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,020
I'm getting dizzy.

402
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,120
Toilet.

403
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,680
Toilet.

404
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,120
Toilet.

405
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,940
Charlie has not arrived yet in this hall?

406
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,460
Manager is at the gate.

407
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,140
Give it to him.

408
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,600
That's Ryotsu.

409
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,660
He must have sent him to Gangnam Brotherhood's house.

410
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,000
The thing has not arrived.

411
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,280
We need you to take responsibility if Charlie doesn't show up.

412
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,060
Where did he disappear to?

413
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,460
I relaxed now.

414
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,260
Okay.

415
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,240
The band two years ago is over.

416
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,360
Where did they go?

417
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,720
Charlie Kobayashi with Narcissist, stand by please.

418
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,260
Oh, Charlie...

419
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,860
Good morning.

420
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,860
Oh, I remember you. You're Kobayashi, aren't you?

421
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,560
What are you doing, Kobayashi?

422
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,340
No, I'm Charlie.

423
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,020
I'm sure you're dressed up, but you're not wearing that outfit today.

424
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,740
That's right.

425
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,220
Come on, change your clothes.

426
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,200
Hurry up.

427
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,720
Can I come in?

428
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,540
Yes.

429
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,180
You guys!

430
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:51,780
Yeah.

431
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,220
Where did you take them?

432
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,780
I sent them to the back door here.

433
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,400
Back door?

434
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,280
Yes.

435
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,980
I'll take a look.

436
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,660
What? You're not here yet?

437
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,520
I'll be there soon, so I'll be gone for a while.

438
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,300
I've changed the order of the performance, but I can't change the order any more.

439
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,400
I forced you to perform at the request of the president of the otaku agency.

440
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,760
What do you mean?

441
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,240
I'm sorry.

442
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:19,540
I'm sorry.

443
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,080
I'll wait for another five minutes. If you don't come in five minutes, the performance is canceled.

444
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,540
Thank you for waiting.

445
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,560
I'm Charlie Kobayashi!

446
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,880
Ryo, you're Charlie. Are you a little fat?

447
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,800
No, I quit smoking, so I think I'm a little fat.

448
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,480
What are you doing?

449
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,400
I'm Charlie.

450
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,940
Then Kobayashi Kazuo will sing.

451
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,200
Tokyo Hustle Man

452
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,400
Please hustle there.

453
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,560
What's the matter?

454
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,380
Ah, I long for Tokyo

455
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,520
Ah, I saw Tokyo in my dreams

456
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,120
Ah, I came to Tokyo

457
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,300
Hustle, hustle, hustle. It must be meaningful.

458
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,940
Two of you, the Tokyo Tower

459
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,620
Two of you, the bus tour

460
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,720
A hustle rendezvous I saw to my dreams

461
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,680
But you're already a wife of a person

462
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,160
Ah, painful Tokyo

463
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,020
Tokyo, Tokyo, Hustle Otoko

464
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,720
Uwaaaaaaah!

465
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,900
This is ridiculous!

466
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,060
What the?

467
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,080
Fly away.

468
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,500
Eh?

469
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,580
Alright, good!

470
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,080
Uwaaaaaah!

471
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,360
Whatever you want, sing!

472
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:08,480
Hey!

473
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,740
Hey, it's a no-no now!

474
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,880
Hey, hey, heart!

475
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,320
Ah!

476
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,200
You're arrested!

477
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:16,840
You're arrested!

478
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,600
Arrest him!

479
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,120
I'm a man of love!

480
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,940
Yeah!

481
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,400
You look like a dream

482
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,620
Yee-haw!

483
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,080
You are already

484
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,200
My wife!

485
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,380
Ah, Tokyo is so sad

486
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,460
Tokyo

487
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,360
Tokyo Hustle Man

488
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,960
-Yay! -Yay!

489
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,000
-Yay! -Yay!

490
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,060
-Yay! -Yay!

491
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,640
-Yay! -Yay!

492
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,000
-Yay! -Yay!

493
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:53,980
What?

494
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,220
So, the reason why we thought it was the back entrance of Kameari Hall

495
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,960
was the back entrance of Kameari Koukaido?

496
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,800
I love you!

497
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,020
I love you!

498
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,240
I love you three times!

499
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,940
I love you as much as I love Hariko!

500
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,200
-All right! -You're so...

501
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,620
As always, there are many flashy bands.

502
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,800
By the way, what happened to Charlie?

503
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,140
He was a one-shot even after he switched to visual.

504
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,860
Maybe he couldn't go to the band festival because he was too big.

505
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,020
It would be lonely if he disappeared.

506
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,780
That's his luck.

507
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,000
It's his fate.

508
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,540
I don't care, but you should stop wearing that make-up, Ryo-chan.

509
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,380
Don't be silly!

510
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,700
I made all the guests of the hall a good match.

511
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,140
I can easily remove this make-up.

512
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,580
And thanks to this, I don't have to go to the bathroom.

513
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:45,920
You're dirty!

514
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,160
Ryo-san, I'm in trouble!

515
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,200
What's wrong?

516
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,120
So, let me introduce you the president of the day.

517
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,040
It's Kobayashi Kazuo, the folk singer.

518
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,680
Hey, Kobayashi Kazuo!

519
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,560
âª Ah, the Tokyo I long for âª

520
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,580
âª Ah, the Tokyo I dreamed of âª

521
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,000
âª Ah, since I came to Tokyo âª

522
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,160
âª I have to hustle, hustle, hustle âª

523
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,040
âª Everyone is good âª

524
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,720
âª Together with you, we sing about Tokyo âª

525
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,140
âª Together with you, we fly about âª

526
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,020
âª Ah, the hustle rendezvous I dreamed of âª

527
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,760
âª Ah, the hustle rendezvous I dreamed of âª

528
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,000
âª Ah, the hustle rendezvous I dreamed of âª

529
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,200
âª You are my wife âª

530
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,160
âª Ah, the painful Tokyo âª

531
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,740
âª Tokyo, I love you âª

532
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,600
Kobayashi Kazuo has reached the end of his long journey of searching for himself.

533
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,520
Ah, what a wonderful life!

534
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:16,700
Okay, I will definitely go to Tokyo.

535
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,840
I'll pick him up for a drink.

536
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:32,180
Kobayashi Kazuo

537
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,580
I always give you a short kiss

538
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,860
You were so dear to me

539
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,700
I can't replace it like that

540
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,720
How much will people get in their lifetime?

541
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,320
You are me

542
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,740
I am you

543
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:02,020
You were the only one who made me happy

544
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,840
Just by laughing

545
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,060
I felt like I was healed from all the pain

546
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,640
It's you again, Professor Tondemo!

547
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,440
This time, it's an experiment of the deep sea suit!

548
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,520
Your invention

549
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,000
I told you it's enough!

550
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,580
Wait a minute

551
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,940
