27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,800
From the tap to the toilet, the sunset falls

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,540
Tomorrow will also end with a sound

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,880
But I lost my happiness again

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,400
I realized it, because I'm such an idiot

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,540
Because I'm such an idiot

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,400
Excuse me, director.

33
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,160
Slow, slow, quick, quick

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,100
Quick, quick, quick, Slow, detai

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,020
Oh, that, um...

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,880
So, you've found me.

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,160
Actually,

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,380
I've been learning accomplished dance lately.

39
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,580
Excellent dance?

40
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,780
It's better than I thought.

41
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,400
How's that, Ohara?

42
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,280
Maybe you can learn it too?

43
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,320
Good...

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,020
I'm the head of the club.

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,620
No, no.

46
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,500
At first, everyone gets a little late.

47
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,720
But if you try, you'll get addicted to it.

48
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,740
Please try it.

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,860
Ah...

50
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:39,280
Yes, let's decide our partners and start with the waltz of yesterday.

51
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,320
It's three quarters of a second.

52
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,200
Yes.

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,880
It's your first time, right?

54
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,240
Well, Daijiro Ohara.

55
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,060
Yes.

56
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,340
Have you ever danced in the club?

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,320
Yes.

58
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,160
Then I'll teach you the steps.

59
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,440
Please come here.

60
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,100
Yes, thank you.

61
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,060
First, stretch your back and the way you put your hands is like this.

62
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,700
Put your right hand under your shoulders.

63
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,940
Don't be stiff.

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,280
Yes.

65
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,100
The waltz is centered on rotation.

66
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,820
The basic rhythm is counted as one, two, three.

67
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,820
I see.

68
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,820
Mr. Ohara, you have improved.

69
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,560
No, it's all thanks to your instruction.

70
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,500
I didn't think there would be such fun in life.

71
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,540
How about it?

72
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,620
Would you like to try it, Mr. Ohara?

73
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,240
Me?

74
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,640
No, it's ridiculous.

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,960
The first pair is...

76
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,280
If you don't mind, I'll help you.

77
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,460
Really?

78
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,780
Yes.

79
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,800
In exchange, I would like to practice the waltz of today.

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,640
Please promote the waltz to everyone.

81
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,160
Yes.

82
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,920
The waltz of the night?

83
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,780
Is the chief?

84
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,800
That's right.

85
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,020
Well, I guess it's one of the advantages of adults.

86
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,400
If it's a waltz, my wife wants to try it.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, I see.

88
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,080
Then, I'll do it.

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
It's a good match.

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,800
Is that so?

91
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,700
I'm a good dancer.

92
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,420
I can dance and dance...

93
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,960
Nakagawa and Reiko can dance, of course.

94
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,680
Yes.

95
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,180
I was taught from the time I could walk.

96
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
I learned it with ballet.

97
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,680
These two are special.

98
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,060
They are different from ordinary Japanese.

99
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,820
If I stretch my back and dance the waltz,

100
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,740
I feel like I'm the second foreign star.

101
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,780
It's strange.

102
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,520
I'll try it, too.

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,600
I'm a dancer.

104
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,600
Oh, I see.

105
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,900
Because you are short,

106
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,060
the underarm turn lead won't go well.

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,780
I'll teach you, Reiko.

108
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,360
I'll teach you, Reiko.

109
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,260
I'll teach you, Reiko.

110
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,020
4/4 seconds.

111
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,520
Count is quick.

112
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,520
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

113
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:26,720
From the side step with slow.

114
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,320
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

115
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,600
From the side step with slow.

116
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,600
Oh!

117
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,560
Oh!

118
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,460
As expected!

119
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,920
You two are tall, so you look like a painting.

120
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, and I'm wearing a fox trot.

121
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,700
I'm wearing a fox trot.

122
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,180
I'm wearing a fox trot.

123
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,620
I'm wearing a fox trot.

124
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,220
I'm wearing a fox trot.

125
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,260
So...

126
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,740
The fool who dances and the fool who looks at you are the same.

127
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,880
You're an insect!

128
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,160
You're annoying.

129
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,020
What do you mean, a fox trot?

130
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,820
I will never do such a thing.

131
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,820
What?

132
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,420
The prize money is 10 million yen?

133
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,380
I see.

134
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,840
Look at this.

135
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,940
Chief Ohara distributed it to us.

136
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,800
Oh!

137
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
I'll do it.

138
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,700
I definitely will!

139
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,120
I'll do it too!

140
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,120
I'll do it, Ryutsu!

141
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,280
Me too!

142
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,880
Are you guys going out?

143
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,620
It's no use stopping them, Ryutsu.

144
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,660
Dance? With that face?

145
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,820
Face has nothing to do with it!

146
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,500
Stop, stop. You idiot. Think again.

147
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,580
You're trying to reduce your rival even a little bit, aren't you?

148
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,180
Giga...

149
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,660
Shut up!

150
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,280
I heard it was 10 million yen, so I'm not supposed to be quiet, right?

151
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,560
I'll do it too! I'm also a Shako dance!

152
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:35,780
Dance!

153
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,580
Me too...

154
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,580
If Nana-chan can make a pair...

155
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,820
Oh, I see. You can't do it alone.

156
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,560
You need someone to make a pair.

157
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,780
What should I do?

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,640
Nakagawa-san is obviously going to make a pair with Reiko-san.

159
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,220
But I can't change the topic.

160
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,380
I see. At this time, anyone is fine.

161
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,860
I have Jody...

162
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,460
I have Nana-chan...

163
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
Hmm...

164
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,860
Well, you can't help it.

165
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,320
You're just a bug.

166
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,300
Sakonji-san, I thought you were the only one I saw.

167
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,700
Let's close our eyes to everything else and make a pair for the sake of money.

168
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,500
A pair?

169
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,320
Don't be so happy with that!

170
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,800
No, Naoko.

171
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,080
Chacha-san.

172
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,740
I...

173
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
Naoko-san.

174
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:43,680
Oh?

175
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:43,840
Chacha-san.

176
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,320
Oh?

177
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,040
I'm? I...

178
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,720
I guess I'm in trouble...

179
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,560
OK, let's join hands.

180
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,400
What?

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,820
Are you a girl manga?

182
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,360
I'll make you a pair!

183
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,080
I'm the one who will make you bloom with a beautiful body without losing to the rival's conspiracy and impudence!

184
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,560
Don't drag the monster in!

185
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,400
It's terrible!

186
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,120
First, let's take a look at the waltz.

187
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,560
Damn it! It's not about getting in or not! It's about being a partner!

188
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,020
Reipo is Nakagawa.

189
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,860
Honda is Otohime.

190
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,080
Volvo is Jody.

191
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,460
And there's more.

192
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,500
Maria is on a business trip at a time like this.

193
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,880
I have to do something or I can't talk!

194
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,260
Next is the word!

195
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,400
Hmm?

196
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,740
Hmm, but when I look at it like this, it's a precise movement like a machine.

197
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,920
It looks like a mannequin is moving.

198
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,300
A mannequin!

199
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,640
Yeah, I think I can do it!

200
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,720
This is where my figure-tech shows off!

201
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,380
Watch this!

202
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,960
It's done!

203
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,940
Uh...

204
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,660
The whole body is...

205
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:30,020
This is the super-toushin-dai figure-touch dance version where all joints are bent to their own will!

206
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
Then, let's start.

207
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,320
Ta-da-da-da-da...

208
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,480
Ah! Ouch!

209
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,600
Ouch!

210
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,180
It hurts!

211
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,840
Damn it!

212
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,800
Even if you can do it, it's the same for me to move it.

213
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Hmm...

214
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,460
Huh?

215
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,540
But it's still difficult to move it.

216
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,140
So, here's a request from my grandfather.

217
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,740
This dance software that dataizes all the professional movements.

218
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,540
Right.

219
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,780
If I install it on my figure, I can dance on my own with my hands connected.

220
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,780
Well, there's nothing you can't do.

221
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,840
But it's a hurry.

222
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,020
If I have two million yen, I can do it, right?

223
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,180
No way!

224
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,680
I need this much.

225
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,240
I need it.

226
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,840
What? You want it for 50,000 yen?

227
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,360
No, no.

228
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,980
Oh, 5000 yen.

229
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,080
That's a good deal.

230
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,260
No way.

231
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,720
It's 5 million.

232
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,800
5 million.

233
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,800
Hmm.

234
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,920
Let's make it a million.

235
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,940
7 million.

236
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,200
8 million.

237
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,580
8.8 million.

238
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,800
Why do you have to increase it?

239
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,140
Why do you have to decrease it?

240
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,160
Hmm.

241
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,700
You're so stubborn.

242
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,180
Then 3 million.

243
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,200
One more.

244
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,600
4 million.

245
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,360
3.5 million.

246
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,640
All right.

247
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,360
The deal is finalized.

248
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,500
In exchange,

249
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,920
make sure you make it to the tournament.

250
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,960
Don't worry.

251
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,820
My staff is okay

252
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,780
even if they don't sleep at home.

253
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,780
They're all so ridiculous.

254
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,920
Do you think they can sleep at home?

255
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,320
Do you think so?

256
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,060
Well, I...

257
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
I think so.

258
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,660
Then I'll take care of this.

259
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,760
Well, I'll take care of this.

260
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,560
What?

261
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,380
I can't do this.

262
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:35,460
You just do it.

263
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,460
Why, what do you mean?

264
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,000
Heيل, I'll show you something.

265
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,340
I have a powerahex.

266
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,960
You're sure to do this.

267
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,080
I'll let you do it.

268
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,920
...

269
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,160
...

270
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,400
...

271
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,220
...

272
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,720
...

273
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,940
Oh, that's great!

274
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,840
Yeah, it did!

275
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,980
...

276
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,460
...

277
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,340
...

278
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:55,480
...

279
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,540
...

280
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,460
Perfect!

281
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,300
You're right, Lotto.

282
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,660
...

283
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,240
But, there's one problem.

284
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,660
You're too tall and weird.

285
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,160
I can't give up here.

286
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,300
I'll stretch my legs for 10 million yen.

287
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,480
What's wrong, Senpai?

288
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,620
I guess you couldn't find a partner after all.

289
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,800
But I don't think Ryo would give up on that.

290
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,760
Sorry to keep you waiting!

291
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,300
You're late, Ryo.

292
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,780
No, it's just...

293
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,400
You're really tall.

294
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,700
Really? You're smarter than usual.

295
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,360
I see.

296
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

297
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,860
welcome to the Social Dance in Katsushika D1 Grand Prix.

298
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,080
We are now hosting the Social Dance in Katsushika.

299
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,380
Go, Katsushika!

300
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,600
The judges will be evaluated by technique and art.

301
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,000
The pair with the highest total points will be the winners.

302
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,220
First, the preliminary round.

303
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,720
The preliminary round starts now.

304
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,040
The preliminary round starts now.

305
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,620
So, I'll start with the waltz.

306
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,800
Mr. Ohara, don't be stiff.

307
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,380
Just relax as usual.

308
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,500
Ouch!

309
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,780
Don't throw it by mistake.

310
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,740
I think...

311
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,760
I'm happy just doing this.

312
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,600
Bobby, be careful with your nose.

313
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,380
I know.

314
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,980
Are you okay, Bobby?

315
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,880
It's surprising that Ryo-chan is so calm.

316
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
Your partner is great.

317
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,380
Really? Who is that person?

318
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,420
This is the first time I've seen him.

319
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,220
It's the first time I've seen him.

320
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,160
It's good to see him!

321
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,820
Feeling so good at singing.

322
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,940
I'll start as soon as possible.

323
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,520
I'm nervous.

324
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,840
I'll listen to them and get ready.

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,960
Yes.

326
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,880
My partnerần

327
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,560
Easy, easy.

328
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,480
Easy.

329
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,900
3, 4...

330
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,180
Not bad.

331
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,500
Now, we will announce the pair that will pass the preliminary round.

332
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,080
Please look at the monitor.

333
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,840
I'm so nervous.

334
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,800
Oh my God.

335
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480
This is the pair that will pass the preliminary round.

336
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,960
The pair that will pass the preliminary round.

337
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,080
I'm disappointed.

338
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,140
Damn, we have to put the nose out.

339
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,880
Don't cry, Bobby.

340
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,180
But the pair that will pass the preliminary round is...

341
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,020
Of course, they have different abilities than you.

342
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,860
I'm so frustrated.

343
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,800
I can't help it.

344
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
They are dynamic and bright.

345
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,840
That's true.

346
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,800
But they became so good in such a short time.

347
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,040
This is true.

348
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,320
Excuse me, what is your name?

349
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,460
Huh?

350
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,340
Is it this one?

351
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,700
This one is rude, Ryo-chan.

352
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,740
The wonderful dance that everyone saw is because of the partner.

353
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,680
Well, I have a name.

354
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,860
I have a name, but...

355
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,520
Ryo-chan, I'm not asking you.

356
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,080
Excuse me.

357
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,800
I'm a man who is not polite and common sense.

358
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,560
My name is Ohara.

359
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,700
And you are...

360
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,760
I'm a dancer.

361
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,400
I'm Izu's dancer.

362
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,260
Izu's dancer?

363
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,740
Well, this is a name that was born to be a good dancer.

364
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,600
Really?

365
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:55,980
Really.

366
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,780
Well...

367
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,180
Excuse me.

368
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,480
I'm going to the bathroom.

369
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,020
Excuse me.

370
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,260
Why is Ryo-chan with you?

371
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,220
Anyway, you look the same as when you always dance.

372
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,080
I'm a natural dancer.

373
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,420
I'm going to the bathroom before the final.

374
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:18,880
Excuse me.

375
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,240
Anyway, it's the final.

376
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,340
Until the end,

377
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,140
I have to get through it somehow.

378
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,960
Well, I'm sorry for before.

379
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,500
Why are you here?

380
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,580
I'm sorry.

381
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,780
I'm sorry for practicing the secret steps.

382
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,260
It was dangerous.

383
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,020
It hurts.

384
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
Ryo-chan.

385
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,000
I wonder if everyone is fine with this.

386
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,000
Well, it's a little embarrassing, but we're all fans now.

387
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,800
Fan?

388
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,580
Not you, but Mr. Dance.

389
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,120
It was wonderful.

390
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,380
Please sign it.

391
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,520
I beg you.

392
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,020
I beg you.

393
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,060
I'm in trouble.

394
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,080
You said you didn't care.

395
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,860
That's right.

396
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,060
Ryo-chan is a good dancer.

397
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,120
I beg you, Mr. Dance.

398
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,400
So, there are various circumstances.

399
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,080
Eh, what's that?

400
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,720
What?

401
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,640
What?

402
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,000
What?

403
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,000
What?

404
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,220
Wait, Ryozu.

405
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:32,980
Mr. Dance.

406
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,740
Please wait.

407
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,260
All right, this way.

408
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,500
Mr. Dance.

409
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,860
Damn it.

410
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,920
Give up.

411
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,100
Okay.

412
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,880
This way.

413
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,140
Odoriko!

414
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,560
Odoriko! Odoriko!

415
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,300
It's not what I expected.

416
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,000
You've made it too beautiful.

417
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,020
What's wrong? Odoriko!

418
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:20,480
Hold on!

419
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,080
My neck is tingling!

420
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,920
It's gone!

421
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,420
I saw it!

422
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,400
Who are you?

423
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,140
I'm the girl manga master, Ruririn.

424
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,300
The girl manga master?

425
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,800
You saw it?

426
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,480
Of course.

427
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,000
I saw everything with my naked eyes.

428
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,840
Perfect!

429
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,620
I failed to complete the plan!

430
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,240
There's only one solution.

431
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,300
What?

432
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,220
In other words, I will replace the doll.

433
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,380
What?

434
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,060
I won't say no!

435
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,960
I'll do my best, Ruririn!

436
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,320
Coach!

437
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,000
Why am I the coach?

438
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,980
You're the coach of the girl manga!

439
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,800
That's true, but...

440
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,420
Anyway, you have no choice.

441
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,540
You must choose me as you partner.

442
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,660
Oh, I see!

443
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,820
He came all the way.

444
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,220
I'll try my best!

445
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,300
Go for it!

446
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,100
10 million!

447
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,360
Now, the final will be released.

448
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,460
The final requires higher techniques and artistic expression than the flying Committee.

449
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,600
Now, which pair will be the best?

450
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,360
I wonder where Odoriko is.

451
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,020
Maybe it's just my imagination.

452
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,500
Odoriko looks different than before.

453
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,400
This is bad. I have to do something.

454
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,420
If this continues, I'll take you down with my strength.

455
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,860
I'll take you down with my strength.

456
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,220
What's going on?

457
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,300
32th pair, big minus.

458
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,540
Are you okay?

459
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,460
Ryo-chan, right?

460
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,300
I don't think I have any choice to win.

461
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,360
I'm still at a disadvantage.

462
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,700
Next.

463
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,840
Odoriko is too dynamic!

464
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,460
This is bad.

465
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,440
The 55th pair has passed as well.

466
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,600
I'm sorry!

467
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,740
I'm sorry!

468
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,260
There are too many winners!

469
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,960
Ryo-chan cannot afford this.

470
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,560
Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

471
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,720
Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

472
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,640
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

473
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,740
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

474
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,900
What are you doing, Ryo-chan?

475
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,800
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

476
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,160
Yaaaiiiiii!

477
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,740
Huh? That face!

478
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,380
Yaaaiiiiiiiiiii!

479
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,680
Shodormundell!

480
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,780
Damn it! You did it!

481
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,860
My feet are shaking!

482
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,240
I'm shaking!

483
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,360
Ouch! Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

484
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,600
Uwaaaaaaa!

485
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,620
What are you doing?

486
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,960
This is getting serious!

487
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,460
What are you doing?

488
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,460
This is bad!

489
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,400
Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

490
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,120
My feet are shaking!

491
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:13,060
I'm so messed up!

492
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,160
I'm not the winner of this competition!

493
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,020
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

494
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,200
Ryo-chan! Take this responsibility!

495
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,240
I'll pay you for this, Kankichi!

496
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,800
No, no...

497
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,620
The cake is delivered by Hanamuko and Hanayume.

498
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,080
Is this the only part-time job we have?

499
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,200
It's not perfect for us.

500
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,040
Stop it, you monster!

501
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,480
Help me!

502
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,100
Is this a crime?

503
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
I'm feeling couldn't help it.

504
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,960
Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.

505
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,260
T Estados Unidos!

506
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,440
What an existent robot.

507
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,060
The typhoon is coming again!

508
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,980
The storm is coming again!

509
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,900
The storm is coming again!

510
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,100
The typhoon is coming again!

511
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,240
The typhoon is coming again!

512
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,280
The typhoon is coming again!

513
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,680
The typhoon is coming again!

514
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,740
The typhoon is coming again!

515
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,540
The typhoon is coming again!

516
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,400
The typhoon is coming again!

517
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,480
The typhoon is coming again!

518
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,080
The typhoon is coming again!

519
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,220
The typhoon is coming again!

520
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:11,420
The typhoon is coming again!

521
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,320
The typhoon is coming again!

522
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,660
You made the world blindly open-minded!

523
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:17,920
You made the world blindly open-minded!

524
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,140
What do you think? I'm cool, right?

525
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,600
I still have plenty of ideas to come up with.

526
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,320
It's not evened feet of dream.

527
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,800
Everyone, will you call me Dr. Lyotsu?

528
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,200
Everyone, will you call me Dr. Lyotsu?

529
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,640
heights of everyone's imagination

530
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,680
It would be my pleasure, if I could be your co-presenter.

531
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,760
Somehow, I feel I can make something good now.

532
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,880
Somehow, I feel I can make something good now.

533
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,140
I watch you, whatever you do.

534
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,760
Come to our town

535
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,900
Thank you!
