That's the result of your previous medical exam.

23
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,540
Did you notice anything?

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,040
Your blood sugar is high.

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,540
You should be careful of your urine.

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,120
Where are you looking?

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,120
Here, here!

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,780
Your body is as big as 35 years old.

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,380
35 years old, 35 years old!

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,960
Wow.

31
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,880
You're young.

32
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,520
Is there a secret?

33
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,500
Actually,

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,640
I went to an athletic club about 3 months ago

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,540
and started building my body.

36
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,440
Athletic club?

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,560
That's right.

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,360
I went there because I was invited by my friends,

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
and it was very effective.

40
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,020
I'm not going to lose to young people.

41
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,280
No, I'm not going to lose to Ryotsu.

42
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,020
By the way,

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,980
you seem to have a nice face lately.

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,080
That's right.

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,140
I've also fixed my stiff shoulders.

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,080
What do you think, Terai?

47
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,940
Why don't you go there?

48
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,320
Oh,

49
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,080
but I'm not good at sports.

50
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,840
I'm tired.

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,220
Don't worry about that.

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,620
I'll start with the computer.

53
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,100
I'll test my strength with a computer

54
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,120
and start with the menu that suits the person.

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,460
I'm really good at it.

56
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,400
Good morning, Chief.

57
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,960
What do you mean, good morning?

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,580
You seem to be living a poor life as usual.

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,940
Do you think you can get a proper job with that?

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,380
Don't worry about that.

61
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,400
I have confidence in my strength.

62
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,600
I'm making a plastic model right now

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,060
and I've been working two nights.

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
The night before that,

65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,300
I've completed two new games.

66
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,100
Before that,

67
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,600
I've had a drink with my friends.

68
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,620
You idiot!

69
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,300
I think his voice is more powerful than usual.

70
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,980
Is this the result of the athleticism?

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,980
Athleticism?

72
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,580
What's wrong, Chief?

73
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,720
Don't call me athletic.

74
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,900
I haven't eaten yet.

75
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,440
You should train your head

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,180
before you train your body.

77
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,180
It's not food.

78
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,060
Athletic club is a place

79
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,560
where you train your body

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,080
and exercise for your health.

81
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,640
It's where you can train your body

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,040
with the latest fitness machines

83
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,980
and computer-based physical examination.

84
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,060
It's a place where you can train your body

85
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,120
with the latest physical examination.

86
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,640
You know that.

87
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,220
You're going to get paid.

88
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,260
Why are you so stupid?

89
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,780
You're going to exercise

90
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,580
with your money?

91
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,600
You don't understand, do you?

92
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,800
It's common sense

93
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,580
to spend money on beauty and health.

94
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,840
In the West,

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,460
people who can't quit smoking

96
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,100
and those who are obese

97
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,000
are considered people

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,600
who can't even manage their own body.

99
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,620
They can't become elite businessmen.

100
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,960
You're right.

101
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,000
You should experience both

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,460
when you can't even manage your own body.

103
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,120
I'm telling you,

104
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,860
you don't have to go there.

105
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,580
You have the strength.

106
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,540
You idiot!

107
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,360
I'm telling you that

108
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,420
scientifically calculated exercise.

109
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,880
I'm telling you,

110
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,340
if you let me say it,

111
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,520
you're wasting your money.

112
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,200
What?

113
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,580
What?

114
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,000
All right.

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,900
Then let's see

116
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,780
which one has more physical strength.

117
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,100
It's an athletic competition.

118
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,300
A competition?

119
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,240
Please stop it.

120
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,340
You're so mature.

121
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,920
Now,

122
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,540
are you scared?

123
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,200
Say whatever you want.

124
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,420
What's so funny

125
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,140
about wasting your physical strength?

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,100
You idiot.

127
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,320
What?

128
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,220
You always

129
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,940
talk a lot.

130
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,980
Well,

131
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,480
you don't have to compete.

132
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,800
I can see the result.

133
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,620
I understand.

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,620
Let's accept that challenge and stand up.

135
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,340
Oh,

136
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,080
you're motivated.

137
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,640
You don't have to regret it.

138
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,780
I have my own physical strength.

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,820
As proven,

140
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,580
I'm 35 years old.

141
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,760
But

142
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
let me decide the place.

143
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,000
Kamiari Athletic Square

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
from 2 o'clock tomorrow.

145
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,720
All right.

146
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,960
Be ready,

147
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,880
Ryotsu.

148
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,340
What's wrong with you,

149
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,020
Senpai?

150
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm a little suspicious.

151
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,480
No,

152
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,220
I'm fine.

153
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,220
I don't care.

154
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,260
What the hell is going on?

155
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,440
Kamiari Athletic Square

156
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,540
open anniversary?

157
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,660
A hundred million yen

158
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:39,920
bargain.

159
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,540
There is nothing wrong with this.

160
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,900
We can do it.

161
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,020
What? Athletics?

162
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,400
I was just paying for it.

163
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,480
You don't have to join us.

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,060
I want 1 million yen.

165
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,800
I'll pay for the house.

166
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,900
Hey, I've been waiting.

167
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,140
Oh, you're all here?

168
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,660
Yeah, we're all here to join you.

169
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,580
I see.

170
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,160
You're all so generous.

171
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,760
Is there something you want?

172
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,060
I wonder.

173
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,020
Oh, that voice.

174
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,760
The great man of Kameari.

175
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,520
You're all here too?

176
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,060
I can't believe I'm meeting you here.

177
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,460
We're all here.

178
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,660
We should go somewhere else.

179
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,080
Don't say that.

180
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,480
Hey, Ryo.

181
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,560
I knew it.

182
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,940
There's a ramen shop, a model shop, and a bar.

183
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,060
Ryo, pay for the house right away.

184
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,460
What else can you say about money?

185
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,620
We don't want to say it.

186
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,960
If you don't want to, give it back.

187
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,060
Wait.

188
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,180
When I have the money, I'll give it back.

189
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,260
Money? What are you talking about?

190
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,100
Nothing.

191
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,940
Welcome, everyone.

192
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,960
From now on,

193
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,340
we will hold a survival race to earn one million yen.

194
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,140
What?

195
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,060
Ryo, what's going on?

196
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,260
Huh? What is it?

197
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,440
I didn't know.

198
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,400
You used me?

199
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,400
You used healthy sports to make money?

200
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,340
Well, well, Chief.

201
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,700
It doesn't change the game.

202
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,960
Or do you accept defeat without fighting?

203
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,720
No, I won't lose to you.

204
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,660
I won't lose to you.

205
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,780
Then please enter.

206
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,120
If you participate, please change into this.

207
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,600
What's this?

208
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,240
What?

209
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,400
What?

210
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,460
What's this?

211
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,020
It's a cockroach.

212
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,620
Then please move over here.

213
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,900
Why do I have to dress like this?

214
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,740
I don't want to.

215
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,120
Ooooo.

216
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,520
Ooooo.

217
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,480
Wow, it's amazing.

218
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,040
A huge large facility.

219
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,360
What's going on here?

220
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,420
Are we going to be cockroaches?

221
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,320
Ice, this is Utsubi'saría.

222
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,220
Everyone, welcome.

223
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,440
I think there are more than 20 cesarias here.

224
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,240
He's been through a lot and has gone through a lot of obstacles.

225
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,120
That's a real "Gokiburi's secret experience".

226
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,020
I didn't expect him to make something like this.

227
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,360
If you're going to quit, it's a matter of time.

228
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,600
What? Who said I'm going to quit? Let's see who wins!

229
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,540
The goal is the bread on the rack in the fridge.

230
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,260
The person who reaches this bread within 30 minutes is the winner.

231
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,560
There are three courses on the floor.

232
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,440
You can choose which course you want to take.

233
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,680
Choose your favorite course.

234
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,020
It's the closest way to go from the front.

235
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,520
No, there's too much space.

236
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,580
There must be a trap.

237
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,060
I'll go through the top drain.

238
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,080
I hope you all have a good time.

239
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,480
Ready...

240
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:41,800
Start!

241
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
This is the best!

242
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,460
I'll do my best for my own money!

243
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,080
You've been imitating Ryo, haven't you?

244
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,520
Let's leave it to Ryo-chan's "Gokiburi-like" intuition.

245
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes.

246
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,220
It's hard to climb, isn't it?

247
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,040
We'll break through the front!

248
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,440
One more chance!

249
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,400
The Gokiburi-like power is on the floor!

250
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,620
This is so real!

251
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,860
The electricity here is not strong.

252
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,240
The electricity here is not strong.

253
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,640
I can't see it.

254
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,440
The floor is sticky.

255
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,340
Ouch!

256
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,420
Ouch!

257
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,840
Ouch!

258
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,420
What is this?

259
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,120
No way!

260
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,920
This is...

261
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,640
The Gokiburi-like power!

262
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
The floor is in a panic.

263
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,580
The drain is the correct answer.

264
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,960
The million yen is mine!

265
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,020
The million yen is mine!

266
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,380
Ouch!

267
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,780
Ouch!

268
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,560
Ouch!

269
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,620
Ouch!

270
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,660
Help me...

271
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,940
Ryo-san, help me.

272
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,300
That's right.

273
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,060
If you can make the plastic and radio-con plug

274
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,960
work, I think I can help you.

275
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,180
That's terrible!

276
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,440
Yes, if you want.

277
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,000
Wait!

278
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,040
I understand, so help me!

279
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,040
I have to.

280
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,280
Come on, get caught here.

281
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,360
It's too late.

282
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,820
You're late.

283
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,760
You go first, Ryotsu.

284
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,540
Damn it.

285
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,360
It seems that it will disappear every minute.

286
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,220
We'll break through the next time it disappears.

287
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,160
One minute.

288
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,380
I can't wait one minute.

289
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,760
I can't believe this.

290
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,540
It's not human.

291
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,020
You're an adult, so you should not overdo it.

292
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,320
I can't believe it.

293
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,120
Chief, a criminal named Goto is waiting for you over there.

294
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,820
What? Where?

295
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,260
Where?

296
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,420
What?

297
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,320
You can't break through the world with your strength alone.

298
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,740
You have to use your head too.

299
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,140
Ryotsu.

300
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,640
You're tough. You go first.

301
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,880
You're dirty.

302
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,200
There's a criminal named Goto.

303
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,340
Chief, there's no idiot who gets caught with the same hand.

304
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,020
There are 10000 yen there.

305
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,060
What? 10000 yen?

306
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,500
He's so simple.

307
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,360
How about that, Ryotsu?

308
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,840
Try to do something with your proud head.

309
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,240
I'm still going to lose.

310
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,840
How far have you gone, Ryo?

311
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,740
What is this?

312
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,500
It's the rule.

313
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,520
Hey!

314
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,900
What? Ryo-chan is inside the Gokiburi Koi-koi?

315
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,600
Yeah, even if it's Ryo-tsu, it's impossible to escape from there.

316
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,760
If he's not there, there's no need to panic.

317
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,800
I was a little too focused on flying earlier.

318
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,560
I'm sorry.

319
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,600
A lot of things are coming together!

320
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,900
Wow! It made the impossible possible!

321
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,180
It's exactly the strength of a Gokiburi.

322
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,960
It's a wonderful strength.

323
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,400
Owner, the forecast is a high pace.

324
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,700
At this rate, a considerable number of people will be able to reach the goal in less than 30 minutes.

325
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,320
What?

326
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,060
That's why I told you.

327
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,640
What are you going to do with all the money you're going to spend?

328
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,680
I don't have the time to spend money right now!

329
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,720
I see.

330
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,200
I didn't know you'd use this.

331
00:14:51,720 --> 00:15:03,420
I'm a little late.

332
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,520
I'm sorry.

333
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,140
What?

334
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,900
What?

335
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,200
What?

336
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,400
What?

337
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,660
Go!

338
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,040
How is this a gas?

339
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,360
How is this a gas?

340
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,260
Did you see the power of the robot arm?

341
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,060
For the moment of truth...

342
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,340
I don't know if this is true, but I can still see the power of a gas.

343
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,480
I'm going to push on the gas.

344
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,860
I can't move it, so I'll push on the gas.

345
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,580
I can't move it, so I'll push on the gas.

346
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:54,980
I can't move it, so I'll push on the gas.

347
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,340
I can't move it.

348
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,240
I'm going to push on the gas.

349
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,040
But thanks to you, we got the stone.

350
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,340
It's here!

351
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,720
Ryo?

352
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,120
What? The Nakagawa are here?

353
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,480
Yes. They attacked us and we ran away.

354
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,680
But we couldn't get out of here.

355
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,020
Damn it. I can't stand here with a million yen.

356
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,860
Let's all get out of here at once.

357
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,400
What?

358
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,640
They are machines. They can't move fast.

359
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,900
While someone is being sacrificed, the others can move forward.

360
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,220
Interesting.

361
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,620
Good.

362
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,300
Listen, no one should be hurt.

363
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,260
Now! Go!

364
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,840
They are being attacked.

365
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,240
I knew it.

366
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,540
They are cheating!

367
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,680
Who is cheating?

368
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,700
Now!

369
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,120
Damn it! I'm the only one who got beaten!

370
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,340
Don't eat me!

371
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,100
I'm sorry, senpai.

372
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,380
Don't bother me. I'm not your opponent.

373
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,580
I'll teach you a lesson.

374
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,900
How is it?

375
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,460
It's hard to hit a vertical.

376
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,440
Ryo!

377
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,040
Chief, you are alive?

378
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,860
I won't forgive you.

379
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,920
Damn it.

380
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,420
Amazing! They are getting closer to the wall.

381
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,500
It's like a real cockroach.

382
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,060
I must get out of here at once.

383
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,880
It seems to be hard.

384
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,460
I'll be down in no time.

385
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,980
I can't.

386
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,640
Funny!

387
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,860
I'll make a good accident with this ball.

388
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,500
Don't touch this ball!

389
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,100
You too, you.

390
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,400
You're a calculative.

391
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,060
That's right!

392
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,900
dumbbell.

393
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,480
I heard it.

394
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,740
Don't follow me around! You're always imitating me!

395
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,240
You're the one who's imitating me!

396
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,920
You're a coward!

397
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,500
Senpai, you finally got beaten.

398
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
You've gone to such a good place.

399
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,460
He came out of there!

400
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,400
He's moving more than a real person!

401
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,880
The chief is pretty good too.

402
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,720
Hehehehe...

403
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,860
Chief! A present for you!

404
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,280
Now I've got a million yen!

405
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,360
Here you are!

406
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,400
There's nowhere to hide from me from now on.

407
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,380
As expected, the goalkeeper is tough.

408
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,020
He's not going to be able to keep up with me.

409
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,880
*slurp*

410
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,660
*slurp*

411
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,140
*slurp*

412
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,900
*slurp*

413
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,160
*slurp*

414
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,600
*slurp*

415
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,320
The goal is right in front of me.

416
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,880
The million yen belongs to me!

417
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,020
Here you are!

418
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,300
Here you are, chief!

419
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,680
I won't forgive you!

420
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,920
Please calm down!

421
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,460
A small voice...

422
00:19:59,460 --> 00:19:59,620
Come here!

423
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,860
What's going on?

424
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,980
I found you!

425
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,680
*slurp*

426
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,040
*slurp*

427
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
I found you!

428
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,540
Damn!

429
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,280
I was almost there!

430
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,580
You came all the way here and got beaten!

431
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,940
*slurp*

432
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,480
Okay!

433
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,100
Now that's my deal!

434
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,640
*slurp*

435
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:19,980
*slurp*

436
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,460
This feels bad.

437
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,760
I'm going to bring this over completely.

438
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,360
*slurp*

439
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,460
*slurp*

440
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,420
*slurp*

441
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,140
*slurp*

442
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,320
*slurp*

443
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,440
You don't think it's going to stop me?

444
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,460
All of you are done for.

445
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,780
Yeah, of all of us, all of you are done for!

446
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,840
Hey, chief!

447
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,260
You won't get away with this, not yet.

448
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,340
*slurp*

449
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,140
Wow!

450
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:44,940
Breaking!

451
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,380
One million yen!

452
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,620
Give me that!

453
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,080
One million yen!

454
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,640
What a mess!

455
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,080
How about this?

456
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,160
What's going on?

457
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:41,640
No! I'll be caught in the rain!

458
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,240
I'll be caught in the rain!

459
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,680
He flew away!

460
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,080
Damn it! My guts!

461
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,980
I did it!

462
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,940
I got one million yen!

463
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,160
One million yen!

464
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,140
Chief, I told you.

465
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,680
It's useless to pay for athletics.

466
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,920
Can't you change?

467
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,020
I liked it, so I got it as a souvenir.

468
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,680
Live as a cockroach for the rest of your life!

469
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,320
You did it, Ryo.

470
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,760
Congratulations!

471
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,040
I knew you'd do it.

472
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,560
And as promised...

473
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,460
There's a whole Komuro family over there!

474
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,700
Damn it!

475
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,780
If you can do it, then do it!

476
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,420
You're weak!

477
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,460
You're weak!

478
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,380
You're weak!

479
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,540
You're weak!

480
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
That's one million yen!

481
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,940
Damn it!

482
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,740
You're so strong.

483
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,340
It hurts!

484
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,080
It hurts!

485
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,640
It hurts!

486
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,240
Take this!

487
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,520
Hey!

488
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,280
Hey! Wait! I have a million yen!

489
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,720
Oh, this is...

490
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,080
What's wrong?

491
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,680
Look at this!

492
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,820
Recently, there was a witness saying that he saw a giant cockroach on the island of dreams.

493
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,820
And finally, we, the crew, succeeded in putting that figure on the camera.

494
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,920
Cockroach?

495
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,860
Then, please watch the shocking video.

496
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,920
Cockroach?

497
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,480
A million yen.

498
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,640
My million yen.

499
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,980
Damn it! Where did it go?

500
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,520
My million yen!

501
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:06,600
What should I do?

502
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,420
I failed to create a picture of the precious photo asked by the director!

503
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,880
No good! No good! No good!

504
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,440
If you find it out, I will not forgive you.

505
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,560
I have to lie to you whatever it is.

506
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,960
Next time, we will reproduce the film "Kyoto Lyoko".

507
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,800
Please look forward to it.

508
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,040
Watch for the next time

509
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,240
Watch for the next time

510
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,160
Watch for the next time

511
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,760
Because time will pass

512
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,820
Don't look down

513
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:47,180
Let's laugh and live

514
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:57,300
Even if it rains today

515
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,240
Tomorrow will be clear

516
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,280
Bye bye

517
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,640
Let's wash our hands

518
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,720
Goodbye for the unpleasant things

519
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,280
Oh yeah

520
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,980
Let's live as we like

521
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,380
There are good things

522
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,340
Outside the door

523
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,280
Let's go

524
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,660
The sun is calling
