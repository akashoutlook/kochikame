00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:29,660
ない奴は俺んとこへ来い俺もないけど心配するんだ2

3
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,940
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

4
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,960
They'll be alright eventually

5
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,700
You understand, right? You understand, you understand?

6
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,040
If you understand, then quietly follow me!

7
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,740
Ryochi and Komachi are ballin'?

8
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,480
8, 9, 10, you're right.

9
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,760
Well, I'll contact you when you're enrolled.

10
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,080
I feel sorry for the neighbors who can get the latest type of plasma TV at such a low price.

11
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,880
The customers are lucky.

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,500
After that, you can run around the sports event and get the prize.

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,860
These 100,000 yen are all mine.

14
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,740
Easy peasy!

15
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,320
The police station, the ball, the sports event?

16
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,160
The prize is amazing!

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,000
There's even a brand-name product and an overseas trip!

18
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,700
Wow!

19
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,180
Wow, amazing!

20
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,800
Hey, don't you want to go out with everyone?

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Four of us, relay?

22
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,840
Komachi!

23
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,820
I'll definitely get Gaultier's wristwatch!

24
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,580
Oh, I already have a competition event, so you can get another relay.

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,200
What?

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
You can't go out now?

27
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,360
What's going on, Maria?

28
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,380
I'm sorry, Ryo.

29
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,620
But, the right triangle can't go out unless it's a man and a woman.

30
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,400
I'm a woman, but my body is a man, so I can't go out!

31
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,940
I've practiced.

32
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,760
I've practiced for two weeks.

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,900
But I can't do that now.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,560
Ryo, what's wrong?

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,760
Huh?

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,800
Reiko!

37
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,000
The heart, the body, and the woman, Reiko!

38
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,160
Come out on the two-man triangle with me!

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,300
And win the championship!

40
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,740
What?

41
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,180
Please!

42
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,680
Come out on the two-man triangle with me!

43
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,640
But why is it a two-man triangle, senpai?

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,540
It's because it's a hole.

45
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,440
A hole?

46
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,240
A hole?

47
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,960
I see.

48
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,680
Hey!

49
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,600
Ryo is a newbie!

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,480
I can't lose!

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:14,980
Just come out on the two-man triangle!

52
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,360
Oh, it's okay!

53
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,760
I don't know about other things, but at that time you were very strong!

54
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,280
That's why I want to compete against me!

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,720
Let's go out!

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,640
What?

57
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,720
You just came to support us, Hattori-san!

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,220
You're not recophyting me!

59
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,220
If it's a pair-out, it's a fork dance.

60
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,260
If we get serious about it, we can win the championship.

61
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm sorry, but I'm already registered for the girls' relay.

62
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,040
Registered? What's that?

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,420
Senpai, you haven't registered for the room yet?

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,140
If I don't register, I can't go to the sports day.

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,960
The deadline for registration is 5 p.m. today.

66
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,920
5 p.m. today?

67
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,960
Then, the registration for the sports day will be...

68
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,280
Stop!

69
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,880
I'll register for the two-person-three-person.

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,080
My partner must be registered by the end of the day.

71
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,440
The two-person-three-person is a lottery for the one who wants to be a member.

72
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,600
A lottery?

73
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,180
The two-person-three-person is a lottery for the one who wants to be a member.

74
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,040
Why are there so many two-person-three-person-want-to-be-a-member?

75
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,220
Because they're stupid.

76
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,380
They all think the same way.

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,060
But now we can't switch to another category.

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,800
As there are many want-to-be-a-member, we decided to cast a lottery for the partner.

79
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,780
The partner will be chosen by the lottery draw.

80
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,700
What?

81
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,580
The two-person-three-person-partner will be the one who draws the same lottery as the partner.

82
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,620
I don't have time to find a partner.

83
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,500
What?

84
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,500
Two people in the front row have won, so there are two more groups.

85
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,760
If you don't win the lottery, you won't get anything.

86
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,580
Ready, go.

87
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,360
Yes.

88
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Another one has won.

89
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,400
There's one more group left.

90
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,680
Wait a minute.

91
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:18,980
Yes.

92
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,620
One more.

93
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,460
Yes.

94
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,180
You're stretching your arm so fast.

95
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,560
No one'll be zero in the end.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,200
I'm a total loser.

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,300
It's about time to get to the end of the game.

98
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,440
Yes.

99
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,620
One for you.

100
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,120
Yes.

101
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,040
Oh, that was close.

102
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,920
You're a winner?

103
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:33,980
Simultaneous.

104
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,780
Oh, that's the end of the game.

105
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,220
It's the end of the game.

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,840
Come on.

107
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,440
It's the end of the game.

108
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,900
You have to win the first game.

109
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,760
Come on.

110
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,320
Ah, Komachi! I can't believe we're with you!

111
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,660
I can't do anything with a pervert, pervert, and gorilla!

112
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,180
I can't do anything!

113
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,280
I can't do anything with a pervert, pervert, and gorilla!

114
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,260
You're right, you grumpy monster!

115
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,440
What's wrong with you?

116
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,000
So you two are in danger, right?

117
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,120
No! I'm telling you to change your partner!

118
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,940
That's right! You don't care if you change with someone else right now!

119
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,340
It's a rule! You're in danger, you grumpy monster!

120
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,880
Stop it!

121
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,740
Stop it!

122
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,520
Stop it!

123
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,840
Stop it!

124
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,540
Stop it!

125
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,340
Stop it!

126
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,100
Stop it!

127
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,720
Stop it!

128
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,880
It's better to join the pervert than to get the watch of Galtier!

129
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,100
Stop it!

130
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
You won't be able to do anything.

131
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,540
It's better to be with Komachi while archers.

132
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,940
It's better to be with Komachi while archers.

133
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,400
This is impossible!

134
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,000
Komachi, you can do one pervert.

135
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,540
What do you mean?

136
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,960
Well, we have three answers, so...

137
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,380
We have three perverts in the first round!

138
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,860
That's right!

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,860
Well, I have to go now.

140
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,400
Hm?

141
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,540
Who?

142
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,360
Komachi?

143
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,100
Komachi?

144
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,960
Mom, how was your Taiwan trip?

145
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,800
Yeah, I'm cooking with my dad right now.

146
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,000
I want to see your face if you're going to Tokyo.

147
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,820
Sorry, I have something I can't skip on Sunday.

148
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,720
I have something to do.

149
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,000
Komachi, it's your dad.

150
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,780
Dad, please enjoy your trip with mom.

151
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,080
It's a gift from Komachi.

152
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,180
I'll enjoy it with my friends.

153
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,780
Dad, why don't you ask him?

154
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,720
Komachi, what's going on with Ryotsu after that?

155
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,820
Oh, it's Mr. Ryotsu Kankichi.

156
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,660
His eyebrows are thick and his legs are short.

157
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,680
Hey, are you still saying that?

158
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,680
How many times do I have to tell you that I can't do anything with such an amateur?

159
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,700
I was here, Komachi. I looked for you.

160
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,700
Call me.

161
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm busy, so don't talk to me.

162
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
It's Mr. Ryotsu's voice now.

163
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,680
It's not over yet.

164
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,920
I'm glad, Dad.

165
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,860
I'm relieved, Komachi.

166
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,180
I'll be nice to you two because I won't get in the way.

167
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:26,880
Mom!

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,240
Bye.

169
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm out of breath.

170
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,780
Are you the country mothers?

171
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,060
You made a strange mistake again because of you.

172
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,920
Maybe Komachi and I are still in trouble.

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,300
You shouldn't have told us.

174
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:44,980
I was kidding.

175
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,280
You might think we're in trouble, but I'm theutter of a problem.

176
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,760
I'm sorry to listen to you.

177
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,140
But you cannot be.

178
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,480
I'm a body-fattening girl.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,400
A fetishist.

180
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,160
Religiously.

181
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,120
So...

182
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,180
My body is a little overweight.

183
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,640
Come on!

184
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,760
A woman has to be able to understand men she loves more and be with her because of her virtue.

185
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,440
I also notice that you're making trouble for me.

186
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,820
So, what about how many people you're seeing in your life?

187
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:11,860
I then I'll change all the time.

188
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,500
Damn it!

189
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,060
It hurts!

190
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,380
Hold on!

191
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,600
If you let go in the middle, you'll get a disqualification.

192
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,000
Good.

193
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't get too close, Sukibe.

194
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,800
Don't get too close? How are you going to run?

195
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,880
I don't want to be interested in a young man like you!

196
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,980
What did you say?

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,060
So, what's your position?

198
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,600
Fine, I'm going to start from the right.

199
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,580
You don't have to say it many times, you know it.

200
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,260
Ready!

201
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,040
It hurts!

202
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,760
What are you doing?

203
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,340
I told you to start from the right!

204
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,340
So, start from the left!

205
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,540
Your right!

206
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:07,980
I said it's your right!

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,700
I thought it was your right foot!

208
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't say things that are confusing.

209
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,120
You're so kind!

210
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,520
No!

211
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,940
You're the one who's late!

212
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,860
It's my fault!

213
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,440
Now, I'm going to start from the inside!

214
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,060
Ready!

215
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,120
Start!

216
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,820
Cartier's watch!

217
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,460
Plasma TV!

218
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,060
You're so useless!

219
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,280
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

220
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,800
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

221
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,560
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

222
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:48,940
Ouch!

223
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,700
Cartier!

224
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,080
Ouch!

225
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,380
Damn!

226
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,100
If I'd practiced beforehand, I wouldn't have lost!

227
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,560
It's Komachi's fault.

228
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,940
Give up on my plasma TV!

229
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,140
What a fool you are, Taiko!

230
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,340
This is the preliminary round.

231
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,920
We're second place, so we'll just have to win the finals, Tomma!

232
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,740
You're here, Komachi?

233
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,840
What? We have an hour before the finals, so I can do whatever I want!

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,080
We've been checking the flow of the finals, but it's not like we're going to the preliminaries.

235
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,800
Are you sure?

236
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,300
If we keep running like we did earlier, we'll never win.

237
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,280
We won't even get the TV or the clock!

238
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
But it's impossible for us to match your pace.

239
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
This is the secret weapon that will make that impossible possible.

240
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,020
What?

241
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,480
What is this?

242
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,160
It's the Nini-chan I made last night.

243
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,780
It's the Nini-chan I made last night.

244
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,280
It's the Victory Machine for the 2 of us!

245
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,420
It's a Truth dejar out of Protech!

246
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,700
Truth işin dotaikun ...

247
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,460
Don't offense me!

248
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:13,960
I, Komachi, will definitely win if the 1 of us can make our 2 in 3 win today!

249
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,720
What? The 2 of us?

250
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,700
It's Victory!

251
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,820
Yes.

252
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,540
Oh, hey, Mom.

253
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,860
Are you already at the airport?

254
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,620
What the ~!

255
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
What? What are you doing in that poor place?

256
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:30,920
Why are you here?

257
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,760
Dad is acting like a fool and says, "This way, this way."

258
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,960
Originally, it was my mom who said that.

259
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,520
Today, today, I'm almost at my father's mercy.

260
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,300
Dad is at his limit of patience.

261
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,440
That's what I'm saying, Komachi.

262
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Don't fight over useless things.

263
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,640
If it's now, it's still...

264
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,820
I'm out of breath.

265
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,320
What's going on?

266
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,600
Today, I gave a gift for a Taiwan trip at my parents' bank.

267
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,940
I gave a gift for a Taiwan trip at my parents' bank.

268
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,640
But instead of Haneda, who is at the airport,

269
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,000
I heard he's at Akabane for some reason.

270
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,140
Hanenoji is the only one who's doing it.

271
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,660
That's what couples are like.

272
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,340
And I'm nervous about a foreign trip that I can't get used to.

273
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,140
I thought I'd pick you up at Tokyo Station.

274
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,320
I'll be right back.

275
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,280
You're going?

276
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:25,640
Where are you going?

277
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,260
I'm sending you two to Haneda.

278
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,340
Get rid of this weird thing!

279
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,940
What about the final?

280
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,280
Hey, hey!

281
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,300
Hello, it's me, Ryo-tsu.

282
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,940
Oh, Mr. Ryo-tsu.

283
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,860
We couples are no longer allowed.

284
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,260
Please take care of my Komachi.

285
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,900
No, that's not what I mean.

286
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,900
Komachi can't walk right now,

287
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,000
so I'll ask around the station and go to Haneda.

288
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,160
Mr. Ryo-tsu.

289
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,120
I'm glad to see you.

290
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,740
I've been a wife for 25 years.

291
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,940
Couples are strangers after all.

292
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,240
If you're going to be with Komachi,

293
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,380
you'd better think about it.

294
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,180
No, I didn't mean it like that.

295
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,960
That's what I mean, Mr. Ryo-tsu.

296
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,620
What do you mean?

297
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,520
It's time for us to start walking our separate paths.

298
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,200
What?

299
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,960
We're going to walk our separate paths.

300
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,220
What?

301
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,240
Dad, Mom, what are you talking about?

302
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,560
I'm going to Hamamatsu-cho.

303
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,680
I'm going to Hamamatsu-cho.

304
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,460
I'm going to Hamamatsu-cho.

305
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,780
I'm going to Hamamatsu-cho.

306
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,640
Take this off.

307
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,320
I forgot the key.

308
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,720
I won't take it off.

309
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,240
What are you going to do?

310
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,660
How are you going to get it?

311
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,040
It's the wedding ceremony.

312
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,400
You're lost in the red field,

313
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,840
and you're in a divorce.

314
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,660
It's too much.

315
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,480
What?

316
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,320
If this happens, I'll go with you.

317
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,020
You're kidding, right?

318
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,800
I can't go to the final by myself.

319
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,600
If that's the case, I'll go with you,

320
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,740
and the safest way is to come back in a hurry.

321
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,020
You're going with me?

322
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,000
With two people and three people?

323
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,580
Let's go.

324
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,540
I'm Ono, participating in today's Taiwan tour.

325
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,880
Ono.

326
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,780
Ono Shojiro and Ono Masako.

327
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,220
Ono Shojiro and Ono Masako.

328
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,780
I'm your daughter.

329
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,840
We're busy.

330
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,160
We'd better take the train.

331
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,880
I'll be there.

332
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,860
Please wait a minute for me.

333
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,720
Ready?

334
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,140
Jackson,

335
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:34,940
Please wait a minute for me.

336
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,220
If you start the car,

337
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,360
you can't stop it этого.

338
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,580
if I start the car,

339
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,640
You can't reverse the car in that speed?

340
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,580
I don't have a pedal in the foot curb.

341
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,820
All I have is the body.

342
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,120
Please give me part of your body.

343
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,300
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move!

344
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,500
It's gonna crash!

345
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,640
It's gonna spin!

346
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,420
Idiot! It's the other way around!

347
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,800
You can't stop it, but you can back it up!

348
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,740
If you don't change the direction, it won't run as it is!

349
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,020
To change the direction, you have to crash into something again!

350
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,240
I have to!

351
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,140
Good job, the direction changed!

352
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,760
It's not good at all!

353
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,020
It's dangerous!

354
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,920
Let me know faster!

355
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,240
This time, it's a pedestrian bridge!

356
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,160
What?!

357
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,980
The uphill is still good.

358
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,740
The problem is downhill!

359
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,380
Help me!

360
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,960
The next is the uphill...

361
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:59,760
The next is the uphill...

362
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,740
Dad! Dad!

363
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,620
Dad! Dad!

364
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

365
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,180
It hurts!

366
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,500
Nakagawa, you're really something!

367
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,140
Congratulations on making it through the first place in the preliminary!

368
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,180
You're the best at the rental competition, aren't you, Terae?

369
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,700
Kei-chan, Terae-san!

370
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,960
Reiko-san!

371
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,420
Everyone, please do your best in the relay!

372
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
I'm so excited!

373
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,220
I can't see Komachi-chan and Ryo-chan's two-person triathlon team...

374
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,000
We've been looking for them for a while now, but...

375
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,380
Are they practicing secret training somewhere?

376
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,320
I'll make something weird like this!

377
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,860
I'll bring it here!

378
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,040
I'll set you free!

379
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,780
It's too much trouble to make you do something that big!

380
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,120
It can't be helped!

381
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,340
Even I didn't expect this.

382
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,720
Couldn't you contact your mom?

383
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,740
I don't have a cell phone...

384
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,600
I can't wait for her to contact her.

385
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,960
Hello, Dad?

386
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,540
Did you two bux?

387
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,180
Your Father and Mother broke up!

388
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,140
What?

389
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,900
Hello?

390
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,220
Dad, why don't you take the next train and follow your mom?

391
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,260
Yes, Hamamatsu, not Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu-cho.

392
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,200
We're heading there right now.

393
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,080
Mom, what are you doing?

394
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,220
Yes, Mom. I'm Ryotsu.

395
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,400
Okay, it's fine.

396
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,180
Mom, you go ahead.

397
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,220
Eh?

398
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,500
Did you get off?

399
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,340
Did you get off the train in Okachiba?

400
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,380
But I don't have a cell phone.

401
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,600
I got off the train and I'm calling you this week, Mom.

402
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,000
Get on! Get on!

403
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,040
Don't get off the next train and get off at Hamamatsu-cho!

404
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,040
We're heading there too!

405
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,180
That's what a married couple is like!

406
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,180
Masako!

407
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,600
Masako! Masako!

408
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,760
Dad!

409
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,360
Dad!

410
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,860
Thank goodness!

411
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,300
Hey, don't stop near the entrance!

412
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,840
It's already late.

413
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,020
The second line door is closing. Keep an eye on it.

414
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,340
Reiko-san!

415
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,420
Yes!

416
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,760
Reiko-san!

417
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,280
You can do it!

418
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,760
I can see the station, Komachi!

419
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,760
Yay!

420
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,320
The train for Okuno-san and the others is almost here!

421
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,640
Huh?

422
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,480
Hello, Mom!

423
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,380
Hey!

424
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,260
Hey!

425
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,120
Komachi!

426
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,060
Where are you?

427
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,160
Everyone's looking for you!

428
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,420
Hey!

429
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,740
Hey!

430
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,640
Komachi, I think she's talking.

431
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,080
Huh?

432
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,620
Hey!

433
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,000
Hey!

434
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,220
Hey!

435
00:19:59,220 --> 00:19:59,340
Hey!

436
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,420
Hey!

437
00:19:59,420 --> 00:19:59,640
Hey!

438
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,460
Hey!

439
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,920
Naoko, I'm sorry!

440
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,320
We'll talk about it later!

441
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,200
Hey!

442
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,620
Where are you?

443
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,520
Dono Shiojiro and Ono Masako!

444
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,580
Komachi!

445
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,660
Kyo-ichi-san!

446
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,180
This way!

447
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,560
Làh!

448
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,480
Dad! Mom!

449
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,420
The reunion is coming!

450
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,040
Dad!

451
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,080
Yeah-

452
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,100
Enjoy it!

453
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,020
You have the best time!

454
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,300
Yay!

455
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,360
Wow!

456
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,180
T Oregon

457
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,640
So this is what you get to catch them.

458
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,220
That's the difference between the father and the mother with all the trouble.

459
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,280
But you Ho almost saw his face before the departure.

460
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,940
If it's good, I never quit.

461
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,840
I haven't finished yet.

462
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,580
Hello? Yes, this is Ono from Taiwan Tour.

463
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,900
I'm sorry, I'll be arriving soon.

464
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,660
I saw you again, you're in a perfect mood. You really look good together.

465
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,960
You're right.

466
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,340
After you return from your trip, you'll meet your parents again.

467
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,940
You don't have to go.

468
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,520
I'm at my limit.

469
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,620
Are you Mr. Ono? This way, this way!

470
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,020
I'm here!

471
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,360
Nice to meet you!

472
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,360
I'm going!

473
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,640
Huh? It's a daughter and a daughter-in-law.

474
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,220
You made it!

475
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,000
Ah, exercise!

476
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,700
Next, we'll do a two-person, three-person final.

477
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,120
The first course, the Shinjuku team.

478
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,100
The second course, the Arakawa team.

479
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,240
The third course, the Setagaya team.

480
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,340
The fourth course, the Suginami team.

481
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,240
The fifth course, the Katsushika team.

482
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,100
Is the fifth course, the Katsushika team, dangerous?

483
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,600
What's wrong, Ryo and the others?

484
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,980
Senpai, you wanted to go out so badly.

485
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,580
Ah, they're here!

486
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,740
Yes, yes, yes.

487
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,420
Ready!

488
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,340
I made it in time, but...

489
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,720
It's not...

490
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,220
It's not like this!

491
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,620
I came all the way here!

492
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,980
Huh? My legs are light!

493
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,480
If it's this...

494
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,300
Here I go!

495
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,720
Yeah!

496
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,940
Wow!

497
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,500
Yeah!

498
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,080
Yeah!

499
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,380
Yeah!

500
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,520
Yeah!

501
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,080
Yeah!

502
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah!

503
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,500
I did it!

504
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,520
President, Ryo did it!

505
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm glad, Ohara!

506
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,200
I did it!

507
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,940
I did it!

508
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,820
Ryo, you're the champion!

509
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,440
I did it!

510
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,040
I did it!

511
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,520
I did it!

512
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:00,980
I did it!

513
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,660
I did it!

514
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,660
Fifth course, the Katsushika team.

515
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,280
Disqualified!

516
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,100
Huh? Why?

517
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,040
I didn't put my feet on the ground, so I'm disqualified!

518
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,120
Disqualified!

519
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,040
Disqualified!

520
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,360
Disqualified!

521
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,140
Disqualified!

522
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,320
Disqualified!

523
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,380
Disqualified!

524
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:17,920
Disqualified!

525
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,280
Disqualified!

526
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,520
Oh, Katsushika!

527
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,680
I'm out of energy!

528
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,780
I was surprised, but...

529
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,140
Disqualified!

530
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,240
Disqualified!

531
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,160
Disqualified!

532
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,920
Disqualified!

533
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,440
Disqualified!

534
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,560
Disqualified!

535
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,040
Disqualified!

536
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,180
and how the moon is shining,

537
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,300
and how the village mayor ordered a wedding.

538
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,900
It's so exciting!

539
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,500
What are you going to do?

540
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,700
I don't know anything!

541
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,600
You explain it yourself!

542
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,880
It's your problem!

543
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,120
It's all your fault!

544
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,020
It seems that there are some good monkeys and dogs around here.

545
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,520
Maybe...

546
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,560
Maybe...

547
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,320
There's no way!

548
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,840
There's no way!

549
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,100
Mr. Honda, when you ride a motorcycle, your personality changes. Why is that?

550
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,620
Why is that?

551
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,980
Why does the sun rise only once every four years? Why is that?

552
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,080
Why is that?

553
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,300
Mr. Nakagawa doesn't lend money to the mass production company,

554
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,580
but he can easily borrow a tank or a fighter.

555
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,920
Why is that?

556
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,280
Mr. Reiko is a rich man,

557
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,900
but he works at a gas station. Why is that?

558
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,360
Why is that?

559
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,220
Why is that?

560
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,720
Damn it!

561
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,000
No matter how many times I do it,

562
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,120
it's the worst day ever!

563
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,260
This fortune-telling that I choose A or B,

564
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,660
no matter how much I pass by,

565
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,720
I end up here!

566
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,040
What the hell is going on?

567
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,680
What's going on?

568
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,660
I have a bad feeling about this day.

569
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,080
Next time,

570
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,040
"The Way of Fate"

571
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,360
See you then!

572
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Next time, "The Way of Fate"
