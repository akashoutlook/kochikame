41
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,780
"I'm hungry..."

42
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,540
"I'm hungry..."

43
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:32,960
"I'm hungry..."

44
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:45,400
The day after the rain, as if someone was calling me

45
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:55,260
I walked, looking back, and my mom was holding my hand

46
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:02,580
I felt a strange feeling at that time

47
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,720
So I walked along the black roadside of the Ake-do-gai

48
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,940
Everyone was a child at one time, but they all forget

49
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,940
They all look like they're proud

50
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,240
"I'm hungry..."

51
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:34,340
I felt a strange feeling at that time

52
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:45,020
Everyone was a child at one time, but they all forget

53
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,040
I walked, looking back, and my mom was holding my hand

54
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,620
They all look like they're proud

55
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,280
Everyone was a child at one time, but they all forget

56
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,640
to the town!

57
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,700
Thank you!

58
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,980
"The Lion's Journey to the City"

59
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,480
You idiot!

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,520
Ugh!

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,660
Poo-chan!

62
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,960
Are you done, Ryo-chan?

63
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,000
I got it!

64
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,420
Ugh, I'm saved.

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,780
What's that?!

66
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,060
Where am I?!

67
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,660
Watch out!

68
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,820
"The Lion's Journey to the City"

69
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,180
Ah, a dream.

70
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,100
What the...

71
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,480
What a dream.

72
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,200
I'm sure the chief won't get mad at me for coming out of a dream.

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,520
Huh?

74
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,500
Whoa!

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,080
What's this?!

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,220
Is there a thief on the bridge?!

77
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,880
No, I'm here, so it's not a thief.

78
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,160
This is no time for jokes!

79
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,460
Nakagawa is a thief.

80
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,940
Reiko is also a thief.

81
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,820
The priest...

82
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,220
That's right!

83
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,020
The priest!

84
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,040
That idiot!

85
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,220
How long are you going to patrol?

86
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,940
That means...

87
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,940
I'm the only one in the bridge!

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,280
It's my responsibility!

89
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,720
Huh?

90
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,540
Could it be...

91
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,840
Is this still a continuation of a dream?

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,560
Hmm?

93
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,540
Ugh!

94
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,360
Ugh!

95
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,620
It's not a dream after all!

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,100
Yes, chief!

97
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,660
I was sleeping in the empty room.

98
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,760
I'm sorry!

99
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,740
Well, it can't be helped.

100
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,600
I'll be careful next time.

101
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,800
I don't think the chief will forgive me for saying that.

102
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,260
This is bad.

103
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,700
I have to think of a good excuse before someone comes.

104
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,840
The priest is back!

105
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,960
Huh?

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,180
Nakagawa, you're early.

107
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,220
Yeah.

108
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,640
Nakagawa!

109
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,780
Oh, Reiko.

110
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,300
Huh?

111
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,360
Weren't you by my side today?

112
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,200
Ugh!

113
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,100
Remember what you have to do.

114
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,500
Ugh!

115
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,880
Even Reiko...

116
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,960
Good morning!

117
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,380
Whoa!

118
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,140
What's this?

119
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,200
What's wrong?

120
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,740
I'm a little dizzy.

121
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,740
So, while Ryo-chan was taking a nap,

122
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,760
someone broke into the exit and broke into the office.

123
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,600
It's sad to see Ryo-san, who's off work, attacking someone.

124
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,660
That's right!

125
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,920
The priest who went on patrol and left the exit empty is also guilty!

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,640
No, rather, the priest who left me lying down and went out is more serious!

127
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,620
Huh?

128
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,900
Oh!

129
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,520
Ryo-chan!

130
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,640
I'm sorry!

131
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,480
I'm so sorry!

132
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,760
But, that was quite a big scene.

133
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,840
The priest might be angry with this.

134
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
It seems that no one was taken, right?

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,900
That's good.

136
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,060
But let's keep this to Chief Ohara.

137
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,980
Nothing has been taken, so we don't have to report it, right?

138
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,620
Ryo-chan?

139
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,160
No.

140
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,120
As I thought.

141
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,900
No!

142
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,280
What's wrong?

143
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:14,600
No!

144
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,300
Huh? Mr. Tenai?

145
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,480
A gold badge from Chief Ohara.

146
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,660
What?

147
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,880
It's a badge from the head of the district office.

148
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,820
Amazing! It's real gold!

149
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,480
Wanna try it?

150
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,480
Congratulations, Chief!

151
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,300
Well, sometimes good things happen when you get old.

152
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,140
Chief Ohara was so happy that he showed us the badge yesterday.

153
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,560
He forgot the badge and went home.

154
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,940
I'll keep it until tomorrow.

155
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,580
Okay, I'll keep it!

156
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,920
You put it on this shelf, didn't you?

157
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,020
Yes. It was in the corner of the shelf until the patrol came.

158
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,520
He doesn't lock the shelf during the day.

159
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,480
What?

160
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,680
Maybe it's on the floor.

161
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,440
Let's find it.

162
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,340
Okay.

163
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,420
There's nothing here. What should we do?

164
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,040
This is the only thing we have in this room.

165
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,000
If we're pros, we can't overlook it.

166
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,720
It's a big mistake, Tenai.

167
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,000
Mr. Ryo!

168
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,980
It's a gold badge from the Ministry of Labor.

169
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,220
We can't buy it just because we want to.

170
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,940
This is the first prize of the gold and the silver medals.

171
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,260
It's a trophy of the first prize of the Ministry of Labor.

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,760
It may be found in the city of Kappabashi, but it's a different story when it comes to the gold medal.

173
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,440
It's a modest prize that has been obtained in the hands of the chief's blood, sweat, and worn soles for more than 10 years.

174
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,380
You put it on the shelf and gave it to Kosodoro.

175
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,160
It's a gold medal after all.

176
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,040
Ryo, that's a terrible thing to say.

177
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,680
It's not.

178
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,360
I'm sure you know that you're not that kind of person.

179
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,160
I should have put it in my locker.

180
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:30,580
I was lost for a moment at that time, but I thought that the chief would know when I wasn't there, so I was careless.

181
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,900
That's right. The chief's gold badge was stolen out of Tenai's carelessness.

182
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,860
I'll make it clear.

183
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:48,140
What is it?

184
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,620
Is my face on something?

185
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,100
Or do you like me?

186
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,980
Did I miss out on you?

187
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,320
Don't be so grumpy.

188
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,380
Tenai and I have a lot of jokes and jokes in the manzai.

189
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,900
We know each other well.

190
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:11,940
Tenai, don't worry about what Ryo said. Let's find the chief's badge together.

191
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,840
Let's find it together.

192
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,060
I can't bother you all. I'm sure I'll get the gold badge.

193
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,160
But if I don't come back, I'll tell Chief Ohara about this.

194
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,920
Chief!

195
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,420
Wait, Tenai!

196
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,640
If you leave it, I'll come back.

197
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,940
Ryo, Tenai is serious.

198
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,340
I'll find it.

199
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,540
I'll leave it to you.

200
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,120
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

201
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,760
What are you doing?

202
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,660
Ryo didn't notice it when he was sleeping in the afternoon, and he was sorry, right?

203
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,120
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

204
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,720
Ryo, it hurts!

205
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,100
He's been so serious that he even wrote a journey to thetrai.

206
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,100
If you're in trouble with a terai, you could take responsibility and take care of your wife and children.

207
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,520
Why would I do that to the terai god and my children...

208
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,280
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

209
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,820
Oh, he really did it. It's a good trouble for the temple.

210
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,600
Senpai, the temple is nowhere.

211
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,880
He just jumped out of the bridge without any clues.

212
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,420
How is he going to find the culprit?

213
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,960
I'll go over there.

214
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,960
The temple's behavior is sober, but it's a mess.

215
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,600
His great-grandson Tadayuki wanted a new one.

216
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,300
So he went to buy one.

217
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,200
Flash Cam Cam Bone, right?

218
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,220
My child wants one, too.

219
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
He's asking me to wait until his birthday.

220
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,960
I need to find a new job before that.

221
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,800
Job?

222
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,340
Are you okay by yourself?

223
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,760
Oh, thank you.

224
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm lost.

225
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,080
My grandson who always took care of me is already a child.

226
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,300
Time flies.

227
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,680
Oh, then be careful.

228
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,740
Oh, my.

229
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,640
I'm sorry.

230
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,920
That badge...

231
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,180
What is it?

232
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,260
No, it's a good badge.

233
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,500
Oh...

234
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,180
Oh!

235
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,640
Give me my hat back!

236
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,560
I'm sorry.

237
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,620
What am I doing?

238
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,840
Calm down.

239
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,800
Calm down and think about the culprit's footsteps.

240
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:44,900
I see.

241
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,340
Someone must be watching near the escape room.

242
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,660
Between two to three o'clock,

243
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,080
Didn't you see a suspicious person near the escape room?

244
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,380
A suspicious person, huh?

245
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,380
Ah, he woke up.

246
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,360
Ah!

247
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,860
Did you wake up?

248
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,920
My child?

249
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,380
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,760
It was a good help.

251
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,780
Come on.

252
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,200
Say goodbye to Uncle Terai.

253
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,500
Oh, my.

254
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,880
Goodbye!

255
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,580
Ah...

256
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,540
It's about three o'clock.

257
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,780
Did you see her?

258
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,640
The suspicious one.

259
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,960
Oh...

260
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,700
You're even higher, Mr. Terai.

261
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,320
Still high?

262
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,560
There!

263
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,800
Right there, more to the right.

264
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,880
A-a little...

265
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,320
Thank you, Terai.

266
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,700
Weirdo.

267
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,660
It looks like he didn't see us.

268
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,800
-Goodbye. -Shut up.

269
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,120
Goodbye.

270
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,020
Oh, that's when he was delivering some partying in the same neighborhood.

271
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,800
Really?

272
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,280
Yeah.

273
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,640
That's a strange guy.

274
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,360
Oh!

275
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,680
If you do that, he'll pack the rice for you.

276
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,360
Sorry for helping you, Mr. Jirai.

277
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,540
No, it doesn't matter what it is.

278
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,260
If you remember anything...

279
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,560
It's about noon.

280
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,920
Ah, I just remembered that a guy came out from the toilet alone.

281
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,380
Really?

282
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,060
If you remember a line or a hairstyle, please let me know.

283
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,080
He was longer than you.

284
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,840
He had short hair.

285
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,780
He was in a tight knit like this, and he was wearing something like...

286
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,000
- Wearing a jumper! - Yeah, he was wearing something like this.

287
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,200
Thank you very much!

288
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,980
I'll be a help! See you!

289
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:50,940
Ryo-san!

290
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,520
How are you going to find the culprit with that little information?

291
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,660
There are hundreds of young men with short hair in this town.

292
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,460
I'll hit one by one with hundreds of people.

293
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,500
I won't bother you.

294
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm already on it.

295
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm investigating in the police station now.

296
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,600
What!?

297
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,180
Ryo-san, you're in trouble.

298
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,220
I'll hit one by one with hundreds of people.

299
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:23,800
I'm already on it.

300
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,760
You're the only one who can't do this.

301
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,520
Apologize to the chief and ask him to forgive you.

302
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:28,740
What?

303
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,920
What's wrong, Rai?

304
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,180
H-he's...!

305
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,480
Let's solve this too.

306
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,380
You always pretend you're happy, but I don't care if you really get a cramp.

307
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,820
Why are you hiding?

308
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,360
Ryo...

309
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,500
Excuse me, but please excuse me.

310
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,620
He's running away!

311
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,860
He's a suspicious person!

312
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,420
I don't care how you feel, I don't care.

313
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,360
Kei!

314
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,100
Is Kanshiki home?

315
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
Yes, he went home a while ago.

316
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,320
How about you, Terai?

317
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
I haven't told him anything.

318
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,560
How about you, Senpai?

319
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,240
Ryo-chan hasn't come home yet.

320
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,520
That's weird.

321
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,620
Kanshiki said that this might not be the entrance to the Aki-su.

322
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,660
Eh?

323
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,960
Then who is doing this?

324
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,140
Wait a minute!

325
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,460
Stop! Stop!

326
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,100
You're so annoying.

327
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
Ryo-san!

328
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,640
What's going on?

329
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,060
What did I do?

330
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,940
Then why did you run away?

331
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,140
I ran away!

332
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,760
I'm sick of being questioned about my job!

333
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,600
What?

334
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,480
What happened?

335
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,540
If you don't mind, please tell me.

336
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,700
I quit the company because I was not good at my job.

337
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,280
It's been three years now.

338
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,420
I have no job.

339
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,600
I still have to pay the loan.

340
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,060
But I still owe money.

341
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,680
I divorced a year ago.

342
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,360
My family is living in Kyushu.

343
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,340
I returned to my parents' house.

344
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,900
Since then, I have been living without a place to live.

345
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,980
I'm not afraid of my family.

346
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,160
What?

347
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,320
Ryo-san.

348
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
Shiochiri-san is so annoying.

349
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,520
I've been working hard until now, but it's not enough.

350
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,340
What are you doing crying?

351
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,140
I can't believe it's someone else's problem.

352
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,900
When I asked the Katsushika office,

353
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,860
they said that your family had a request to find you.

354
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,080
The family?

355
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,100
Shiochiri-san is divorced and now lives alone.

356
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,500
But I checked the office.

357
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,780
The wife and children said that they would come to pick you up.

358
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,400
The wife and children?

359
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,860
The wife wasn't divorced.

360
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,840
She was looking for Shiochiri-san.

361
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,220
What?

362
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,120
What's wrong?

363
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,600
What's wrong?

364
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:28,720
What's wrong?

365
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,840
What's wrong?

366
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,680
Wait quietly in the office until your family comes to pick you up.

367
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Thank you, Terai-san.

368
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,100
Ryo-san.

369
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,720
Be strong.

370
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,680
That's good.

371
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,020
Now Terai's opinion is back.

372
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:57,940
Hey, you can't park there.

373
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,360
The driving is prohibited there!

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,480
The middle man who wears a jumper with a short hair.

375
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,060
Terai.

376
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:04,920
Hey.

377
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,560
Terai.

378
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,820
*Growl*

379
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,160
*Growl*

380
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,660
*Growl*

381
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:35,960
*Growl*

382
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,720
You're really a big shot!

383
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,400
*Growl*

384
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,380
*Growl*

385
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,020
*Growl*

386
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,120
They're so bad at talking...

387
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,860
Hey! We're on the move!

388
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,980
You're disturbing the camera, Mr. Oomari!

389
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,700
Excuse me!

390
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,020
Excuse me!

391
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,400
Mr. Ryo, give me back my sword.

392
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,360
*Growl*

393
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,940
I was so surprised.

394
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,820
If you were filming a movie, you should have put on your costume.

395
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,680
Oh, the person I saw earlier...

396
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,560
*Growl*

397
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,560
The actor, huh?

398
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,280
*Growl*

399
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,840
*Growl*

400
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,320
*Growl*

401
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,120
Hold up!

402
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,060
Excuse me.

403
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:24,980
What's wrong?

404
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,440
*Growl*

405
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,980
*Growl*

406
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,820
I'm sorry for being so loud.

407
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,800
I thought we'd be done soon.

408
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,540
That's true.

409
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,460
Actually, Marie and John...

410
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,700
*Growl*

411
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,780
*Growl*

412
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,960
Marie, you're not allowed to come!

413
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,300
*Growl*

414
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,360
Come here!

415
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,380
*Growl*

416
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,240
*Growl*

417
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,600
*Growl*

418
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,120
*Growl*

419
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,520
*Growl*

420
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,040
*Growl*

421
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,760
*Growl*

422
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,920
What should we do?

423
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,760
*Growl*

424
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,880
Then, was the dog the one who broke the safe?

425
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,180
I'm sorry.

426
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,480
Um, I can't find a black gold bag in the bookcase over there.

427
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,280
Do you know about that?

428
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,900
I don't think I have it.

429
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,920
Anyway, we have to tell the priest.

430
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,980
*Growl*

431
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,640
*Cough*

432
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,460
*Cough*

433
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,560
*Cough*

434
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,180
Damn, he's so stubborn!

435
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,370
*Cough*

436
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,220
*Cough*

437
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,520
*Cough*

438
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:35,840
*Cough*

439
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,440
*Screams*

440
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,100
What the hell is this?

441
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,720
*Cough*

442
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,000
*Screams*

443
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,600
*Cough*

444
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,420
I won't let you get away!

445
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,860
Hey, let go!

446
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,860
No, I won't let go!

447
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,100
Let go, let go!

448
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,820
*Screams*

449
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,120
*Screams*

450
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,060
Damn, he's so stubborn!

451
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,880
*Screams*

452
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,080
*Screams*

453
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,240
*Screams*

454
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,260
*Screams*

455
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,100
*Screams*

456
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,320
Ryo-san...

457
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,880
*Screams*

458
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,960
*Screams*

459
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,400
*Screams*

460
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,200
I stole the

461
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,420
*Screams*

462
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:20,720
*Screams*

463
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,780
*Screams*

464
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,000
*Screams*

465
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,820
*Screams*

466
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,600
*Screams*

467
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,340
*Screams*

468
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:38,380
*Screams*

469
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,840
*Screams*

470
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,320
What are you stealing in a place like this?

471
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,680
A helmet or a Juralumin shield?

472
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,440
That's enough, Ryo. Thank you.

473
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,280
Don't apologize, Terai.

474
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,800
We caught the thief's accomplice.

475
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,360
The chief should be watching the badge a lot.

476
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,340
Ryo was the one who caught him.

477
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:12,680
Ryo, that's right.

478
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,640
Besides, I can't do a deal like that.

479
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,380
We've been through a lot together, Ryo.

480
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,500
But I won't forget what happened today, even if I quit being a police officer.

481
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,580
Terai...

482
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,140
What? It's you guys?

483
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,800
Chief!

484
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,140
I happened to pass by,

485
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,320
and I saw some men in the grass.

486
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:42,760
I heard they were having a rampage,

487
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,660
so I came to see how they were doing.

488
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,300
Chief! What's wrong with that?

489
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,680
Oh, this?

490
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,880
I tried to look young, but I don't think I look good.

491
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,560
A badge!

492
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,400
Yeah.

493
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,460
Tonight, I suddenly met a friend from my school days.

494
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,180
I was going to show him off,

495
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,460
so I went back to the police station to get it.

496
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,320
What is it, Ryo?

497
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,620
Ryo, you haven't told Terai yet?

498
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,400
I told you, didn't I?

499
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,620
What?

500
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,860
Ryo, what do you mean?

501
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,600
Well...

502
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,420
Well...

503
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,120
Ahhhhh!

504
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,600
Hey, Ryo!

505
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,100
Don't sleep in the middle of your work!

506
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,440
Huh?

507
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,360
No, Chief.

508
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm not sleeping.

509
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,500
Tell Terai that I'm back to get the gold badge.

510
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,540
Okay?

511
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,480
Yes, sir.

512
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:40,700
I understand.

513
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,020
And you!

514
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,580
Don't sleep!

515
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,220
She hasn't slept!

516
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:46,760
See you soon!

517
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,400
...

518
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,960
...

519
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,560
That was not a dream!

520
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:06,660
It wasn't a dream!

521
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,220
You knew everything, Ryo-san.

522
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,060
No, to be honest, that's not true, Terai.

523
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,040
I was so sleepy that I was almost unconscious.

524
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,900
What's with those eyes?

525
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,120
They just confirmed their friendship!

526
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,900
Well, I'm glad I found the gold badge.

527
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,140
I'm glad I found the gold badge.

528
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,600
Oh, the chief is here too!

529
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,560
Oh, what are you two doing here?

530
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,420
Oh, you found the gold badge.

531
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,220
That's great!

532
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,420
I've been here all this time.

533
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,020
You knew, Ryo-san, didn't you?

534
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,220
Didn't you?

535
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,040
Ryo-san!

536
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,460
