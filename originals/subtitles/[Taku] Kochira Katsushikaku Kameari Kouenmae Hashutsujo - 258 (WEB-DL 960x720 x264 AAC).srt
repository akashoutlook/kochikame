1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:00,660
The End

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,300
I can't do this. I've got the wrong handwriting.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,580
Do you have an eraser?

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,100
I can't erase with a ball pen.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,920
I can't help it. I'll erase with a stick.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:15,860
It's dirty!

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,600
It's even dirtier.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,560
I have no choice but to paint it black.

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,260
You idiot!

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,400
If you want to erase an important document with a stick,

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,640
you don't have any intelligence!

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,440
You idiot!

13
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,260
It's always so hard, boss.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,260
Read this.

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,300
Who wrote this dirty handwriting?

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:36,980
It's yours.

17
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,680
Mine? That's strange.

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,260
Was I this desperate?

19
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,020
Read it.

20
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,360
September 1st.

21
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,380
This handwriting...

22
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,100
Do you know what this handwriting is?

23
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,760
Don't write your own handwriting!

24
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,460
People with good handwriting

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,300
are good at everything.

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,020
Money is also good at everything.

27
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,100
And so is your way of life.

28
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,700
That's you.

29
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,440
You're being prejudiced!

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,660
You can read it!

31
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,240
You can read it!

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,600
You can read it better than Nakagawa and the others.

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,400
Look.

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,260
I've stopped at the end.

35
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,620
The "Kichomen" is in the handwriting.

36
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,400
Yours is a dirty handwriting that you don't want to stop.

37
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,100
The next handwriting has a good balance of parallel lines.

38
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,340
Yours has no parallel lines at all.

39
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,560
It's the other way around.

40
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,000
This handwriting has a good balance.

41
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,100
Yours is a good balance of parallel lines.

42
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,840
Yours is a good balance of parallel lines.

43
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,940
And what are you going to do with this?

44
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,440
What are you going to do with this?

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,420
You know what?

46
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,220
I'm going to rewrite the report until tomorrow.

47
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,000
Got it?

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,260
When you watch TV,

49
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,800
make the room bright and

50
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,440
look away.

51
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,940
If you're not rich,

52
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,880
come see me.

53
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,440
I'm not rich,

54
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,640
but I'm worried about you.

55
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,840
Look at the blue sky,

56
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,320
look at the white clouds,

57
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,560
look at the blue sky,

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,020
look at the white clouds,

59
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,420
and you'll see

60
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,860
what I'm talking about.

61
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,460
what I'm talking about.

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,020
You understand, right?

63
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,780
I understand! I understand!

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,300
If you do, just shut up and follow me!

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,280
You idiot!

66
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,660
Huh?

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,200
I told you to submit your work by today!

68
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,140
I'm always sending you a life without any responsibility, so this is what you're doing!

69
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,700
Senpai, did you do something again?

70
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,100
I forgot the report that I was told to rewrite by Chief Ohara, so I was just doing it.

71
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,980
You can finish it all tonight!

72
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,940
Do it, Ryotsu! No matter how many hours it takes!

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,020
Yes, I understand! I should do it, right?

74
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,800
Hey, the character there is wrong!

75
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,240
What?

76
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,840
That Mimizu is dancing to Flanance!

77
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,160
What?

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,080
The character there is dancing to Flanance!

79
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,680
Don't write a manga and cheat!

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,160
Finally finished.

81
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,100
I can't believe you're so weak just by writing a report.

82
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:31,820
Huh?

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,820
Chief, what is this?

84
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,600
You can see it by looking at it. It's a death certificate.

85
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,740
I was doing pachinko while I was on duty.

86
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,360
Senpai, I'll excuse myself first.

87
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,920
Do your best, Ryo-chan!

88
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:48,980
Huh?

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
You guys...

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Don't go around talking nonsense! Hurry up and write a death certificate!

91
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,460
Oh, by the way, Chief, where did you decide to go on your next trip to the escape room?

92
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,700
Huh? A trip to the escape room?

93
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,140
No, Kei-chan. You said you were looking forward to seeing where you're going.

94
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,580
Wh-what?

95
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,240
Ah, that's right. Well, I'm looking forward to it.

96
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,420
Then, I'll excuse myself first.

97
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,180
Oh...

98
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,980
Chief, I don't think you're saying you forgot.

99
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,960
You said you don't have any sense of responsibility for people.

100
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,000
Huh, Chief?

101
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,960
I forgot! What should I do, Ryo-chan?

102
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,820
Then, I didn't have this death certificate.

103
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,840
What?

104
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,620
That's right. The Chief had forgotten an important matter, so he's your partner.

105
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,600
That's a different story!

106
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,380
Is that so?

107
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,280
Everyone was looking forward to your next trip.

108
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,580
So, what should I do?

109
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,820
What should you do? You can't make any reservation for a hotel from now on.

110
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,980
Can't you do anything about it?

111
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,600
I was impressed by the words you always say.

112
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,160
You said you'd take care of what you did yourself.

113
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,540
You're right. But it depends on the occasion.

114
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,920
If you leave it to me, I can do something about it.

115
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,040
This death certificate is...

116
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,060
Don't worry, Chief.

117
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,660
You can leave it to me at any time.

118
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,400
I see.

119
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,960
So, how much did you pay for your travel expenses?

120
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,500
I forgot to pay the rent for the travel expenses.

121
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,700
What?

122
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,640
What do you mean?

123
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,160
The budget is zero.

124
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,540
Huh? What?

125
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,360
I just remembered something.

126
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,560
Please, Ryo-chan! You're the only one who can endure it.

127
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,980
You're the only one!

128
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,240
I understand. I'll do something about it.

129
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,460
Please! It's a promise between men!

130
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,780
Ryo's North Town Trip

131
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,560
Now, we're going on a trip to the Kamayari Park Exhibition Center.

132
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,480
Today's trip is specially designed to review this megacity, Tokyo, from the ground up.

133
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,700
T-Tokyo?

134
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,160
Does that mean we can't leave within the range of the Yamanote Line?

135
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,260
That's right.

136
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,560
Tokyo is too short and I don't know much about it.

137
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,420
As a police officer who protects the capital, I need to know more about Tokyo.

138
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,840
Otherwise, I can't protect the safety of the city.

139
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,800
I see.

140
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,880
Good idea.

141
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,060
Thank you for your understanding.

142
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
And if you're in Tokyo, leave it to me.

143
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,400
I'll buy a coke from the Shinchu army in Tokyo,

144
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,160
and I'll be called the first boy to drink coke in Japan.

145
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,480
I'll be called the first boy to drink coke in Japan.

146
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,960
Oh, you're right, Ryo-san.

147
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,060
You're not born yet, are you?

148
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Well, that's all I have to say.

149
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,340
The detailed course is written on this hand-written pamphlet I just sent you.

150
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,140
Well, first of all, it says "visit the traditional Tokyo".

151
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,300
I wonder if you're going to watch Kabuki or Noh.

152
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,140
Next, we're going to go on a water cruise.

153
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,560
After that, we'll go on a walk around the best outlet in Japan.

154
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,660
After that, we'll go on a walk around the best outlet in Japan.

155
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,240
The end is a

156
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,880
Let's go!

157
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,040
Yes!

158
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,920
Wait a minute!

159
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,380
Where are you going?

160
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,700
I'm going to buy a ticket.

161
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,620
You're going to take the train, right?

162
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,600
You're so naive!

163
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,180
You don't know the purpose of this trip.

164
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,180
I'm not buying a ticket.

165
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,700
The station is on the road!

166
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,080
You're going on a water cruise?

167
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,940
It seems so.

168
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,100
Water cruise?

169
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,120
Let's walk!

170
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,000
It's okay.

171
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,340
Walking is good for health.

172
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,680
Such a trip is fitting for a policeman.

173
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,000
Come on!

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,420
Let's walk without complaining.

175
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,800
Eh...

176
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,060
Where did you get the fish?

177
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,240
I took this in Ueno...

178
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,080
In the Edo period, the sea won't wet the area here.

179
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,200
It was a fairy tale.

180
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,720
Really?

181
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,360
You're just like the senior.

182
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,460
Really?

183
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,340
Right?

184
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,920
Maybe it's Ryo-chan's ancestors.

185
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,380
Yes, you can see the history, but what about the tradition?

186
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,360
Speaking of tradition, it's a tradition that has been going on for a long time.

187
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,720
In other words,

188
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,100
This is the Japanese tradition, the pigeon bean magic!

189
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,120
I don't know such a tradition.

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,440
Besides, the pigeon.

191
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,660
You're running away, senior.

192
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,540
I see. This is the tradition.

193
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,160
If you're Japanese, you don't have to do pigeon bean magic at all.

194
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,060
As expected of the chief.

195
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:08,520
Yes.

196
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,020
Give me your hand.

197
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,140
I'll collect the bean stand later.

198
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,640
The water cruise written on the pamphlet.

199
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,820
It looks like this.

200
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,200
I feel like I'm walking, coming, and getting tired.

201
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,040
I'll go.

202
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,620
I'll go.

203
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,580
Go on.

204
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,500
What?!

205
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,200
Senior, don't just look at the sky, and love yourself too.

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,280
Looking at the sky like this, I remember the Ryo-tuke-chan's years when I was a child.

207
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,320
Ryo-tuke-chan's years?!

208
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,300
Senior, what's that?

209
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,600
In the past, a lot of people in the department store of Oka-chi-machi told me about the story of the principalmente from the Tsu-kunaniya store in the Ik permis.

210
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,040
Oh, I see.

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,240
He borrowed money from the bank and took in the watch that my father always bragged about.

212
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,700
However, he used the money for the bar and the sake and spent it all in one night.

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,860
My father was chased by his mother and finally jumped into the Sumida River from Azumabashi.

214
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,060
It was exactly the crisis of the Ryotsuke.

215
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,840
In the end, the watch that he cherished became a junk.

216
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,000
If he were my father, he would have looked at the money he didn't have and come up with it.

217
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,540
It's like Ryo-chan.

218
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,720
So what were you doing?

219
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,280
I was resting on the boat here all the time.

220
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,940
You're so strong. I can't do that.

221
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,320
If I had been the manager at that time, I might have been the manager by now.

222
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,040
I'm sorry.

223
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,880
That's right.

224
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,420
The upper one was broken by half an hour.

225
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,760
I want to take a break.

226
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,200
Not yet. Let's go next.

227
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,720
I'm just looking forward to it.

228
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,480
Well, that's okay.

229
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,040
Next is...

230
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,320
The best outlet in Japan is a budget.

231
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,840
After all...

232
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,900
Now, let's act freely.

233
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,960
Gather here in an hour.

234
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,680
Act freely?

235
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,320
Even if you say that, you will be pushed and washed away by the crowd.

236
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,700
Ryo-chan, what should I do?

237
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,900
Oh, there he is.

238
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,300
Ryo-chan.

239
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,220
What?

240
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,280
This is too much.

241
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,540
I paid for the entrance fee and the boat fee of the museum myself.

242
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,060
I'm just a fool.

243
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,040
Even if you say that, the budget is zero.

244
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,720
It can't be helped that you pay for it yourself.

245
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
But...

246
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,860
As long as I leave it to me, the manager should not speak.

247
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,280
Ryo-chan.

248
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,940
Ouch.

249
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,680
Idiot. Where are you looking at?

250
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,560
That's it.

251
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
No, dad.

252
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,620
Idiot.

253
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,240
Is the store okay?

254
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,300
I'm selling oil here.

255
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,300
Hey, you.

256
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,140
You went to skip the class again, didn't you?

257
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,980
It's the liquor.

258
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,300
You also wasted the money in the store and drank in the daytime, right?

259
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,580
Shut up!

260
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,360
I have to be polite to parents, right?

261
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,060
Awful.

262
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,640
You made it.

263
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,340
Don't you do that!

264
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,080
He did it.

265
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,440
Come on, catch it!

266
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,020
We will catch you, idiot.

267
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,260
Pretend not to be.

268
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,380
comparing.

269
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,780
Come on!

270
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,900
Let's go home!

271
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,500
What are you doing?

272
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,960
It's a movie!

273
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,240
Who's that?

274
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,060
I'm going home!

275
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,080
What's going on?

276
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,080
You're gonna get in trouble with your parents!

277
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,340
Don't kick a kid!

278
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,220
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

279
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,860
Everyone, it's the police!

280
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,880
The trouble has subsided!

281
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,020
What? The police?

282
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,760
That's right! Even if you resist, you'll be a sinner!

283
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,880
Ryo-tsu!

284
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,840
This is Senpai's father!

285
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:43,760
He's the one who causes trouble wherever he goes, this idiot!

286
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,400
Don't worry about it!

287
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,660
I won't do it today!

288
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:47,880
I'll go on a trip to Japan!

289
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,300
Let's look forward to the police's visit to Tokyo!

290
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,820
You get it, right, Chief?

291
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,280
You forgot about this, too.

292
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,620
You'll look forward to seeing Tokyo from my feet?

293
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,300
Being so bold, isn't that my turn?

294
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,080
What is it, Dad?

295
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,040
I'm already tired of you!

296
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,780
Don't be stupid!

297
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,340
We'll go to Ueno first!

298
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,580
We'll visit the art museum and visit Saigo's statue,

299
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,240
a dove and an egg!

300
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:13,860
Yay!

301
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:14,820
What?

302
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,680
Then, let's go to Shinobazu Ike

303
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,060
I rode a boat.

304
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,900
Damn it.

305
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,640
Then, in the rain...

306
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,680
Oh, I see.

307
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,800
You did it too.

308
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,800
My father has no way out.

309
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,380
Come on, I'm back.

310
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,720
What a son to disturb his parents.

311
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,580
I won't let you cross my line again.

312
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,920
You came the other day.

313
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,020
By the way, it's already evening.

314
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,660
Where is the inn tonight?

315
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,540
Oh, it's in Asakusa.

316
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,920
Asakusa?

317
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,620
Are you staying at a city hotel?

318
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,980
Well, that's the place.

319
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,800
Let's go.

320
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,840
Are we going to walk again?

321
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,280
Let's go by train.

322
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,780
No, no.

323
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,660
This trip is meaningful to walk.

324
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,180
Isn't that right, Chief?

325
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh, yes, everyone.

326
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,280
It's only two or three kilometers.

327
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,280
Let's walk.

328
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,900
Chief Ohara today.

329
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,860
Don't you feel like you're holding your senior's shoulder?

330
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,480
That's right.

331
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,580
I wonder if you're holding something weak.

332
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,940
The talent to attach to the weakness of seniors is the best in the world.

333
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,900
Now, this is the inn.

334
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,400
Isn't it your senior's house?

335
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,100
That's right.

336
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,140
All you need is a roof and a futon, right?

337
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,740
But there is a Viking in the trip, which means that you can eat dinner anywhere.

338
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,380
Of course.

339
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,460
I'm not lying.

340
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,180
I'm telling you that this is a Viking who will eat dinner.

341
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,360
Which one among the three is the Viking who can eat at the end?

342
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,820
Viking?

343
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,780
I've heard in the village.

344
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,920
Hey, you're not going to inserted.

345
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,460
Not already inserted?

346
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,540
Today, there will be six residents.

347
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,600
If that's the case, you should say so.

348
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,960
But what will we do?

349
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,940
Our house is too small.

350
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,080
We don't have a bed.

351
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,660
I don't have a place to sleep.

352
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,600
It's okay, it's okay. Leave it to me.

353
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,700
Well then, everyone.

354
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,720
As I announced,

355
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,740
each of you brought a piece of food.

356
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,900
What? I brought something.

357
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,340
Please put it in the pot.

358
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,420
But mine is a cookie.

359
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,020
I brought a Chinese bun.

360
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,300
I put it in. It's a melon.

361
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,440
I brought a banana from Ameyoko.

362
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,040
I brought a caviar.

363
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,680
I don't care.

364
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,440
I'll put it in the pot.

365
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,900
It's the same as a dark pot.

366
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,840
You must eat what you grab with a chopsticks.

367
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,300
What?

368
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:07,040
I'm sorry, everyone.

369
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,380
I was wrong.

370
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,360
Chief?

371
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,120
What?

372
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,120
Actually...

373
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,020
What? I knew it.

374
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,280
I thought it was weird.

375
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,320
No, I'm sorry.

376
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,280
I'm a fool for leaving it to someone like you.

377
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,180
Chief, I'm such a fool.

378
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,320
But this was fun.

379
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,480
Yes, really.

380
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,320
We bought some good souvenirs.

381
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,220
That's right.

382
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,820
Hahahahahaha.

383
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,280
Ah, I'm sorry.

384
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,820
There is a lot of food, but Shime-kukuri is a fun meal.

385
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,200
Do you really eat this?

386
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,580
Of course. I am the only one who is on this trip.

387
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,400
As planned, I will eat this meal and go on a long trip to the Kamayari Park.

388
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,680
Look, the melon is also edible.

389
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,320
Let's eat.

390
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,680
Let's eat.

391
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,680
Melon is quite good.

392
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,200
You can eat well, Ryo-san.

393
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,380
He has been eating anything since he was a kid.

394
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,920
Hey, chief. If he doesn't listen to you, please beat him up.

395
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,940
You don't have to say unnecessary things.

396
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,480
What are you doing?

397
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,220
You bastard.

398
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,340
Are you going to do it? You are a thief.

399
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,140
What did you do to your parents? I won't forgive you anymore.

400
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,040
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm here.

401
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,600
You will start again.

402
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,380
Come on, everyone. Come here.

403
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,140
Are you all going to eat that strange thing?

404
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,860
I won't.

405
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Let's eat rice with tsukudani.

406
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,660
It smells so good.

407
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,700
It smells good.

408
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,200
I feel bad for Ryo-chan.

409
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,680
What?

410
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,160
Don't worry. Don't worry.

411
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,320
This is a good one.

412
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,220
He is still doing it.

413
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,100
What?

414
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,860
Don't worry. Don't worry.

415
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,860
It seems that it has ended.

416
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,880
It seems that the pain is over.

417
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,360
It seems that the pain is over.

418
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,400
It seems that the pain is over.

419
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,300
Good night.

420
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,900
Good night.

421
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,240
Good night.

422
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,300
Good night.

423
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,100
Good night.

424
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,280
Good night.

425
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,060
Good night.

426
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,120
Good night.

427
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,560
If you get angry, I won't forgive you.

428
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,160
You shouldn't say that. Stop snorting and being a coward.

429
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,940
What is that?

430
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,880
What?

431
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,100
What is that?

432
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,340
Look! Over there!

433
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,140
Where?

434
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,860
What?

435
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,860
Can't you see because it's moving forward?

436
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,260
I'm not joking. I can see.

437
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,180
Hey, father.

438
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Did you see the shooting star here long ago?

439
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,340
Oh, it was so.

440
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,800
What?

441
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,660
Father, there's a fire!

442
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,160
Where are you? Where are you? Where's the fire?

443
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,820
The store's cooking place is...

444
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,360
Someone call 119!

445
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,620
Father, let's go!

446
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,280
Yeah!

447
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:45,840
You're too stupid!

448
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,040
Next!

449
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,600
What's that?

450
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,520
What's that?

451
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,120
What's that?

452
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,580
Leave the rest to the main job.

453
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,040
The fireman's like his parents.

454
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,600
He's spitting water.

455
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,020
That's the job of a fireman.

456
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:23,980
Good work!

457
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,000
But he's gonna catch a cold if he's wet.

458
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,980
I heard the siren.

459
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,420
Right.

460
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,520
Oh, it's fine. I'll do it alone.

461
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,660
Just go to sleep.

462
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,900

I don't have money.

Don't worry.

499
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,520
I took it out of my mother's wallet.

500
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,340
As expected of your father.

501
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,320
You're the same as you used to be.

502
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,400
You idiot.

503
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,820
It's a secret from my mother.

504
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,320
If you're chased by me like when I was in a fight with Ryo,

505
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,080
I'll kill you.

506
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,640
Ha ha ha ha ha.

507
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,240
Anyway,

508
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,320
Cheers!

509
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,440
Phew, it's so sweet.

510
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,260
But still.

511
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,900
You were so useless.

512
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,160
I'm grateful that you didn't become the police's troublemaker.

513
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,020
Well, in another way, you're a troublemaker.

514
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,920
Oh, I forgot.

515
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,800
I have something to give to my father.

516
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,960
Take it.

517
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,600
Kankichi, this is...

518
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,020
I bought it at Ameyoko.

519
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,200
It's your birthday tomorrow, right?

520
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,540
Huh.

521
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,980
It's cheap to buy it with your salary.

522
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,420
It looks old,

523
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,860
but it's similar to the old one, right?

524
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,620
Well...

525
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,520
Ryotsu.

526
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,680
Chief.

527
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,960
Can I have it, too?

528
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,320
Here you are.

529
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,540
Come on, Kankichi.

530
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,500
Put it over there.

531
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,440
I heard there was a fire right there.

532
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,460
The two who were active in the fire left without saying their names.

533
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,840
I'm sure they were good parents and children.

534
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,220
It seemed to be a good thing.

535
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,760
Yeah!

536
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,380
Let's drink tonight. I feel good.

537
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,100
Nice.

538
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,860
Boss, please give me more sake.

539
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes.

540
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,060
You're a good drinker, boss.

541
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,280
Boss, the konnyaku here is delicious.

542
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,380
Really? Then I'll have that too.

543
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,080
And half a pen too.

544
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,000
This year's summer has come.

545
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,060
It's here! Here it is!

546
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,940
This year's summer has come.

547
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,520
It's here! Here it is!

548
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,360
Let's drink a lot and have a great time.

549
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:34,260
Let's drink a lot and have a great time.

550
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,740
Ah, I feel good.

551
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,680
This year's summer has come.

552
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,720
It's here! Here it is!

553
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,380
Get out! Get out!

554
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,520
Ah, this year is also a summer song

555
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,700
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!

556
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,280
Oh, I'm dying

557
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,540
Big, small waves, small waves, small waves, small waves, big waves, big waves

558
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,840
The wind of the south is blowing

559
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,160
Big, small ass, small ass, small ass, big ass

560
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
I'm getting excited

561
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,700
Ah, Puri Puri Puri Puri Puri Puri Puri Puri Puri Puri Puri Puri Puri Puri Puri

562
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,080
The wind of the south is blowing

563
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,440
The wind of the south is blowing

564
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,120
Nagisane-Puru-Puru

565
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,540
Nagisane-Puru-Puri

566
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,980
Terrible! What a terrible script!

567
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,380
Why do we have to do a swimming competition full of women in an old-fashioned play?

568
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,200
It was a mistake to leave the script to Ryotsu.

569
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,560
Next time, the masterpiece "Momotereira".

570
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,160
Thank you.

571
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,900
Thank you!
