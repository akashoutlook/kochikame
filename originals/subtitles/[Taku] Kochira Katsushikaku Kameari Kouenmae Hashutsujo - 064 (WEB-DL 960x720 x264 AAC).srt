2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,520
In the middle of the river, I stare at the sunset

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,340
When I kick the pebbles, the shoes fly too

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:32,400
I wonder if I should go to the taiko where I used to play the jokin

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,940
I was laughed at as a child

6
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,640
Even if I try to cheer up, I can't win

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,680
The cityscape that never changes even if I yawns is strangely kind

8
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,400
From the water tank in Tongari-boshi

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:07,120
To the taishakuten, the sunset falls

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,480
Tomorrow will end like this

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,220
I lost my happiness because I was happy again

12
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,180
I'm a fool

13
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,100
I'm a fool

14
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
I'm a fool

15
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,680
Gentlemen, this season has finally come.

16
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,380
Last year, I couldn't catch up with you while I was chasing him to the end of my hair.

17
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,600
But this year,

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sure I will catch this man

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,060
I will put an end to our long fight

20
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,660
I will take back all the debt

21
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,200
I will definitely take it back

22
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,580
Prepare yourself, General Director Ryo Tsukankichi

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,860
Nyehehehe

24
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,220
Nyehehehe

25
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,940
Nyehehehe

26
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,520
Nyehehehe

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,940
I will kill you

28
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,840
I will kill you

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,160
I will kill you

30
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,740
I will kill you

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,020
I won't be able to tell

32
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,300
I will kill you

33
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,280
Mr. Ryo Tsukuk�

34
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,740
Mr. Oshima

35
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,000
You are a great man

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,700
Yes

37
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,220
Arale

38
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,780
I was told that it was a bad idea.

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,900
I wonder if we can really get the money back from Ryo-san.

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,600
I feel like it's harder than launching a rocket into Mars.

41
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,740
What are you talking about?

42
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,120
That's why we can't get the money back.

43
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,620
Is there a good way to do that?

44
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,140
I've prepared a new weapon to make this happen.

45
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,980
You failed last year with that, didn't you?

46
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,880
Was it Ryo-Nasu?

47
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700
Ryo-Nabi!

48
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,320
That was a failure because it relied on only the signal of the launchers.

49
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,800
But this year's new weapon takes that into consideration.

50
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,280
It's perfectly finished!

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,100
I've installed a surveillance camera in every place in the castle.

52
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,500
Now I know where Ryo-san will run to.

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,740
I can't trust this machine.

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,180
It's okay!

55
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,880
I'll name it...

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,100
Peeping Eye Operation!

57
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,420
Ryo-san!

58
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,120
Ryo-san, I'm home!

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,720
Yes, yes!

60
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,660
Yes, yes, this time's bonus...

61
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:02,980
Oh!

62
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,700
I finally got to use this for the 180th and the half-day!

63
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,480
What a cute bonus!

64
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,500
Hey, stop it.

65
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,780
Stop making such a big deal out of it.

66
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,340
You're the only one who's receiving money from the police in the country.

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,520
So, Ryo-san, what are you going to use that bonus for?

68
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,480
Don't be surprised.

69
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,920
First, I'm going to buy a computer based on this bonus.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,140
I'm going to make a game with my knowledge and experience as a gamer.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,820
And then, this game will be a big hit, and I'm going to create a game company.

72
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,340
And then, as the chairman, I'm going to live a self-sufficient life.

73
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,880
How about that?

74
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,820
I'm going to make a great plan that's not going to go to waste.

75
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,060
I think you're the one who's going to be the most wasteful.

76
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,680
Oh, well, I'm busy, so I'll just...

77
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,340
Oh, no, no!

78
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,000
Last year, I had a big deal to do with this.

79
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,240
Hey, I think the score yesterday was perfect.

80
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,420
Yes, yes.

81
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,700
Yes, yes.

82
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,700
Yes, yes.

83
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,280
Yes, yes.

84
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:10,960
Yes, yes.

85
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes, yes.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,760
Ha!

87
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,260
No one's paying his debt.

88
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,060
They're all misunderstanding the bonus day.

89
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,260
Lucky?

90
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,980
We're not going to misplace your bonus, are we?

91
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,920
Next, it's time for Peeping Eye's strategy!

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,620
The target is moving at a speed of 25km/h to the west of Himawari Street.

93
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,400
I won't let you get away, Ryo Tsukankichi!

94
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,740
Commander Zenie, Ryo-san is currently passing through Himawari Street.

95
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,340
He is heading towards Kame no Ana Cafe.

96
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,600
Ryo-san is very sensitive.

97
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,640
Please be careful when you act.

98
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,780
Roger that.

99
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,480
Roger that.

100
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,640
Yes, sir.

101
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,920
Welcome.

102
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,500
Please enjoy your meal.

103
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,540
Oh, but I don't have any other ideas.

104
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,840
Well, whatever.

105
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,460
B-Han, standby.

106
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,840
C-Han, ready.

107
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,120
Good.

108
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,940
Commence attack!

109
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,880
Watch out.

110
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,400
AAAAH!!

111
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,760
U-U-U–!!

112
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,320
He's out!

113
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,800
That hurts.

114
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,340
Are you okay?

115
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,600
Are you happy?

116
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,860
I'm glad you prepared as well, all right!

117
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,000
Ye-e-e-e-h!

118
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,060
He-he-he-he.

119
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,660
Ryo-san is the best!

120
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,880
I can't see a thing!

121
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,000
What are you doing?

122
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,940
Hurry up and catch him!

123
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,760
I'm going to catch Ryo-san!

124
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,420
Ah, Ryo-san is out!

125
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,520
I won't let you get away!

126
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,880
I'll catch you if you try!

127
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,280
You bastard!

128
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,820
Damn it!

129
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,760
Damn it!

130
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,220
Ryo-san ran away, leaving his bike behind!

131
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,880
I'll follow Iko's instructions!

132
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,600
Understood.

133
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,740
As expected, you're not a simple person.

134
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,980
But it's pointless to run away.

135
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,000
You're a victim of countless new cameras that have been installed all over the city.

136
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,860
You're a victim of countless new cameras that have been installed all over the city.

137
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,340
You're a victim of countless new cameras that have been installed all over the city.

138
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,200
I'm relieved that you've come this far.

139
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,900
Your carelessness is a life-threatening thing, Ryo-san.

140
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,180
Why? Why?

141
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,640
Don't let him get away!

142
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,420
Hey, hey!

143
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:34,960
Stop!

144
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,440
Give me back my money!

145
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,060
Hey, hey!

146
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,060
I'll catch you if you try!

147
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,400
Ryo-san is heading east to Sumire Street.

148
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:42,880
Ryo-san is heading east to Sumire Street.

149
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,260
What?

150
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,060
Yuck!

151
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,480
Damn it!

152
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,060
How do you know where I am?

153
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,940
Yuck!

154
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,320
Damn it!

155
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,860
Damn it!

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,240
He looks serious!

157
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,320
Damn it!

158
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,500
Damn...

159
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't tell me, I did something to the starter before I knew it, again.

160
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:17,940
Hey!

161
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,060
The car!

162
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,120
Wait, it's there...

163
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,140
Don't you know the police!

164
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,940
Good bye!

165
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,120
*Screaming*

166
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,980
*Screaming*

167
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,660
*Screaming*

168
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,160
Alright, I'm done with you.

169
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,780
Hm?

170
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,500
Come on.

171
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,120
*Screaming*

172
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,180
Come on, come on, come on.

173
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,360
Let's go over there since Uncle Aoi is here.

174
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,720
It'll be awful if you get eaten.

175
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,820
It will be awful if you get eaten.

176
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,340
Who's gonna eat?

177
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,560
Hm?

178
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:04,800
Hm?

179
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,500
*Screaming*

180
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,680
See? I think I got too close.

181
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,740
You're using a small CCD camera and a transmitter?

182
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,440
It doesn't look like a child's toy.

183
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,720
*Screaming*

184
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,480
*Screaming*

185
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,080
You're not getting away!

186
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,980
*Screaming*

187
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,080
*Screaming*

188
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,200
*Screaming*

189
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
What's wrong with this?

190
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,500
The Mekaman boy...

191
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,680
Hey, you, Promo!

192
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,920
You're doing your job, aren't you?

193
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,200
You were watching me with the camera, weren't you?

194
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,360
You're not doing your job, were you?

195
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,200
*Screaming*

196
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:50,940
*Screaming*

197
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,680
*Screaming*

198
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,040
It's him.

199
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,340
It's not just him.

200
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,520
Damn it! Where did he go?

201
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,680
*Screaming*

202
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,420
*Screaming*

203
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,120
Look! He's over there!

204
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,040
Where?

205
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,620
*Screaming*

206
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,980
*Screaming*

207
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,160
*Screaming*

208
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,700
*Screaming*

209
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,120
Oh no!

210
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,360
I'm going to lose Ryo's figure!

211
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,340
Headquarters!

212
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,220
Tell me where Ryo is!

213
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,840
I lost him completely!

214
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,260
Headquarters, over here!

215
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,860
Headquarters!

216
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,560
What's going on?

217
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,580
The camera...

218
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,660
The Beeping Eye Operation...

219
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,140
*Screaming*

220
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,880
*Scared*

221
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,260
*Screaming*

222
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,220
*Screaming*

223
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,500
*Screaming*

224
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,020
Damn it!

225
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,700
They put up all those CCDs!

226
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm gonna crush them with this!

227
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,320
That's right!

228
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,660
Just in case!

229
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,980
*Scared*

230
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,460
*Scared*

231
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,760
*Screaming*

232
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,080
I'm sorry!

233
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,740
The Beeping Eye Operation failed!

234
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,080
I told you!

235
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,140
You can't use the machine!

236
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,380
Hey, do you have any good ideas, grandma?

237
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,260
Leave it to me.

238
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,140
*Scared*

239
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,340
*Scared*

240
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,180
*Scared*

241
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,480
*Scared*

242
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,920
Hey, can't you hear me?

243
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,600
*Scared*

244
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,020
*Scared*

245
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,640
*Scared*

246
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,280
*Scared*

247
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,620
*Scared*

248
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:04,960
*Scared*

249
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,320
*Scared*

250
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,820
*Scared*

251
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:14,440
I see, it really is the same thing.

252
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,380
*Mbait*

253
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,120
Ryo!

254
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,640
The fan left you!

255
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,720
*Mbait*

256
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,480
See?

257
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,540
It's easy.

258
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,320
You're right.

259
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
I'm counting on you, Ryo-san.

260
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,960
I won't let you get away with this!

261
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,320
Now, give me the bonus, Ryo-san.

262
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,200
Got it. I'll give it to you.

263
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,860
Huh?

264
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,560
Huh?

265
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,780
Huh?

266
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,480
Huh?

267
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,160
Huh?

268
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,360
Huh?

269
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,560
Huh?

270
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,820
You're going to make me cry again like last year!

271
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,600
You won't be able to get away this year!

272
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,160
Where is it?

273
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,720
Huh?

274
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,620
Uh... it's not here.

275
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,500
The bonus is... not here!

276
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,140
Huh?

277
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,660
No way!

278
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,520
Bonus... bonus... bonus!

279
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,560
It's a physical test.

280
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,320
Look into it thoroughly.

281
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,580
The bonus bag isn't small.

282
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,200
If you lose it, you'll find it soon.

283
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,560
It's not here. It's not anywhere.

284
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,940
It looks like it really fell.

285
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,560
Yeah!

286
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,900
I'll be glad to give it to you.

287
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,120
This is for you, dear Ryo-sans.

288
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,300
You must get a hold of yourself!

289
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,700
A rent for the few in attendance.

290
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,700
Alright!

291
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,720
What are you talking about?

292
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,400
You're the only one I want!

293
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,140
The bonus bag is...

294
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,020
Thank you!

295
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,700
"Nihiru Residence"

296
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,940
It's no big deal,

297
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,180
to be tricked into such a play.

298
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,760
Who would take advantage of that?

299
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,100
I'll give you one more chance.

300
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,600
G-san, change this into something small and unobtrusive.

301
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,820
All of it?

302
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,700
Yeah, all of it.

303
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,200
What's wrong? Isn't this a bonus?

304
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,380
Ryo-san, you're in trouble. If you find out that you lent it to someone, you'll be fired.

305
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,780
Yeah. Who was the one who repaired the jar you broke the other day?

306
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,660
That's...

307
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,120
Then you can get rid of that.

308
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,800
I got it. See you later.

309
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,140
I-I-I got it, Ryo-san.

310
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,120
How about this? It's a 10-yen coin from the Meiji era.

311
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,800
It's worth hundreds of thousands of yen.

312
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,180
It's a 10-yen coin from the Meiji era.

313
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,680
If you have this much, you can buy three.

314
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,060
Hmm, four. It's about you.

315
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,020
You're going to call the police anyway, right?

316
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,160
I'm in trouble. I can't win against Ryo-san.

317
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,600
One in the sandals.

318
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,980
One in the radio.

319
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,920
One in the grip.

320
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,560
Let's say you get paid when the fire is out.

321
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,000
If it goes well, it might sell higher than the price.

322
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,780
If it goes well, it might sell higher than the price.

323
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,120
If it goes well, it might sell higher than the price.

324
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,320
Well, then...

325
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,200
Gah!

326
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,800
Gah!

327
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,580
Ow...

328
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,600
Gah...

329
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,960
Dammit! What the heck?

330
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,520
Huh?

331
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,980
GAAAAHH!

332
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,540
GAH!

333
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,420
!

334
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,880
!

335
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,600
!

336
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:05,840
!

337
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,200
!

338
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,520
!

339
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:06,860
!

340
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,660
!

341
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,560
!

342
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,180
Ah!

343
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,080
No, no!

344
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,860
Ah!

345
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,780
Ah!

346
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,620
Ah!

347
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,180
Ah!

348
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,320
Ah!

349
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:29,960
Ah!

350
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,040
Damn it!

351
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,800
I'm sure it's around here.

352
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,340
I'm sure it's around here.

353
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,380
Ah! There it is!

354
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,280
Gold! Gold!

355
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,740
Hey, you!

356
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,680
The cement over there is still...

357
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,480
Hehehehe...

358
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,640
Hehehehe...

359
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,960
Hehehehe...

360
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,860
Hehehehe...

361
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,880
Damn it! It's still not solidified!

362
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,180
It's instant cement!

363
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,680
Hehehehe...

364
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,020
Hehehehe...

365
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,820
Hehehehe...

366
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,360
Hehehehe...

367
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,500
Hehehehe...

368
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,140
Gaaah!

369
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,260
Hehehehe...

370
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,320
Please, stop!

371
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,420
Give up and stay with me!

372
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,280
Hehehehe...

373
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,200
Hehehehe...

374
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,240
Three more.

375
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,180
Hehehehe...

376
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,340
If the cement came from over there...

377
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,180
Hehehehe...

378
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,420
I think it's in here.

379
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,360
Tick! Tick!

380
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,820
What is that?

381
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,660
What's that?

382
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,840
Excuse me!

383
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,960
I'd like to take a picture of the stolen item!

384
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,940
I did it!

385
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,900
The second one!

386
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,460
Two more!

387
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,180
What? A lion?

388
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,080
Why a lion?

389
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,840
It's not a single one.

390
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,620
Lions are cat-like animals.

391
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,220
They're so big they're like cats.

392
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,820
They're so cute.

393
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,040
They're so cute!

394
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,680
Lucky!

395
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,240
I did it! The third one!

396
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,160
No way!

397
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,940
I did it!

398
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,480
Gold?

399
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,680
What's this?

400
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,020
Gold! Gold! Gold!

401
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,000
My gold!

402
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,620
You're not getting anything!

403
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,480
Where is it?

404
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,460
One more!

405
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,040
One more!

406
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,260
One more!

407
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,140
One more!

408
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,840
One more!

409
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,540
One more!

410
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,660
One more!

411
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,580
Where is it?

412
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,640
When you're stuck in a trap, go back to the crime scene.

413
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,440
Go back to the crime scene a hundred times.

414
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,960
Damn it!

415
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,940
One more!

416
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,640
Where did it go?

417
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,080
I won't give up!

418
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,680
I can't just disappear all of a sudden.

419
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,220
It must be somewhere.

420
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,340
It must be somewhere.

421
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,040
I'm sure it's somewhere!

422
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,420
I wonder if someone picked it up.

423
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,460
I have these three.

424
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,460
I'm glad.

425
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,400
Damn it! Why isn't it on?

426
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,600
I'm sorry!

427
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,940
I'm sorry!

428
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm sorry!

429
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,740
I'm sorry!

430
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,200
I'm sorry!

431
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,980
I'm sorry!

432
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,100
I can't believe I missed!

433
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,240
I'm sorry!

434
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,160
I'm sorry!

435
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,480
I can't believe this!

436
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,040
I'm so sad!

437
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,340
I can't believe I didn't pick it up.

438
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,220
Shit!

439
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,760
You are so annoying!

440
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,500
I was trying to hide myself,

441
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,660
Stop acting like a fool.

442
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,200
The old man from Incho-Kido has deleted all of them.

443
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,900
I'm sorry, Ryo.

444
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,380
Now, show me the 4 gold coins.

445
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,380
What's going on? I don't have any.

446
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,400
If you don't, shall I check my body again?

447
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,500
Of course you won't.

448
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,160
The gold coins are small unlike the satsutaba, so look thoroughly.

449
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,120
Now, let's do it.

450
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,640
Let's go.

451
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,600
What's going on?

452
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,400
No matter how hard I search, I can't find any.

453
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,840
Because I don't really have any.

454
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,220
The real one is...

455
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,640
What's going on, Ryo? Are you going to say something again?

456
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,960
Even if you want to run away, you can't run away from me.

457
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,540
No!

458
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,580
My gold coins! My gold coins!

459
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,180
No, no, no!

460
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,020
The gold coins are on top of the drum here!

461
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,520
It's true!

462
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,300
You're planning to trick us again, aren't you?

463
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:21,460
No!

464
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,500
It's really true!

465
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,760
Huh? Is that the one?

466
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,140
What?

467
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:30,780
What?

468
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,240
What?

469
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,100
What?

470
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,360
Stop it!

471
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,560
Stop it!

472
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,460
What's wrong, Ryo?

473
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,180
My gold coins!

474
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,340
Whoa!

475
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:11,980
Why, what the--

476
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,060
It was hot in there!

477
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,140
But it's hot!

478
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,320
Whoa!

479
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:12,520
It's hot!

480
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,040
But the pictures and the letters are all gone, so it's not worth anything.

481
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,480
Four of them won't even be 10,000 yen.

482
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,800
Ryo-san.

483
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,300
What do you want?

484
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,100
As you can see, it's my bonus.

485
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,160
We talked about it earlier, but I'll take the gold for now.

486
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,060
Huh? You're gonna pay me back my debt?!

487
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,400
No, it's a bribe.

488
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,820
It's not worth anything, but it's our mercy.

489
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,300
I'm planning to pay you back the debt you owe me for the next bonus.

490
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,840
You demon! You devil! You're so selfish!

491
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,340
Next year, I'll definitely pay you back!

492
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,840
Is that okay, chief?

They're all different even though they look the same.

499

Don't mess with them!

500
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,480
They're really all messed up.

501
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,920
