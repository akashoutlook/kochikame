1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,960
"It's time for my sister and I to meet"

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:21,940
There comes a day that floats on the ocean

3
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,860
I look at the sunset floating in the deep sea

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:33,800
When I kicked the love stone, it flew to the shoes

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,000
I wonder if it's a joke

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:50,260
I laughed as it was

7
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,120
Even if I'm in good health, I have a bad luck

8
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,400
The cityscape that doesn't change even a single nightmare is very gentle

9
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,740
From the water tank of the Tungari Boshi

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,520
The sun sets to the sea

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,140
The sun sets to the sea

12
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,820
Tomorrow will end like this

13
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,260
The happiness of the Katsushika Shiba Mata

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,340
I realized it after losing it

15
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,620
Because I'm stupid

16
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,260
"Hondara's Alternative Facts"

17
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,900
It's a nice day

18
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,520
I want to go to work, take a lunch and go for a drive

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,040
If the running is not good, it's the driver who drives

20
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Is true

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:10,900
I think so too

22
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,200
Yeah, when I thought you were running around,

23
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,300
I thought you were driving a Honda.

24
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,500
You're right!

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,980
Handling on!

26
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,180
Ah...

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
How is it? Is it good?

28
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,940
Yeah, it's good!

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,740
It's a great combination!

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Oh, that's good!

31
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,000
Here, one more bite.

32
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,320
What do you mean, "Ahh"?!

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,200
It's obvious from the card!

34
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,960
There's something embarrassing about it.

35
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,780
Why do you have a wife like Kyoko in such a weird man?

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,420
She's not as young and beautiful as Maria's mother,

37
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,100
and she's very stylish, and she's a professional cook.

38
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,660
Ah, I'm getting hungry just by looking at her.

39
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,920
Nakagawa, put her next to me.

40
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,740
Yes, but what?

41
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,440
I'll teach you instead of Ten.

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,400
Darling, say "Ahh" to me.

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,500
Ahh...

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,080
What?

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,500
Ahh...

46
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,920
I'm sorry. Who is it?

47
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,480
If you're going to be so nervous, do it at home.

48
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,420
What?

49
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,080
It's been a while, Ryo.

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,920
Kyoko, how do you like this?

51
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,000
Ryo, how about a bite?

52
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,760
Me, too?

53
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,980
Then, no problem.

54
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,480
Senpai!

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,060
Yes?

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,380
I'll pay you back.

57
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,460
Ah...

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,400
Darling, be careful!

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,140
Sorry, my hand slipped a little.

60
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,740
Ryo!

61
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:35,820
Ryo!

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,080
Stop it, Nakagawa!

63
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,620
Senpai, are you okay?

64
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,120
I'm not okay!

65
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,780
I'm sorry, Ryo!

66
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,980
See you later!

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,420
Hey, you did it on purpose, didn't you?

68
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,120
You're too late!

69
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,680
Damn it!

70
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,320
I'll make you pay for this, Dad!

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,960
Watch me!

72
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,120
Honey, I'm going to the dorm.

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,720
I'm going to the dinner party, too.

74
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,900
I'll go shopping and go by night, darling.

75
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,120
I'm looking forward to the criminal's cooking.

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,940
A dorm full of women?

77
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,400
Isn't that MD?

78
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,340
What are you going to do with that?

79
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,840
Well, you'll see.

80
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,940
Mom, it's me, Zeon!

81
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,360
Yes, it's Kyoko.

82
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,200
Hey, lady, it's me.

83
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,620
Oh, Ryo!

84
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,980
I'm sorry about yesterday.

85
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,420
No, it's nothing.

86
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,640
By the way, what are you doing now?

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,580
Well, darling is going to the dorm from today,

88
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,700
so I'm going to buy some food.

89
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,760
Then, it's the Shimonoseki Fugu.

90
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,920
Fugu?

91
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,360
Don't you know?

92
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,720
All the fighters in the fighting team eat Shimonoseki Fugu

93
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,000
and get stronger.

94
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,480
Oh, I didn't know that.

95
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,720
I have to go to Shimonoseki and get it right away.

96
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,900
Thank you, Ryo.

97
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,960
You're welcome.

98
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,060
I'm glad to hear that, darling.

99
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,060
Oh, by the way,

100
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,180
which hand do you use when you shake hands?

101
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,360
Right hand.

102
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,020
Oh.

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,640
Which hand do you use when you throw a Southpaw?

104
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,480
Left hand.

105
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,100
But why do you ask me that?

106
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,800
Oh, I forgot.

107
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,440
By the way, lady,

108
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,200
do you love me?

109
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,920
Of course. I love you.

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
What do Kawa and Furui do?

111
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,640
Oh, they jump into the pool.

112
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,480
That's right.

113
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:30,560
That's right.

114
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,520
Which hand do you use for baseball?

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,900
What are they up to?

116
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,340
What's that?

117
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,620
I collected only the voices of Kyoko-san on the phone just now,

118
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,480
put a number on it, and edited it.

119
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,700
What are you going to do?

120
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,700
For example, if you combine 4, 5, and 9...

121
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,020
I love you, Ryo-san.

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,280
Oh, we're talking properly.

123
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,000
Because it's MD, you can get your head out of anywhere.

124
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,060
You can take out any part of the conversation and combine it,

125
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,020
and it's digital recording, so your voice is real, right?

126
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,960
Yes.

127
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,100
Say something, Nagagawa.

128
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:05,640
Huh?

129
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,820
Um...

130
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,440
Hello, lady.

131
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,360
Okay.

132
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,620
16, 14.

133
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,020
Oh, hello.

134
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,460
How about your husband?

135
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,260
6, 15, 8.

136
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,600
Who?

137
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,160
Well, he's fine.

138
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,320
Wow, the timing is perfect.

139
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,400
Right?

140
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,880
I'll take revenge on that hondara dad with this.

141
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,760
You tell him.

142
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,920
F ries un hondara dad has a changed outfit,

143
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,800
In order to pass the international martial arts competition,

144
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,340
there are only two types of hondara dogs:

145
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,840
The hondara mice that can crawling through the ground,

146
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,040
as well as those who can come to the west beyond the horizon or beyond the planche,

147
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,440
or the hondara mice that can walk above the horizon,

148
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,360
So,

149
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:51,900
your homies must be hondaras,

150
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:59,040
if you are a typical hondara dog,

151
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,440
Yes, sir.

152
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,440
In that case, you'd better forget about your lover and your family during the gathering.

153
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,620
It's a phone call from the madam.

154
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,660
What? From Honey?

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,460
♪Ran, ran, ran, ran, ran, ran, ran♪

156
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:09,680
What?

157
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,640
Hey, Honey! I was so lonely!

158
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,220
Oh, boy.

159
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,320
6, 5, 4, 12...

160
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,160
Darling, we're almost there.

161
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,220
You're a lot faster than we thought, Honey.

162
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,440
I want to meet Darling as soon as possible!

163
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,480
What's wrong, Honey?

164
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,260
You seem to be in a different mood from usual.

165
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,540
Oh, no.

166
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,760
It's nothing.

167
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,960
Fugu!

168
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,480
What? Fugu?

169
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,240
Oh, no. I mispronounced.

170
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,880
Is Fugu Andy Fugu?

171
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,860
At times like this, it's 16, 16, 16...

172
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,980
I love you, Darling.

173
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,300
I love you, Darling.

174
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,520
I love you, Darling.

175
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,940
Oh, I see.

176
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,660
You're saying that Fugu is nothing.

177
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,220
Leave it to me.

178
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,500
I'm sure I'll win the International Fugue Championship!

179
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,560
Oh, well.

180
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,300
I guess...

181
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,840
I'm sorry to have fooled you.

182
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,380
All right. Next up is...

183
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,580
The New Fugue Championship

184
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,300
This time, several new members will participate.

185
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,620
Let's teach them a new technique.

186
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,720
You go first!

187
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Huh? Me?

188
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,780
Then, out of the 999 special techniques of the Hondara sword,

189
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,480
number 773, the Gokinokken!

190
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,900
Whoa!

191
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,660
That technique!

192
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,000
Take a walk.

193
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,540
Y-Yes.

194
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,000
What's the Gokinokken?

195
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,920
What kind of technique is it?

196
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,560
Take a good look at the Gokinokken.

197
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,600
I... I...

198
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,880
It's a bad Gokiburi!

199
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,680
Look closely. It's just a toy.

200
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,540
But even a big man is not good at Gokiburi.

201
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,960
He'll pay for it when he's in panic.

202
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,380
This is the Gokinokken.

203
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,900
You're making up the most ridiculous excuse, and you're still playing the cheater.

204
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,280
Next up is...

205
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,780
The 7th special technique of the Hondara sword, number 774, the Inunoken!

206
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,520
All right!

207
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,180
Take this, Inunoken!

208
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,300
You're going to get beaten with the same hand!

209
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,880
That's the real thing!

210
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:08,860
What?

211
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,020
You got a problem?

212
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,920
Ugh!

213
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:11,880
Ugh!

214
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:12,660
Whoa!

215
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,140
That was just a toy.

216
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,360
But sometimes, you can use the real thing, so you have to be careful.

217
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,160
You're not going to stop me, are you?

218
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,500
Oh, I'll do it like this.

219
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,180
The next strategy is...

220
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,940
Oh, I'll do it like this.

221
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
The next strategy is...

222
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:28,880
Oh, I'll do it like this.

223
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,180
Oh, I'll do it like this.

224
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,040
Oh, I'll do it like this.

225
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,420
The next strategy is...

226
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,920
It's the original element of ever-changing love.

227
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,120
Hey, darling?

228
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,980
I know you're in here, honey.

229
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,980
What are you doing? Get over here!

230
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,700
Because I'm much better at this.

231
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,680
I'm so embarrassed. You're right here.

232
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,160
How come, honey?

233
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,320
Darling, raise your right hand.

234
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,320
Huh? Right?

235
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,680
Right here?

236
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,520
Bend your wrist.

237
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,720
Oh, right here?

238
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,420
Put your right leg in front of your chest.

239
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,580
Put your right leg in front of your knees.

240
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,060
Like this?

241
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:01,780
Yes!

242
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,040
It really looks like Yami.

243
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,140
Darling, put your left leg up too.

244
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,120
My left leg?

245
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,940
My head!

246
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,340
I can't hold it in!

247
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,660
He's such an idiot.

248
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,360
Next.

249
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,840
Darling, can you get me the flowers on the top?

250
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,320
Flowers?

251
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,580
That one?

252
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,160
But how can I climb that high?

253
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,320
I love you, darling!

254
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,720
I love you, darling!

255
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,880
I love you, darling!

256
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,560
Okay, Johan. I'll give it a try.

257
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,740
Okay!

258
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,260
He's so slow!

259
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:55,660
He's climbing!

260
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,880
He's really fast!

261
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
He's climbing.

262
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,940
It's not funny if he doesn't fall.

263
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,160
If this happens...

264
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,060
Darling, it's wonderful!

265
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,940
Are you serious, honey?

266
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,900
It's almost done!

267
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,860
He's so fast!

268
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,760
He's really fast!

269
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:18,860
He's really fast!

270
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,460
That's fantastic, Johan!

271
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:20,880
I'm so glad I took this video!

272
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm so glad I took it, MD!

273
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,060
Darling, jump down from here this time!

274
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,820
Don't be ridiculous.

275
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,780
I love you, darling!

276
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,240
I love you, darling!

277
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,460
I love you, darling!

278
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,180
I'll get angry! Hurry up!

279
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,160
Okay!

280
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Give it up for Johan!

281
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,340
I love you!

282
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,220
I love you!

283
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,520
I love you, Johan!

284
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,560
I love you, Johan!

285
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,080
I love you, Johan!

286
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,720
I love you, Johan!

287
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,460
Darling, jump into the fire this time.

288
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,240
What?

289
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,560
I think I'm a little too stylish.

290
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,900
I love you, darling. I love you, darling. I love you, darling.

291
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,820
I'm going to get angry. Hurry up!

292
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,480
Yes, ma'am!

293
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm tired of staying in the same dorm today.

294
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,720
You were so cool, darling.

295
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,440
I know, honey.

296
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,600
You should come here, too.

297
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,160
No!

298
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,020
Don't!

299
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,780
I went to the Shimonoseki to buy some fugu, but I was late.

300
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,400
Darling must be tired of waiting.

301
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,260
Honey, come here.

302
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,140
No!

303
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,300
What?

304
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,640
What?

305
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,580
Don't!

306
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:45,860
No!

307
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,560
No!

308
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,500
Show me your face!

309
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,440
No!

310
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,000
No!

311
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,160
No!

312
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,440
I'm at my limit!

313
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,080
Darling!

314
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:54,920
What?

315
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,120
Why are you here?

316
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,940
Who's that woman?

317
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,400
It's you!

318
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,560
We've been talking about you!

319
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,260
Don't lie!

320
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,100
You're in this room!

321
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,720
Huh?

322
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,780
She's not here!

323
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,980
Of course not!

324
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,720
I just came here.

325
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,760
But you were with me all day today.

326
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,880
You were wearing a jacket.

327
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,560
No, I wasn't, honey!

328
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,880
Who are you?

329
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,960
Who are you?

330
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,160
Huh?

331
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,540
It's you!

332
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,460
It's you!

333
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,200
What?

334
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,600
I was all alone.

335
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,420
It was dangerous.

336
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,240
Let's leave now.

337
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,800
What?

338
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,460
You two?

339
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,840
Good evening.

340
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,060
I guess everyone is your staff, huh?

341
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,440
Hey, let go of my beard!

342
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,820
Let go of me?

343
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,300
I'm not going anywhere!

344
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,760
You can go down!

345
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,940
Because I'm going down three times!

346
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,640
My house!

347
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,880
Why did you take me?

348
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,240
What did you do to me?

349
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,520
Thanks to you, Darling's students are doing great.

350
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,460
If this goes on, Darling won't be able to participate in the International Criminal Law Competition.

351
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,260
I'm in trouble, Ryo-san.

352
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,800
There's no other way. I'll participate as a student instead.

353
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,420
Really, Ryo-san?

354
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,680
The problem is not that.

355
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,900
The problem is this beard!

356
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,540
Beard? A beard will grow in a month.

357
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,320
That beard is not growing on its own.

358
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,220
That beard is growing on its own.

359
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,840
It's a "beard of happiness"!

360
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,700
A beard of happiness? What's that?

361
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,360
I hope nothing bad happens to me.

362
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,660
Is there anything wrong with shaving your beard?

363
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,940
Recently, I dropped one of my beards by mistake.

364
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,760
A few days later, I fell in love with my wife and became a woman.

365
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,220
Before that, I was in trouble with the bubble collapse and the Heisei rice riots.

366
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,020
All kinds of misfortunes happened when I dropped this beard.

367
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,940
Isn't that a "beard of misfortune" not a "beard of happiness"?

368
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:08,960
No.

369
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,640
My husband is a buddhist,

370
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,800
He was the one who raised me up,

371
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,120
And we got married,

372
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,420
Because I started to grow a beard of happiness.

373
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,920
Hmm.

374
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,380
I hope nothing bad happens to us at the International Law Conference...

375
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,340
The 117th International Law Conference is now on.

376
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,640
Now, let me hear a speech from the head of the Chinese department, Mr. Chou Nengten.

377
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,440
I am Chou Nengten, Reine.

378
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,600
What? Darling, you're not here yet?

379
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,400
I see. What should I do? It's about to start.

380
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,720
That's strange. I thought I'd go and take the lunch.

381
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,280
I can't believe that misfortune has started.

382
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,280
It's no good. I don't feel anything at all.

383
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,220
It was empty until just now. I can't make it to the tournament.

384
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,940
It can't be helped. I'll get off the highway.

385
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,780
Yes.

386
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,520
I'm not sure if it's because I fell or something fell.

387
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,200
Anyway, it's just a series of misfortunes.

388
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,580
This is all because I dropped the luck.

389
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,040
Hey, taxi! Stop!

390
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,060
Damn it! It's a bug!

391
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,100
This is also because of the beard?

392
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,460
If this happens...

393
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,720
Hurry to the International Legislative Assembly.

394
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,560
Yes, sir.

395
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,720
The government needs to take action.

396
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,660
The government needs to take action.

397
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,820
Damn it! I got on the bus!

398
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,000
The first round is starting!

399
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,500
It started.

400
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,080
Please, Ryo-san. Can you do something?

401
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,640
Even if you say that, I'll...

402
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,020
Ryo-san can do it.

403
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,940
Please do something.

404
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,340
I'm in trouble.

405
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,440
Huh?

406
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,260
The winning team is the Airaiken!

407
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,780
Senpai, next!

408
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,440
Ryo-san...

409
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,720
Alright, I'll do something!

410
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,500
The Hon-dara-ken representative, Asato Bandai, and the Janken representative, Gu Jokiba!

411
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,400
I'm Asato Bandai!

412
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,360
No, you're not!

413
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,980
It's about whether you can win or not.

414
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,060
Then, let's begin!

415
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,820
Hon-dara-ken, Janken!

416
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,980
Tsubanomai!

417
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,580
I'm crying!

418
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,200
Now!

419
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,080
One!

420
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,440
The winner is the Hon-dara-ken!

421
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,520
You did it! You're just like me!

422
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,100
You're right.

423
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,320
Hon-dara's father is not easy to imitate.

424
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,280
Next, Hon-dara-ken representative, Ryo-tsu Kanki-chitai!

425
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,740
The baseball-ken representative, Yoyoi-no-Yoi!

426
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,300
Now it's my turn!

427
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,200
I can't drive. I'll use the subway.

428
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,540
I'll be there on time.

429
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,760
What's this?

430
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,740
I have an announcement.

431
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,360
The train has slipped into the banana river and has been out of service.

432
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,420
Ah!

433
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,260
Ah! What's going on?

434
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,700
One!

435
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,700
Until then!

436
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,640
What are you doing, Hon-dara-ken?

437
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,140
I knew it! I'm the best!

438
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,240
Oh my god!

439
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,280
Why is the magic door open?

440
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,760
I can't win!

441
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,420
Help me!

442
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,960
Ah!

443
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,860
The white monkey!

444
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,540
What?

445
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,300
Ah!

446
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,440
Ah!

447
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,260
Ah!

448
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,400
Ah!

449
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,840
The egg! The egg!

450
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,660
Ah! It's a bear!

451
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,620
Don't come here!

452
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,440
Don't go!

453
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,360
Help me!

454
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,560
Ah!

455
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:25,580
Ah!

456
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,680
Oh!

457
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,440
Ah!

458
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,460
Ah!

459
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,080
Ah!

460
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,800
That was close.

461
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
You defeated 13 people.

462
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,540
The next Universal Champions Wins

463
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,120
Hon-dara-ken Representative Asato Bantai!

464
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,760
I'm busy!

465
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,420
Son-dama Shine!

466
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:48,980
Is...

467
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,860
Is he really human?!

468
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,460
Y-Yeah!

469
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,640
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A!

470
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,580
If we're throwing away things like this, we'll be late!

471
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,180
It's the Enshita Sea!

472
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,440
I didn't know we were getting to the North Pole.

473
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,240
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-!

474
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,640
A-Amazing...

475
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,020
We did it! We're in the final!

476
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,740
Japan! Asado's victory!

477
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,900
You're saying "get up, you!"

478
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,760
Hi, I'm Honodara Kenji, and I'm a commander of the Ryōchi.

479
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:23,940
I'm ready to use you!

480
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,180
Alright, alright.

481
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,700
Representative of the Imokon prefecture, Mecha Mecha Robusta!

482
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,520
Is that really possible?!

483
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,740
Hurry, you guys!

484
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,460
Let's hurry back to Japan!

485
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,640
It's an unknown ship. There's no signal.

486
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,460
Kama, attack.

487
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,580
Roger!

488
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,660
It's a ship!

489
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,680
Oh no! It's coming to our rescue!

490
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,280
Oh my, I'm doing it again!

491
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,820
I'll kill you!

492
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,040
I won!

493
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,180
I'm just a piece of cake if I win at Limokon.

494
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,260
Y-you won...

495
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,660
Awesome! With this, I'll have every Honodara Kenji in the final!

496
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,680
By "every"...

497
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,440
Senpai, what now?

498
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,060
Hmmm...

499
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,160
And now it's the final round!

500
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,440
The winner has to buy one.»

501
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
-and you'll receive 10 million yen.

502
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,900
What? 10 million?

503
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
I didn't hear that!

504
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,560
Then you'll put your father in danger!

505
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,240
That's not good.

506
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,120
Huh?

507
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,460
The prize money won't come out until the final.

508
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,280
Huh?

509
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,800
Damn it, I guess I have a plan.

510
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,420
It's no good.

511
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,800
The martial arts competition will end at this rate.

512
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,620
Huh?

513
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,480
Another one has appeared!

514
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,620
Help!

515
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,720
I'll use this doll to trick them.

516
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,660
Really?

517
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,820
This is very difficult.

518
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,160
Then, I'll use the same sword, Asato Bantai,

519
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,580
and the same sword, Ryotsu Kankichi, to win the final!

520
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,480
It seems to have already started!

521
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,040
It's true that the movement was too fast,

522
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,460
so I was surprised.

523
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,000
I can't see it well.

524
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,620
I did it!

525
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,960
I did it!

526
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,880
I finally surpassed my master!

527
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,840
What's going on?

528
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,040
There are two Asato Bantai?

529
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,340
Two?

530
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,020
What?

531
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,920
Where?

532
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,140
Oh, my.

533
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,180
Where are they?

534
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:48,940
Huh?

535
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,200
Huh?

536
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,240
Huh?

537
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,500
Huh?

538
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:52,820
Damn it!

539
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,020
I thought I could get 10 million yen after winning,

540
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,260
but I came out of nowhere!

541
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,580
I see.

542
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,540
Come on, Ryotsu.

543
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,500
The real game is coming.

544
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,120
Yes!

545
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,900
Where do you want to go?

546
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,960
Huh?

547
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:06,980
Huh?

548
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,000
Huh?

549
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,020
It's for 10 million yen!

550
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,460
I can't lose!

551
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,100
I will show you the true strength of the Pondala Sword!

552
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,940
Let's go!

553
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,880
Come on!

554
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,240
What?

555
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,320
