2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:16,220
I look at the sunset that floats in the river

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:24,560
When I kick the stone, it flies to my shoes

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,340
I wonder if I'll go after I save up

5
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,960
I was laughed at as it was

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,500
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can only win

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,740
The cityscape that does not change even one yawn is strangely kind

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:03,880
From the fountain to the sea of the sea of the sea

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,640
The sunset falls to the sea of the sea

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,480
Tomorrow will end like this

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,500
I lost my happiness again in the Katsushika Shiba

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,800
I noticed

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,080
I'm stupid

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,540
I'm stupid

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:24,600
I'm stupid

16
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,500
"Demon Throne Disappeared"

17
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,660
Don't come!

18
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:40,980
Yatsu!

19
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,760
Y pais! Be careful!

20
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,180
Senpai!

21
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,220
Don't come!

22
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,240
Whoever comes, I shall never come down!

23
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
I'm not getting off!

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,540
If you don't want to get off, you don't have to!

25
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,900
But at least tell me why.

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,100
Here, a set.

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,620
Tell me, Junpei. What happened?

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,280
Mom broke the promise.

29
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,140
Promise?

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,840
It's a movie. It's a pecomon.

31
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,900
If I don't go today, it'll be over.

32
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,720
I see. So that's why you're going to strike the chimney.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,740
Mom's always like that.

34
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,180
She says something like, "I made it."

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,360
But she thinks it's okay to break the promise with me.

36
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,040
I did it on my own! I promised!

37
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,400
It's kind of nostalgic to see the city from the chimney.

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,880
What? Ryo, did you go to the chimney too?

39
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,080
Yeah. There was no tall building back then.

40
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,060
It was even bluer.

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,540
I climbed the Senju Ghost Chimney.

42
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,820
It's even taller than this.

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,200
Ghost Chimney?

44
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,540
Yeah. It's the largest chimney in Japan.

45
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,980
There were few buildings back then, so you could see the bottom of the city from anywhere.

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,660
The four big chimneys are just as big as you can see.

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,760
The number of chimneys depends on the size of the city.

48
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,420
There are three chimneys on the Sumida River, and two on the Senju Bridge.

49
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,500
So, it's a ghost chimney.

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,540
Yeah. That's why I often encoded the number of chimneys that I could see.

51
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,540
I wanted to meet them in one place.

52
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,560
I know I said it was just one.

53
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,800
What are you two doing?

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,060
Ah!

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,100
Hm?

56
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

57
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,220
I'm in trouble. What should I do?

58
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,800
Did you lose the chain?

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,200
What?

60
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,460
Yeah. Lend me a hand. I'll fix it.

61
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:04,940
Thanks.

62
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,400
This is how you do it.

63
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,440
Hm? Wow! It's a secret base.

64
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,040
Wow! That's amazing.

65
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,160
Yeah.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
See? I did it.

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,500
You're so clever.

68
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,780
Hehe. This is my morning meal.

69
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,580
Oh.

70
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,920
Hm?

71
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,180
Then, Mr. Densuke.

72
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,360
Yeah.

73
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,440
Thanks. You really saved me.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,920
See ya.

75
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,740
Thanks, you guys.

76
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,840
Let's go home.

77
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,580
All right.

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,780
See you.

79
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,360
Thanks, you too.

80
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,000
Hey, Kanchi.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,220
Garko, are you there?

82
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,860
B-yeah, it's a surprise.

83
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,980
What are you doing?

84
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,720
What are you doing?

85
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,880
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,720
I'm looking forward to tomorrow!

87
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,540
There are three people who are the problem.

88
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,840
It's a trio of three people: Tonpei, Chinkichi, and Kankichi.

89
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,260
The other three will be here soon, so don't be nervous.

90
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,200
Yes, sir.

91
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,160
We did it! We did it!

92
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,560
We did it!

93
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,080
Huh?

94
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,700
Ah...

95
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,080
Hey, who's that?

96
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,960
Who's the bad guy who did that?

97
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,240
Kankichi! It's you again!

98
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,440
You idiot!

99
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,480
Where's the money?

100
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,820
Professor Kyoto.

101
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:02,840
Huh?

102
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,720
I'm fine.

103
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,400
Well, this guy is...

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,760
It's okay.

105
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,740
He's my student.

106
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,600
What?

107
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,540
Yesterday's...

108
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,640
Nice to meet you.

109
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,920
Hey, how are you?

110
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,020
We are in our third division, so long as miss Kuruma is here,

111
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,580
We are the R Shanghi, Saiki and Yoko.

112
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,600
Let me introduce ourselves!

113
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,280
Hello everyone!

114
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,220
I'm Yoko Saeki.

115
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,880
Thud!

116
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:45,400
Thank you for watching!

118
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,080

119
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,960
Please subscribe to my channel!

120
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,800
What are you doing at this late night?

121
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,660
Hey, wait!

122
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
I don't know!

123
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,100
Then who broke the cup in the classroom?

124
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,180
Who broke the cup in the classroom?

125
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,580
It wasn't me!

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,860
Liar!

127
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,380
I saw you peeping into this classroom last night!

128
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,060
I saw you peeping into this classroom last night!

129
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,280
That's...

130
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,780
Is that so?

131
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:03,980
Yes!

132
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,420
I see, you're all doubting me.

133
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,760
I see, you're all doubting me.

134
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,840
Look into my eyes.

135
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,840
Tell me the truth.

136
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,740
It wasn't me!

137
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,640
It wasn't me!

138
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,340
You can't be fooled, Mr. Saeki.

139
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:20,900
You can't be fooled, Mr. Saeki.

140
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,580
This is the most problematic student!

141
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,840
It's not!

142
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,940
You all know that, right?

143
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,220
I won the cup because I was active in the school sports competition.

144
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,680
I won the cup because I was active in the school sports competition.

145
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,920
Why would I break it?

146
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,360
I was active in the school sports competition.

147
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,000
I was active in the school sports competition.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,180
Damn!

149
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,280
Stop it!

150
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,000
Kankichi!

151
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,220
Why?

152
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,740
Why?

153
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,640
You idiots!

154
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,080
Why?

155
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,220
Why?

156
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:54,980
Why?

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,600
Why?

158
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,140
......

159
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,860
Damn it. Why is everyone like this?

160
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,660
How stupid.

161
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,540
You too, Sensei.

162
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,240
How stupid.

163
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,760
Kankichi-kun! Kankichi-kun!

164
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,360
I knew it was here.

165
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,580
What? Sensei, you doubted me, didn't you?

166
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
That's not true. Kankichi-kun fixed my bicycle chain, didn't he?

167
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,240
No, that's not true. I did the bucket water.

168
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,940
Kankichi-kun, how many chimney can you see from there?

169
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,980
One, of course.

170
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,060
That's right.

171
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,900
You can see one chimney.

172
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,160
But that chimney is...

173
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,320
Actually, there are four.

174
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,040
Depending on the angle of view, one can be seen, two can be seen, and three can be seen.

175
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,380
That's why it's called a ghost chimney.

176
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,840
I know.

177
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,680
That's right.

178
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,560
Hey, Kankichi-kun. Don't humans think so?

179
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,880
What?

180
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,120
Depending on the angle of view, one person can see many things.

181
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,120
There's a rampage, there's a thought.

182
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,320
But the nature of that person doesn't change, does it?

183
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,560
The nature?

184
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,400
I wonder if it's the real thing.

185
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,680
I think Kankichi-kun's kindness for fixing that chain is true.

186
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,860
So let's be brave and be proud.

187
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,740
I believe that Kankichi-kun didn't do it.

188
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,120
Yeah.

189
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,120
Is that true?

190
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,140
Yeah.

191
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,980
Kankichi-kun, the two of you broke the dodgeball after school yesterday.

192
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,660
I finally found the girl who saw it.

193
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,720
It's Naohito and Kazuya.

194
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,780
Thank you, Tompei, Chinkichi.

195
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,760
You're my best friends, after all.

196
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,280
Damn it, I'll beat Naohito and Kazuya.

197
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,580
No, Kankichi-kun.

198
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,060
What?

199
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Don't cause violence.

200
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,280
Yes, teacher.

201
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,460
Teacher?

202
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,420
What's Kankichi-kun doing out there?

203
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,660
Well…

204
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,300
Good for you.

205
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,080
Kankichi's image

206
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,100
Episode Five: Kankichi's Parce

207
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,640
And now for the Final erle noche

208
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,080
Kankichi's Perction

209
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,400
I can't get out of the hospital easily.

210
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,480
He also seems to be talking about something.

211
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,260
And then, I came to the school in the morning and brushed the blackboard.

212
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,340
I also decorated the teacher's desk with flowers.

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,600
It's a big deal when I come to visit my family.

214
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,540
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

215
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,400
Kinjiro, don't study here!

216
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,060
Oh, no!

217
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
Don't sleep there!

218
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,860
The teacher will come soon, so please do it properly!

219
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,800
Mom, the teacher doesn't have a class, so please give me a course.

220
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:16,820
Huh?

221
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,580
Oh, he's here.

223
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,260
Welcome, teacher.

224
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,540
Welcome.

225
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,240
That's not a joke.

226
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,580
This is my mother.

227
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,740
And this is my little brother, Kinjiro.

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,120
And this is my father.

229
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,220
This is my father!

230
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,680
What?

231
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,040
You're here!

232
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,320
Teacher, let's go.

233
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,500
I'll ask again.

234
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,020
But the teacher suddenly came to say goodbye.

235
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,520
Huh?

236
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,840
Teacher, are you going to quit?

237
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,880
Teacher Kuruma, the teacher of the teacher's husband, has finished his home treatment and will return to school next week.

238
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,820
So he's going to say goodbye to everyone soon.

239
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,160
No way.

240
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,100
Damn it.

241
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,560
I'll ask Teacher Kuruma to take a bicycle and get him hospitalized again.

242
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:07,940
I'll go to school.

243
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,460
You don't have to say that even if you're joking.

244
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,920
Well ...

245
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,760
Even if you go back to university, you won't forget about Kankichi and the others.

246
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,000
These three weeks were valuable experiences for me.

247
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,960
I felt strongly that I couldn't be a better person.

248
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,960
Don't be so shy.

249
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,540
You don't look like Kankichi.

250
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,380
Oh, that's right!

251
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,940
Let's go somewhere on Sunday tomorrow!

252
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,660
I haven't done my homework yet when you fixed the bicycle chain.

253
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,420
Let's go to the movies, Kankichi.

254
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:43,960
Movie?

255
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,220
What kind of movie do you like?

256
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,220
Well, well, I like the movie "Chanbara".

257
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,280
Then let's go to the movie theater.

258
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,460
It's decided.

259
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,560
Time is 10:00 in the morning.

260
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,100
Really?

261
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,800
It's a promise.

262
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,940
Yeah, it's a promise.

263
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,300
Yeah!

264
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,580
I'm going to the movie theater with Teacher Yoko alone.

265
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:03,820
Movie theater with two people?

266
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,140
This is like a date.

267
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,280
Yeah!

268
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,160
Brother, please be quiet.

269
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,560
You idiot!

270
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,760
I can't be quiet.

271
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,360
Yeah!

272
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,020
Kankichi, go to bed now!

273
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,900
Teacher, you're late.

274
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,940
The first meeting will start soon.

275
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,280
What's wrong?

276
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,380
Please call me.

277
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,800
Yes, this is Yorozuya change room.

278
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,020
Oh, it's Teacher Yoko.

279
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,020
What's wrong?

280
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,240
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,720
I promised to go to the movie theater with Kankichi at 10 a.m. today.

282
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,880
Why did you suddenly get sick?

283
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,220
Yes, I have to take care of it today.

284
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,040
Well, it's hard, isn't it?

285
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,120
I'll tell you right away.

286
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,680
Please. I'm really sorry for Kankichi-kun.

287
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,320
No, you don't have to worry about that.

288
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,100
Kenjiro, go to the Odeon-zama!

289
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,660
Yes!

290
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,980
Teacher's tip!

291
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,820
I'm sorry, Kankichi-kun.

292
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,080
But I couldn't go yesterday.

293
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,300
I promised you.

294
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,860
I hate you so much!

295
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,620
Kago Sakuya.

296
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,280
Don't think that time is infinite.

297
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,040
Life has limits.

298
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,600
In this short life,

299
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,400
you can't live with others.

300
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,700
If you keep listening to that,

301
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:09,840
I'll have to say goodbye to Yoko Saeki-sensei today.

302
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,820
It was a short 3 weeks, but thank you for your hard work.

303
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,840
Where's Kankichi?

304
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,440
Kankichi-kun?

305
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,640
He left right after class.

306
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,040
What a pain in the ass.

307
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,900
Kankichi-kun.

308
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,660
If that's the case,

309
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,040
I feel sorry for him.

310
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,320
I hate you.

311
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:42,840
I hate you.

312
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,680
I hate you!

313
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,160
Kankichi!

314
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,180
Huh?

315
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,400
Here!

316
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,340
Yoko-sensei said that you should give this to him!

317
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,200
Dr. Yoko!

318
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,920
I told you I was going to go!

319
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,340
You looked lonely, Kanchi.

320
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,360
Kanchi.

321
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,500
What are you doing, Kanchi?

322
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,760
Take off all the curtains!

323
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,600
We're not done yet!

324
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,880
You're not going to be late for the train, are you?

325
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,100
The train to Uenori is already set, so it'll be fine.

326
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,380
Okay, hurry!

327
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,560
Uenori

328
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,700
It's huge when you look at it up close.

329
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,940
It's so big!

330
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,300
What are we going to do, Kanchi?

331
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,320
Once a man decides, he'll do it!

332
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,900
Watch out! It'll be bad if you get caught!

333
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,740
I know!

334
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,480
What?

335
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,420
What?

336
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:13,500
Oh, no!

337
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,460
Hey, don't come in!

338
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,700
I know, Tompei!

339
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,280
It's Kanchi!

340
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,280
Kanchi, leave this to me!

341
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,500
Go!

342
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,060
Yeah, I'm doing it!

343
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,900
Hey, wait!

344
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,240
Kid!

345
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,020
Yay, over here!

346
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,200
Hey, wait!

347
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,920
Wh- where do you think you're going?

348
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:58,960
Jump!

349
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,980
Uh-oh!

350
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,120
What's wrong with you, huh?

351
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,660
Why aren't you jumping, you piece of sh...

352
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:02,780
I know I should jump too!

353
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,620
Jump!

354
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,140
I'm tired of standing on the ground like this!

355
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:07,480
I'm gonna jump too!

356
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,680
I can't get off!

357
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,180
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

358
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,500
You're coming, Kanchi!

359
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,260
Jump!

360
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,920
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

361
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,320
Go, get over here, Kanchi!

362
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,520
That's a chimney!

363
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,700
What?

364
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,900
The chimney in Sumida River is visible from the train!

365
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
If it's a chimney, you can't see it because it's hidden in the shadows!

366
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,260
You idiot!

367
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,820
You should have said that earlier!

368
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,940
I did say it!

369
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,520
Damn it! The train is coming!

370
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,500
What should I do?

371
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,180
Alright!

372
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,480
If I can get on the wind, I'll be fine!

373
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,800
I did it! I got on it!

374
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,100
Kankichi!

375
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,700
It's trying to fly over there!

376
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,540
What?

377
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,600
It's dangerous, Kankichi!

378
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,060
Alright, let's go!

379
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:10,720
What?

380
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,140
Ouch!

381
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,740
But I did it!

382
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,700
I'll get on it quickly!

383
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,980
Alright, Kankichi!

384
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,020
Hang in there!

385
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,580
I'll send it to Yoko!

386
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,800
Mom, there's something on the chimney!

387
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,100
The chimney?

388
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,500
What?

389
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,720
It's heavy!

390
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,900
Thank you, Yoko Sensei!

391
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,500
And I'm sorry!

392
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,480
If only she were here...

393
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,380
Thank you, Kankichi.

394
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,020
I'll be a good teacher.

395
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,080
Goodbye, Kankichi.

396
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,020
Did you see it, Sensei?

397
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,400
Kankichi, you're the best!

398
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,860
Idiot!

399
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,760
You all were sent to the police!

400
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,360
Do you understand?

401
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,900
And then I got in trouble by the police,

402
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,300
and the school,

403
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,700
and the parents,

404
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,440
and I got in trouble for the rest of my life.

405
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,320
The only time I got on the chimney...

406
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,600
was back then.

407
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,000
That's it.

408
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,240
That's it.

409
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,140
I'm going to go now.

410
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,920
Ryo-san.

411
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,800
Junpei!

412
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,580
Junpei, I'm coming with you!

413
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,420
Mom, it's dangerous. Leave this to Ryo-san.

414
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,700
But she's my daughter!

415
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,820
Mom!

416
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,840
It looks like she's here to help.

417
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,580
Ryo-san.

418
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,700
Don't worry.

419
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,140
You're not going to get mad.

420
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
She's your mom.

421
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,720
Okay.

422
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,680
Mom, I'm sorry.

423
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,140
I'll get off soon.

424
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,240
Junpei!

425
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,820
Okay, Junpei.

426
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,720
Just follow me.

427
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,840
It's harder to get off than to get on.

428
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,300
Okay.

429
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,100
I'm going to get off.

430
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,760
Ryo-san, you're too big.

431
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,780
Junpei!

432
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,380
Now, jump into your mom's arms.

433
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,600
What?

434
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,440
She'll hug you gently.

435
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:38,980
Okay.

436
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,020
Mom!

437
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,440
Junpei!

438
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,900
Mom!

439
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,820
Junpei!

440
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,800
What a moment of excitement.

441
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,760
Mom!

442
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,520
You stupid boy!

443
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,900
Why are you bothering people?

444
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,680
You always say that.

445
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,580
I'm sorry.

446
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,140
Mom!

447
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,480
I feel sorry for you.

448
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,700
Mom!

449
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,760
You were about to say you were sorry!

450
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,820
I want to say to someone who's sorry,

451
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:28,940
Is there a child in the world?

452
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,500
It's little.

453
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:30,980
She doesn't know.

454
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,840
If everyone understands this,

455
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:31,980
Then, I'm going behind you.

456
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,920
-Alright then. -Alright then.

457
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,280
He was taken away

458
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,160
From the town, that huge and brave figure

459
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,420
I can't see it anymore

460
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,820
It's for us

461
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,000
I feel like one memory is going to break

462
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,020
I didn't feel like that

463
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,540
I couldn't be the hero

464
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,740
Why did I get in such a locker

465
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,780
With a naked Honda

466
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,760
I want to be bullied by children

467
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,420
I have to be chased by a rugby club member

468
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,040
Or a female wrestler

469
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,580
It's unreasonable

470
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,520
Next time, the scary box man

471
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,260
Thank you
