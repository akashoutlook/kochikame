00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,900
〈The

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,720
It is a hazy day in the city

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,320
I saw it

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,120
A stone fell

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,720
lt was thrown

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,580
It was thrown into my shoes

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:32,520
I wonder if I'll go to the store where I saved up

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,920
I laughed as it was

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,540
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,680
There is only a single slur

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,940
The cityscape that does not change even one yawn

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,560
It's so gentle

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,040
From the tapestry of a cap

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,960
To the taishakuten

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,120
The sunset falls

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,460
Tomorrow will end like this

17
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,240
If you win, you'll be happy again

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,440
I'm going to lose

19
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,500
I realized

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,020
Because I'm an idiot

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,540
Bye, Chief Ohara

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,240
Hey!

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,740
Hey! Wait! Wait!

24
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,300
Pay the money!

25
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,340
Ryo-san, catch him!

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,320
He's running away!

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,880
He's running away?

28
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,260
He's in pain

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,780
Ryo-san!

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:53,900
Don't let him run away.

31
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,260
I'll catch you no matter what.

32
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,520
Okay!

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,080
I won't let it go!

34
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:07,320
Ryo, don't let him get away!

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,820
I'm worried

36
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,080
I can't do it

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,980
I can't do it

38
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,420
This is the last chance

39
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,540
Don't worry

40
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:15,780
You don't have to worry

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,820
You can do it

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,040
Wait a minute

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,920
I'll catch you

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:29,260
Stop him!

45
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,660
Stop!

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,600
Stop!

47
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,680
-Here you go! -Huh?

48
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,880
Huh?

49
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,300
Get on your knees!

50
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,480
Please, I beg you!

51
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,880
-How did it go? -W-we were fine.

52
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,680
Lock, lock!

53
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,280
As you remember, the culprit was arrested!

54
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,240
Huh?

55
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,100
What's wrong, chief?

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,080
What's wrong with you?

57
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,980
You idiot!

58
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,820
Who told you to go that far?

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,480
You don't know the true nature of the game.

60
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,720
I'm the one who's been trying to get away with it.

61
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,060
I'm the one who's been trying to get away with it.

62
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,440
I'm the one who's been trying to get away with it.

63
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,100
Not just physically, but mentally as well.

64
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,220
Not just physically, but mentally as well.

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,700
Who do you think will be the one to be punished?

66
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,360
You're the type to act before you think.

67
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:47,960
You're the type to act before you think.

68
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,920
When I cross the road,

69
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,280
I look at the right and left,

70
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,000
then I look at the right and left again,

71
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
then I look at the right and left again,

72
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:56,960
and then I cross the road after I look up.

73
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,520
Why are you looking up?

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,720
Because there might be a meteor shower.

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,300
Yes, we're going to the park.

76
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,820
Because there might be a meteor shower.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
Chief, it's the chief.

78
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,800
It's not a joke.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm Ohara.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,440
What?

81
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,820
I'm the chief of the third branch.

82
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:15,760
I'm the chief of the third branch.

83
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,400
Yes, that's...

84
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,880
Yes, I understand.

85
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,560
What's wrong, chief?

86
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
The third branch is...

87
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,640
I think the chief was hospitalized for a sudden illness.

88
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:35,980
I think the chief was hospitalized for a sudden illness.

89
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,980
Yes, that's why I'm going to be the chief's deputy for a while.

90
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,540
Yes, that's why I'm going to be the chief's deputy for a while.

91
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,140
Then, what about this branch?

92
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,160
But the chief will take over.

93
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,840
But the chief will take over.

94
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,660
Great!

95
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:45,740
Great!

96
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,460
What do you mean "great"?

97
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,100
That looks great.

98
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,360
No, I don't think it's okay to be so quiet that the chief is gone.

99
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,680
No, I don't think it's okay to be so quiet that the chief is gone.

100
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,380
It says, "He's happy to see you.

101
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,180
What?

102
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,620
I'll try to be quiet without seeing your face.

103
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,180
I'll try to be quiet without seeing your face.

104
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,020
We're fine because we can spend our days lovingly every day.

105
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,020
We're fine because we can spend our days lovingly every day.

106
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,880
We're fine because we can spend our days lovingly every day.

107
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,660
We're fine because we can spend our days lovingly every day.

108
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,760
I'm getting lucky, too.

109
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,320
If I can get away from this Shimatsu-shou, my management skills will be properly evaluated.

110
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,380
I'm so sad. The chief is not in the operation.

111
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,660
It's not an operation. It's a relocation.

112
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Well, that's it.

113
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,480
Even if I'm not there, everyone will cooperate and go.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,520
Yes.

115
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,220
This is the third exit.

116
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,580
It's a pretty beautiful exit.

117
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,760
But it's difficult here.

118
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,280
What do you mean?

119
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,740
I heard that there are no problems like Ryotsu with young people.

120
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,680
The problem is the young people.

121
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,320
The previous chief used his nerves too much and was hospitalized because he was beaten.

122
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,660
Beat?

123
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,840
Anyway, he's a young man these days.

124
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,780
He only does what he's told to do.

125
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,500
If he's scolded, he'll quit right away.

126
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,540
So my true management skills will be questioned.

127
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,580
OK.

128
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,600
Ah, gentlemen.

129
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm here.

130
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,020
I'm Ohara, the chief of this office.

131
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm counting on you.

132
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,200
I'm Otsuka.

133
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,160
I'm Sugamo.

134
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:19,940
I'm Komagome.

135
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,080
What?

136
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,520
What a honest young man.

137
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,800
There's nothing to worry about.

138
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:33,060
My guidance policy is to make careful decisions and to be proactive...

139
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,700
I have to feed them.

140
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,600
...Eggs.

141
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,720
And to be proactive...

142
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,080
Hello?

143
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,820
Oh, Tabata?

144
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,580
Now?

145
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,600
Is it OK?

146
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,380
It's not a big deal.

147
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,320
Yeah, go ahead.

148
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,620
You can continue.

149
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,340
What?

150
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,920
The problem from the other day...

151
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,380
I'm embarrassed as a police officer...

152
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:53,480
What?

153
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,420
You've already passed?

154
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,280
Really?

155
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,000
Really?

156
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,280
Yeah, yeah.

157
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,120
Oh, it's 11:30.

158
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,720
I have to go.

159
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,020
Where are you going?

160
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,880
Messis.

161
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,840
There's a very popular spot in the magazine.

162
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,060
The line will be ready soon, so you have to line up before 30 minutes.

163
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,880
I have to line up before 30 minutes.

164
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,340
Idiot!

165
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,300
What are you thinking?

166
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,220
I'm working.

167
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,720
Don't you have any sense of self-awareness as a policeman?

168
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,040
I'll quit.

169
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,000
Why do you have to be scolded like this?

170
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,360
I haven't done it.

171
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,200
You guys?

172
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,680
I see.

173
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,600
You have zero management skills.

174
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,080
Huh?

175
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,420
It's our fault that you don't have your own skills.

176
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,120
Hmm?

177
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,540
So, you're not going to apologize?

178
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,160
No, no way.

179
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,340
No way!

180
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,020
He's angry again.

181
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,500
Oh, is that it?

182
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,820
Well, I won't talk like this.

183
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,740
How about you?

184
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,060
You want to go out for a drink tonight?

185
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't worry.

186
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,200
I'll treat you.

187
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,000
Tonight?

188
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,700
I have a program I want to watch.

189
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,180
I have to clear the game.

190
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,720
I have to go to the concert tonight.

191
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,360
I can't go.

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,300
Besides, we'll go to drink on our own.

193
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,180
Don't worry about us.

194
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,960
Yeah, we'll just get lost if we get involved with our superiors and subordinates.

195
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,440
Everything is up to my own pace.

196
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,480
If I tell them I'll treat them to a meal, they'll just follow me.

197
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,820
What am I thinking?

198
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,760
I was so close to that sick guy.

199
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,680
We'll go to eat.

200
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,020
Chief!

201
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,860
If you're the chief, you have lunch break.

202
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,640
What? It's already 2 o'clock!

203
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,260
What's wrong, Ryo-chan?

204
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,020
Nothing!

205
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,080
Let's redo all the reports we submitted!

206
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,240
What? What do you mean?

207
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,760
It's not good if we don't have a date or a plan.

208
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,800
What? What do you mean?

209
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,180
It's not good if we don't have a date or a plan.

210
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,860
I was scolded by the copy dog!

211
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,980
You can't do that?

212
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,940
But I told the chief of the Demoshika.

213
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,260
Damn it! The date of the new game's release!

214
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,380
I'm home.

215
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,500
Chief of the Demoshika!

216
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,740
We have to have a date for this report!

217
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,600
Which one?

218
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,020
This one...

219
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,420
I don't have to sign it or not, right?

220
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,120
Whichever one is fine.

221
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,580
Well, it's better if you sign it.

222
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,320
You don't have to.

223
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,420
But isn't it better if you sign it?

224
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,640
Whichever one you want.

225
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,680
Damn it!

226
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,160
It was perfect to do the check, because I'm a precious chief!

227
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,880
Damn it!

228
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,880
But...

229
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,440
What's wrong with my heart?

230
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,180
It's just please the chief's commanding power!

231
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,100
It's alright!

232
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,560
Damn it!

233
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,940
What are you thinking?

234
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,100
Don't listen to the next person.

235
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,380
It's better now.

236
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,800
Yes, I'm running to the park.

237
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,980
Blue mini-cycle?

238
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,460
I found it at the station.

239
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,800
But the documents are not here.

240
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,340
I gave it to the chief last week.

241
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Right, chief?

242
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,040
Yes, I have it.

243
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,980
Put it here.

244
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,840
I'll deliver it to the police station!

245
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,600
Ryo-tsu is working hard, too.

246
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,420
He works ten times more than usual.

247
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,720
He doesn't have time to be idle.

248
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:50,420
Damn, one day is over with just the document.

249
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,760
I'm going.

250
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,900
Good work.

251
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,380
Nothing happened today.

252
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,340
You have been given peace.

253
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,560
Yes.

254
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,620
I'll treat you to a feast.

255
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,580
How is it, chief?

256
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,940
I'll treat you to a feast.

257
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,680
Really?

258
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,520
To communicate with your subordinates, you need to drink.

259
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,900
There is a good yakitori restaurant.

260
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,760
It's good and cheap.

261
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,160
I'll treat you to a feast.

262
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,380
No, I can't go.

263
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,180
I'll have dinner at home today.

264
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:24,740
No, no.

265
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,020
I'll go first.

266
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,860
No, no, no.

267
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,760
I'll pay for it.

268
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:34,780
Okay, I'll go.

269
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,920
Ryo-tsu?

270
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,460
Yes, I had seen Ryo-tsu in person, right?

271
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,120
What kind of person was he?

272
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,080
Ryo-tsu, huh?

273
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,180
At any rate,

274
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,620
I don't see such a crazy person.

275
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,500
He always wears sandals and wears uniforms on the day of the day.

276
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,260
When he becomes a salesman of the entertainment department,

277
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,120
he also goes to work at the inn to buy clothes.

278
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,560
Cool!

279
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:55,900
You're so cool!

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,440
What? I told you so!

281
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,540
You're so cool?

282
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,900
Mr. Ryo is our idol!

283
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,780
Idol?

284
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,560
He's a civil servant but he's free to live freely without being bound by anyone.

285
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,800
He's wonderful. He's able to go through his own lifestyle.

286
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,860
Don't be stupid!

287
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,040
He lives without looking back at others' troubles and worries.

288
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,920
He's just living freely.

289
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,640
The chief is too old.

290
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,460
He doesn't understand how we feel.

291
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,300
That's right!

292
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,160
What's wrong with living freely in our own lives?

293
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,740
Mr. Ryo is our idol!

294
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,300
Idol? Ryo?

295
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,620
He threw the president off the second floor.

296
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,160
There are 53 destroyed cars.

297
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,720
78 cars?

298
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,260
What happened?

299
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,200
I heard there were 150 cars.

300
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,440
I don't understand.

301
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,900
It has been 2 years and Mk-II :

302
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,260
Senior, you look very pale recently.

303
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,140
Of course. I've been at work for over a year.

304
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,020
I'm your boss now.

305
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,500
Rather than slacking off, I don't have time to sit in a chair.

306
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,800
It's so hard to do that right now you should're worried about him.

307
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,740
He was doing the dishes so he'd do things so fast he could.

308
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,860
I'm worried about you now, so I can't miss you.

309
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,380
Stop it.

310
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,440
I'll walk home from here.

311
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,120
Really?

312
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,900
Good night.

313
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,180
Oh...

314
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,220
Go, go.

315
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,860
This is the law of the 50 ways of communication between a superior and superior.

316
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,680
Chief!

317
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,260
Why do you always come here when you don't read a book?

318
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,580
Chief said...

319
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,640
You always read a novel, but you don't read a business book!

320
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,760
Well, you're not doing well with your subordinates in the third chapter of the eight books, are you?

321
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,900
I'm fine.

322
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,820
Everyone is good young people and I have no trouble.

323
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,520
You're the one who's arguing with the chief.

324
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,020
I'm kidding.

325
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,320
It's very easy to work and I'm in the right mood.

326
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,120
I see.

327
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,760
Then I'll stay here.

328
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,460
I'm the official chief of the third chapter of the eight books.

329
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,720
I'm the official chief of the third chapter of the eight books.

330
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,100
Even if you become the chief,

331
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:15,700
I'm fine.

332
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,560
Don't walk in front of me.

333
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,820
I'm going to have a drink with the bird.

334
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,520
Me too.

335
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,100
You're going to lose!

336
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,120
You're going to lose!

337
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,480
L-Lachai, are you two?

338
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,580
I'm alone!

339
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,100
I'm sorry, but this is the only room we have.

340
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,360
What would you like?

341
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,140
Beer!

342
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,300
Here you are.

343
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:14,440
You're a good drinker, but you're not good at drinking.

344
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,620
You're a good drinker, but you're not good at drinking.

345
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,880
You're a good drinker, but you're not good at drinking.

346
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,680
No dumb dude could be so full of energy today.

347
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,660
No dumb dude could be so full of energy today.

348
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,600
What would you like to drink?

349
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,940
I'd like two thongs of flavour, two white thongs and a Plus.

350
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,640
I'd like two thongs of flavour, two white thongs and a Plus.

351
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,880
I'd like two thongs of flavour, two white thongs and a Plus.

352
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,820
I'd like two thongs of flavour, two white thongs and a Plus.

353
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:33,960
I'd like two thongs of flavour, two white thongs and a Plus.

354
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,200
I'd like two thongs of flavour, two white thongs and a Plus.

355
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,320
You're not paying attention.

356
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,380
I'd like two thongs of flavour, two white thongs and a Plus.

357
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,680
And I'd like some shirts, sixs, fives, eights, nine cubs,

358
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,240
Kimchi hot pot!

359
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,200
Ah, I'll have the chirichiri, yudofu, and ishikari hot pot!

360
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,460
Aji no tataki, curry no karaage,

361
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,000
Ika no maruyaki, niku jaga!

362
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,760
Oshinko ni shirasu oroshi,

363
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,200
Morokyu asari no sakamushi,

364
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,640
Akedashi dofu ni edamame!

365
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,620
I'll have tatami iwashi!

366
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,440
Tonsoku ni takobutsu!

367
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,760
Hey, beer no sake da!

368
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,560
Oodokkuri de!

369
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,640
Sake masu de!

370
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:16,060
Uu, my head hurts.

371
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,960
I did something stupid last night.

372
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,580
But I still can't remember what happened on the way to Chidori.

373
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,020
That's why, in the rare thing jokes series,

374
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,460
the part of the soul is different.

375
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,900
Oh, that's right.

376
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,700
What the hell are you thinking?

377
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,680
Tofudiran and...

378
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,260
Dilan...

379
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,620
Oh! Tofudiran and... Dilan...

380
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,180
Tofudiran and... Dilan...

381
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,120
Emergency call! Emergency call!

382
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,840
A robbery occurred at the second Hotsudo Bank.

383
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,660
The culprit is running towards Kameari Sanchome by bike.

384
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,800
Repeat.

385
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,200
Otsukaku, Sugamoku, Komagome.

386
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,960
That's right.

387
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,020
Get him at the station.

388
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,340
Huh?

389
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,560
But the working hours are almost up.

390
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,020
I have a date appointment.

391
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,520
Don't say that!

392
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,760
Come with me!

393
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,360
Come with me!

394
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:22,860
I got it!

395
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,020
I got it!

396
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,020
Oh!

397
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,020
Oh!

398
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,480
Ow, ow, ow!

399
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,260
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

400
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,320
Damn it!

401
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,840
Now, run along!

402
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,600
Now, run along!

403
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,540
You'd better be careful!

404
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,660
You're here!

405
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,300
I'm...

406
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,820
The real Ryo-tsu!

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,780
So lucky!

408
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,900
What are you?

409
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,660
Ryo-tsu is our ideal type!

410
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,900
Huh? My ideal type?

411
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,180
Your subordinates have more eyes than you do!

412
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,020
This is not the time to be like this!

413
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,680
Let's go! Don't be so grumpy, Ryo-tsu!

414
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,420
I'm not your subordinate!

415
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,880
Don't order me around!

416
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,900
Come here!

417
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,700
Okay, okay!

418
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,220
Let go of me!

419
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,280
Ryo-tsu is...

420
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,980
He's so unyielding to Chief Ohara!

421
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,920
Maybe Chief Ohara is a great person!

422
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,800
What's this?

423
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,500
Yeah.

424
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,140
It must be the culprit's motorcycle.

425
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,800
From the motorcycle's perspective,

426
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,300
the culprit is...

427
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,080
This one.

428
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,220
Think about it from the slipart.

429
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,960
Over there!

430
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,480
Don't imitate me!

431
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,340
Ryo!

432
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,160
You're the one who's imitating me!

433
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,600
Chief, it's too small for you.

434
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,520
Please get out of the way.

435
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,160
You better get out of the way!

436
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,580
Help!

437
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,200
What?

438
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,140
Tanaka!

439
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,080
Help! Tanaka!

440
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,160
What?

441
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,080
Let go of her!

442
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Get a car ready!

443
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,660
Otherwise, I don't know what to do!

444
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,220
Let's call for backup!

445
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,300
What?

446
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,760
Wait!

447
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,740
Don't provoke the culprit!

448
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,140
No way!

449
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,640
But we're the only ones...

450
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,960
Safety is the most important thing!

451
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,060
Anyway...

452
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,820
What's going on?

453
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,280
Ryo-tsu is...

454
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,820
Where is he going at this time?

455
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,040
Over there!

456
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,700
Yeah.

457
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,980
What are you doing?

458
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,500
He's trying to jump from the top!

459
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,580
Quiet!

460
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,980
You're being too violent...

461
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,040
It has to...

462
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,780
What..

463
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,140
What's going on?

464
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:46,620
What, man?!

465
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,060
Tanya's sleeping!

466
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,120
Bl choo!

467
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,040
Right, bring it on!

468
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,360
Bl choo!

469
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:54,700
Bl choo!

470
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:54,720
Bl choo!

471
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:54,940
What's wrong?

472
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:55,560
Go away!

473
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,280
Bl choo...

474
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,300
Bl choo, he's not sleeping!

475
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,520
Bl choo, he's not sleeping!

476
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:57,640
Where did he go?

477
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,260
Bl choo...

478
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,240
Bl cho, he's not sleeping!

479
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,440
Bl choo...

480
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,460
Bl choo!

481
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,040
Bl cho...

482
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,720
Bl chooo!

483
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,260
Huh?

484
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,820
No!

485
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,480
Look!

486
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:24,600
What?

487
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,480
Now what?

488
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,760
I didn't hide anything.

489
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,140
I didn't think you'd do that.

490
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,080
I still have my underwear.

491
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,600
What's wrong?

492
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,000
This is...

493
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,020
You're hiding the truth in your underwear, aren't you?

494
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,680
Damn it!

495
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,020
I-I got it!

496
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,860
Calm down!

497
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,640
Shut up!

498
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,020
I got it!

499
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,040
Now!

500
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,620
Let's go!

501
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,420
Don't let go, Ryosuke!

502
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,760
Hurry up!

503
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,720
Wait!

504
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,360
Damn it!

505
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,520
I won't let you get away!

506
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,360
Gah!

507
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,340
Don't put on a breathtaking act again, chief.

508
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,360
You're but a solid body for my good.

509
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,700
I haven't moved around after so long...

510
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,880
Chief, you're old enough!

511
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,000
What?

512
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,600
What are you talking about?

513
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,520
As long as there are people like you,

514
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,080
I won't let you get in.

515
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,300
Chief!

516
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,740
We were so impressed.

517
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,900
Chief is amazing!

518
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,760
We will follow you from now on.

519
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,180
Please tell us what you want to say.

520
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,280
I see.

521
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,180
But everyone, teamwork is important.

522
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,860
We must not forget that we know each other's strengths and weaknesses.

523
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:16,760
Yes!

524
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,160
I'm sorry, I have to go back to the park.

525
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,320
Idiot!

526
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,500
What is this report?

527
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,820
What were you doing when I was gone?

528
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,300
I was writing and writing, but I didn't write anything.

529
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,400
Idiot!

530
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,920
-You've been doing this for a long time. -I thought you were back.

531
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,720
You're going to do this soon, right?

532
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,820
But I have to say this.

533
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,180
You're not like the Kameari Park Exhibition.

534
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,640
Well,

535
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,300
do you think it's okay to say that?

536
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,980
It's not okay.

537
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,000
The chief is too stubborn.

538
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,120
Stubbornness is born.

539
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,180
Let's rewrite the report.

540
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,180
Please don't listen to me.

541
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,220
I hear you.

542
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,480
I don't understand no matter how many times I say it.

543
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,340
Honda, don't be so nervous all the time.

544
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,180
Being dumped is a part-time job.

545
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,740
Men are kinder the more they are in love.

546
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,420
I'm sorry.

547
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,720
I was too depressed.

548
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,400
Hey, hang in there.

549
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,900
Hey, Hongza!

550
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,600
Next time,

551
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,700
Run, chapter point man!

552
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,020
