2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,480
I look at the sunset floating on the river.

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,840
When I kick the stone, it flies to my shoes.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,080
I wonder if I'm going to save money.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,420
I laughed at the fact that I was still a child.

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,500
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can only win.

7
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,980
There is a city that does not change even one grumble.

8
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape is strangely gentle.

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:03,940
From the waterfront of the Tungari-boshi to the Taishakuten.

10
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,080
The sunset falls.

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,500
Tomorrow will end like this.

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,340
I lost my happiness again in the Katsushika river.

13
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,940
I noticed.

14
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,960
I'm a fool.

15
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,900
Ryotsu! Shisu! What?

16
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,100
Take this!

17
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,580
This guy!

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,300
Does this child care about anything?

19
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,780
Stop stupid imitations!

20
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,600
Immediately release the hostages!

21
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,260
Shut up!

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,320
Try to move even a step from there!

23
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,760
I'll take this guy down from here!

24
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,160
Help me!

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,280
What should we do?

26
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,220
If that's how it's going to be, we should really do it.

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,540
Anyway, let's calm down for now.

28
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,040
Hey!

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,200
Why do you have to do such a stupid thing?

30
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,660
Ryozu!

31
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,200
Super!

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,340
This is definitely faster!

33
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,000
Ryo-chan, you're going to go around the water and catch the culprit!

34
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,740
Good! Let's distract the culprit!

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,260
Hey!

36
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,980
What do you want?

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,900
Say it!

38
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,320
Get me 50 million yen in cash!

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,140
50 million yen in cash?

40
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,960
I got it!

41
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,140
Is 10,000 yen fine?

42
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,840
Or is it an old 10,000 yen note with no number?

43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
That's the car!

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,920
I'm going to go!

45
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,440
Get the car ready!

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,720
Got it!

47
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,920
Don't forget to fill the gas tank!

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,380
Huh?

49
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,020
Is there anything else?

50
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,160
Is there anything else you need?

51
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,980
Anything else?

52
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,900
Anything else?

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,300
That's right, you horse!

54
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:04,700
What?

55
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,440
No more!

56
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,820
We did it!

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,160
It's all right now!

58
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,200
Hey, calm down!

59
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,940
You bastard!

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,580
Jump!

61
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,920
Jump!

62
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,580
Hang on!

63
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,860
Jump!

64
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,580
You bastard!

65
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,860
Stop running!

66
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,440
Okay, I got this!

67
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,580
Hey, stop!

68
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,060
I got this!

69
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,600
I got you!

70
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:42,660
What?

71
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,860
He's got me in a middle position!

72
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,620
So fly!

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:51,920
Run!

74
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,100
Ryo!

75
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,760
Ryo!

76
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,120
Ryo! Ryo!

77
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,180
Don't worry.

78
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,040
He'll be fine even if he gets hit by a tank.

79
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,600
But...

80
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,940
He was fine until now.

81
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,860
I'm sure he'll be fine again.

82
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,940
Yes.

83
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,040
That was tough.

84
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,900
Ryo...

85
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,120
Hey, Reiko. Don't worry.

86
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,220
I'm fine as you can see.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,240
He's still not coming out.

88
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,500
Is he really fine?

89
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
He's right here.

90
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,020
That was a big shock.

91
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,160
Hey, what are you doing in the middle of nowhere?

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,340
Senpai!

93
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,500
It's him.

94
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,900
He's hiding somewhere and trying to scare us.

95
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sure.

96
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,040
I don't like it.

97
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,540
Is everyone making fun of me?

98
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,140
No one is.

99
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm sure.

100
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,080
I'll be right here.

101
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,220
Huh?

102
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,840
That's...

103
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,180
Chief, we're in trouble.

104
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,000
We're in trouble!

105
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,660
Senpai, he usually comes back right away.

106
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,780
Let's look for Kawara.

107
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,400
I'm so frustrated.

108
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,320
Oh!

109
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,160
It's the police!

110
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,160
He's wearing a jacket and sandals.

111
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,380
I've seen him somewhere before.

112
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,760
Huh?

113
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,020
It's me!

114
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,240
What? Me?

115
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,920
I've seen him somewhere before.

116
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,800
I have?

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,420
What?

118
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,820
It's only me.

119
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,840
What's going on...?

120
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,400
Huh?

121
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,840
He went back to...

122
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,060
I didn't know that he just died.

123
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,740
It's bullshit!

124
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,240
Just do your job!

125
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,860
I...

126
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,680
I'm not done yet.

127
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,280
I...

128
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,900
I...

129
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,400
We're finished!

130
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,460
Hello, dear?

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,160
Oh, hello there.

132
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,920
It's here!

133
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,900
Don't come, you monster!

134
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,420
I knew it.

135
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,860
You're still alive.

136
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,560
You're still alive.

137
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,360
You have legs, right?

138
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,880
You can still go back.

139
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,160
Really?

140
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,700
What should I do?

141
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,300
It's easy.

142
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,260
I'll put you in the water.

143
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,320
I'll put you in the water.

144
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,380
Okay.

145
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,720
Okay.

146
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,260
I'm back to life.

147
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,360
Of course, you're free to go.

148
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,060
This is good.

149
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,640
I'm back to life.

150
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,160
We're free to go.

151
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,800
We don't look like humans.

152
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,700
But we look like real ghosts.

153
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,020
You didn't see me.

154
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,540
I'm invisible.

155
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm invisible.

156
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,280
Can you do anything else?

157
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,260
I see.

158
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,960
I can fly.

159
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,760
I can get into other people's minds.

160
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:57,660
What?

161
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,660
I can get into other people's minds.

162
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,000
I can get into other people's minds.

163
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,760
I'm jealous.

164
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,680
I don't have a body to go back to.

165
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,960
I'm jealous.

166
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,520
I've been a ghost for eight years.

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,320
If you can go back to your body,

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,280
you don't have to use this.

169
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,360
You don't have to use this.

170
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,760
Ryo!

171
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,100
-Senpai! -Don't hide!

172
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,440
Show yourself!

173
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,860
I'll go this way.

174
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,360
Thanks for the help!

175
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,240
If I die,

176
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,500
we'll meet again.

177
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,020
Senpai!

178
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,280
That's your captain!

179
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,500
She's here!

180
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,160
Ryo!

181
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,480
Ryotsu!

182
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,260
Oh!

183
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,540
Oh!

184
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:43,700
No!

185
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:49,840
Ryo-chan!

186
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,140
Reiko-san!

187
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,500
Ryo-tsu!

188
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,180
Ryo-tsu, open your eyes! Ryo-tsu!

189
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,280
No! I have to go back!

190
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,880
Wait. I'll try it right away.

191
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,480
Reiko-san! Reiko-san!

192
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,720
Hehe, that's it!

193
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,200
Reiko-san!

194
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,720
What?

195
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,160
Ah, Reiko-san.

196
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,300
Oh no, I suddenly remembered something important!

197
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,600
Excuse me!

198
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,060
Ah, Reiko-san!

199
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,380
I'm Reiko!

200
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,680
Yes, yes, I'm sorry.

201
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,280
I'm sorry, sister.

202
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,620
Well, this is heaven.

203
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,920
I had a bad night, so I simply fell down.

204
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,000
I will clean up after this.

205
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,640
That's not very nice of you.

206
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,840
Ryo-san, so you got a favor?

207
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,780
I always cause trouble for Ryo-chan, so I get a special gift.

208
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,780
After all, everyone's rich.

209
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,840
What?

210
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,760
It's got the effect of Ryosan that made Reiko lose her cool all of a sudden.

211
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,220
Well, what are we going to do next?

212
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,220
Next, we are going to tell you something about the viceroy of the Kankichiyusha prefecture that's been saved by the police on his arrest.

213
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,100
Uh, I've heard already.

214
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,580
As much as I know, Gakushika's Office has decided to pay a special bonus for your achievement.

215
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,180
- We have decided to give you a bonus. - A bonus? That's great!

216
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,760
We'll send you the video from the Katsushika library.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,920
Where's the camera?

218
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,900
Ryotsu is a famous person and everyone loves him.

219
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,880
The Fukes are very popular, and he is called Mr. Katsushika.

220
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,600
Ryotsu, I'll never forget you!

221
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,160
You're so annoying! I can't stand it!

222
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,320
Senpai is dead...

223
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,360
It means that the world is full of darkness.

224
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,680
I feel sorry for Maria. She was so shocked that she fell asleep.

225
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,860
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,040
Now, I'll show my gratitude to the new president, and I'll give you a wooden sword.

227
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,940
A wooden sword, everyone!

228
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:57,300
You have to give it to me first.

229
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,940
Yay! Everyone's on board!

230
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,600
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,700
I was wrong to announce this earlier.

232
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,320
The

233
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:24,720
W... what is this?

234
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,760
What are you doing!

235
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,860
Everyone, get your clothes off right now!

236
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,900
It's the president's order!

237
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,840
No way!

238
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,300
What's going on?

239
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,640
But the president's order means...

240
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,200
Yeah.

241
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,280
If this goes on...

242
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,880
What was I doing?

243
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,400
Hey, be careful, Reiko.

244
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,300
What?

245
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,540
No!

246
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,180
I'm thin, so I'm not confident about this.

247
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,200
You're confident, but you're definitely a pervert.

248
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,280
Good!

249
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,320
Then, let's do this instead of salute.

250
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,540
Hohoho!

251
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,500
Poyo!

252
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,880
No!

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,180
Pervert!

254
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,000
No!

255
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,840
Hey, you turned into a pervert in front of the president!

256
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,440
But perverts are perverts!

257
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,360
That's right!

258
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,740
I forgot!

259
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,220
Actually, you can see the big picture of the president's uniform.

260
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,220
If you're going to obey the order, I'll kill you all!

261
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,200
Naoko!

262
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,180
Naoko!

263
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,860
Naoko!

264
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,820
Hang in there!

265
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,240
Hehe.

266
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,680
You're a pervert!

267
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,620
What?

268
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,560
What did you say?

269
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,720
I mean, it's true!

270
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,220
You're a pervert!

271
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:06,960
You're a pervert!

272
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,920
You're a pervert in your face, and you're a pervert in your personality!

273
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:09,620
What?

274
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,380
You're actually a pervert, but you're cheating on me with your chest pads!

275
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,080
Huh?

276
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,900
I know that.

277
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,940
You really liked Ryozu Kaikichi, didn't you?

278
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,780
Who are you, you pervert?

279
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,720
You're a pervert?

280
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,740
You're a pervert, so you're a pervert!

281
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,300
You're a pervert, so you're a pervert!

282
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,780
You're a pervert, so you're a pervert!

283
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,520
What?

284
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,760
You did it!

285
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,520
What?

286
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,780
No, I didn't.

287
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,380
You're the pervert who's acting like a pervert!

288
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,540
What did you say?

289
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,320
You were a pervert in the bathroom the other day, too!

290
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,500
Don't look at me like that.

291
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,280
I'm a pervert!

292
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,700
Oh, no.

293
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,780
I left my plastic bag in front of the hair salon.

294
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,140
Chief!

295
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,660
Chief!

296
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:50,720
Sir?

297
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,640
You woke up.

298
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,540
What am Iâ€”

299
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,640
Now everyone, let's pay our respects to our chief!

300
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,460
Yes!

301
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,440
Ho-hey!

302
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,340
Ho-iod!

303
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,420
Ho-hey!

304
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,360
Ho-iod!

305
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,340
Idiot!

306
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,240
Episode 1: The

307
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,280
I have just received a message from the Katsushika office of Tenya Wanya.

308
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,200
The body of the retired Lieutenant Ryotsu was stabbed by a dog due to a fire.

309
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,500
What? It's the evening? Why are you in such a hurry?

310
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,900
You should go back to your body as soon as possible.

311
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,840
Ouch! Why did you hit me?

312
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,280
Chief!

313
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,640
Idiot!

314
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,160
This is dangerous, Chief!

315
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,580
I'm not a chief. I'm a god of death.

316
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,020
A god of death?

317
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Yes. I came to pick you up. Follow me.

318
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,600
Wait! I'm not a god of death!

319
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,620
I'm here, even if you're not.

320
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,800
Now, listen to me. You're already dead.

321
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,100
That's a mistake. The ghost I mentioned earlier said I'm not dead yet.

322
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,580
Phew. Time's up.

323
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,540
No way! No way!

324
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,560
What a bad guy!

325
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,920
Ryotsukan Kichi.

326
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,720
Born in Yorozuya as the eldest son of the Tskudani family of Tokyo and Taito prefecture.

327
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,420
Father, Ginji.

328
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,700
Mother, Yone.

329
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,740
Born on June 14, 1910.

330
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,200
He was caught by the police and was thrown on a train.

331
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,320
He fell into a river and died.

332
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,980
There is no doubt.

333
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
No doubt?

334
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,420
Is that possible?

335
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,860
I don't want to go to heaven yet.

336
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,420
Idiot! Who's going to heaven?

337
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,800
You're going to hell on the third day of your life.

338
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,360
I'm not joking! I'll fix it!

339
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,000
Come on!

340
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,060
No!

341
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,380
Die honestly!

342
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,860
Damn you!

343
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,100
I'll rewrite this guy's data.

344
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,460
Hey, Ryotsu!

345
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,160
Don't wait, Ryotsu!

346
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,020
Wait, you fool!

347
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,260
Wait!

348
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,780
It's a dead end.

349
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,800
This will make someone get in trouble.

350
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,460
Ryotsu!

351
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:37,760
What?

352
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,060
What?

353
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,320
What?

354
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,360
What is it?

355
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,860
Come on, Ryotsu!

356
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,220
Hey, Ryotsu!

357
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,240
What the hell have you done to yourself?

358
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,140
You?!

359
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:54,940
You?

360
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,440
You?!

361
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,900
Come on, come on.

362
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,380
You think I'm a crazy guy?

363
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,640
I've never been so crazy.

364
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,320
Let's see...

365
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,560
The future president,

366
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,200
Prime Minister, 3 billion a year,

367
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,060
and a life of 1,200 years.

368
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,300
No way.

369
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,700
Even if my life is long,

370
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,780
I can't be disqualified.

371
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:30,860
I'm so tired of my life that I haven't gotten used to it yet.

372
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,080
But I think I made it in time.

373
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,620
Namu, namu, namu, namu, gachan, gachan.

374
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,880
Namu, namu, gachan, gachan, gachan.

375
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,000
I can't believe that Ryo-san would end up like this.

376
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,380
I can't believe it.

377
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,380
Ryo-san, why? Why?

378
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,340
Why am I so sad after I died?

379
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,220
I'm going to cry.

380
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,840
Why didn't you pay the debt before I died?

381
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,700
What the hell?

382
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,420
You're so selfish, you bastard.

383
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,220
There are quite a few public funds gathered.

384
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,800
This is the person who died, of course.

385
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,820
In other words, it's my money.

386
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,980
You idiot!

387
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,140
You're such an idiot.

388
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,280
You're not getting away with this.

389
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,500
You're going to be scolded even after you become a Buddha?

390
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,340
I don't like it at all.

391
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,600
Why did you die, Ryo-san?

392
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,820
Chief, you're talking about me?

393
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,400
Okay, I'm sorry to worry about you.

394
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,460
Ryo-san, Kankichi, I'll be right there.

395
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,000
I'll be back soon.

396
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,800
Hey, you light bulb thief!

397
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,800
Hey, light bulb thief, wait!

398
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,880
I found you.

399
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,640
Come with me.

400
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,480
Why does the god of death have a stun gun?

401
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,260
The world over there is also linked to the progress of reality.

402
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,140
Come on.

403
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,080
Look at this.

404
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,600
I'm going to live to be 1200 years old.

405
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:09,680
There is no hope for you.

406
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,000
You idiot!

407
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,220
You put a lot of data, so the computer of the god of death led to an error.

408
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,980
It's impossible.

409
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,600
What?

410
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,740
You must go to hell today as you are destined to do.

411
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,960
No! The light bulb thief is going to escape!

412
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,560
Did you hear that?

413
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,760
Don't say that, you fool!

414
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,940
This is my money!

415
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,020
Hey, Ryocan! Wait!

416
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,780
The bus is...

417
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:43,980
Wait!

418
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,520
Damn it!

419
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,200
I have to run fast!

420
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,100
It's faster to fly in the sky!

421
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,800
Damn it!

422
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,900
Wait!

423
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,580
I'll start the bus.

424
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,120
I'll start the bus!

425
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,180
Damn it!

426
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,780
I have to run fast!

427
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,320
I can't stop now!

428
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,040
Wait!

429
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,260
I'll start the bus!

430
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,620
Wait!

431
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,660
Why did Ma-san...

432
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,120
Damn it!

433
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,040
I have to run fast!

434
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,770
I can't stop now!

435
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
I can't stop now!

436
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,760
Damn it!

437
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,080
Damn it!

438
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,140
Wait!

439
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,220
Wait!

440
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,720
What happened?

441
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,980
I can't stop now!

442
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,380
I'll start the bus!

443
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,560
Damn it!

444
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,680
Wait!

445
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,680
I'll start the bus!

446
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,680
Damn it!

447
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,480
I have to run fast!

448
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,920
I have to run fast!

449
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,640
Damn it!

450
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,660
I have to run fast!

451
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,940
What?

452
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,320
No!

453
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,980
That's my bus!

454
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,000
I can't stop now!

455
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,560
Damn it!

456
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:48,940
Damn it!

457
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,080
Damn it!

458
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,040
I can't stop now!

459
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,680
Damn it!

460
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,260
I have to run fast!

461
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,120
Stop it!

462
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:00,820
Stop it!

463
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,040
I have to run fast!

464
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,220
I can't stop now!

465
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,280
I don't want to!

466
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,160
Damn it!

467
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,440
I have to run fast!

468
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,300
Damn it!

469
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,660
Damn it!

470
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,920
Damn it!

471
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,460
You two finally said goodbye.

472
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,260
He'll put the plumber and game software we've gathered together in your account.

473
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,100
He'll put the plumber and game software we've gathered together in your account.

474
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,540
And the video.

475
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,540
Then, I'll close the lid.

476
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,700
Manmaidam, Manmaidam, please don't hesitate to appear.

477
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,440
Damn it! Where's my body?

478
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,320
Take this!

479
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,840
That was a close one, Ryosu.

480
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,760
What?

481
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,540
Not yet!

482
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,220
I'm not done yet!

483
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,880
Then, I'll open the lid.

484
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,240
My body...

485
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,940
Give up this time!

486
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,700
Not yet!

487
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,040
I did it!

488
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,320
What?

489
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,700
Ryosu!

490
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,500
Senpai!

491
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,340
Someone, put out the fire!

492
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,120
Why?

493
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,140
This guy is a nuisance to come to hell.

494
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,160
I won't bring him here again.

495
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,520
Someone, put out the fire!

496
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,720
I'm going to die again!

497
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,260
The End

498
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,820
Captain, what took us so long?

499
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,400
Please leave!

500
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,000
Where are you going?

501
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,620
I don't want to go anywhere like that.

502
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,440
Please stop!

503
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,780
Captain!

504
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,000
The next episode is "Dangerous Kids".

505
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,880
Captain!

506
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,740
The End

507
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,820
I'm sorry.

508
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,400
"The Power of Power"

509
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:36,520
I'm so excited!

510
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,960
I'm so excited!

511
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,100
I'm so excited!

512
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,820
I'm so excited!

513
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,500
I'm so excited!

514
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,400
I'm so excited!

515
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,780
I'm so excited!

516
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,880
I'm so excited!

517
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,400
I'm so excited!

518
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,820
I'm so excited!

519
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:51,820
I'm so excited!

520
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,520
I'm so excited!

521
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,880
I'm so excited!

522
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,840
Hello, everyone.

523
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,200
Hello, everyone.

524
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,980
Hello, everyone.

525
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,160
Hello, everyone.

526
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,420
Hello, everyone.

527
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,240
Draw it a little in the ground

528
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,100
