1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,740
Kik 19

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,040
When you're watching TV, turn up the mood and try to get away from the room.

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,960
Come to my place if you don't have money.

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,820
I don't have money, but I'm worrying about it.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:35,900
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,420
You'll be able to do something somehow

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,460
You'll be able to do something somehow

8
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,360
If you have no job, come to my place

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
I don't have one, but don't worry

10
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,320
Look, it's burning

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,400
Ah, it's burning

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,960
You'll be able to do something somehow

13
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,580
You know it, right?

14
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,400
You know it, you know it!

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,720
If you know it, then shut up and follow me!

16
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,920
Wake up, serious person Ryo-tsu!

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,420
You idiot!

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,320
What's wrong, Chief Ohara?

19
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,220
Nothing, just look at this!

20
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,940
It's the result of the mock test of the first test of the chief of the police.

21
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,260
This is...

22
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,060
Too bad!

23
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,900
The test of the chief of the police is resumed!

24
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,300
The test of the chief of the police is resumed!

25
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,860
The police department is resumed!

26
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,580
I will judge it not by this nor by that!

27
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,300
It was the lowest point since the starting of the test!

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,040
You even made me embarrassed!

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,000
The chief forced me to take the test!

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,240
I didn't want to take it!

31
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,040
At your age, you should have taken it once!

32
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,380
But so cruel is a minor!

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
It can be anything but a problem for the elementary school kid.

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,680
Then, what about the current minister?

35
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,160
Huh?

36
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,560
No, no.

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,540
Not Yamadaichiro.

38
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:34,660
Isn't it a tree?

39
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,760
Is it a bush?

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,040
No, it's not.

41
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,520
It really is a school.

42
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,580
You'll have to start over from elementary school!

43
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,260
Are you really going to make me do a problem for elementary school students?

44
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,620
It's to acquire knowledge and skills that are not embarrassing to people.

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,720
Don't be shy.

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,720
I just have to do it, right?

47
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,860
Umm...

48
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,360
Don't fall asleep so suddenly!

49
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,640
I feel sleepy when I look at the problem.

50
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,220
I've heard that there are people who don't like studying.

51
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,220
You were like that too, right?

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,880
Then, here's the problem.

53
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,160
What is this?

54
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,580
I see!

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,820
When you fall asleep, you get a pencil stuck in your forehead, right?

56
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,100
Ahh!

57
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,420
A pencil stuck in my forehead!

58
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,100
But I woke up, so I'm going to continue studying!

59
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,240
When I was young, I fought against my sleepiness like this and was eager to study.

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,260
This time, don't fall asleep.

61
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,060
I see.

62
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,960
If I see such a thing in front of me, I can sleep.

63
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,140
I'm sleepy again.

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm going to sleep here.

65
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,060
I'm going to sleep here.

66
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,500
I'm going to sleep here.

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,920
There's a pencil stuck in my forehead...

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,900
Ouch!

69
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,620
I can't believe you fell asleep like that.

70
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,660
But Ryo-san, you don't sleep much when it comes to games or plastic models,

71
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,980
why do you go to bed right after you start studying?

72
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,140
Is that why you're having so much trouble?

73
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,000
Human beings are the ones who make effort to do what they're interested in.

74
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,040
But in the case of Ryo-chan,

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,360
In your case, your head is different from other people's.

76
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,280
No way...

77
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,680
Exactly!

78
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,980
Who is it?

79
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,440
Hey, Gorilla-kun! It's here!

80
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,200
Here!

81
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,680
You're a medamawari!

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,280
No!

83
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,140
It's me, Gorilla-kun!

84
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,780
Professor Edaki!

85
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,140
Actually, I've been into human brain research lately.

86
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,860
So why are you a medamawari?

87
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,180
That's weird!

88
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,840
I made this with the image of a tuna eyeball.

89
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,360
Tuna eyeballs contain a large amount of brain smell, DHA.

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,220
Call me Medamato Santa.

91
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,340
That's too suspicious.

92
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,400
The other day, I sneaked into Gorilla-kun's room and secretly measured his brain waves.

93
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,380
How could you do that?

94
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,180
I've been having weird dreams lately.

95
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,220
I thought so.

96
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,660
As a result, I found something interesting.

97
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,560
Actually, Gorilla-kun doesn't have his brain working at all.

98
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,300
What?

99
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,940
His brain...

100
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,680
He doesn't work!

101
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,740
No way!

102
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,540
Brain...

103
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:45,980
The brain on the left.

104
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,920
That's how much I know!

105
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,680
Human brain is divided into brain and brain.

106
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,940
Brain is the brain that controls the sensitivity of things like art and lightning.

107
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,980
DHA.

108
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,220
Brain controls the sensitivity of things like math and language processing.

109
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,860
That means the brain is not working.

110
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,000
That means the brain is not working.

111
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,380
So I don't like tests.

112
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,300
But the brain is working very hard.

113
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,720
So you're working hard to build up your mind.

114
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,460
I see.

115
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,560
I can't believe this!

116
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,820
But don't worry.

117
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,020
Believe me.

118
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,420
Pop, pop, pop, pop!

119
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,200
Mr. Brain!

120
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,940
What's that?

121
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,720
It's a machine that awakens your brain.

122
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,700
If you use this, your brain will start working.

123
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,100
Really?

124
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,320
Yes.

125
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,880
I've already done animal experiments.

126
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,960
Look at this.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,360
It's a mouse man.

128
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,660
Mouse man?

129
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,740
It's a mouse man.

130
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,640
I named him because he's handsome.

131
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,660
I see.

132
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:52,800
I see.

133
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,400
He has awakened the brain by Mr. Brain.

134
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,720
I named him as Mouse Man.

135
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,400
Say 'kiss' in Japanese.

136
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,680
Did you see my brain?

137
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,080
It's the problem of elementary school.

138
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,700
It's quite suspicious.

139
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,660
It's better than not doing anything.

140
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,540
Let me try it.

141
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,020
Are you ready?

142
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,520
Yeah.

143
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,460
Let's go.

144
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,200
Dr. Brain, switch on!

145
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,860
"What do you think, Professor?"

146
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,340
"Upside is Uno, and below is the graph showing the activity of Sano."

147
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,920
"Really? He's not doing any activity at all?"

148
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,460
"He seems to be sleeping very deeply. Let's turn up the output a little."

149
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,900
"It seems like there's no change, but if he were a normal human, Sano would have started working long ago."

150
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,200
"It's supposed to be, but the output is even more..."

151
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,440
"He seems to be still sleeping."

152
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,040
"Isn't it broken?"

153
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,180
"Is it Ryo-chan's Sano?"

154
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,980
"No, it's the machine's!"

155
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,700
"That can't be! My invention is perfect!"

156
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,340
"Power up!"

157
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,280
"Huh? My head is getting numb!"

158
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,040
"Is this machine really okay?"

159
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,460
"Your Sano won't wake up if you're a little lazy."

160
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,600
"I can't help it."

161
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:17,940
"Tapai!"

162
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,420
"He won't wake up yet; he's such a hardy guy!"

163
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,060
"Wake up! Wake up!"

164
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,220
"Professor!"

165
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,780
"Is it not dangerous anymore?"

166
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,520
"Noo, not yet?!"

167
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,840
"Sano, wake up!!"

168
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,460
"Argh!"

169
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,660
"Aargh!"

170
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,880
Ryo-tsu! Are you okay?

171
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,240
Senpai!

172
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,860
Ryo-chan is studying!

173
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:05,700
What?

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,740
Ryo-tsu, you...

175
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,620
We are solving this problem right now. Please be quiet.

176
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,780
Ah, okay.

177
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,860
It's done! What is it, Chief?

178
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,880
Ryo-tsu, are you okay?

179
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,420
You are really Ryo-tsu, aren't you?

180
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,740
I was shocked by that explosion.

181
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,980
I thought I was with someone else again.

182
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,820
What are you talking about?

183
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,660
I am me.

184
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,300
But suddenly studying...

185
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,960
I don't know myself, but...

186
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
The moment the explosion happened...

187
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,860
I felt like the problem was solved suddenly.

188
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,720
So I tried to solve it now.

189
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,980
It's going to be solved in an interesting way.

190
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,500
Why did I have to struggle with such a simple problem?

191
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,680
I don't know. It's strange.

192
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,480
Everything is right.

193
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,620
Then, Ryo-tsu's difference in ability is...

194
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,340
That's right!

195
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,600
Gorilla-kun's difference in ability is completely awakened!

196
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,740
If we keep this up, Gorilla-kun will evolve into a human soon!

197
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,800
He is a human from the beginning!

198
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,020
Here, tea.

199
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,900
Take a break for a while.

200
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,580
After this problem is over,

201
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,360
I will continue to study every day.

202
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,140
Since then, if you have time, you should study.

203
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:20,960
But...

204
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,720
The drill that Chief Ohara bought at the beginning has already finished...

205
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,680
Right now, he only buys himself a problem set.

206
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,940
Isn't it a great change?

207
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,340
What are you going to do by studying so much?

208
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,920
Are you going to go to college?

209
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,280
I think I'll take an entrance examination of the Chief of Staff.

210
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,080
What?

211
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:39,920
What?

212
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,340
Did Ryo-tsu really say that?

213
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,360
Ha ha ha! It's a very interesting joke!

214
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,300
Wasn't it true that he recorded the lowest score in the last mock exam?

215
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,440
That idiot. He's trying to embarrass me again.

216
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,460
But Ryo-chan has been studying recently.

217
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,480
The exam is next month.

218
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,040
I've been doing elementary school problems until before, but I can't make it in time.

219
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,600
Today, I was doing the entrance exam for the university last year.

220
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,700
It was almost all correct.

221
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,160
What?

222
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,740
It seems that the power of the person who had slept for decades has been released at once.

223
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,160
If we go with this pace, the junior high school director's promotion exam may pass in one shot.

224
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,560
Or, the police law promotion exam may be possible at once.

225
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,920
That Ryo-chan...

226
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,560
But the junior high school director's promotion exam not only has a written exam, but also an interview and a police duty.

227
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,460
Can he do it well?

228
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,100
You too.

229
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,660
I think he can do it.

230
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,420
Huh?

231
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,420
It's about time.

232
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,560
There are 30 minutes left until the time to go to work.

233
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,880
He's always early these days.

234
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,440
That late painter.

235
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,720
Good morning, Chief Ohara.

236
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,380
Oh, good morning.

237
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,940
It's really nice weather today.

238
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,560
Is it really Ryo-chan?

239
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,940
Then who is it?

240
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,060
He always wears the right uniform.

241
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,780
I've been too loose so far.

242
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,180
I see.

243
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,600
I'd like to ask you a little bit about the way.

244
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Yes, I'm back.

245
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,960
If you go straight down this road, there's a cigarette shop on the right.

246
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,020
Turn right there...

247
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,100
Ryo-chan is seriously working.

248
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,000
We're also helped.

249
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,700
When I'm free, I study for the exam.

250
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,320
Now he's a perfect model police officer.

251
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,040
I can't believe it.

252
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,280
Well then.

253
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,680
Ryo-chan, you seem to be studying a lot these days.

254
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,280
I've just been too lazy to do it.

255
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,720
By the way, do you know Article 31 of the Japanese Constitution?

256
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,900
Unless it's in accordance with the law,

257
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,240
you can't have that life or freedom taken away,

258
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,360
and you can't have that punishment.

259
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,520
Oh, that's right, senpai.

260
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,020
Then what is the definition of an officer's job?

261
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,540
An abnormal behavior.

262
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,780
From the circumstances surrounding it,

263
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,140
it is reasonably judged,

264
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,740
committing some kind of crime,

265
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,620
or if it is suspected of committing a crime,

266
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,040
it is sufficient reason to be doubtful.

267
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,840
It's a reasonable reason.

268
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,560
If you know about the crime already committed,

269
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,100
or if you know that the crime is about to be committed,

270
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,800
you can ask for something that can be recognized.

271
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,080
Wow, you're good at explaining things.

272
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,260
You're really good at explaining things.

273
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,220
Oh no, if this continues,

274
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,500
Ryo-chan will really become the chief of the police at the next exam.

275
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
And then he'll be a police chief...

276
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,520
I don't think he'll become a police officer or a police officer.

277
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,780
I don't think he'll become a police officer or a police officer.

278
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,300
I don't think he'll become a police officer or a police officer.

279
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,880
Ohara-kun, I'll have some tea.

280
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,520
Yes, I'm home.

281
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,380
Ohara-kun, please send this document to the head office.

282
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,560
Yes!

283
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,340
Umm...

284
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,560
What's wrong, Ohara-kun?

285
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,420
I don't know how to use the machine...

286
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,380
Idiot!

287
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,300
That's why I'm the head of the police!

288
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,220
Use more of your brain, brain!

289
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,560
I'm sorry, sir.

290
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,140
I'm sorry, sir.

291
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,300
I can't help it. I can't help it.

292
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:17,760
I can't help it. I can't help it.

293
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,140
I can't help it.

294
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,120
Nope, nope.

295
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,400
Hey! You're alone!

296
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,060
What about the rest?

297
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,420
I'm alone on patrol.

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,860
Reiko's gonna the station.

299
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,860
Oh...

300
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,640
I see.

301
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,920
Actually, we've got some good wine.

302
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,280
How about it?

303
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,460
Oh, looks delicious.

304
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,180
Drinking in the morning would lower your office's work.

305
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,760
DRINKING IN THE MORNING WOULD LOWER YOUR OFFICE'S WORK. DRINKING IN THE MORNING WOULD LOWER YOUR OFFICE'S WORK. DRINKING IN THE MORNING WOULD LOWER YOUR OFFICE'S WORK. DRINKING IN THE MORNING WOULD LOWER YOUR OFFICE'S WORK. DRINKING IN THE MORNING WOULD LOWER YOUR OFFICE'S WORK.

306
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,520
If I continue every day, I'll definitely fail the exam.

307
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,320
Chief.

308
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,580
I'll have it after the work hours are over.

309
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,840
If you say such a funny thing,

310
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,520
the other people will notice it too.

311
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,200
I can't drink alone anymore.

312
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,580
Everyone drinks with fun, right?

313
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,160
Ryotsu...

314
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,520
You...

315
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,400
I was such a narrow-minded person.

316
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,140
I didn't know you'd get in the way of such a great man.

317
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,060
I want to go in if there's a hole.

318
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,340
Ryotsu, please pass the exam this time.

319
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,840
If you can help me with anything, please tell me.

320
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,020
What's wrong with you?

321
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,980
I'm home.

322
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,630
Chief Ohara.

323
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,140
What's wrong?

324
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,900
Please help Ryotsu pass the exam.

325
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,100
What's that sound?

326
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,960
It's been a long time.

327
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,040
Everyone at the exit in front of the park.

328
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,600
Who are you?

329
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,620
Who was it?

330
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,340
If you've forgotten, let me remind you.

331
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,760
I'm Shiratori Reiji, the super rich.

332
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,420
I remembered.

333
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,600
Reiko, I've booked the best restaurant in Akasaka.

334
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,820
Let's enjoy it until we are satisfied.

335
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,720
Shiratori Jyuko...

336
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,060
I'm sure he passed away.

337
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,640
How many times did he pass the exam?

338
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,760
He can survive in the woods.

339
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,340
And Shiratori Jyuko has passed away.

340
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,360
It's not the end.

341
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,540
Let's go, Reiko.

342
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,320
Mr. Shiratori.

343
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm missing something.

344
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,160
Money, money, money.

345
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,580
That's right.

346
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,680
I'm sure the super rich Ryotsu Kanki will come here.

347
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,620
Is there no one?

348
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,140
Hmm?

349
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,160
What? He's here.

350
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,480
Look, Ryozu is studying. Don't get in the way.

351
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,780
Studying?

352
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,000
You should make jokes after seeing this.

353
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,000
There you go!

354
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,640
Stop it!

355
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,680
This time, it's not a children's bank account.

356
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,860
It's real money.

357
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,700
Pick it up, poor man. Pick it up!

358
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,620
I can't believe I'm not upset to see this much cash.

359
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,600
Hey, don't ignore it.

360
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Look, there's a 2,000 yen bill.

361
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,880
Hey, pick it up.

362
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,280
If you pick it up, you'll get a 10% reward.

363
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,340
I know it's for children.

364
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,380
The reason you get a car loan is because of the item.

365
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,540
If you drop it in front of you, you won't get it.

366
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,880
Is that so?

367
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,780
By the way, the range of the car loan when you deliver the item is between 50% and 20%.

368
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,840
It doesn't have to be 10%.

369
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,760
Of course I knew that.

370
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,240
I was just trying to test your knowledge.

371
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,440
And then?

372
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,960
The person who gave up their right to own the item will be the first person to pick it up.

373
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,900
Such as the money he's sold.

374
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,500
What?

375
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,620
This is my money!

376
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,260
No one should touch it!

377
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,060
In front of Reiko, you made me feel embarrassed!

378
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,700
Remember it!

379
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,640
He's gone...

380
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,620
It's the first time

381
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,220
You can continue to study by keeping the money in your pocket?

382
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,460
I can't think of it from Ryo-chan before.

383
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,720
I'll explain about it.

384
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,380
Professor Ezaki, that outfit is...

385
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,500
A paint wall?

386
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,620
No matter how you look at it, it's a sweet potato!

387
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,440
I guess so.

388
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,360
So, what about you, professor?

389
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,100
Why do you wear that kind of outfit?

390
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,740
The energy that moves human brain is sugar.

391
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,040
Sugar.

392
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,360
If you include sugar a lot, it's a sweet potato.

393
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,820
That's the only reason.

394
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Well, the Gorilla-kun you're seeing now has instinct and reason in his head.

395
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,220
In other words, his brain and his brain are fighting frequently.

396
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,640
Usually, they win or lose.

397
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,700
But Gorilla-kun's brain has been sleeping for decades, so it has too much power.

398
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,860
That's why he completely suppresses his brain and becomes a super rational person.

399
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,720
Hmm. That's fine.

400
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,760
But somehow, he doesn't seem like Ryo-chan.

401
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,460
Then, let's go for the exam.

402
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,580
Do your best.

403
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,860
Yes.

404
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,140
Now that Sano is working, I finally understand.

405
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,380
How well the chief was paying attention to me.

406
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,860
And how much the chief was worried about me.

407
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,100
Ryo-tsu.

408
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,600
Be a better cop.

409
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,060
Be a better cop than I am.

410
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,840
Chief.

411
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,720
Ryo-tsu.

412
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,120
Chief.

413
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,600
Chief.

414
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,200
Chief.

415
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,540
Chief.

416
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,140
Chief.

417
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,600
Ryo-chan, if you go to school, you'll be kicked out of this school, right?

418
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,900
I'm sure that'll happen.

419
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,080
If Ryo-san is kicked out, this school will become a normal school, too.

420
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,420
He'll grow up from here.

421
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,220
Let's send him off with a smile.

422
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,500
That's right.

423
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,780
I've been waiting for you, poor commoner!

424
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,720
Siratori?

425
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,340
You?

426
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
Wait, I know what you want to say.

427
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,440
Right?

428
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,940
Isn't it cold wearing such clothes using this?

429
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,380
However, it's not cold at all.

430
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:16,860
Because.

431
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,720
ke Medal

432
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,340
I have a bath worth 10000 yen, you know!

433
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
So~re!

434
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,020
Ah, feels good!

435
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,180
This is great!

436
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,300
There are all the treasures of Shinatori Junko in here!

437
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,940
There is a possibility that it could be a poison or a poison.

438
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,240
But let's just ignore it for now.

439
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,860
The time of the exam is approaching.

440
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,420
Don't ignore it!

441
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,580
Then how about the shower in the office?

442
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,400
That's it!

443
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,900
This is your favorite notebook!

444
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,040
Go ahead and pick it up!

445
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,580
I won't listen to your provocations.

446
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,420
I'm sorry for rushing you.

447
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,720
Look, look! There's more!

448
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,580
You really want it, don't you?

449
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,520
You can give it to me.

450
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,100
Money is so nice.

451
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,000
It makes me feel rich.

452
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,920
There are many things more important than money in the world.

453
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,940
What's wrong?

454
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,840
My legs. My legs don't move.

455
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,720
Since we're here, let's go get them.

456
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,920
We've always been like this, haven't we?

457
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:22,980
This is bad.

458
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,880
I've been caught up in money and failed many times.

459
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,420
I'll show you the money in front of my eyes!

460
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,620
That's right!

461
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,640
You can't lose to such a desire!

462
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,940
If you listen to me quietly, you'll get rich!

463
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,140
I don't need money!

464
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,240
I'm not kidding!

465
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,280
Wait.

466
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,540
Let's talk rationally.

467
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,180
I hate that kind of thing.

468
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,220
I'll do this to you!

469
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,240
You don't have to come out for 100 years!

470
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,300
Hey, poor guy.

471
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,540
What?

472
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,600
Money!

473
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,320
The world is full of money!

474
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,200
Money! Money! Money! Money!

475
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,700
Stop!

476
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,940
It's my mom's company's all-lilies!

477
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,500
I told you that you'd pay us!

478
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,420
I won't touch it.

479
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,180
Hey, driver!

480
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:17,860
Your car!

481
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Bring it to my room!

482
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,700
You!

483
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,840
Stop it!

484
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,000
Yes sir!

485
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,220
Hey! gorilla!

486
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,280
Mr. Morita! Do you need a bill?

487
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,580
A bill? Of course I'll take it!

488
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,780
I said so!

489
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,420
No! I'll get hit!

490
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,760
Oh, a bill!

491
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,640
Hey, where's the bill?

492
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,820
It's here.

493
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,280
A bill full of sugar that will be the energy of the brain.

494
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,780
I'm sure I'll pass this.

495
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
That bill?

496
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,080
A bill?

497
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,480
Hey, a real bill!

498
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,080
Hey, hey, hey!

499
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,300
Water, water, water!

500
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,680
Yes!

501
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,560
Oh, there's water over there!

502
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,040
Hey, water! Water, water!

503
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,500
Hey, this is...

504
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,200
Gasoline Station!

505
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,980
This is mine!

506
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,840
Miss Reiko brought it for me!

507
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,820
No, you!

508
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,120
Let go of me!

509
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:29,560
This is...

510
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,160
Ryo-chan's son is in deep sleep again.

511
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,440
Huh?

512
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,340
Then, will the General Secretary be asleep?

513
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,760
It can't be for the rest of his life.

514
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,760
But this is more like Ryo-chan.

515
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,780
What about Shiratori-san?

516
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,380
The vice-minister said he would be revived from the fire many times.

517
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,960
But all his wealth is gone.

518
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,020
I think it's going to take some time to be revived.

519
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,480
Hey!

520
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,900
Be more rational!

521
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,640
Ugh!

522
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,180

We used the P.H.S. counterpoint system for investigation training.

539
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,240
If he runs over as the culprit, I'll keep him!

540
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,100
Leave it to us.
