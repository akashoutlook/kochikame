Translation by Hazuki no Yume

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:17,560
I look up at the sunset floating on the river

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,560
When I kick the pebbles, it flies to my shoes

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,660
I wonder if I should go to the gym where I used to work out

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,700
They laughed at me saying I was still a baby

6
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,400
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can only get a penalty

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,920
The cityscape that doesn't change even if I have one bad day is strangely gentle

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,380
From the water tank of the Tungari-boshi

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,140
The sunset falls to the Kaishakuten

10
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,400
Tomorrow is over already

11
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,900
I lost my happiness again when I was in Katsushika and Shibamata

12
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,740
I realized

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,340
I'm such a fool

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:39,120
I'm such a fool

15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,720
Okay! Stay better together

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,000
I show the Japanese gift

17
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,360
Hold on!

18
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,900
Smile! Smile! Smile!

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,980
Ok! Say cheese!

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,820
Where have you been?

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,440
I've been to Nijube Shrine.

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,820
But there were a lot of foreign tourists in Asakusa.

23
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,680
But if you look closely, there are a lot of foreigners here.

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,100
If you say Akihabara and Asakusa,

25
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,360
you must go to a guidebook for foreigners.

26
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,080
What?

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,640
How is the road to Japan so narrow?

28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,560
You're not allowed to enter here by car.

29
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,880
Stop! Stop!

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,760
Ouch!

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
Are you okay, sir?

32
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,360
I'm fine. But what is this guy?

33
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,340
It's Jaguar.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
And it's an old Mk2.

35
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,520
A British guy.

36
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,680
He jumped out of the car suddenly.

37
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,520
He's a gentleman in the UK.

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,080
Hey, what are you thinking?

39
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,340
I thought it was a mountain gorilla in Japan,

40
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,680
but it came to the United States.

41
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,380
Who's a gorilla?

42
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,040
Professor Ezaki.

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,280
Isn't it Professor Ezaki?

44
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,460
What's up, Nakagawa?

45
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:07,920
Do you know him?

46
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:08,980
Yes.

47
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,540
When I was studying in Cambridge University in the UK,

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,760
Professor, did you forget?

49
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,920
It's Nakagawa.

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,740
Oh, my students.

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:18,980
How do you know?

52
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,580
I'm Nakagawa.

53
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,560
What a coincidence that you can meet me in this place.

54
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,160
I'm glad to meet you in this country.

55
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,360
It's a miracle.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,500
It's a miracle!

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,680
I don't know if you're Japanese or a foreigner.

58
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,900
I've lived abroad for a long time.

59
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,440
Hey, it's time for morning tea.

60
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,920
How about a cup of tea?

61
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,880
What's with that outfit?

62
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,540
Why are you wearing a skirt?

63
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,120
This is England's new style.

64
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,020
It's a kilt, senpai.

65
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,280
It's a traditional British national costume.

66
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,180
But I think it's Scotland, not England.

67
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,360
So, who are you?

68
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,220
It's a pair of trousers.

69
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,080
I can tell by your outfit.

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,220
Did you change your clothes?

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
Yes, this is my...

72
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,640
You're the culprit, aren't you?

73
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,120
I'm wearing a uniform, too.

74
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm your senior.

75
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,900
My Jaguar is not injured.

76
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,100
If it's that important, you can't come in.

77
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,160
You...

78
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,040
What?

79
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,440
Your pronunciation is wrong.

80
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,200
Jaguar!

81
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,680
J-A-G-U-A-R.

82
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,060
It's Jaguar.

83
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,680
Yes, go ahead.

84
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,660
J...

85
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,740
Jagu...

86
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,160
G...

87
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,720
G-A-G-U-A...

88
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,680
You stupid!

89
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,820
In Japan, it's Jaguar.

90
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,480
Jaa-ga-r.

91
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,800
Oh, my tea time is over.

92
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,680
Why did I talk to you two?

93
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,440
You're bothering me.

94
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,560
I should have put out a table here.

95
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,720
I can't speak English without a cup of tea.

96
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,300
I know the difference.

97
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,340
Ezaki Korosuke.

98
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,360
Korosuke?

99
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,120
What are you doing?

100
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,740
I thought you were a croquette instead of Korosuke.

101
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,700
You're the only one who thinks that way.

102
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,820
The fog is so strong.

103
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,720
It was raining in London today.

104
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,500
It was raining again today.

105
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,240
You're so good at speaking English.

106
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,460
You should say Nikujagwa instead of Nikujaga.

107
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,620
I've lived abroad for a long time.

108
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,640
When I think about it, I miss my days in England.

109
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,820
Big Ben's money that I spend in the fog.

110
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,620
It's Zenzouji's money.

111
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,320
I'm going to build a 2-story building right outside the window of the apartment.

112
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,840
Run.

113
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,020
Thank you for waiting.

114
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,820
Everyone, we have arrived at Asakusa Zenzouji.

115
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,360
There's a double-decker bus.

116
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,600
Recently, I've been running in Japan.

117
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,080
There's a famous detective Sherlock Holmes in Baker Street.

118
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,840
There's a rich soldier under the famous god of Kanda.

119
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,800
There's a famous Tower Bridge in London.

120
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,740
There's a famous Kajino Bridge in Japan that hasn't opened yet.

121
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,220
I hate losing.

122
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,660
Me too.

123
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,260
We're going to take the bus, too.

124
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,160
Oh.

125
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,040
Oh, make me see the bilang chicken somewhere.

126
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,960
What's going on, Blanc?

127
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,480
Because I have to go to work with you.

128
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,220
Well, Professor, would you like to have some sushi?

129
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Oh, I would be happy to.

130
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,320
Very good.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,880
Here it is.

132
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,940
It's good.

133
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,980
Right?

134
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,820
What's wrong, Professor?

135
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,920
Hmm...

136
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,320
Where's the napkin?

137
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,700
Ah, I told you to come!

138
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,860
Here I come!

139
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,440
Oh, Ryo-chan, Kei-chan!

140
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,800
What's up, Reiko? You're here too?

141
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,800
You two are still at work, right?

142
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,580
I don't mind lunch.

143
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,160
Dad, I'd like to have a tuna, salmon roe, and natto roll.

144
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,260
Here!

145
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,320
Oh, Kei-chan, who's that?

146
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,680
Ah, let me introduce you.

147
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,640
My teacher at Cambridge University.

148
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,860
Professor Ezaki Korosuke.

149
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,560
This is the chief of the school's school of the school's principal, Reiko Akimoto.

150
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,620
How do you do, Reiko?

151
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,980
"Mademoiselle" is French, isn't it?

152
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,540
Oh no!

153
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,840
"Mademoiselle" means "open more windows!"

154
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,460
You're so stubborn!

155
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,840
Professor, you've lived abroad for a long time, so you don't need to use the word "wind".

156
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,020
"Wind"?

157
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,960
It means "a base" or "a base".

158
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,600
What would you like to eat, Professor?

159
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,160
How much.

160
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:10,880
Huh?

161
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,820
"Master", how much you could say?

162
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
You mean "how much"?

163
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,160
No, no. How much?

164
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,980
Even if you say it like that...

165
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,980
Got it. How much? How much?

166
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,760
In other words, how much?

167
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,640
Oh, yes.

168
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,440
This is a very good way to say it.

169
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,020
How much is "how much"?

170
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,480
Is "with" like "tontchi"?

171
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,400
Hey, wait a minute.

172
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,980
"Wid" is "ikura".

173
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,480
"Wid" is "ikura".

174
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,300
Professor, you're so reckless.

175
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,060
"Ikura" is "anything".

176
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,200
"Ikura" is "anything"?

177
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,100
Oh, "ikura" is "anything"!

178
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,660
"Ikura" is "anything."

179
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,840
"If you say it so very quickly,"

180
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,880
well, that's okay, but

181
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,780
"Ikura" is "anything".

182
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,500
"Ikura" is "anything".

183
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,600
You got it.

184
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,100
How about you try it this time?

185
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,280
"Ikura" can be said as "waduku".

186
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,720
"Ikura", "waduku" means "pick up".

187
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:20,840
Ok.

188
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,740
·

189
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,480
"Waduku" means "cooking up leaves".

190
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,720
"Waduku" means "cooking up leaves".

191
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,580
English people always drink tea!

192
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,940
Excuse me, but I live in front of the Edo.

193
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,960
I don't drink tea often.

194
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
Thank you for the meal!

195
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,660
Enjoy!

196
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,960
It looks like the owner of the store was angry.

197
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,660
That's right.

198
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,660
Miss.

199
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,440
Yes?

200
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,300
Please send my Jaguar.

201
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,860
Ah! You're so fast!

202
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,340
But I'm driving.

203
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,420
I'm driving.

204
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,300
Leave the small Japanese cars behind.

205
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,700
It's Jaguar. Jaguar.

206
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,160
But Reiko's car is...

207
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,020
Porsche.

208
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,020
The middle one is Ferrari.

209
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,480
Cars are just cool and fast.

210
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,960
Without an extension like the British car,

211
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,980
it's hard to be a true driver.

212
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,740
Yes, that's right.

213
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,480
Even the British car I have

214
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,080
is Morgan Lotus.

215
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,260
Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce, and...

216
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,600
Anyway, England is the origin of the industrial revolution.

217
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,300
It's a country of adults with traditions and customs.

218
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,460
You bastard!

219
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,400
You should have listened to me quietly.

220
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,140
You're like England, England, and Kirigiri.

221
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,140
Senior, you didn't keep quiet.

222
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,960
Japan is a country of the sun and the sun.

223
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,420
It has traditions and customs.

224
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,520
You're Japanese, aren't you?

225
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,840
Anyway, I've lived abroad for a long time.

226
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,440
What?

227
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,320
London's grey sky is so nostalgic.

228
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,520
Tokyo's sky is too blue.

229
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,100
What do you mean blue?

230
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,120
Look!

231
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,260
Smog makes it grey enough.

232
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,240
There are many other grey-coloured states,

233
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,100
grey-coloured politicians.

234
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,400
If you don't like losing,

235
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,300
you don't lose.

236
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,720
I'll be in your care.

237
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:09,980
I see.

238
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,420
The British have the world's standard character.

239
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,380
The British speak English.

240
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,200
Tsukudani and instant noodles are the inventions of Japan.

241
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,240
London has London boots.

242
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,420
Geta, Zori, Waraji, Take-Uma are in England.

243
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,600
Is there Mt. Fuji?

244
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,340
Is there Tokyo Tower?

245
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,480
I don't think so.

246
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,020
No!

247
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,780
There's no Mt. Fuji or Tokyo Tower in England!

248
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,200
That's the truth!

249
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,940
Look! Japan has won.

250
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,580
But there's no 007 in Japan.

251
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,460
There's a ninja with a long history in Spain.

252
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,060
What?

253
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,040
A ninja?

254
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,460
You got it?

255
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,520
Tradition and common sense are not the same as the British.

256
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,220
In this case,

257
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,520
I'll have a duel!

258
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,740
I'll have a duel!

259
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,380
A duel?

260
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,940
N-no way!

261
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,080
A duel?

262
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,340
-What? -That's a stick?

263
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,740
-What? -What?

264
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,900
-No, it's not. -What does that mean?

265
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,820
-What does that mean? -Hip-hop Club!

266
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,160
-What? -What does that mean?

267
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,060
-What? -It means - -What

268
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,480
does that mean? -Hip-hop Club! Mint

269
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:43,580
y lets the world's best It's

270
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,480
not Tokyo Tower. I can

271
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,880
What does the Tokyo Tower have to do with the battle?

272
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,720
It's an iron tower!

273
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,320
What?

274
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,940
That's why...

275
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,880
Iron tower...

276
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,100
Climbing is the sport of a gentleman!

277
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,860
Whoever climbs to the top of the iron tower first wins!

278
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,660
You're trying to fool me again, aren't you?

279
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,740
Fine, if you're going to climb, I'm not going to win.

280
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,960
Senpai is right.

281
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,740
Even though he was only 2 years old, he was able to destroy 1000 chandeliers!

282
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,620
Start!

283
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,640
Whoa...

284
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,240
I heard the lights!

285
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,400
I can't lose to such a cheap guy!

286
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,060
I better win for real tomorrow!

287
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,280
Wh-What did you say?!

288
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,960
That's not fair!

289
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,820
How could you do that?!

290
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,460
What?

291
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,200
You have to climb up like that to make the rule!

292
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,400
Kosaki, you're going to miss!

293
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,220
Damn it!

294
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,220
Oh!

295
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,020
It's good to see Tokyo from such a high place like this.

296
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,380
Really, I haven't climbed up the Tokyo Tower in years.

297
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,900
I've been forgetting about the

298
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,560
"Early in the Clouds" for a while.

299
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,640
Hey, stand there to take a picture.

300
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,060
Oh, I'll ask that Fuji-san to come in.

301
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,940
Oh, what's wrong?

302
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,380
I-I think Ryotsu was there just now.

303
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,000
No, that's not what I meant.

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,400
No way!

305
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,060
I-I didn't think so.

306
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,200
Is this the end of the elevator?

307
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Wow, we're almost at the top!

308
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,920
Just a little low.

309
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,540
H-Huh?

310
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:15,560
Ugh!

311
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:15,940
How dare you go to the top!

312
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,100
I-I'm...

313
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,140
H-He's just trying to get in good water, h-heh...

314
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,320
I'm the one cooking!

315
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,040
I-I-I don't know what's wrong!

316
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,400
Hey, why don't you try to climb up the tower as well?

317
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,220
Tot ed.

318
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,940
Hahaha.

319
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,520
You have to climb up with me, don't you think?

320
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:38,980
Hmmm?

321
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,780
Oh, Professor Eizaki stopped!

322
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,120
Senpai wins!

323
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,000
Hehe, victory is on my side!

324
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,280
Ah, Senpai!

325
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,600
Well, there are times when the electric current is too strong in an iron tower, so be careful.

326
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,980
Say it quickly!

327
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,980
Now then...

328
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,220
This is the real top!

329
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,100
Oh, we're going to make it!

330
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,960
Ah, I hate this place too much!

331
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,980
I'm going to make it!

332
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,400
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch...

333
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,920
My whole body is still tingling...

334
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,000
Senpai and Professor hate losing too much.

335
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,200
It's true!

336
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,540
I'm a Japanese, but I can't forgive a guy who's wearing a foreign uniform.

337
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:27,980
Huh?

338
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,220
Yotsu...

339
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,860
What's wrong, Chief?

340
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,000
You didn't go up to the Tokyo Tower yesterday, did you?

341
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,820
Of course not.

342
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,400
No way! Who would climb up to such a high place?

343
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,160
Only fools and smoke can do that!

344
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,700
Fools and...

345
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,100
Smoke, huh...

346
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,080
Hmm...

347
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,980
I guess it's just a delusion.

348
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,340
It's a delusion! A delusion!

349
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,240
That's fine, but...

350
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,500
By the way, Nakagawa and Ryotsu...

351
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,840
There's a training for a car that we developed at the headquarters.

352
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,580
Will you come with us?

353
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,460
A car for safety?

354
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,980
A car for safety, huh...

355
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,640
So we're going to stop a car that died in an accident, huh?

356
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,020
I see.

357
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,120
Today, at the training for this car,

358
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,220
we have a professor from Cambridge University who's in charge of the development of the prototype.

359
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,100
Oh?

360
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,700
You're bringing a professor from England?

361
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,700
A professor?

362
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,560
Senior, it's Professor Ezaki!

363
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,300
What?

364
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:32,880
What did you say?

365
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,680
See?

366
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,720
It's true!

367
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,280
What's that voice?

368
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,380
There he is!

369
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,920
It's Professor Ezaki!

370
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,040
He drives like a madman.

371
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,940
He used to be a model.

372
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,280
He's like a car that breaks down when it hits.

373
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,120
Hello!

374
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,620
Sorry to keep you waiting, everybody.

375
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,860
Professor Ezaki!

376
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:07,760
You're back!

377
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,880
You're all fine, aren't you?

378
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,480
We just met yesterday!

379
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,140
And look!

380
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,740
Five of your drivers got blown away!

381
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,920
Oh, that's good news!

382
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,040
You're not the one who got blown away!

383
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,340
I have a lecture, so I'll be back!

384
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:24,960
Hey!

385
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,920
Professor Ezaki, would you like to hear something?

386
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,820
Here you go.

387
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,200
The theme of the "Car Society" is "Ecology and Safety".

388
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,400
It's important to think about the environment and make cars that are safe.

389
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,040
That's a good point.

390
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,720
I'm a professor of mechanical engineering.

391
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,760
Mechanical engineering?

392
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,240
But you're not good at driving.

393
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,520
So my safety car was made...

394
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,000
The world's most durable,

395
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,080
the Swedish Volvo's durability,

396
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,600
and the German Benz's stable driving.

397
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,760
It is made with the technology of the British Rolls-Royce,

398
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:06,620
which incorporates Japanese car electronics.

399
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,280
It's literally the safest car in the world.

400
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,520
So it's a mix of both.

401
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,900
I guess it's impossible to do that just in the UK.

402
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,420
Yo!

403
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,320
It's tea time.

404
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,760
You!

405
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,900
Yes, sir.

406
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,120
You always have tea time...

407
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,340
This is the secret to safe driving.

408
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,840
Ah!

409
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,000
You!

410
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,320
Excuse me.

411
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,440
I'm too hot.

412
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,520
Hey, what's the car announcement?

413
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,180
Well, that's fine.

414
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,200
This is the safety car I developed.

415
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,140
It's a Coyote Go.

416
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,380
This is it!

417
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,540
It looks very durable.

418
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,140
All the back seats are equipped with airbags

419
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,720
ABS multi-weights system

420
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,180
All the data is transferred to the front glass by Japanese electronics technology

421
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,360
Wireless remote control

422
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,720
Door opening and closing, and even the gas engine

423
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,200
All the safety features are in this remote control

424
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,260
The car is also...

425
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,340
Sorry, are you okay?

426
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,520
I'm not okay!

427
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,100
That's strange, the engine should only run at N-range

428
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,980
You should have stopped the engine

429
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,640
Right

430
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,140
Stop it!

431
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,120
Stop!

432
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:39,940
Stop!

433
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,180
Stop!

434
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,560
Stop!

435
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,120
Stop!

436
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,760
Why are you coming to me?

437
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,840
Senpai!

438
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,300
Watch out!

439
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,720
Where is the safe place for the remote control?

440
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,500
The shock test is over

441
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,920
Don't fool me!

442
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,700
But it's strange

443
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,520
The airbag doesn't work because of such a shock

444
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,140
It's true

445
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,340
What do you mean?

446
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,920
It works when the car crashes at 300km/h

447
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,320
What?

448
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,780
300km/h means the car is broken

449
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,980
You should be more careful

450
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,560
I can drive at 300km/h

451
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,620
Sir, we have prepared a safety test

452
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,840
He's a bad driver, so it's dangerous to be close to him

453
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,320
What?

454
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,080
Help him!

455
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,300
You can't try to be safe at the passenger seat

456
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,380
I'm not a bad person!

457
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,020
I can't trust your driving

458
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,500
Don't worry

459
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,380
It's 100% safe

460
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,620
Don't put that on yourself!

461
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,060
Let's go!

462
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,100
Trust me!

463
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,820
I can do it!

464
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,280
I'm going to the pole!

465
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,680
I'm going to the pole!

466
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,760
I can see the front!

467
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,820
Calm down!

468
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:15,000
I don't have my glasses

469
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,460
Look at the front!

470
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,400
Turn the steering wheel!

471
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,020
This is bad!

472
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,060
It's safe

473
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,720
Come back soon!

474
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,800
I didn't know

475
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,120
What's wrong?

476
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,860
Something's wrong

477
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,020
Something's wrong with the car

478
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:48,380
I can't see anything!

479
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,460
Hurry up!

480
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,640
The brakes!

481
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,540
It's not working!

482
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,480
I can't release the brakes

483
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,500
What?

484
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,680
Raise the sunroof!

485
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,520
OK!

486
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,520
It's the intersection!

487
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:05,940
Turn left!

488
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,240

489
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,500

490
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,020
Like this?

491
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,380
Back to the front!

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,540
was so

563
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,920
good

564
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,280
The power is more powerful than anything

565
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,260
If you all gather here

566
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:11,560
It's like a dream, the final energy

567
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,380
Tomorrow, the day after, believe in yesterday

568
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,840
Draw the universe, stand on the ground

569
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,380
The planet of Kameari will come to an end

570
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,420
This is good, right?

571
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,920
There's no reason to say it's good, right?
