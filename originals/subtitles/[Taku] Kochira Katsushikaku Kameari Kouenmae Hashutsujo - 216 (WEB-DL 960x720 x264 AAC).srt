1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:07,660
Unwanted Person"

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,240
When you watch TV,

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,860
make the room bright and look away.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:13,800
"The Unwanted Person"

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,580
Come to me, the unwanted person!

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,240
I'm worried.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,920
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,240
I'll be fine in a while.

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,320
Unemployed person

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,000
"The Unwanted Person"

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,660
Come to me, the unwanted person!

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,740
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,960
I'm not here, but I'm worried.

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,420
Look at the burning red clouds.

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,020
I'll be fine in a while.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,300
I'll be fine in a while.

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,320
I wonder if it'll work somehow

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,600
You know, right?

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,220
You know, you know!

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,720
If you know, then shut up and follow me!

22
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,720
Laser

23
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,200
Star

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,080
I did it! Spot on!

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,880
I can do it too!

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,880
Next, let's match it!

27
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,620
If you do this, you'll have more fire range!

28
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,200
Listen closely...

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,620
It will explode in a couple of hits!

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,520
Wow! As expected from Kankichi!

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,480
That's right, Tomo. I'm a genius!

32
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:20,820
Hey!

33
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,360
You guys are the ones who did this!

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,580
Tompei! Chikichi! Run away!

35
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,200
Hey, wait!

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,520
Wait!

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,680
The child shrine maiden is a middle school student this year.

38
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,500
It's all rusted.

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,740
It's dangerous if it breaks.

40
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,900
I've repaired it many times.

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,800
I'll order a new one next year.

42
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,940
There's a way to carry children in the temple.

43
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll hit you with a sword soon.

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,100
That's the silver bar of the Sukudaniya, isn't it?

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,420
That's what shortened the life of the shrine maiden.

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,500
What was he doing in the shrine?

47
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,160
Hey, Kankichi! The key is not locked!

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,080
Hmm...

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,340
I did it!

50
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,180
I got in first place!

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,340
Getting a date for the shrine maiden before Miyada...

52
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,220
...is such a relief!

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,780
I'll find a place for you tomorrow!

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,400
Here I am!

55
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,520
You pick one good place!

56
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,180
This is my place every year!

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,780
This is it!

58
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,560
No! This place is mine!

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:34,960
What is this?

60
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,460
Let go of me!

61
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,000
Let go of me!

62
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,720
Stop it!

63
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,180
Stop it!

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560
It's broken.

65
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,100
What should we do?

66
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,920
You fell because you pushed it.

67
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,800
No, it's Tonbei's fault.

68
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,300
It's your fault for trying to escape.

69
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,600
This is not the time to say that.

70
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,340
We have to do something about this.

71
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,140
It's broken, what should we do?

72
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,060
Is there a way?

73
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's exchange it with the eighth one.

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,960
What?

75
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,060
The eighth one is just like ours.

76
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,300
We can't find out if we take it back.

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,920
But the eighth one is quite big.

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,120
We can take it back by morning.

79
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
But it's too heavy for three people.

80
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,040
We can't take it back.

81
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,280
Are we still going to the Shrine?

82
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,360
Not yet.

83
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,360
Can we take a break?

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Our shoulders are about to break.

85
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,320
We can't.

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,880
We won't be there by morning.

87
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,740
We don't need to carry it for ten years.

88
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,100
That's right, it's a shortcut.

89
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,260
If we go through here, we can reach the Shrine.

90
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,920
The eighth Shrine is under the dodo.

91
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,880
But the train is not coming.

92
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,460
It's okay. It's still early for the start.

93
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,280
What?

94
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,000
It's a train!

95
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,620
It's a train!

96
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,260
Kakichi is lying!

97
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Hurry up!

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,880
The train can't cross!

99
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,700
Kakichi!

100
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,380
No! Jump into the river!

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Damn it! I had a hard time.

102
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,740
It was a festival after all.

103
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,240
You're doing something dangerous.

104
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,900
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,060
I want to tell you not to copy a good kid.

106
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,300
Speaking of festivals, when we were little, it was a big event.

107
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,160
It was fun.

108
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,180
I got my pocket money and searched for what I wanted under the acetylene lamp.

109
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,400
Acetylene lamp?

110
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,440
I don't know.

111
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,880
I don't think the Nakagawa and Reiko generation knows.

112
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,500
Instead of a light bulb, they use a lamp to light up a shop.

113
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,240
By the way, is there anyone who's too close and burns their hair?

114
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,320
The color and smell of that flame,

115
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,120
I still remember it well.

116
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,520
Ryo-chan is a festival lover.

117
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,460
Well, well.

118
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,480
By the way, what about the club president today?

119
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,320
It's the last day.

120
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,420
But later, he said he would come to the festival with Hiromi-san and Daisuke-kun.

121
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,860
By the way, Mr. Honda and Komachi-chan also said they would come.

122
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,100
We're busy with our work, but we're all going to the festival.

123
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:08,640
By the way, Mr. Honda and Kumachi-chan also said they would come.

124
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,820
By the way, didn't all of you say...

125
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,400
I think they're all going to come, too.

126
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,580
What!?

127
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,700
Then let's go get my friends to celebrate the festival.

128
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,900
Well...

129
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,760
It's going to be special, so we're going to celebrate it together.

130
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,180
Ryo-chan, it's fine, Ryo-chan.

131
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,800
I got used to being the one who plays the acetylene lamp,

132
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,780
But still.

133
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:20,980
Hahaha!

134
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,260
What's so busy about K-Law?

135
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,660
It's like we're back in our childhood.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,280
Don't worry about it, Ryo-chan.

137
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,700
Let's patrol by ourselves.

138
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,500
Yes!

139
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,100
Wow!

140
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,520
Awesome!

141
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,560
What's going on?

142
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,480
Listen, look closely.

143
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,880
Look!

144
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,480
It's 10 yen from here.

145
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:42,960
Wow!

146
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,540
What's going on?

147
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,180
That's amazing, old man!

148
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,120
Hahaha!

149
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,380
Show us more!

150
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,600
Show us, show us!

151
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:49,700
Show us!

152
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,300
Alright, alright.

153
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,860
Then take a good look.

154
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,780
What's going to be missing this time?

155
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,860
Hmm...

156
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,260
Wow!

157
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,560
I think that's...

158
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,020
Ah!

159
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,060
It's my wallet!

160
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,300
When did you get it?

161
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,160
That's a great trick!

162
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,120
That's not a trick.

163
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,500
It's a trick!

164
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,340
Excuse me, but can you show me again?

165
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,340
Huh?

166
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,060
Oh, Mr. Omawari!

167
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,340
I'm just a child.

168
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:18,960
I'm a child-loving boy.

169
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,360
Bye, kids!

170
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,960
Bye-bye, old man!

171
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,760
You're the best at eating like this, Anzahm!

172
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,500
That's awful!

173
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,220
Huh?

174
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,060
It's not what a police officer in a uniform does.

175
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,860
How is it?

176
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,000
It may be a poison to the primitive.

177
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,920
What?

178
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,740
Two Demekins?

179
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,600
What did you say?

180
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,800
It's exactly the same!

181
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,660
That flashy yukata is like a Demekin with goldfish.

182
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,640
Huh?

183
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,300
What?

184
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,240
I don't have any beauty-sense.

185
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,320
Huh?

186
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,980
I don't have any beauty-sense.

187
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,900
Ah, Senpai!

188
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,740
Good evening!

189
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,040
Ah, you're with Otohime, huh?

190
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,440
Ah, you two shouldn't get too close.

191
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,020
It's a poison to those who can't have a boyfriend.

192
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:01,780
What?

193
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,560
I don't want to be called a "poor, young man."

194
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,260
Hmm.

195
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,020
Nana, let's go to the shrine.

196
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,320
Yeah.

197
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,240
Huh?

198
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,420
Let's go to the shrine.

199
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,940
Daikichi, huh?

200
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,700
I'm so scared!

201
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,520
But...

202
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,060
I'm scared, too!

203
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,860
Ahaha!

204
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,980
Well, what should we eat next?

205
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,420
Grandma, two hot ones!

206
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,060
Sure!

207
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,840
You're working, but you're quite hungry.

208
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,720
Y-Yes, Chief!

209
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,340
Hey, Hiromi!

210
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,480
Good evening!

211
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,940
You've grown up, Daisuke!

212
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,460
Yeah!

213
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,100
You're just like Hiromi, Sakura.

214
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,360
You can't even look at a man who looks like you.

215
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,660
What?

216
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,260
You can't look at a man who looks like you.

217
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,500
Well, Chief, you're a little too young.

218
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,960
At the festival, a young man can have a lot of fun.

219
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,360
You're right, Papa.

220
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,480
Yeah, you're right.

221
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,140
Hey grandpa, let's count them.

222
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,240
And a tishtime!

223
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,160
Do you understand, Ryotsu?

224
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,300
The festival is the place for money.

225
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,060
Pay much attention.

226
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,100
Yes, I know that.

227
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
It seems that the chief is not a good fit for me.

228
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,440
Yeah, maybe he is.

229
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,920
Oh, come on!

230
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,020
Take your time!

231
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,540
Hurry up!

232
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,440
Geez!

233
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,240
Excuse me!

234
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,440
Be careful, man!

235
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,440
What's that?

236
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,920
Grandpa, let's go quickly!

237
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,340
Ah, yeah...

238
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,180
Could it be that guy...

239
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,880
No, that can't be.

240
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,160
It's Grandpa!

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,520
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

242
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,060
Let's go.

243
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,440
Oh, look, look.

244
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:33,780
I can't run.

245
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,360
Hey, wait, goldfish!

246
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,900
I'm gonna arrest you!

247
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,200
Wait a minute!

248
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,120
Hey!

249
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,740
I told you to stop!

250
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,540
You...

251
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,380
Come on!

252
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,380
You can't run away!

253
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,160
Hey!

254
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,380
I got you!

255
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,220
Oh!

256
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,040
No!

257
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,940
Nana-chan's manga character is on it.

258
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,660
Give me that!

259
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,840
No, no.

260
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,940
Mine is delicious.

261
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,220
I'll give you a bonus.

262
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,860
Three million yen.

263
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,520
Thank you.

264
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,120
It's a waste to eat.

265
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,480
Yeah.

266
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,060
Hmm?

267
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:09,960
That's weird.

268
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,140
Where did my wallet go?

269
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,320
There's no "Sai-sen-dorobou" here.

270
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,560
I'll take care of this place.

271
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,180
I have to save you all.

272
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,180
You are the only one who can do it.

273
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,300
I'll take care of it.

274
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,180
I'll see you here.

275
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,920
Thank you very much.

276
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,780
And thank you for your help.

277
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,080
You found me.

278
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,120
I'll keep Mr. Ichigo.

279
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,120
What's the number?

280
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,320
I'll give it to you the next time.

281
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,680
Good luck.

282
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,460
Thank you.

283
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:40,740
Huh?!

284
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,200
Well, are you good?

285
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,620
Calm down, Mr. Ichigo!

286
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,080
Well, you two, good luck!

287
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,420
Good luck to you, too.

288
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,460
Let's go!

289
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:47,480
Wait.

290
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:47,680
Huh?

291
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,520
My wallet has gone somewhere!

292
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,660
There's a 6-month-long deposit in that!

293
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,360
Senpai!

294
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,040
It's a suri.

295
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,100
Alright! Let's split up and catch it!

296
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,100
Yes!

297
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,380
I got a suri!

298
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,580
Papa, it's a suri!

299
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,040
What?

300
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,180
N-No way...

301
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,540
What? My wallet is gone! I got a suri!

302
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,480
What?

303
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,520
That means there's a criminal nearby!

304
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,520
That guy over there!

305
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,320
Hey! Wait!

306
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,080
You're not getting away!

307
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,800
You bastard!

308
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,880
You're a criminal!

309
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,460
You're under arrest!

310
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,760
Give me what you stole!

311
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,860
Hey, let go!

312
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,060
You're not getting away!

313
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,400
You rascal!

314
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
You're a rascal!

315
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,460
You're a rascal!

316
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,160
I'll get you!

317
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,700
I'll get you!

318
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,960
I'll get you!

319
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,980
Hey, boss!

320
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,140
Why are you getting a suri?

321
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,860
I'm not getting a suri!

322
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,700
You're running away!

323
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,660
I just wanted to go to the bathroom!

324
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:06,820
I...

325
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,720
I found it this time!

326
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,040
Wait, wait, wait!

327
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,680
I'm sorry!

328
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:17,960
I...

329
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,840
I lost it!

330
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,900
I think it came this way.

331
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,340
Where did it go?

332
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,680
Ryotsu.

333
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,360
Ouch!

334
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,080
What are you doing here?

335
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,680
Boss!

336
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,260
Didn't the suri come this way?

337
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,580
Suri?

338
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,260
No, I was looking at this shrine for a long time.

339
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,460
But no one came here.

340
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,700
Oh, I see.

341
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,260
That's strange.

342
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,980
Where did it go?

343
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,540
Hang on.

344
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,580
Look over there.

345
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,060
Yes, yes!

346
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,260
You can come out.

347
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,300
It's been a long time, Karasawa.

348
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,180
Mr. Ohara...

349
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,260
15 years.

350
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,200
No, I think it's longer.

351
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,160
Hiromi was a junior in elementary school.

352
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,820
Thank you for your help.

353
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sure you've made some progress.

354
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,680
Please give him my gratitude.

355
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,720
I'm very thankful to you for your kindness.

356
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,160
Mr. Hinamatsu I'm grateful to be a part of the hu census.

357
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,600
Thank you.

358
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,140
Thank you very much.

359
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,780
I'm so glad you came to our house.

360
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,940
I'll think of her more.

361
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,220
Thank you.

362
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,620
And thank you.

363
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:31,960
Thank you so much.

364
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,840
Good night, Takahashi.

365
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,680
Good night.

366
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,980
See you next time.

367
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,000
2

368
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,800
"Karasawa Masagoro"

369
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,700
That man is the high-ranking officer of the police, Karasawa Masagoro.

370
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,880
Ouch, papa!

371
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,820
No, don't hold me so tightly!

372
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,080
It hurts, Hiromi!

373
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,140
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

374
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
It's gone!

375
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,880
I can only arrest the high-ranking officer for that.

376
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,560
Oh, no.

377
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,020
Where did Karasawa go?

378
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,560
There he is!

379
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,040
One, two, three...

380
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,840
Oh, damn it!

381
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,420
It's gone!

382
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,920
Look, papa! Papa!

383
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,000
Papa?

384
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,400
That was close.

385
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,600
I saw it, Karasawa!

386
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,540
You!

387
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,900
You're the police!

388
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,500
It's time for you to take your revenge!

389
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,500
Dad!

390
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,260
Masaru!

391
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,700
There's something interesting over there!

392
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,100
I'm waiting!

393
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,820
Want to go see it?

394
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,580
Oh, yeah.

395
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,160
Later.

396
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,040
You go first.

397
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,200
Let's go right now, dad!

398
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,100
No, you go first!

399
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,140
Then, I'll go first.

400
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,880
Come right away, dad!

401
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,560
Thank you for your help.

402
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,780
It's a problem if the children see us.

403
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,720
Papa!

404
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,620
Look, look!

405
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,520
I did it!

406
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,200
I did it!

407
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,080
You did it, Hiromi!

408
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,840
I'm a little busy with this old man.

409
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,320
I'm a child, so I can wait alone.

410
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:18,760
Yeah.

411
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,840
See you later!

412
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,600
Karasawa, when you get out of the office, I'll be your guarantor.

413
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,800
If the children are cute, you'll get a good job.

414
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,880
Don't come back here, Karasawa.

415
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,620
You're never coming back.

416
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:51,920
Haruta!

417
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,640
You've done a good job.

418
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,800
You're all set.

419
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,240
I heard you want to come back tomorrow.

420
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,940
I'm glad.

421
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,520
You've got a new start.

422
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,880
Thank you.

423
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,400
Thank you very much.

424
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,480
I will never do that again.

425
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:12,980
Yeah.

426
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,180
You can't leave Masaru and your wife alone.

427
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,480
It's a promise.

428
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,900
At that time, Mr. Ohara's kindness was in my heart.

429
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,140
No, it's the source of his hard work.

430
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,320
What happened to your wife?

431
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,540
Two years ago, we were working together.

432
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,440
I was relieved.

433
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:34,960
I see.

434
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,540
I remembered something bad.

435
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,000
So, what now?

436
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,600
Masaru and his wife are in trouble.

437
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,400
Oh, that time.

438
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,940
Come back, dad.

439
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,860
But there's not much good things in the world.

440
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,000
Did something happen?

441
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,360
Masaru's company went bankrupt.

442
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,840
After his life became unstable,

443
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,840
I thought I had to take care of my unpaid salary.

444
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,920
I thought I had to take care of my unpaid salary.

445
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:04,940
I thought I had to take care of my unpaid salary.

446
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,920
But I didn't get a job.

447
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,400
And I couldn't stay at home.

448
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,780
I see.

449
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,860
Grandpa!

450
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,280
Oh, Daisuke.

451
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,020
Grandpa, buy us a robot.

452
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,400
We promised.

453
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
I know.

454
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,560
Later.

455
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,480
I'll go later.

456
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,460
Go to your mother's house.

457
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,340
Yes, I promise.

458
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,320
I'm his grandson, Daisuke.

459
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,040
And my little sister, Sakura.

460
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,600
We're brothers.

461
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,500
Masaru is my son.

462
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,980
Is Masaru's wife pregnant?

463
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,460
She's the only one.

464
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,060
They're about the same age.

465
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,760
Oh, I see.

466
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,240
That's cute.

467
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,140
It's true that you don't want to see your grandchild.

468
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,360
Just being with them makes you feel at ease.

469
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,460
But I can't buy anything for my grandchild's birthday.

470
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,880
Who do you think has the heart?

471
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,820
I just happened to see it.

472
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,480
I told the kids it was a handkerchief.

473
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,160
But it wasn't a handkerchief.

474
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,380
It was a handkerchief of a mule.

475
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,060
I understand that feeling.

476
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,200
But giving money and things isn't the only way to express your love for your grandchild.

477
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,480
Don't you think so?

478
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
Where did she go?

479
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,640
I can tell by looking at her face.

480
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,900
Nakagawa! Reiko!

481
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,180
Did you find the mule?

482
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,600
Kei-chan is looking for someone who looks like it.

483
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,300
I told her I saw it today.

484
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,620
There are too many people and I can't find it.

485
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,280
Nakagawa!

486
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,400
The mule was arrested by the police.

487
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,180
You can't escape or throw away your evidence wallet.

488
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,720
I understand.

489
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,880
I won't let you go.

490
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,120
More than money and things,

491
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,540
you need to follow the rules of the world.

492
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,380
You need to know what's good and what's bad.

493
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,200
You need to keep your promises.

494
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,260
Promises?

495
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,920
I'm always speaking seriously about my promise to you.

496
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,020
Thank you.

497
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,960
I'll never give it to you again.

498
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,080
Don't make your wife or Masaru cry.

499
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,820
I promise you.

500
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,880
Ohara...

501
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,780
I will not say anything more than this.

502
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,280
The key of the Sandra High School

503
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,560
Who is CEO Ohara speaking to?

504
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,900
What's the matter, Nakagawa?

505
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,500
Chief Ohara, who's He?

506
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,040
He's my friend, but he's...

507
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,780
A friend of the chief?

508
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,560
Kei...

509
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,260
Anyway, I've been yelling for you, but you're really here.

510
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,220
You're right!

511
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,280
Mr. Honda and Komachi's wallets were stolen, too.

512
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,560
You might be mistaken.

513
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,280
Try looking again.

514
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,640
Chief.

515
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,380
I'm sure he doesn't know where he put them because he's wearing a new yukata.

516
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,160
Yeah.

517
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,400
Nakagawa!

518
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,180
Tell the other victims to look again to see if their wallets were really stolen.

519
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,400
Y-Yes, sir.

520
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,160
I know.

521
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,940
No.

522
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,680
It's him!

523
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,940
Slimei, you're in trouble!

524
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,860
I got you!

525
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,260
You hid it here, didn't you?

526
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,680
Senpai!

527
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Look carefully!

528
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,020
This is my wallet!

529
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,780
It's mine!

530
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,920
Mine, too?

531
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,280
That's good.

532
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,540
What do you think? It's a fire that can't be moved!

533
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,320
Darn it!

534
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,920
Well done, Ryotsu.

535
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,620
Senpai!

536
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,160
Huh?

537
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,820
It's not just mine.

538
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:08,000
H-Hey!

539
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,660
Excuse me, sir!

540
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,040
Can I ask you something?

541
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,780
Naka-air!

542
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,100
sinners

543
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,900
There it is!

544
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,320
The money and the yuka are safe!

545
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,300
That's good!

546
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,980
But, chief, I...

547
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,100
What about me?

548
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,540
I said that it didn't matter a little bit, but it's not!

549
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,920
Right, Nakagawa?

550
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,920
Meaningless

551
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,640
It was my bad.

552
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:30,860
I'm very sorry.

553
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,380
It's nothing.

554
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,560
Oh, it's Grandpa!

555
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,700
Dad!

556
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,540
Grandpa!

557
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,140
You guys...

558
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,380
I'm glad. I was worried you wouldn't be quiet.

559
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,540
Masaru said he's always liked festivals, so he'd probably be here.

560
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,360
Dad, I've decided on a new job.

561
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,460
The conditions are better than before, and I'm getting really nervous.

562
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,540
I see. That's good.

563
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,060
Grandpa, Grandpa said he likes sushi today.

564
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,240
I see. I love sushi, too.

565
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,720
You're Tadashi?

566
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,640
Yes. I'm Tadashi, which means "honest and honest".

567
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,140
That's a good name.

568
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,940
Well, then, Mr. Ohara...

569
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,260
Bye-bye!

570
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,920
Grandpa!

571
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,280
I thought I saw him when I was little.

572
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,920
I think he's not here.

573
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,020
Oh, that's right. He's my old friend.

574
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,360
I don't like it.

575
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,240
The chief has a lot of tears in his eyes.

576
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,300
Well, he says there's no bad guy who likes festivals.

577
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,280
Ryotsu, you...

578
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,220
Idiot!

579
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,560
No matter how much you like festivals, you can't just leave work to a fool.

580
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,380
Hurry up and get that man to join you.

581
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,580
Yes, yes.

582
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,280
Let's go!

583
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,860
The End

584
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,140
♪ When I walked along the street ♪

585
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:15,580
♪ Looking back at the days of rain ♪

586
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,320
♪ That someone calls me ♪

587
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:24,200
I walked while looking back at the day after the rain

588
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,640
I was drawn to the gacha

589
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:34,460
I felt a strange feeling at that time

590
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,980
So I tried to walk only the black part of the Akegogai Tile

591
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,140
Everyone was a child once, but everyone has forgotten

592
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:00,520
A politician with a great face and a blue aunt above his eyes

593
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,960
Go up and see that corner

594
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,360
I can see everyone

595
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,100
There is a wall there

596
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,180
There must be a turtle

597
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,220
Everyone come to our town

598
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,360
Thank you!

599
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,340
Thank you for your support for a long time

600
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,660
This time I really became a police officer

601
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,320
Reiko, why do you work so hard for me?

602
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,400
Is it love for me?

603
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,420
Next time, goodbye Ryo

604
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,580
Reiko, marry me!

605
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,900
The last time, let 's meet again

606
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,480
I want to keep my family

607
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,820
The third child

608
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,440
Such a wonderful Spencer

609
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,900
My family is giving him a lot of love

610
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,100
Thank you so much

611
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,000
I'll leave

612
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,000
"I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love
