When I kicked the love stone, it flew to my shoes

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:41,660
I wonder if I should go to the gym that I was saving

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,740
I laughed at the fact that it was still a baby

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,900
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can only win

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,160
I have a cold and a cold, but I can't change a single nightmare

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,260
The cityscape is strangely gentle

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,540
From the water tank of the Tungari hat

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,320
The sun goes down to the Taishakuten

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,120
Tomorrow, I'll wear a hat

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:23,880
Tomorrow, I'll wear a hat

19
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,380
It's over

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,700
If I win, I'll be happy again

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,080
I lost it and realized

22
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,640
I'm an idiot

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:44,060
That's what happened while I was taking a break

24
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,540
Well, it's always like that

25
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,660
Senpai, what's wrong?

26
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,000
What's wrong?

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,340
Finally, it's a room

28
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,580
You can see no. 2 or no. 3 in Tokyo

29
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,260
I'll be satisfied this time

30
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,780
Is it an old movie theater, Ryo-chan?

31
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,940
Yes, not mine

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,320
When I was a kid, the movie was just as good as it can be

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,860
At that time, the movie theaters in Japan had several stars

34
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,800
But I remember this Orion's hadn't

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,000
Check this out

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Asakusa Rock

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,480
Asakusa Rock, a movie theater and industrial area that has built the era of Japanese photography through Meiji and Showa.

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,740
Since the opening of the electric theater in Meiji in 30, as the first movie theater in Japan,

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,280
many theaters have opened up like a flash.

40
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,980
When I was a child, movies were the golden age.

41
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,080
In this era when TV was not yet so popular, movies were truly the kings of entertainment.

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,460
This is a story of memories of that time with me and this Orion.

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,200
Don't be so rude, Kichi!

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,400
It's already the beginning!

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,440
I made it!

46
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,880
The brakes are not working!

47
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,460
If you pay for the movie tickets, you can't buy ice cream inside.

48
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,880
Let's use the same ticket.

49
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,580
Excuse me, one small ticket, please.

50
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,460
Yes.

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,160
Here you are.

52
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,740
Hey, wait a minute.

53
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,360
Why are you wearing a coat in summer?

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,620
I'm cold.

55
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,340
Then what's this inside?

56
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,420
Oh, no!

57
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,980
No, you're not!

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,200
There's no gap in the lower part.

59
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,960
I thought there was another one.

60
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,740
Where is it?

61
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,420
Oh, there it is!

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,700
Oh, it's here.

63
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,860
You're a jerk.

64
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,460
What?

65
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,860
Oh, no!

66
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,400
Ouch!

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,720
What are you doing to the customers?

68
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
You're wasting the ticket fee.

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Where are the customers?

70
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,940
I have no choice.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll pay the bill.

72
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,040
Kichi!

73
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,520
Of course.

74
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,960
I can't buy ice cream anymore.

75
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,180
It's okay.

76
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,220
I have seven tickets.

77
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,140
Seven tickets?

78
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,180
Damn it!

79
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,940
It's so cool inside.

80
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,320
This is the only place with a cooler.

81
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,560
It's crowded.

82
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,940
It's like a stand-in.

83
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,100
That's why I should have come earlier.

84
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,240
I'll look for an empty seat.

85
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,100
You guys go to the right.

86
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

87
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,600
It's crowded, after all.

88
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,800
It's not empty at all.

89
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,620
Yeah, not even one.

90
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,360
How about over there?

91
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,800
No, it's not open.

92
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,260
I can't help it.

93
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,140
Let's look at the front.

94
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,640
It's easier to sit down.

95
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,260
Yeah.

96
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
It's hard to see, but it's powerful.

97
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,260
It's heavy.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,440
Huh?

99
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,620
I didn't know you liked movies so much.

100
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,360
What?

101
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
There were no TV games back then,

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,080
and there were a lot of houses without TV.

103
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,140
All kinds of kids went to the movie theater.

104
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,080
And when it comes to movie theaters,

105
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,640
Ramune's bottle is the best.

106
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,480
What?

107
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,740
What is that?

108
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,400
Ramune's bottle has a B-ball in it.

109
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,600
You break that and take it out.

110
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,500
But why a movie theater?

111
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,620
Movie theaters are usually in the low end.

112
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,860
The rolling bottles come in front.

113
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,160
You put it in your feet like this.

114
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,080
When the kids were young,

115
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,920
they all broke their bottles when they got bored of movies.

116
00:05:59,380 --> 00:05:59,900
What?

117
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,560
Are they doing it while they're filming?

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,520
Yeah.

119
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
When adults notice it,

120
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,860
they quit for a while,

121
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,140
but it starts again soon.

122
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,320
And then the movie theater finally gave them a prize.

123
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,060
After that, they stopped breaking them,

124
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,580
but even the smart guy who brought them

125
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,080
to the bottles that were falling on the street came out.

126
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,280
He's your senior, isn't he?

127
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:18,820
Yeah.

128
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:18,980
Anyway,

129
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,840
he was saying that he had the best memory.

130
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,240
Yeah.

131
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,760
That was one day of the time

132
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,460
when children were like that.

133
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,320
What?

134
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,500
Oh, lord!

135
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,720
Ramune!

136
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,300
Isn't that great?

137
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,680
Who is it?

138
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,060
There is no one here.

139
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,660
Go for it, lord.

140
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,940
Almost there.

141
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm back, Samurai Kintaro.

142
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,880
What?

143
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,080
What?

144
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,580
Kintaro!

145
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,660
Kintaro on the left!

146
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,460
Ah!

147
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,980
Kintaro on the right!

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,460
Damn it!

149
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,700
It was almost done!

150
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,620
Don't do anything stupid!

151
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,740
Hey!

152
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,760
You're in my way!

153
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,140
I can't see!

154
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,240
Damn it!

155
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,900
Let go of me!

156
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,700
Let go of me!

157
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,420
It's all his fault!

158
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,160
What the hell did you do?

159
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,700
No!

160
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,900
No!

161
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,540
No!

162
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:14,840
No!

163
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,000
No!

164
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,880
Hey!

165
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,360
You're here again!

166
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,680
You're so annoying!

167
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,980
You're so annoying!

168
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,740
You're so annoying!

169
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,580
You're so annoying!

170
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,020
This way!

171
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,300
Take this!

172
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,780
Three, four!

173
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,300
No!

174
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,860
Three, four!

175
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,140
Six, seven!

176
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,160
You're like a mouse!

177
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,560
Six, seven!

178
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,640
Six!

179
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,680
Yes!

180
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,080
Eight!

181
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,200
Six, seven!

182
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,860
Six, seven!

183
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,160
Oh, my God!

184
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,980
Six, seven!

185
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,200
- Hey! - Don't get our asses kicked!

186
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,620
No!

187
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,140
Hold it right there!

188
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,780
Hey!

189
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,400
What's going on?

190
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,740
It's all your fault!

191
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,200
It's all your fault!

192
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,080
It's all your fault!

193
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,120
I can't let anyone who doesn't watch movies come to the theater.

194
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,800
Get out of here.

195
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:19,940
What?

196
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,020
What's up, Hikaru?

197
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,600
Dad.

198
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,740
Huh? Kankichi-kun Kane?

199
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,760
Huh?

200
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,460
The guy from Tsukudaniya, Gin-san.

201
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,340
Why do you know my name?

202
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,120
You've been watching movies with Gin-san since you were little, right?

203
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,300
I remember you.

204
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,620
How about it?

205
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,220
Shall we go see it?

206
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,260
What?

207
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:40,980
Are you sure?

208
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,460
It's your first time in a movie theater, right?

209
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,140
Dad.

210
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,360
Don't say that.

211
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,680
It's a movie with a lot of people.

212
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,260
This is the movie theater.

213
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,940
Wow!

214
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,580
Wow!

215
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,280
You can shoot with this machine?

216
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,340
It's so hot.

217
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,860
The lamp heat of the movie theater is so high.

218
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,020
I'm heating it with this carbon duct, but it's still hot.

219
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,120
Summer is a hell of a heat.

220
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,460
Why are there two of the same machine?

221
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,260
I cut the film.

222
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,160
Switch?

223
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:12,900
Yes.

224
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,940
Kintaro-san.

225
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,560
It's about time.

226
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,940
Can you say that?

227
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,540
Watch it from here.

228
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,460
Yes.

229
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,380
You have to go.

230
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,200
I can see the screen.

231
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,640
It's like a special seat.

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,740
Watch it.

233
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,780
The mark is on the right end of the screen.

234
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,680
It's a disaster.

235
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,600
It's true.

236
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,900
Switch with the second mark.

237
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,780
Oh, now this one is moving.

238
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,320
Oh, it was like this.

239
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,700
It takes about 13 minutes to shoot in one film.

240
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,880
It takes about 7 hours.

241
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,220
Hey, Hikaru, roll this.

242
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,880
Then, this is one film.

243
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,600
Don't touch it.

244
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,700
Are you kidding me?

245
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,120
But, it's amazing.

246
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,160
You're still a junior high school student, right?

247
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,420
I'm still a half-person.

248
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,780
I help the children during summer vacation.

249
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,460
If you let me do it, I can do it, too.

250
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,880
That's right.

251
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:04,900
Hm?

252
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:05,980
Oh.

253
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,160
You're late.

254
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,440
It's about time for the next film.

255
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,340
The next film?

256
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,760
I'm holding a film in a few pieces.

257
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,400
What?

258
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,020
I'll shift the screening time in order, and take the finished film to the next movie theater.

259
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,060
Oh, it'll be hard if you don't make it in time.

260
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,700
Yes.

261
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,540
I'll have to wait for the audience in the middle of the movie.

262
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,500
Oh, here it comes.

263
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
I'll go get the film, so please take care of the rest.

264
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,860
Yes.

265
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,420
Oh, the film's broken.

266
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,140
What?

267
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,320
Oh, the fire.

268
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,660
What's going on?

269
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,720
What are you doing?

270
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,780
The audience is starting to fight.

271
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,620
Don't you know what I'm doing?

272
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,800
You have to connect the film quickly.

273
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,060
I'll do that later.

274
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,760
What?

275
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,940
Don't let the audience wait for you.

276
00:10:59,380 --> 00:10:59,820
Okay.

277
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,780
That's good.

278
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,800
That's good.

279
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,880
Are you okay?

280
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,980
Yes, I'm fine.

281
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,140
I'm glad.

282
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,340
The background scenes will make the dialogue go well.

283
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,820
It's hard, isn't it?

284
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,340
You have to do that?

285
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,640
Not at all.

286
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,500
I love movies.

287
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,560
There are a lot of people who are struggling in a place we don't know.

288
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,080
Yes.

289
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,700
But we're just watching them.

290
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,900
Dad.

291
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:43,980
Yes?

292
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,560
Why did you put them in the movie theater?

293
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,220
They like movies.

294
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,500
If they like movies, they want to see the movie theater.

295
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,600
But...

296
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,120
What?

297
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,240
That's strange.

298
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,640
The directors should have gone home.

299
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,400
Is there still someone in there?

300
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,680
You guys.

301
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,420
I was going to clean up the bottle I spilled earlier.

302
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,920
I'm sorry I made a fuss.

303
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,700
Hikaru.

304
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,520
This is how we got along with Hikaru.

305
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,660
Next time, the young man will become a star.

306
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,280
The End

307
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,400
So we went to Orion Island.

308
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,060
Did you go to see the movie every day?

309
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,840
Of course, I just went in from the back door.

310
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,320
I talked to Hikaru about movies every day.

311
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,660
I like Tokijiro Kutsukage of Raizo.

312
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,540
I also liked Hiraio Saburo.

313
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,180
Kikuchi is good at historical stories.

314
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,620
I've been coming to the hut since I was three.

315
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,680
I came every day, so I remembered the lines.

316
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,300
Oh, this is next week.

317
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,000
But the works change every week, so it's hard.

318
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,880
You have to remember the title properly.

319
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,780
This is called a sewing machine.

320
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,560
See, the movement is like a sewing machine that sends a thread.

321
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,720
It's true.

322
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,480
The volume is 2 seconds per second.

323
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,540
It's a 24-frame movie.

324
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,800
So the movie machine is showing the movie while blinking 24 times per second.

325
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,820
Wow.

326
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,640
What is your dream?

327
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,700
I want to be a film director.

328
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,180
I don't have a qualification as a film director yet, so I can only do a little.

329
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,820
But I want to get a qualification and enter a film company.

330
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,700
And my dream is to be a director.

331
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,580
What? A film director?

332
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,160
Yes.

333
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,520
I want to make a film in a movie theater all over Japan.

334
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,520
Wow.

335
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,640
A director can only be a smart person.

336
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,900
Yes.

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,160
My father said that if you go to a good university, you will be a good student.

338
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,600
A film director?

339
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,860
Yo! Start!

340
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,100
I have a big dream for me who is living a normal life.

341
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,560
I'm not old at all.

342
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,200
But Hikaru is a man who has always been a grown-up.

343
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,700
When the summer vacation was coming to an end, a big thing happened.

344
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,980
You don't say?

345
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,980
You are going to do a film?

346
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,740
Yes.

347
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,280
I suddenly got a fever this morning.

348
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,220
If I asked a doctor to come ...

349
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,900
No, you will be ill.

350
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,720
It's almost the first screening time.

351
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,320
Well, if you call for help, it's okay.

352
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,760
I'll do it on my own.

353
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,540
You?

354
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,460
Yes.

355
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,160
But you are ...

356
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,820
I understand, father.

357
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,480
You'll be safe for a while.

358
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,660
But, teacher, today is the first day...

359
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,080
Father, I'll do it for you.

360
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,020
S-silly. I'm still a criminal.

361
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,180
It's okay, father. Leave it to me.

362
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,980
I can't help it. I'll ask the doctor for help.

363
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,940
Yes.

364
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,480
Anyway, let's see what's going on.

365
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,400
Hikaru, we heard what you said.

366
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,060
We'll help you.

367
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,940
Thank you.

368
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,620
There are already a lot of customers.

369
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,160
It's time for the screening.

370
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,960
Hikaru.

371
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,500
Then, Kankichi, ring the buzzer.

372
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,400
Yes.

373
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,800
This one.

374
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,460
Tonpei, turn off the lights.

375
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,460
Roger.

376
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,360
Turn off the lights.

377
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,520
Chinkichi, open the curtain.

378
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,640
I'll be waiting.

379
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,220
Turn off the light on the screen.

380
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:18,760
Okay.

381
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,180
I'm ready.

382
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,220
Now, let's go.

383
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:25,800
Yes.

384
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,780
Let's go.

385
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:27,840
Let's go.

386
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,700
Let's go.

387
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,880
Okay.

388
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,780
Ta-da, let's go.

389
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,560
This is it.

390
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,880
Let's go.

391
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
It's good.

392
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,640
I'm ready to go.

393
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,460
Rensui, ready.

394
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,320
The End

395
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,860
That way!

396
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,580
Don't just watch movies!

397
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,740
Get the film back!

398
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,300
I'm in trouble.

399
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,340
What's wrong, Hikaru?

400
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,260
The sequel isn't here yet.

401
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,900
What? There's only one more?

402
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

403
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,420
It went well, but if the rest of the film didn't come...

404
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,100
I'll go on the way.

405
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,540
Kankichi!

406
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,840
I'll go on the way.

407
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,740
It's the usual order, but the film's already here.

408
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,500
I'll go on the way.

409
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,140
This is the last reel.

410
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,260
If the film doesn't arrive in 13 minutes,

411
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,400
the movie will be cut in the best part.

412
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,680
Then the movie will be cut in the worst part.

413
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,420
What? 20 minutes ago?

414
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,800
Yeah.

415
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,880
If the movie goes on for 5 minutes,

416
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,460
the film won't arrive in Orion Island.

417
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,160
What's happening?

418
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:27,980
The End

419
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,620
The End

420
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,040
The End

421
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,960
Where did it go?

422
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,620
No way...

423
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,480
Are you okay?

424
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,140
It looks like the leg bone is broken.

425
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,100
The ambulance is here!

426
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,380
Old man!

427
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,020
It came from Orion Island. Where's the film?

428
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,180
You're in the way!

429
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,300
Everyone's waiting!

430
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,360
Old man, where's the film?

431
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,360
Please...

432
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,440
Leave it to me, old man!

433
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,820
Hey, what time is it now?

434
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,860
It's past 10:05.

435
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,500
We're not done yet!

436
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,000
Only 5 minutes left.

437
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,580
Episode 2: "Ne Efendimiz"

438
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,460
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

439
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,480
Sorry, sorry!

440
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,400
Oh yeah, the Sandlot....

441
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,720
No way!

442
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,740
It's a mattoon this time!

443
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,480
Damn it! It took too long to get back!

444
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,660
It's a curve again!

445
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,920
Here! Here!

446
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Now it's construction time!

447
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,760
I can't stop!

448
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,080
I can't stop!

449
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,920
The film!

450
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,020
Wait! Wait for me!

451
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,160
I really don't have time!

452
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,960
The mud man?

453
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,480
No! I don't have time!

454
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:03,240
We don't have a minute left.

455
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,900
What's he doing?

456
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,480
What's up with Kankichi?

457
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,280
The mud man is going to end up in a good place!

458
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,220
Hikaru!

459
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,680
The mud man!

460
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,200
It's me!

461
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
Kankichi! Where's the film?

462
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,200
Here!

463
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,560
Hikaru! Take this!

464
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,520
Thank you, Kankichi!

465
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,180
It's a sign!

466
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:53,280
We made it!

467
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,600
We made it!

468
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,040
It's okay.

469
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,780
It's okay.

470
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,080
It's okay.

471
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,020
It's okay.

472
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,420
It's okay.

473
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,000
It's okay.

474
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,380
Good~

475
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,640
Good~

476
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,460
Good~

477
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,580
Haha~

478
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,100
In the end, Aesaki was automated and he lost his qualification as a film master.

479
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,720
Since that, he doesn't get along with Hikaru anymore.

480
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,720
What happened to him after that?

481
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,320
He became the director.

482
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,440
He is still doing well in his paprika.

483
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,600
Also,

484
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,860
- Well, let's go, senpai. - Huh? Where?

485
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,320
Where? The last screening of "Orionza", right, Ryo-chan?

486
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,600
That's right.

487
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,100
Thank you very much for coming to the last screening of "Orionza".

488
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:02,880
The movie we're going to watch today is a nostalgic movie that was decided by everyone's request.

489
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,260
Please enjoy the movie until the end.

490
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,880
Huh? Huh?

491
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,160
I love movies.

492
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:31,300
Te-ten is decided, then the flicker is picketed, then the movement is heaped,

493
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:39,700
then everything is combined, then a great power is flying.

494
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:50,760
Here's the last energy like a dream, for everyone.

495
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,020
Tomorrow, tomorrow

496
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,460
Tomorrow, tomorrow

497
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,000
Tomorrow, tomorrow

What? It's alive?

504
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,840
Then take it to Ryugu Castle!

505
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,160
Wait a minute, grandpa!

506
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,960
I'm not a real turtle,

507
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,000
and I don't know where Ryugu Castle is!

508
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,720
Next time, "The Return of the Turtle"!

509
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,260
Thank you!
