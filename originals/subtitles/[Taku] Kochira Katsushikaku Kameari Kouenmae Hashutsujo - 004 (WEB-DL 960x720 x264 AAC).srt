00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,760
I'll have it charged for 20,000 yen in 5 hours on this precious day.

52
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,920
What's with the cup noodles?

53
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,380
They're on payday.

54
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,360
Damn it.

55
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,380
Hey, this guy has been acting since summer!

56
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,200
You're a thief, aren't you?

57
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,440
Thank you for your hard work.

58
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,920
You don't need it.

59
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,080
The thief will be delivered to the police.

60
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,940
This is the Japanese common sense.

61
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,340
If you come to the police station later, you'll get a reward.

62
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,640
I'll give you a bowl of noodles.

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,980
You don't need it.

64
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,820
That was close.

65
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,760
It's a survival before payday.

66
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,420
Even a cup noodle is a precious food.

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,220
That's not good.

68
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,580
It's too bad.

69
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,640
What are you doing?

70
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,380
I'm looking for the prize for the lottery.

71
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,720
We bought 40 of them.

72
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,920
Really?

73
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,320
You're not even in a hurry.

74
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,900
You should learn from your mistakes.

75
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,800
You're a Japanese soldier.

76
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,780
What?

77
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,680
I'm not an idiot.

78
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,580
I'm not a Japanese soldier.

79
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,900
Then you're a Bosnian.

80
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,820
You're not a Bosnian.

81
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,800
You're a Bosnian.

82
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,760
You're a Bosnian.

83
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,740
You're a Bosnian.

84
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,420
You're a Bosnian.

85
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,060
You're a Bosnian.

86
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,320
You're a Bosnian.

87
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,500
through.

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,740
You're a Bosnian.

89
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,300
You're all rascals.

90
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,900
You're all rascals.

91
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,660
You're all rascals.

92
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,900
You're all rascals.

93
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
You're all rascals.

94
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,100
You're all rascals.

95
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,200
You're all rascals.

96
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,880
You're all rascals.

97
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
-Let's look it up. -I see.

98
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,380
There are four left.

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,380
This is...

100
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,020
wrong.

101
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,820
You're thinking the wrong way!

102
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,740
Work according to your expectations!

103
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,340
Ignore, ignore.

104
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,160
Everything's wrong.

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,940
Of course.

106
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,780
There's no one like you.

107
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,860
The Goddess of Fortune is...

108
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,060
Right.

109
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,360
Maybe the same lottery was left last year.

110
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
Did you look it up?

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,740
This book has the lottery numbers of the year.

112
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,940
I see.

113
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,580
It's the first one.

114
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,400
The reason why I hate lottery is...

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,820
because the winner hides it.

116
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,340
Not even one, not even two.

117
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,340
Not even three.

118
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,140
It's worth 3 million yen!

119
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,500
By the way, in Japan,

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,380
the media is always like this.

121
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,920
They don't announce the winner.

122
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
It's the fault of the Japanese.

123
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,020
Hey, chief.

124
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,700
It's not good to be quiet even though you're getting it.

125
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,620
That's right.

126
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,740
If you go there, the one who plays pachinko and kiba is good.

127
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,940
Whether you get it or not, your emotions will come out honestly.

128
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,860
Pyo-chan, you lost the pachinko today, didn't you?

129
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,580
Shut up!

130
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,260
It's the luck of time.

131
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,580
Chief.

132
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,800
How was the lottery?

133
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,600
It was...

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,560
It was...

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,500
I think we should talk about the lottery.

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's talk about Bosnia and Herzegovina.

137
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,600
Chief.

138
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,360
Are you hiding something?

139
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,760
Nothing.

140
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,020
I see.

141
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,080
The way the winner acts is...

142
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,340
First, he suddenly becomes silent as soon as he gets it.

143
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,820
Second, he turns the topic around and stops talking about the lottery.

144
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,820
Chief, please show me the lottery.

145
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,180
I got it wrong.

146
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
If you got it wrong, can I see it?

147
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,440
No, no, no.

148
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,340
I'm sorry.

149
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,420
I'm sorry.

150
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,540
I'm more suspicious when you're not sure.

151
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,220
I'm not sure.

152
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm saying I got it wrong because I got it wrong.

153
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,880
I'm sure he's talking about it.

154
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,680
I feel like I'm not sure.

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,720
What?

156
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,060
No.

157
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,380
Then, please break it right now.

158
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,180
What?

159
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,860
You're not sure, right?

160
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,900
If you're not sure, I'll break it.

161
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,020
No, I'm collecting the lottery.

162
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,800
When did you start doing that?

163
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,260
Your eyes are lying.

164
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,060
Show me.

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,400
What are you doing?

166
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,080
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

167
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,740
I'm going to break it.

168
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,580
Why are you lying?

169
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,760
I'm going to break it.

170
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,200
Are you okay, Ryo?

171
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:23,860
Senior.

172
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,380
What I did just now was not worth 100,000 or 200,000 yen.

173
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,360
I called it a considerable amount.

174
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,320
Hey, give me your book.

175
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,140
Yes.

176
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,760
Which lottery did you buy?

177
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,340
It's the same as this year.

178
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,200
This one.

179
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,200
Good.

180
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,400
Read the prize money.

181
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,640
Read it from below.

182
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,160
I'll give you a chance.

183
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:47,800
Here.

184
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,400
5 pieces, 500,000 yen.

185
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,340
Wrong.

186
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,700
4 pieces, 1,000,000 yen.

187
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,820
This is also wrong.

188
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:01,860
Next.

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,660
3 pieces, 3,000,000 yen.

190
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,620
I got it!

191
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,140
I got 3,000,000 yen!

192
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,500
Wrong!

193
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,800
A small citizen like you will be surprised.

194
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,500
You will definitely get 3,000,000 yen.

195
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,760
Wrong.

196
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,400
I got it wrong.

197
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,120
The bank will not give you a check for a prize of more than 1,000,000 yen.

198
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,960
The prize will be given today.

199
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,780
If you don't go to the store today, it will be invalid.

200
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,240
Ujiho.

201
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,480
I'm sorry.

202
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,920
Let's go to drink.

203
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,080
Until 0:00 AM.

204
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,480
I'm sorry.

205
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,840
I actually got 3,000,000 yen.

206
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,040
You did it, chief.

207
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,240
But I didn't do anything wrong.

208
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,720
I didn't hide anything.

209
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,940
I see.

210
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,100
It's the bad habit of Japanese people who don't do anything wrong.

211
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,860
Seriously.

212
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,640
You should show your happiness with your body like an outsider.

213
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,300
Like this.

214
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,200
I got the lottery!

215
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,080
I won!

216
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,240
I won!

217
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,460
I won!

218
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:13,900
Woo-hoo!

219
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,840
That's right!

220
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,920
Gattemo's Gacaret!

221
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,200
Woo-hoo!

222
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,400
Good!

223
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,380
Well, that's how much I would like you to show your happiness.

224
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,580
I got it.

225
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,060
You're not really an outsider!

226
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,020
I will call the family medicine bureau and let them know you won.

227
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,700
Look.

228
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,660
I found out you got the lottery by chance, didn't I?

229
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,380
You are like a great golfing player.

230
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,540
Is it common sense to party and celebrate?

231
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,280
The common sense is to celebrate together.

232
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,600
But...

233
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,620
Or were you going to save three million?

234
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,080
I didn't mean that...

235
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,440
Then leave it to me.

236
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,300
Oh, I'm Ryotsu, the head of the park.

237
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,400
I'm going to hold a party for 200 people tonight.

238
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,340
Please prepare a special shabu-shabu.

239
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,860
Shabu-shabu?

240
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,920
Hey!

241
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,720
I'll go and inform the office directly.

242
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,600
R-Ryotsu!

243
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,820
I was lucky to win the lottery, but...

244
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,380
It was unlucky that Ryo-chan was there.

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,060
Is the club president off today?

246
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,820
It's been a long time since the day after that day.

247
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,680
It's about time to get better.

248
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm sure he was shocked.

249
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,340
Senpai, you're overdoing it.

250
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,020
You should have stopped with the shabu-shabu.

251
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,120
You have to set it up until 8 o'clock.

252
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,600
The club president is coming!

253
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,420
What?

254
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,260
Good morning.

255
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,320
I'm sorry to bother you.

256
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,740
How much did the party cost?

257
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,160
Not a penny.

258
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,460
Sorry, I won't talk about that anymore.

259
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,160
I'm getting hot again.

260
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,380
Anyway, I've been addicted to the lottery since you were there.

261
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,280
What?

262
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,740
The American lottery.

263
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,400
What is it?

264
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,720
You have to choose 6 numbers from 1 to 51 and you'll get it.

265
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,620
The prize is 5.5 billion yen.

266
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,060
5.5 billion yen?

267
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,140
I'm so housewife.

268
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,240
Of course, I know.

269
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,400
But how can it be that easy?

270
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,280
But as Ryo-chan said, perhaps there's a law in the past.

271
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,420
He collected the statistics from 5 years.

272
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,160
And he's also been to the lecturer's studio.

273
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,460
He's in charge of theicios combination of numbers.

274
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,000
He's up to no good except with his work.

275
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,260
You finally came out, Lady.

276
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,080
Why you.

277
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,340
He's making fun of the lottery ticket, but he's still buying it.

278
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,280
Don't say such a hard thing.

279
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,840
You're worth 5.5 billion yen.

280
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,660
Ryo, we got a notification from overseas.

281
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,960
Okay, I'll keep giving you a prize until you win.

282
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,380
Chief, you want a bite of 5.5 billion yen?

283
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,640
No, it's okay.

284
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,380
Chiefs should follow the dream of living in Japan.

285
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:22,560
I hope so.

286
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,720
Is it right?

287
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,080
The number of the last lottery was...

288
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,540
2, 16, 17...

289
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,980
It's correct so far.

290
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,180
Next is 23, 2, 34...

291
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,500
It's correct!

292
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,580
No, I'm just happy so far.

293
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,280
I'll let you down later.

294
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,160
I knew it.

295
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,100
I chose the 4-5 curve,

296
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,780
but why didn't I choose 45?

297
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,940
Why didn't I choose 45?

298
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,960
Could 45 be...

299
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,380
Could it be...

300
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,740
45...

301
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,160
I got it.

302
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,680
I got 5.5 billion yen.

303
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,720
I did it!

304
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,180
Even so, the lottery is amazing.

305
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,280
The prize money is 5.5 billion yen.

306
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,000
Right, Ryo-san?

307
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,620
What?

308
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,200
What's wrong with you?

309
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,480
What's up?

310
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,740
Your face is pale.

311
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,360
Comforting one's own body, because it's cold,

312
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,060
he has a fever.

313
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,320
On the other hand, how is it?

314
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,520
What about Lotokuji?

315
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,440
What? What do you mean?

316
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,260
You were looking up Lotokuji's number, weren't you?

317
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,020
Surprising!

318
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,900
Anyway, let's talk about the compensation.

319
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,540
Huh?

320
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,600
Well, the winner's behavior is probably...

321
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,200
...to change the topic and not talk about the lottery.

322
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,540
What about Lotokuji, Ryotsu?

323
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,460
Well, leave that to me.

324
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,160
I'm on duty, so please don't talk to me for a while.

325
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,060
And you suddenly become silent and talk to me.

326
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:26,900
Hmm?

327
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,640
I don't like it.

328
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,620
I'm not a talkative person.

329
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,340
I got you.

330
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,980
What do you mean?

331
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,220
What?

332
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,460
You got me, didn't you?

333
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,280
What do you mean?

334
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,240
You got me, Lotokuji.

335
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,340
You got me for 5.5 billion yen.

336
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm sorry.

337
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,400
You got me.

338
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
You're exactly the same number as the number you chose.

339
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,700
Huh?

340
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,260
Hey, Nakagawa!

341
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,780
You're so annoying.

342
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,220
You're so dirty!

343
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,960
But we were thinking about winning together, weren't we?

344
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,820
Stop it, Ryo.

345
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,940
You got me.

346
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,440
What did you mean by that?

347
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,360
Come on.

348
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,180
Myложro...

349
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,400
You got a lot of money, Ryo.

350
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,040
I got 6,500 million yen.

351
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,240
I think you're good.

352
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:29,500
I do, too.

353
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,880
I'm glad.

354
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,140
I'm glad...

355
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,520
I'm glad...

356
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,860
That's all.

357
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,300
It was a good game.

358
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,920
Thanks.

359
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm going to win the prize!

360
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,720
I'm going to win the prize!

361
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,760
I'm going to win the prize!

362
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,640
Give me chocolate!

363
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,160
You're not as lucky as I thought.

364
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,560
I'm not as lucky as I thought.

365
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,000
Look at that.

366
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,900
I'm going to win the prize!

367
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,920
I'm going to win the prize!

368
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,800
Give me chocolate!

369
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,900
Give me chocolate!

370
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,160
It's rare to see someone so proud.

371
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,920
It's rare to see someone so proud.

372
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,140
I hope you're happy.

373
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,440
I'll let the media know.

374
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,940
I'll let the media know.

375
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,320
Please wait!

376
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,680
Please wait!

377
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,600
I told you to let everyone know.

378
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,160
I told you to let everyone know.

379
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,200
I told you to let everyone know.

380
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,020
That's right.

381
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,980
I want you to be nice to Japanese people.

382
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,280
I want you to be nice to Japanese people.

383
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,320
Hello, this is the exit of the Kameari Park.

384
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,400
Hello, this is the exit of the Kameari Park.

385
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,000
Then, I'll be in trouble tomorrow.

386
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,740
Then, I'll be in trouble tomorrow.

387
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,100
Then, I'll be in trouble tomorrow.

388
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,860
Hey, Ryo!

389
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,560
You're popular overnight.

390
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,340
Damn it!

391
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,500
I thought I was a fool and fell in love with you.

392
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,060
I got a letter from Kou.

393
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,580
What?

394
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,480
It's from MK from Chiba.

395
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,480
It's from MK from Chiba.

396
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,240
You're the only one who has 5.5 billion yen.

397
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,640
You're the only one who has 5.5 billion yen.

398
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,420
You're the only one who has 5.5 billion yen.

399
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,040
Don't fight!

400
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,720
Don't fight!

401
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:20,980
Don't fight!

402
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,360
Don't fight!

403
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,260
Don't fight!

404
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,140
Kouma...

405
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,880
Kouma...

406
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,060
Kouma...

407
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,440
Kouma...

408
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:27,540
You're my wife.

409
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,180
I've been waiting for you.

410
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,020
You're my wife.

411
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,640
You're my wife.

412
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,160
You're my wife.

413
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,540
You'll always love me!

414
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,720
You'll always love me!

415
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,220
That's right! I'm going to marry Ryo-sama!

416
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,260
Wait a minute, Komachi!

417
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,860
Don't worry, Naoko!

418
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm going to marry Ryo-sama!

419
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,560
Ryo-chan was the number one man who didn't want to marry in the office until yesterday.

420
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,520
Shut up!

421
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,720
If you want to marry, you'd better spend 5.5 billion yen!

422
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,180
What did you say?

423
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,260
You're being rude!

424
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,320
Beep!

425
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,100
Hey, Ryo-chan, do something!

426
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,900
Ryo-chan!

427
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,300
If you don't go out, this party will be over!

428
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,120
You guys!

429
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,600
Get out of here!

430
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:24,280
I haven't received 5.5 billion yen yet, so I don't have any comments!

431
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,780
But...

432
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,520
Don't make excuses!

433
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,140
That's right!

434
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,580
I'll answer to you if I get the money.

435
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,200
I'll also announce how to use it.

436
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,360
So everyone, go home today!

437
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,080
Go home!

438
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,240
See you!

439
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,480
Bye-bye!

440
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,300
Good-bye!

441
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,000
What?

442
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,820
Yeah!

443
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,000
Okay!

444
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,160
I got it!

445
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,040
What's wrong?

446
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,340
There was an ad from America.

447
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,360
The ad is 5.5 billion yen!

448
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:55,820
What?

449
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,920
You have a loud voice!

450
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,880
You can get it on the media!

451
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,580
Is it a newscast for the media?

452
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,300
Of course!

453
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,460
Anyway, I'll go get it!

454
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,640
I'll leave the rest to you!

455
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,040
Okay!

456
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,280
But don't worry!

457
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,020
You can take it!

458
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:20,780
You got this!

459
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,160
I-I'll bring it!

460
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah!

461
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,580
Wait, I'll go get it!

462
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,460
Wait, I-I-I can't!

463
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,600
A-An ad...?

464
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,300
Of course, I can't...

465
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,340
Wait, I-I don't think it's a newscast.

466
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,640
Other mages, you just keep saying the same thing, don't you?

467
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,460
Maybe you're just playing games!

468
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,420
A bad ad, huh?

469
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:36,960
I won't wait until you give me the money.

470
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,940
-What's this? -This is a branded product I ordered for 3 million yen.

471
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,160
Hahaha!

472
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,520
Master, this is not a branded product but a branded product.

473
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,220
Haha!

474
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
-Sanzai-yu! -I'm sorry.

475
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,720
Let me introduce you.

476
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,280
This is Sato, who will be working as my staff today.

477
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,820
I'm Sato. I look forward to working with you.

478
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,980
Hello, I'm Nakagawa.

479
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,700
I'm Reiko.

480
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,700
I'm Ohara, the head of the club.

481
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,380
By the way, you always take care of Nakagawa and Reiko.

482
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,800
I'm sorry I don't have much, but please take it.

483
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
This much?

484
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,020
Are you sure you want to take it?

485
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,600
Of course.

486
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,680
Ryo-Ryo-tsu!

487
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,440
Don't use so much.

488
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,340
Go and save money!

489
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,900
Sanzai-yu, here's your money.

490
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,500
What?

491
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,180
I've used 3 million yen at the party recently.

492
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,420
Please take it as a apology.

493
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,300
What?

494
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,980
Is this really okay?

495
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,060
Here you go.

496
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,680
Oh, right, let's do that.

497
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,400
Sanzai-yu, 3 million yen.

498
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,440
To the room in the back.

499
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,360
Okay.

500
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,720
-You're doing this? -What?

501
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,580
I wanted to try it when I became rich.

502
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,820
I can't stop eating!

503
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,800
Please, director, I'm begging you!

504
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,460
You're an idiot!

505
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,180
You can't do that!

506
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,400
You're a rich man.

507
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,040
I'm just trying to get my money.

508
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,360
You're trying to get your money?

509
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,940
Ryo-tsu, have you decided on a way to use it?

510
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,680
Yes, I did.

511
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,640
I ordered it on the day I got it and it's going to arrive today.

512
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:24,900
Huh?

513
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,620
It seems like it's here.

514
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,420
What did he order?

515
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,520
He ordered a real combat helicopter.

516
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,460
And it's gold.

517
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,440
You're stupid.

518
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,660
If it's real, it's more than 1 billion yen.

519
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,880
I'm surprised.

520
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,720
Of course, you can't buy a real one.

521
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,240
This is a 1/1 scale radio-controlled helicopter.

522
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,920
It's real and it's gold-plated.

523
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,780
It's a specialty.

524
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,800
It's worth 5 billion yen.

525
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,380
I'm in pain.

526
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,540
Director!

527
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,040
Did you get that?

528
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,720
Yes, I already did.

529
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,340
Alright, let's fly!

530
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,200
I hope you're not going to be late.

531
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,800
It's flying like crazy.

532
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,840
Senior, what are you going to do?

533
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,540
I can't wait.

534
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,080
It seems like it's piloting a real helicopter.

535
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,120
If it's worth 5.5 billion,

536
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,700
I'll give it to you as a donation.

537
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:32,900
You're right.

538
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,020
He's more right than me.

539
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,800
Alright, let's go to the park.

540
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,960
Please give me a meal.

541
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,120
I'll give you a meal.

542
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,620
I'll give you a meal.

543
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,100
Please give me a meal.

544
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,360
I'll give you a meal.

545
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,180
This is my lucky charm.

546
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,920
I'm the only one who can do this.

547
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,700
Please give me a meal.

548
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,760
I'll give you a meal.

549
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,840
Please give me a meal.

550
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,020
I'll give you a meal.

551
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,740
What a mischievous little young man.

552
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,940
But you're so стороны.

553
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,160
The tickets that we bought are worth 5 billion yen.

554
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
Ca..5 billion yen?

555
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,780
Get it!

556
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,160
Get it!

557
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:24,940
Personally?

558
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,120
As you can see, it's all my fault.

559
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,900
Eheheheh!

560
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,920
It's so fun!

561
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,020
And this guy too!

562
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,820
And this guy too!

563
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,200
And this guy too!

564
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
Eheheh!

565
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,800
Eheh?

566
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,360
Oh, no...

567
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,660
I...

568
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,460
I don't have a...

569
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,440
I don't have a Prop...

570
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,120
I don't have a Prop...

571
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,700
AAAAAAAAHHH!

572
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,000
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!

573
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,340
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!

574
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,340
Ryo-chan!

575
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,120

576
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,920
My 50 billion yen helicopter!

577
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,500
Um, my big money is...

578
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,160
Ryo-san, you're in trouble!

579
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
The lottery costs

580
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,140
30% of the United States' federal tax!

581
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,980
30% of the United States' federal tax!

582
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,900
Pay the 50 billion yen tax!

583
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,920
Huh?

584
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,140
30% of the 50 billion yen?

585
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,280
Huh?

586
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,500
5.6 billion yen?

587
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,140
Kachin...

588
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,580
Ah...

589
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,440
You've earned 5.6 billion yen,

590
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,060
and you're using it so quickly.

591
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,300
And you've earned 5.6 billion yen,

592
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,940
and you're using it so quickly.

593
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,660
And you're using it so quickly.

594
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:52,700
And you're using it so quickly.

595
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,860
You're such an idiot.

596
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,920
And you're such an idiot.

Even if something crazy happens

612
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,480
Please smile cutely

613
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,640
You can go out with a nothing face

614
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,000

A woman who's been through a lot isn't beautiful

621
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,880
So you should smile right away

622
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,560
If you're not a child

623
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,720
Hey

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,180
