1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,340
"The End of the Rain"

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,600
When you watch TV

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,400
Make the room bright and try to get away

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:24,620
After the rain, like someone calling

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,760
After the rain, like someone calling

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,360
I walked while looking back

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,420
"Mom, please help me!"

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,260
I felt at that time

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,500
A strange feeling

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,180
So I tried to walk only the black part of the Ake-dogai Tile

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:54,600
I tried to walk only the black part of the Ake-dogai Tile

12
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,980
I tried to walk only the black part of the Ake-dogai Tile

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,400
No matter who, even if I was a child at one time

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,360
Everyone has forgotten

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,740
The politician with a cashier face

16
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,820
And the blue aunt over my eyes

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,220
And the blue aunt over my eyes

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,360
Check that corner

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,600
And check that corner

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,800
Make everyone, everyone see you

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,900
♪ You'll fly together ♪

22
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,800
♪ There's a wall over there ♪

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,800
♪ You will find the wall ♪

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,040
♪ Everyone, come to our city ♪

25
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,600
Thank you!

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,700
Nakagawa-kun was saved.

27
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,180
I didn't expect to see you in front of the head office.

28
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,540
It was a coincidence, chief.

29
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,480
Did you have a meeting with the head office?

30
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,640
Yes, the entire meeting of the taxi robbery that has been going on in the city recently.

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,520
There is a lot of damage in our ship.

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,240
Nakagawa, your cell phone is forbidden while driving.

33
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,520
Of course I know.

34
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,780
Chief, my car's phone is hands free.

35
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,240
Hands free?

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,380
Yes, this is Nakagawa.

37
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,320
It's me.

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,080
What is it, senpai?

39
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,500
Matt, wait a moment.

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,780
I heard a voice from the speaker.

41
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm using Castelio's speaker.

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,720
The microphone is here at the steering wheel.

43
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,780
Sorry, sorry. I met a friend.

44
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,380
Are you on patrol?

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,180
Patrol? I'm not joking.

46
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,880
I'm not patrolling on a nice day like this.

47
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,300
I'm doing something.

48
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,660
What?

49
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,980
What's that weird voice?

50
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,440
Is someone by your side?

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,060
No, I was listening to the radio while driving.

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,540
I'll turn down the volume.

53
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,900
What? Radio?

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,920
By the way, Nakagawa, where do you think you are now?

55
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,820
Well...

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,200
The hint is this sound.

57
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,580
I can hear the sound of the waves and the engine.

58
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,940
Are you on a motorboat?

59
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,780
Oh, he's talking nicely, Nakagawa.

60
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,860
The hint is this.

61
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,000
It's where men who dream of a nuclear war are gathered.

62
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,920
Is it a field of battle?

63
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,780
No way.

64
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,180
Idiot.

65
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,640
There's no sound of the waves at the field of battle.

66
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,660
It's a court.

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,840
What?

68
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,300
I was thinking of taking back the loss of the field of battle on Sunday.

69
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,880
Sen...

70
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,000
Senpai.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,320
You shouldn't talk too long.

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,880
Okay.

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,400
Go, go, Number 3.

74
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,800
Hey, idiot.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,780
What are you doing?

76
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,480
No, no, no.

77
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,040
Idiot.

78
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,980
Give me back my money.

79
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,420
You're quite a stubborn man.

80
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,400
What do you want?

81
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,080
Sen...

82
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,820
Senpai.

83
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,040
Your voice is too loud.

84
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,620
I was listening to you on the radio.

85
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,100
Oh, I see.

86
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,580
Sorry.

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,520
But I'm still hungry, Number 3.

88
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,060
Damn it.

89
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,300
Huh?

90
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,480
What are you doing?

91
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:11,760
Senpai?

92
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,720
What's the matter?

93
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,000
No, no, nothing.

94
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,160
Nakagawa, do you know where you are?

95
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,500
Isn't that the court?

96
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,700
I'm asking you where you are in the court.

97
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,140
You seemed to be in your room.

98
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,180
Idiot.

99
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,380
There's no phone in the bathroom!

100
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,240
Why do you ask so suddenly?

101
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,940
You got fired all of a sudden.

102
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:37,960
What happened?

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,520
But I remember the voice now.

104
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
It's me, Ohara.

105
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,120
B-boss?

106
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,040
Why are you there?

107
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,440
Wasn't there a meeting in the main office?

108
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,980
I'm going back to the headquarters.

109
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,140
Ryotsu, are you taking a rest today?

110
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,760
No, I'll go.

111
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,840
I'll go.

112
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,600
Did you hear everything I said so far?

113
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,740
Did you hear everything I said so far?

114
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,700
I heard it well, Ryotsu.

115
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
Go back to the headquarters immediately.

116
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
If you arrive later than us,

117
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,200
I'll be in trouble.

118
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,940
No way!

119
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,160
Is there such a thing?

120
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,360
Nakagawa, where are you running now?

121
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,700
I'm near Aosu Station.

122
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,100
I'm on a bus right now, but I'm about to leave.

123
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm on a bus right now, but I'm about to leave.

124
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,060
What? Aosu?

125
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,900
I'll cut it.

126
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,120
If it's a close distance, I can't lose to Ferrari.

127
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,580
But I don't have enough energy to go to the course.

128
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,240
But I don't have enough energy to go to the course.

129
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,960
What?

130
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,240
Thank you.

131
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,800
I'll take a taxi here.

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,660
Gassu, go to the Kameyari Park in front of the station.

133
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,500
Go to the Kameyari Park in front of the station.

134
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,320
I'm sorry.

135
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,380
I don't know much about this area.

136
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't know much about this area.

137
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,980
I'll take another taxi if you're in a hurry.

138
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,440
I'll take another taxi if you're in a hurry.

139
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,960
I'll drive in the addressed area.

140
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,980
I'll drive in the same area.

141
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,540
Watch out!

142
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,780
Please protect the speed limit.

143
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,900
Shut up. I'm a police officer.

144
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,260
This bus will be operated as an emergency vehicle from now on.

145
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,000
This bus will be operated as an emergency vehicle from now on.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,280
Damn it.

147
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,220
Damn it! You're causing a traffic jam at a time like this!

148
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,820
This is a different road!

149
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,780
That road is U-turn forbidden, right?

150
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,220
That is V-turn, so it's fine.

151
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,000
Really?

152
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,040
Hello!

153
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,800
Can you please drive around the garden?

154
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,960
The people of the north are very friendly!

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,240
They will watch you a lot!

156
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,840
Hey! The train is late!

157
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,180
I don't think so...

158
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,800
Shut up! We're going down the stairs!

159
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,620
Hold on tight!

160
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,620
Stairs?

161
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:25,240
I can't breathe!

162
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,380
There's a corridor!

163
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,180
It's too narrow to pass!

164
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,920
There's no such thing as impossible in my dictionary!

165
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,740
Look to the side!

166
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,000
The wall is broken! The wall!

167
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,680
The people of the north are very friendly, so it's fine!

168
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,480
Even if the festival's shrine breaks the wall,

169
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,880
there's no one like this!

170
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,280
This is not a shrine!

171
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,880
This is ramparts!

172
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,060
This is not a shrine!

173
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,880
This is a joy-seeker!

174
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,840
HARUTO!

175
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,020
Hey, what are you doing by the train?

176
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,580
He'll wear a mask!

177
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,580
That's a good idea!

178
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,440
I'm afraid the train won't let us pass-

179
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,360
I will!

180
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,440
I'm going to leave~!

181
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,840
Take the back road!

182
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,600
Hey, chief, what's going on?

183
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,600
Senpai, you're in time.

184
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,160
My neck is...

185
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,100
No, no, no.

186
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,800
I'm the type that always gives my best for work.

187
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,420
You ran from the court, but you still talk big.

188
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,060
I'm sorry!

189
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,900
Chief!

190
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,840
The president called.

191
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,240
The president called.

192
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,760
What? From the president?

193
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,720
What?

194
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,920
Ryo-tsumo?

195
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,480
Oh, I see.

196
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,700
I'll go right away.

197
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,260
Chief, what's going on?

198
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,600
We have information that one of the taxi robbers is hiding in Katsushika.

199
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,240
Really?

200
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,360
We're going to set up a special investigation department.

201
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,640
You three come with me to the office.

202
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,140
Yes, sir!

203
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,500
Is this taxi real?

204
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,060
Yes.

205
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,440
We hired three taxi companies that usually cooperate with the police.

206
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,520
We want you to arrest the taxi robber using this car.

207
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,060
But why are you making this idiot do such an important task?

208
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,700
He's not an idiot, is he, chief?

209
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,320
In fact, he's a driver and a double-duty owner.

210
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,440
So we chose the right person to be the computer's owner.

211
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,180
It was Nakagawa, Reigo, and Ryo-tsumo.

212
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,280
I see.

213
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,180
So the computer has more eyes to see people.

214
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,400
Don't get carried away.

215
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,560
Thank you for waiting.

216
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,480
Oh.

217
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,320
I changed my clothes.

218
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,660
You two look great.

219
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,380
Thank you very much.

220
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,440
When the time comes,

221
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,160
this bulletproof glass will protect the driver.

222
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,760
Wow!

223
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,580
You two, I'm counting on you.

224
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,360
Yes.

225
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,900
Chief, where's my taxi going?

226
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,660
Oh, this way.

227
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,660
Your taxi is here.

228
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,460
Why is my taxi only with old-fashioned tubes?

229
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,460
It can't be helped.

230
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,320
Because I could only pay for this.

231
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,860
Boss, where is the button from the bullet glass?

232
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,740
It's not in your garden.

233
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,620
What?

234
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,060
What if it's targeted with a gun?

235
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,480
I don't think you'd die even if you were shot.

236
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,860
Well, then you'd better avoid it.

237
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,200
That's terrible.

238
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,660
It's a big discrimination against the middle class.

239
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,580
I'll be going.

240
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,560
I'll be going.

241
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,740
I'll be going.

242
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,180
What's wrong with Ryotsu?

243
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,760
He's about to come.

244
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,020
Get out of the way!

245
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,220
I'm going!

246
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,640
I hit it.

247
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,800
That's a putter.

248
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,340
Idiot!

249
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,180
Where are you looking?

250
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,860
Even if I say that, he'll jump out of the way.

251
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,760
What?

252
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,960
You're old.

253
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,900
You should know the trick.

254
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,020
There's no sudden stop.

255
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,060
Avoid it.

256
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,220
You're stupid.

257
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,760
S-sorry.

258
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,700
You're just saying?

259
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,200
Are you really all right?

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,540
Damn it.

261
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,920
The computer just picked it.

262
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,200
He'll get angry.

263
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,340
Damn.

264
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,440
I'll be in charge of the police station.

265
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:23,920
Please excuse me.

266
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:23,940
I'll take care of the police station.

267
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,300
I'll take care of the police station.

268
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,560
I'll take care of the police station.

269
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,300
Nakagawa, can you hear me?

270
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,280
Yes.

271
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,780
There's a possibility that the man with the ID is inside.

272
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,060
There's a possibility that the man with the ID is inside.

273
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,200
Roger that.

274
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,320
He might be moving in a taxi.

275
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,220
If the culprit gets on the taxi,

276
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,240
he'll be asked to go to the place where he was told to go.

277
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,280
he'll be asked to go to the place where he was told to go.

278
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,580
Roger that.

279
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,720
Wait for him to contact his friends,

280
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,380
and make him a villain.

281
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,580
Okay?

282
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,520
Okay.

283
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,500
Please take me to Kameari Station.

284
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,500
You're mistaken for a real man.

285
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,940
You're mistaken for a real man.

286
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,000
Please. I'm in a hurry.

287
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,300
You can go back to the station in 10 minutes.

288
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:07,940
You can go back to the station in 10 minutes.

289
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,580
It'll take some time anyway.

290
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,120
Okay.

291
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,140
Okay.

292
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,860
Thank goodness.

293
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm saved.

294
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,460
I'll fly you.

295
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:29,540
We're here.

296
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:38,300
We're here.

297
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,620
We are here in 3 minutes.

298
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,420
You saved me.

299
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,120
How much is this?

300
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,440
I forgot the meter.

301
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,820
I'll take it.

302
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,560
No problem.

303
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,860
Let's go.

304
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,740
What's this?

305
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,580
We're

306
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,940
It's good.

307
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:05,700
Go to Haneda.

308
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,200
I'll go to Haneda.

309
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,740
It's too far.

310
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
I'll ask for it. The flight time is...

311
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,180
I'll ask for it for 10,000 yen.

312
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,240
10,000 yen?

313
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,080
Alright, I got it!

314
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,200
You can get in fast if you start at the speed bump!

315
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,740
Hold on tight!

316
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,080
What's wrong?

317
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,980
A man with a mission has appeared.

318
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,240
What?

319
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,260
He's going somewhere.

320
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,380
Alright, Ryotsu's taxi is at the exit.

321
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,620
Huh?

322
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,880
R-Ryotsu's car is missing!

323
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,680
What?!

324
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,460
What happened to Ryotsu?

325
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,900
He got on a passenger and went somewhere.

326
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,800
What are you saying, you idiot?!

327
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,380
Oh no!

328
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,140
He got on another taxi!

329
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,060
The mission is a failure!

330
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,880
Ryotsu, answer me!

331
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,820
Ryotsu!

332
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,240
Damn it, the radio is dead.

333
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,320
Oh crap...

334
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,540
I'm so sorry, Ryotsu.

335
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm sorry, Ryotsu.

336
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,120
How did you get here?

337
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,240
Is that you?

338
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,940
No, I'm the one who got hit by a car in the middle of the street.

339
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,300
Yo!

340
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,640
You are!

341
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,220
You'd better carry your luggage in your trunk.

342
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,280
Excuse me.

343
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,140
Should we go from Shibamata?

344
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,440
I'm from the Tora-san Museum, and I'm from Yagiri.

345
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,940
Are you two new to Tokyo?

346
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,580
Yes, I was wondering where to look.

347
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,280
If you look from the platform, it's close.

348
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,800
Ah, excuse me.

349
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,120
Senpai, where are you? The manager is in a hurry.

350
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,900
What? Nakagawa?

351
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,360
Sorry, but there's a customer.

352
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,580
I'll leave it to you guys.

353
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,160
What? No way!

354
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,540
Um, is Harajuku close?

355
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,060
Yes, it's close.

356
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,380
Then let's go from there.

357
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,160
I don't use my cell phone while driving. I'll cut it.

358
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:15,640
Oh.

359
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,320
Well, shall we go?

360
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,580
Thank you.

361
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,980
Oh, my God.

362
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,040
Where did he run to?

363
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,600
He's a tenant, isn't he? That taxi.

364
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,120
In the first place, it's wrong to leave such an important task to Ryotsu.

365
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,600
Ah, thank you.

366
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,220
Move, move!

367
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,440
It's on the road of the Ryotsu taxi!

368
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,380
Can I force a traffic jam?

369
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,180
It's okay, it's okay.

370
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,440
The road is all mine.

371
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,560
Hey, the previous bus!

372
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,260
It's in the way, you bastards!

373
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,940
What kind of driver is the car passing by the bus?

374
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:55,920
Hmm?

375
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,780
Oh!

376
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,160
Ryotsu!

377
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,960
Hey, chief!

378
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,300
Oh, no!

379
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,700
I, I can't believe it.

380
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,560
Thank you very much.

381
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,480
Be careful of the strange men who hit you.

382
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,980
Yes, sir.

383
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,660
See you later.

384
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,420
It's been two hours, and you've earned 20,000 yen.

385
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,560
This is a good business.

386
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,840
All right, I've decided.

387
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,520
Still flowing spurts.

388
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,040
Hold on.

389
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,260
I've got a car you're interested in.

390
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,460
What do you need?

391
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,720
No problem.

392
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,260
I've got a taxi driver's license.

393
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,740
Do you have a taxi driver's license?

394
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,620
Stop pretending.

395
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,400
Sorry.

396
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,140
You've got a low-paying license, but

397
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,220
Ryo knows the back of the town!

398
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,580
He's probably an administrator.

399
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,320
You're right.

400
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,440
See you!

401
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,360
I'll pay you back after I finish the remodeling.

402
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,820
Do they happen to be lurking here?

403
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,340
It's the taxi thief after all.

404
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:13,480
It's the criminal.

405
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,820
He jumped into the cage from the bird.

406
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,460
Hey, please take me to Narita Airport.

407
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,300
Hey, customer.

408
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,220
Actually, the bad taxi traffic is popular these days.

409
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,940
I'm sorry, but can I ask you for a money for poop?

410
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,580
What?

411
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,780
Stop it.

412
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
I understand.

413
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,980
I can't help it.

414
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,200
How much is it?

415
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,440
I'll give you 20,000 yen.

416
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,180
Yeah.

417
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,720
Thank you.

418
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,380
I'll give you 20,000 yen.

419
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,180
The one with the gun is the right one.

420
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,040
What's wrong?

421
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,920
That taxi has a bulletproof light.

422
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,080
Something might have happened.

423
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,620
Stop the car.

424
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,340
Yeah.

425
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,100
Huh? It's a stop sign.

426
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,920
Stop the car.

427
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,980
Do you have a driver's license?

428
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,720
Yeah.

429
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,340
Excuse me, sir.

430
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,000
Could you please get off?

431
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,140
I'll take care of it.

432
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:50,940
I won't let you get away!

433
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:59,300
Hey, hurry up and catch him!

434
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,060
Yes sir!

435
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,980
Now, be quiet!

436
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,960
Now, come out!

437
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,440
You're in the way!

438
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,780
Senpai, that was a good job.

439
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,280
No matter what you say, I'll do it when I have to, Ryo-chan.

440
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,820
I'm glad I got to do the last five rounds.

441
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,780
Chief, thank you for your help for a long time.

442
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,820
What? The order?

443
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,240
Huh?

444
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,440
Hey, what do you mean?

445
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,160
I found out that the taxi driver was my shift worker.

446
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,160
See you later.

447
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,880
Hey, Ryo-chan!

448
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,740
Hey, don't wait! That taxi is a temporary one!

449
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,620
You idiot!

450
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,900
Ohara-kun, this is bad!

451
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,840
W-what's going on?

452
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,660
W-watch this!

453
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,840
What?

454
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,200
Huh?

455
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,500
What?

456
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:01,660
We can't deliver the damage?

457
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,860
All the taxi drivers of Ryo-chan have been destroyed.

458
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,060
Besides, a number of reports of traffic violations have been sent in.

459
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,080
Damn Ryo-chan!

460
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,000
Nakagawa-kun, Reiko-kun, get Ryo-chan immediately.

461
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,540
Yes sir!

462
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,580
You can't be a local official in the foreign month!

463
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,340
I'll pay you all with this taxi!

464
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,060
I'll make you a taxi!

465
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,420
Oh no!

466
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,180
Stop the taxi in front!

467
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,240
I'm not kidding!

468
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,820
I'll kill you!

469
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,720
Damn it!

470
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,880
They're so stubborn!

471
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,780
Well?

472
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,940
I'm sure you paid for the remodeling.

473
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,260
Too bad!

474
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,440
What?

475
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,300
Don't let him get away!

476
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,200
Senpai!

477
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,580
Nakagawa!

478
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,380
Ryoji!

479
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,140
Stop the car!

480
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,440
Ryoji!

481
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,940
Give up already!

482
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,180
You're a great driver!

483
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,540
You're good at driving!

484
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,400
No, not that.

485
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,400
Alright!

486
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,040
Please stop!

487
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,120
That won't do anything!

488
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,280
Kintaro!

489
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,940
Hahaha!

490
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,360
It's impossible for you guys to catch me, Akechi!

491
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,340
Reminds me of the 007 VONDO car!

492
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,620
Damn it!

493
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,640
Oh? But I'm sure it's...

494
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,820
Looks like you gave up.

495
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,540
There's no way!

496
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,300
Senpai, what happened?

497
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,660
Hehehe...

498
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,620
The car just went "dogaan" and I was thinking I should go back to normal work.

499
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,760
We've already paid for the ticket.

500
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,200
What?

501
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,480
You've worked hard all this time, Ryo-tsu.

502
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,660
Uh, Chief?

503
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,840
The taxi has received the request form of those who broke the fence, so pay it properly.

504
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,100
Huh?!

505
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,900
And that taxi is not a rental.

506
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,220
Pay it back to the taxi company.

507
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,120
Uh... Nooooooo...

508
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,640
