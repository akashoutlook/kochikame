1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,920
When you watch TV, make the room bright and take a look away.

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,900
Come to me if you're broke.

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm not here but I'm worried.

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,900
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds.

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,640
I'll get through it somehow.

6
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:56,700
I have no job.

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,460
Come to me if you're broke.

8
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,500
I'm not here but I'm worried.

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,500
I'm not here but I'm worried.

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,140
I have no job.

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,260
I'll get through it somehow.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,560
I'm not here but I'm worried.

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not here but I'm worried.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,560
Hoi!

15
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,740
The Yes!

16
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,700
You saw a train going in front of Hakuchu Highway, you've got guts!

17
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,140
No! No it's not! This is my car!

18
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,440
What?!

19
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,400
The Man Who Has Missed Too Many Locks

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,200
Then, to keep your car from being stolen,

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,980
get rid of your tires and lock on the car.

22
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,180
You're saying you're getting rid of the gasoline?

23
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,340
That's right.

24
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,500
You didn't come here to sell the tires, did you?

25
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,520
If I was this cautious, I wouldn't have been robbed.

26
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,560
I don't want to regret it for taking so much trouble.

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,520
So, what do you want from the station?

28
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,260
Oh, that's right!

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,060
Actually, I heard strange sounds from a house where no one was.

30
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,060
Akisuka!

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,480
Where is the house? Is it near here?

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
It's the third floor. I have to hurry.

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,840
Um, screws, screws...

34
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,320
Is it this house?

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,460
Yes, it's the top floor.

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,180
It's the door in the back.

37
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,600
What is this number of holes?

38
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,540
There are 30.

39
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,280
30?

40
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,760
And they are all dimple key types that are strong for picking.

41
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,220
As an anti-theft model house, I received a medal from the Anti-Theft Association.

42
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,040
Then are you the owner here?

43
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,940
Thanks to you, I sold all of them.

44
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,660
I have about 5 more houses in the city.

45
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,960
Huh? It won't open.

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,740
Oh, I made a mistake.

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,220
This way. This way.

48
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,920
Just opening the door won't make it any better.

49
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,560
However, I don't think there are people who can break through this kind of equipment and work in the office.

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,000
Look!

51
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,060
Just hurry and open it!

52
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,760
Yes!

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,880
It's open.

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,840
Good.

55
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,680
What is it?

56
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,520
This is...

57
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,340
A spear!

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,940
What is this door?

59
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,700
It's 1 meter thick.

60
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,700
Is it a safe?

61
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,120
The window...

62
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,260
The glass is intact.

63
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,220
That means...

64
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,680
Ah!

65
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,260
I did it again.

66
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,880
I forgot to close it.

67
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,100
Close?

68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,180
Forget?

69
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,020
I'm not going outside yet.

70
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,480
You can't go inside.

71
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,620
Ah! Senpai! Over there!

72
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,400
They're there.

73
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,940
I'll call for support!

74
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,280
I don't think I can wait!

75
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,380
No!

76
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,060
Senpai!

77
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,680
Huh?

78
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,040
What?

79
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,740
Ah!

80
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,020
We can't take anything!

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,060
Ososuke, what is that thing?

82
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,140
Ah...

83
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,560
To be able to jump from this height...

84
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,640
It's just a piece of cake.

85
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,380
"Akira"

86
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,940
It was a high-frequency signal.

87
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:31,300
But the security equipment inside was perfect, so it seems that only this gold piece was stolen.

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,840
Thank you very much.

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,720
But, it's still insufficient to enter the Aki-su even though it was so well-protected.

90
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,580
I have to be more and more strict!

91
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,840
Um, it's just a matter of forgetting to close the window.

92
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,660
Ana, Ryu-chan, did you change your cell phone?

93
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,540
Yeah, I borrowed it from Jomae-san. It's a hotline.

94
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,680
Senpai, Jomae-san's house has been asked for special security.

95
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,540
I'm worried because after something like that happens.

96
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,420
It seems that if something happens, he will be able to contact me immediately.

97
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,000
Hmm...

98
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,060
Oh, I didn't expect you to promise to receive money personally, Ryu-chan.

99
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,140
What?

100
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,300
It's just a security within the scope of the police officer's duty.

101
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,520
That's it.

102
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,420
Of course, Senpai.

103
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,020
Of course! I got a thousand yen of money!

104
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,320
It's our job to protect the safety of the citizens' lives.

105
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,400
Ah!

106
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,980
Yes, yes.

107
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,160
What's the matter?

108
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,380
Yes, I understand. I'll be right there.

109
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,440
What happened?

110
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,200
It's an emergency. I'll be back in a moment.

111
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,100
He must have received money.

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,000
Hmm...

113
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,100
Let's focus on Birulli!

114
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,080
"Police Force"

115
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,880
This is...

116
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,180
Are they running?

117
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,480
There's no way!

118
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,360
I'm going to start this!

119
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,880
The door will open when I get there!

120
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,380
No way!

121
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,400
Why?

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:06,520
What?

123
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,860
Alright, let's go.

124
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,260
What the hell is this?

125
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,660
This is a side-respirator.

126
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,160
If the visitor does something suspicious,

127
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,500
it automatically activates the anti-aircraft system.

128
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,800
What do you mean, "something suspicious"?

129
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,620
I just got a little close to the wall.

130
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,340
I'm in trouble.

131
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,700
What the hell is this?

132
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,980
What the hell is this?

133
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,000
There's a infrared sensor going around the corridor.

134
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,360
What?

135
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,180
Please use this.

136
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,300
An infrared gobble?

137
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,260
There's a sensor going around the corridor like this?

138
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,980
There's only clear space on the ceiling.

139
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:06,540
I can't see anything.

140
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,660
Did it go through?

141
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,720
I did it.

142
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,500
What?

143
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,900
This time, it's a trap.

144
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,460
The suspicious will be sent directly to the underground parking lot's safe box.

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,400
Excuse me, but Mr. Ryotsu, please start over.

146
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,560
What?

147
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,880
What?

148
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:31,980
What?

149
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,220
What?

150
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,700
What?

151
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,520
What?

152
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,480
We can't let anything come in front of us, right?

153
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,820
Hey, Yotsu!

154
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,620
Why don't you just open the door?

155
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,080
No, you have to press the code to open it outside.

156
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,800
Code?

157
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,320
Please press the 26-digit code next to the door within 5 seconds.

158
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,740
What?

159
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,640
I know it's just one time, so you have to remember it.

160
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,200
The code is 635025.

161
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,160
231895447139652824059

162
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,940
That's it.

163
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,840
What did you say?

164
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,040
635002318954471396...

165
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,240
Time out.

166
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,400
Again?

167
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,500
Please start over.

168
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,540
Yes.

169
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,240
Yes!

170
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,100
This is the third time.

171
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,160
63500231895447139652824059

172
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,760
Lock removed.

173
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,680
I'm sure there's no more.

174
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,720
6350023189544713965

175
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,240
Temperature sensor!

176
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,120
Laser!

177
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,120
I'm going to kill you!

178
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,200
Let's start over.

179
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,040
I quit.

180
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm going to stop.

181
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,620
Oh, my God.

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,740
It's faster than I thought.

183
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,800
6350023189544713965

184
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,560
Mr. Ryotsu...

185
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,400
As expected of Mr. Ryotsu.

186
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,280
Climbing the outer wall...

187
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,720
But I have to set up an electric power line for the outer wall, too...

188
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,920
Well, what do you want me to do?

189
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,800
Yes.

190
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,340
Yes. I would like to show you the latest defense device.

191
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,660
What?

192
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,620
This security system is perfect for all the closures in the house.

193
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,340
The window is a 30cm thick bullet glass.

194
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,960
There is also a sensor alarm on the support.

195
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,040
There are also many infrared TV cameras and laser devices installed on the balcony.

196
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,200
The wall inside the house is 1m thick.

197
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
You can shoot missiles inside.

198
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,660
You can shoot missiles inside.

199
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,620
And here is the central control room where you can see all the TV cameras and control all the defense devices.

200
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:24,880
How is it?

201
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,080
This is perfect for security, isn't it?

202
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,840
Ryochi.

203
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,940
Is this the Earth Defense Army?

204
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,460
Yes. Ryochi security service.

205
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,780
Yes.

206
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,640
Yes.

207
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,020
I will ask you right away.

208
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,540
Yes.

209
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,160
Today is the third time.

210
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,820
Ryochi, I'm sorry.

211
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,600
Please look at the gas.

212
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,900
Ryochi, I'm sorry.

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,260
I forgot to close the window of B.

214
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,160
Ryochi, I'm sorry.

215
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:56,920
I forgot to wash the laundry.

216
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,680
Ryochi, I'm sorry.

217
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,700
Ryochi.

218
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,160
Ryochi.

219
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,200
What a worried guy.

220
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,180
Jomae calls more than 10 times a day.

221
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,000
I will call him more than 10 times a day.

222
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,480
I will call him more than 10 times a day.

223
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,300
I will call him more than 10 times a day.

224
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:15,560
He really likes the plug.

225
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,500
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,200
Maybe a friend will be angry at me if I leave.

227
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,100
It's not a problem.

228
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,200
Right.

229
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,060
Thanks.

230
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,860
Ryochi.

231
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,920
I hope you don't explain to the employee.

232
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,160
That's the truth.

233
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,180
In thenimari Basin

234
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,680
What a strange man you are.

235
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,660
What is a nice person?

236
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:39,780
What?

237
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,800
Ryozu-san!

238
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,600
What's wrong? What happened?

239
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,600
Here, have a drink.

240
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,460
I'm asking you what happened.

241
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,720
I can't sleep so I thought I'd have dinner.

242
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,620
What?

243
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,200
Cheers.

244
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,200
No, stop kidding!

245
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,480
Don't!

246
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,840
You said on the phone, "Please help me!"

247
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,980
and now you're yelling like you're dying.

248
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,760
I came here at this hour!

249
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,840
I can't sleep so I thought I'd have dinner!

250
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,400
I'm sorry!

251
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,420
I was alone at night and I was so lonely.

252
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:20,860
Alone?

253
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,320
Then what's this picture?

254
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,860
You have a family, right?

255
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,240
My wife and children left.

256
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,080
Huh?

257
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,940
A few months ago...

258
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,380
It was last summer.

259
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,840
I bought my son a bicycle on his 10th birthday.

260
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,280
My son practiced every day.

261
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,540
When he finally got to ride it by himself,

262
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,720
the bicycle got stolen.

263
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,120
Did you give it to him?

264
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:57,440
Yes.

265
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,400
But in the end, he couldn't find it.

266
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:00,520
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,500
When I saw my son cry that day, I decided.

268
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,960
Thieves don't go away from the world.

269
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,980
That's why I will protect my family with my own hands!

270
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,300
So, you started to lock up everything.

271
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,040
Yes.

272
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,160
But this is a bit too much, isn't it?

273
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,260
My wife told me so.

274
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,440
My wife and I often argue over the keys.

275
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,800
One day...

276
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,140
I said, "I don't want this house full of keys anymore."

277
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,620
I took my son out.

278
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,620
So you live in a big apartment like this alone.

279
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,600
Yes.

280
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,480
Well, I don't know if you're lonely alone.

281
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,740
But what your wife says is the best.

282
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,140
I'm not proud of it, but I've never locked up a house.

283
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:51,760
What?

284
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,340
Aren't you worried about that?

285
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,760
Zhin, zhin, zhin.

286
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,400
When we were kids, we were...

287
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,000
We didn't have a house with a lock.

288
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,740
That's why the neighborhood next door was free to go out.

289
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,500
It's because it was a peaceful time.

290
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,900
In this day and age, if there was no lock, I'm just worried.

291
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,700
Hmm...

292
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,280
Huh?

293
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,700
Huh?

294
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,660
A chain.

295
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,320
What's this chain?

296
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,280
I...

297
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,020
I...

298
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,660
Th-thief!

299
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,680
Oh, no!

300
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,460
Bastard!

301
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,600
Ugh...

302
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,040
Ugh...

303
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,580
Ugh...

304
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,220
Ugh...

305
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,280
Ugh...

306
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,040
What's wrong with me?

307
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,400
You idiot!

308
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,440
I made you a secret!

309
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,240
You idiot!

310
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,640
Ugh!

311
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,600
Ugh!

312
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:37,680
Ugh!

313
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,140
Ugh!

314
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,200
Ugh!

315
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,560
Ugh!

316
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:41,600
Ugh!

317
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:41,620
Ugh!

318
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,480
What, what is this apartment?

319
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,500
Ugh!

320
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,060
I've forgotten to lock the toilet door.

321
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,900
I've got a bad feeling about this!

322
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,360
Well, I'm glad I was there.

323
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,940
I can't say it's still safe.

324
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,760
Hmm...

325
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,960
We have to make it more and more serious!

326
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,440
Hey, Naoko Komachi! Are you here?

327
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,360
What's up, primitive man?

328
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,460
What do you need us for?

329
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,700
Actually, I have a favor to ask you.

330
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,420
Oh, Senpai.

331
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,680
There's no call from Jomae at all lately.

332
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,760
What's wrong with him?

333
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,220
He's calmed down, hasn't he?

334
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,460
No, he hasn't.

335
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,680
I don't think he'll be able to calm down so easily.

336
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,640
Oh, I heard a rumor.

337
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,380
Yes, Ryozu Security Service.

338
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,460
What? You moved?

339
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,980
I guess it's around here.

340
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,440
You said it yourself.

341
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,080
I came to the Nasa Bunch, but there's no home.

342
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,940
Huh? There's an antenna here.

343
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,800
What? There's a keyhole here.

344
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,340
Oh, this is...

345
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,480
No way!

346
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,440
Oh, Ryozu!

347
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,100
I was just about to pick you up.

348
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,820
Is this the house you moved to?

349
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,140
Yes. It's the underground shelter that NASA has developed.

350
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,480
I sold all the houses.

351
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,440
I sold all the houses.

352
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:27,760
I transferred all my property.

353
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,080
There's only one exit here, so I didn't forget to close the window.

354
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,780
I think it's the best place for a freak like me.

355
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,120
But underground...

356
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,280
But you still locked the door?

357
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,220
I'm worried about a house without a key.

358
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,440
Huh?

359
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,900
I'm worried about a house without a key.

360
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,460
I'm worried about a house without a key.

361
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,220
I'm worried about a house without a key.

362
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,640
I'm worried about a house without a key.

363
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,660
How is it, Ryozu?

364
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,740
Mr. Ryozu, if there's anything you're worried about, please tell me.

365
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,040
I want to make amends.

366
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,040
It's true that there's no window, so it's hard to get in.

367
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,060
All the furniture is locked and can't be taken.

368
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,000
It's a house like a safe example.

369
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,140
But it's not hard to live in a place like this, is it?

370
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:13,980
Huh?

371
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,840
Safety comes first, so that's not a big problem.

372
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,080
Huh?

373
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,680
I'm worried about the house.

374
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,880
The heavy rain in the Kanto region has brought great damage to various areas.

375
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,020
According to the City of Kanto,

376
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,900
Hitchhiking is pouring down over 500 mm per hour in the south of Kanto.

377
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,060
The house, which has been flooded from above and below the floor,

378
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,860
has reached 500 mu...

379
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,420
Well, if you like it, I don't care.

380
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,760
No matter how safe I am,

381
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,800
I'm sorry if you live in this house even if you get paid.

382
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,620
I'm sorry if you live in this house even if you get paid.

383
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,620
I'm sorry if you live in this house even if you get paid.

384
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:54,640
I'm sorry if you live in this house even if you get paid.

385
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,620
Is there still any danger?

386
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,220
Please say anything.

387
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,760
That's not what I'm talking about.

388
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,020
I'm saying whether this place is suitable for a human to live in.

389
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,760
The most important thing is safety.

390
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,500
In other words, a house is like a fortress protected by the enemy.

391
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,180
I'm happy if the rain stops.

392
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,360
It's the 21st century now.

393
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,380
I think you should rethink that idea.

394
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,700
I don't remember being lectured by you.

395
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,040
I'm going home.

396
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,940
Wait.

397
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,540
There are still many security equipment that Mr. Ryotsu wants to see.

398
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,920
Don't worry.

399
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,280
There's no thief who can enter this house.

400
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,160
What's this door? It's very hard.

401
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,800
You bastard.

402
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,740
Ouch!

403
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,120
Ouch!

404
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,580
It's a sea.

405
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,820
Mr. Ryotsu, do something quickly.

406
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,280
I know.

407
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,380
I know, I know.

408
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,580
But the water pressure is too strong.

409
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,360
It's dangerous here.

410
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:04,820
Let's go out.

411
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,400
You can't leave this house.

412
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,940
That's not possible.

413
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,320
What's important is home or life.

414
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,400
What's important is the future.

415
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,220
I understand.

416
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,880
I just want to make a living.

417
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,360
What is this?

418
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,380
Run!

419
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,820
My house...

420
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,340
My house...

421
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,940
What should I do?

422
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,820
I lost everything...

423
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,900
What should I do?

424
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,400
What did you lose?

425
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,260
I lost everything.

426
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
Everything?

427
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,860
You just lost a house.

428
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,860
What do you want to protect?

429
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,360
Why did you lock your house?

430
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,100
That's...

431
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,000
You locked an empty treasure chest!

432
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,320
Dad!

433
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,380
Shinya...

434
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,240
Sakiko...

435
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,800
What's going on?

436
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,340
What's going on?

437
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,760
My wife and son came to visit me because they were worried about you.

438
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,420
How have you been, Shinya?

439
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,100
I'm fine. How about you, Dad?

440
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,380
I'm fine.

441
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,940
Shinya said he'd be lonely without you.

442
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,380
I see.

443
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,900
There he is, Ryo-tsu Kankichi!

444
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,520
I found the bike you asked for.

445
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,440
I found the bike you asked for.

446
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,200
Oh, you found it!

447
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,260
A bike...

448
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,860
This is the bike you were looking for, right?

449
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,640
This bike...

450
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:31,920
Shinya Jomai.

451
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,080
Yes.

452
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,520
It's your bike.

453
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,380
Oh, my bike!

454
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,100
You're good!

455
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,420
Of course.

456
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,000
Don't underestimate a commuter car.

457
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,080
Ryo-tsu!

458
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,400
Thank you so much for this trip!

459
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,140
From now on,

460
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,740
I'm going to work together with my family.

461
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,180
I'm glad.

462
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,640
Don't try to lock the car too hard.

463
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,480
Okay!

464
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,180
Yes!

465
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,780
By the way, about that bike...

466
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
Yeah!

467
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,000
The house I inherited all my property was washed away.

468
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,640
Ah!

469
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,960
What are you going to do?

470
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,900
You said you'd pay me 50,000 yen per month!

471
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,580
You called me out 10 times a day and 20 times a day!

472
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,060
That's not true.

473
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,200
I'm not going to do that!

474
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,480
Ryo-chan!

475
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,100
You didn't promise to personally get paid, did you?

476
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,940
You were just guarding it within the scope of your job as a policeman, right?

477
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,800
That's right!

478
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,080
I didn't promise to get paid at all!

479
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,920
N-No.

480
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,780
Y-Yes.

481
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,180
By the way, Ryo-tsu.

482
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,460
You promised to bring me Tokujou sushi if I found a bike, right?

483
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:41,860
That's not true!

484
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,300
I asked for special help from 300 commuter cars in the entire Kanto area.

485
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,040
Tokujou sushi 300 yen.

486
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,360
I'll take care of it.

487
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,640
300 commuter cars!

488
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,720
I lost everything too.

489
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,160
What are you talking about?

490
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,160
I'll definitely have you pay for 300 commuter cars!

491
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,940
Ehehe!

492
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,960
Ehehe!

493
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,600
Ehehe!

494
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:07,680
Ehehe!

495
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,540
Ehehe!

496
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,160
Ehehe!

497
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,360
Ehehe!

498
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:14,820
Ehehe!

499
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,880
Ehehe!

500
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,780
Ehehe!

501
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:17,980
Ehehe!

502
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,680
Ehehe!

503
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:34,700
Ehehe!

504
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,880
Ehehe!

505
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,600
Ehehe!

506
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,220
Ehehe!

507
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,340
Ehehe!

508
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,880
Even if you lie and cheat a little

509
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,640
Sometimes you're helping someone

510
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,540
Baby, do you know me?

511
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,480
I'm headed for tomorrow

512
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,820
Nice breathing

513
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,800
Don't get sick, I'll do what I have to do

514
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,580
Cute breathing

515
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,200
It's hard to understand

516
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,520
I want to show you

517
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,980
It's better than seeing it again

518
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:31,780
Nakagawa and his father meet for the first time in a long time

519
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,520
But the meeting place is far away

520
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,280
Speaking of Nakagawa Ryuichiro

521
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,240
He is the busiest businessman in the world

522
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,920
Where will he meet?

523
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,500
Space?

524
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,820
Next time, visit the base of Nakagawa

525
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,520
Thank you

526
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,360
There is a turtle

527
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,940
There must be a turtle

528
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,740
Come to our town

529
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,860
Thank you

530
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,060
See you
