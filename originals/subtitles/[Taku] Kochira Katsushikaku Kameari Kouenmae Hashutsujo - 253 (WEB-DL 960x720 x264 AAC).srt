1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,100
"When you watch TV, make your room bright and try to look away!"

2
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,980
Come to my place if you're not rich!

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm not rich, but I'm worried

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,060
Look at the blue sky and the white clouds

5
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:42,480
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:57,540
Come to my place if you're not rich!

7
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm not rich, but I'm worried

8
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,480
Look at the red clouds and the red clouds

9
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,700
I wonder what will happen in the meantime

10
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,340
Do you understand?

11
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you understand?

12
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,000
If you understand, come to me quietly!

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,300
I'm not rich!

14
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,440
I'm not rich!

15
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm not rich!

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,540
I'm not rich!

17
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,220
I'm not rich!

18
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,780
I'm not rich!

19
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,100
Senpai, are you still here?

20
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,420
What's your favorite bento shop?

21
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,660
Soon!

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,300
More coolers, please!

23
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,280
This is the limit!

24
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,700
Senpai said he wanted to ride an open car, so...

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,840
I thought it would feel good to hit the wind directly.

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,560
However, it's still very hot.

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,360
Maybe it was too crowded, lost the tempo and lost electricity.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,260
Well it's not so bad.

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,740
Well, that's fine...

30
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,800
But can't you just hurry up?

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,900
I'm trying to be a little looser.

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,960
Well, is that ok?

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,080
I gave up on you.

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,560
Of course I'm bought by Yukari-san.

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,300
I'm just kidding.

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,340
Well, that's fine.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,460
If you flinched, I can take revenge on you instead.

38
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:29,960
U-U-U Representative Mr.Adётame

39
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,520
This is a very delicious watermelon.

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,640
Ok, buy that one instead.

41
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,980
Are you serious, senpai?

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,040
Summer is always about watermelon.

43
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,120
Which one should I buy?

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,460
Look! A square watermelon!

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,120
Everyone must be very happy about this.

46
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,080
Is that so?

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,200
Is there something wrong?

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,040
I sometimes see a square watermelon.

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,860
But the corners are too straight.

50
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,340
I'm worried about the taste.

51
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,960
It's ok. It's a delicious watermelon.

52
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,260
Yeah.

53
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,420
Look.

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,200
Don't worry.

55
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,320
I bought this one.

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,620
Thanks.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,060
What is this?

58
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,940
Didn't you go to buy everyone's lunch?

59
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,160
You can eat lunch there anytime!

60
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,960
I'll never eat a square watermelon like this again.

61
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,740
I might not like it.

62
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,420
I didn't want to see you.

63
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,040
I want a lunch box.

64
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,220
You guys don't know how wonderful this watermelon is?

65
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,340
It's a square, a square.

66
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,460
It's just disgusting.

67
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,440
It's a little creepy.

68
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,400
It's so bad.

69
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,500
You can't judge by its appearance.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,840
I bought it because its appearance is interesting.

71
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,280
Stop it!

72
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,720
The problem is the contents.

73
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,180
I bought it because its appearance is interesting.

74
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,600
I bought it because its appearance is interesting.

75
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:56,980
There's no red part.

76
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,580
It's pure white.

77
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,780
You can't judge by its appearance.

78
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,380
The problem is the taste.

79
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,060
It must be delicious watermelon.

80
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,680
Try it.

81
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,600
What?

82
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,220
You eat it?

83
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,380
The shape is different, but the watermelon is watermelon.

84
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,600
It doesn't look like watermelon.

85
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,440
It's...

86
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,480
It's like cucumber.

87
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,180
I see.

88
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,440
That's right.

89
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,860
That's right. We need to change the way we eat.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,960
Let's try putting miso on it.

91
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,720
This is delicious.

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,140
This watermelon goes well with miso.

93
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,300
But that's the way to eat cucumber.

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,780
This is cucumber after all.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,480
Right.

96
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,100
You were completely fooled, senpai.

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,140
I'm so frustrated.

98
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,580
I was fooled by my family when I was a kid and now I'm humiliated.

99
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,180
I'm going to buy a watermelon with everyone's money.

100
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,960
What's wrong with buying a watermelon in the summer?

101
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,920
What's wrong with buying a watermelon in the summer?

102
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,940
It's normal for Japanese people to eat watermelon in the summer.

103
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,640
Who decided that?

104
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,820
Some people don't eat watermelon.

105
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,240
I don't accept that kind of guy as a Japanese.

106
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,820
I eat three kinds of watermelon.

107
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,080
You're lying.

108
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,320
I'm not lying.

109
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,700
I eat watermelon in the morning when I wake up.

110
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,840
I eat watermelon in the morning when I wake up.

111
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,140
I eat watermelon at night when I see fireworks.

112
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,400
I eat watermelon.

113
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,260
If there is only watermelon in the summer of Japan, I don't need anything else.

114
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,940
Then prove it.

115
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,220
What?

116
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,740
Why don't you just live with watermelon in the summer?

117
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,680
What?

118
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,300
There's no way you can do that.

119
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,380
I'll do it.

120
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,520
If I can do it, I'll get a million yen.

121
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,140
What?

122
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,520
It's fine.

123
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,540
Meiko, it's bad.

124
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,660
If Chief Kohara finds out...

125
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,140
The chief will be out of town from yesterday and will be back in a week.

126
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,660
So it's fine for a week.

127
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,300
What?

128
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,540
Just a week?

129
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,920
However, if you live in the summer of Japan for a week, you can't live in the summer of Japan.

130
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,320
You can eat 300 watermelon when you get older and older.

131
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,300
What?

132
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,100
300?

133
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,200
If you make 300 futur in a week, it'll be 41 times in a day.

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,400
Take 8 hours when you're sleeping, and if you look at that, the price per hour will be less than 3 times.

135
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,760
If you can do that, you can pay a million yen.

136
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,700
What do you say?

137
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,800
I'll accept that challenge.

138
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,100
If you can eat 300 watermelon in a week

139
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,680
The Man Who Can Eat Watermelon!

140
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,520
Then I'll put on a surveillance camera so that you don't cheat.

141
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,620
If you get caught in the camera, you're out.

142
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,420
Is it okay to add salt?

143
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,060
The seasoning is okay.

144
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,420
I'll make the drink okay, too.

145
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,700
However, if you eat food other than watermelon, you're out.

146
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,060
Okay, I got it.

147
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,580
The start time is just before 1:00 p.m.

148
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,940
Five, four, three, two, one, start!

149
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,860
I can't do it!

150
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,820
First, it's the right way to eat it!

151
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,960
I'll eat it at once!

152
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,820
Pull it out!

153
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,120
I'll spit out the seeds at once!

154
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,820
Oh, it's dirty.

155
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,880
If you spit out the seeds on a watermelon, you're a pig!

156
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,820
Rusia

157
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,080
I got back from the patrol.

158
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,880
How many did you eat now?

159
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,920
Ten of them.

160
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,700
Five every hour!

161
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,160
This is enough for all five or six of them.

162
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,060
We're going to have to pay that million yen.

163
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,620
Reiko

164
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,900
You really don't understand it yet?

165
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,820
You already ate 80?

166
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,100
If we succeed, we'll get that million yen.

167
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,200
It doesn't cost much, so it's worth two of them.

168
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,180
That's a great way to eat.

169
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,060
This is faster to eat.

170
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,140
I didn't get any seeds.

171
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,080
If you leave it, it'll grow naturally.

172
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,920
That's true, but...

173
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,680
What? You ate 80 of them?

174
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,760
Yeah, there are 220 left.

175
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,480
That's so fast.

176
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,020
I'm done with one, so there are 219 left.

177
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,620
Hey, Ryo-chan.

178
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,280
There's still some red stuff left.

179
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,100
There are still some left.

180
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,400
I can't accept that you finished one.

181
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,780
I know. I'm the one who cares about the details.

182
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,960
Here, Kei-chan. This is your tea.

183
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,720
Thank you, Reiko-san.

184
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,760
Look. I only ate two in an hour.

185
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,180
He's definitely losing his spirit.

186
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,480
Next is the 100th.

187
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,160
I'm getting tired of seeing all this green and black stuff.

188
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,180
I know!

189
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,780
What are you doing, senpai?

190
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,200
I'm changing my mood.

191
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,380
Look! White and red watermelons.

192
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,560
How disgusting.

193
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,740
Thank you!

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,280
This is the best 16 soccer ball watermelon.

195
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,100
"Zin" "Gi" "Re" "Chi" "Chu" "Shin" "Ko" "Tei"

196
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,160
All those real words are from Hakkenden Suika

197
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,440
There are more.

198
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,240
Aquarium Watermelon,

199
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,600
The Life-Gender Watermelon,

200
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,820
The Wondering Watermelon,

201
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,100
and the Melon Watermelon

202
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,360
the Ultra- solid Watermelon

203
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,120
"Three Color Glucose Watermelon"

204
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,020
Okay, finally, I have the power to eat!

205
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,740
Well, the inside is just a regular watermelon, right?

206
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,820
You bet.

207
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,900
The End

208
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,120
You ate 30 of them in just a day.

209
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,480
You've lost a lot of speed.

210
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,420
I'll be faster from now on.

211
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,000
Ryo-sama!

212
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,660
I heard you've been eating 300 of them in a week!

213
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,340
Well...

214
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,960
Is there anything I can do for you?

215
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,160
Well, I can't ask you to eat them for me.

216
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,040
I'll have to peel them.

217
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,440
Oh, you're good at cooking!

218
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,000
I made some watermelon-flavored daikon.

219
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,060
You're getting a bit greedy.

220
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,140
Which one would you like?

221
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,140
I'll have one.

222
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,400
But it's not good.

223
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,940
No way!

224
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,280
No way!

225
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,320
It's just fruit salad with watermelon.

226
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,060
It's just watermelon with dressing.

227
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,740
How is the watermelon juice?

228
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,280
Yeah, it's surprisingly good.

229
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,060
That's good!

230
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,320
But I'm getting tired of it.

231
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,260
It's watermelon juice.

232
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,360
I'm sorry.

233
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,660
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,640
So you only did three of them.

235
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,340
Sorry, I didn't do my job.

236
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,660
That's right.

237
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,800
How about you make some jam?

238
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,080
Watermelon jam?

239
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,520
We need to remove the water from the jam.

240
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,280
So I'm going to use a lot of watermelon.

241
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,080
I'll give it a go, just in case.

242
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,820
I'll count on you.

243
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,760
Make me plenty of it.

244
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,940
Which one?

245
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,940
Want to try it?

246
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,860
Well?

247
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,280
*sniff*

248
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,320
*sniff*

249
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,720
*sniff*

250
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,100
*sniff*

251
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,480
How is it, Ryo-sama?

252
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,600
The sweetness of the watermelon is condensed.

253
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,940
It's hard to eat it as it is.

254
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,580
Come to think of it, I bought bread four days ago.

255
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,120
I put it on that.

256
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,280
If you eat something other than watermelon, you're disqualified.

257
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:40,860
Huh?

258
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,960
You can only eat jam.

259
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,500
Damn it!

260
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,500
Where is Senpai?

261
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,620
He went out on patrol.

262
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,040
He doesn't like seeing watermelon.

263
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,780
*sniff*

264
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,360
*sniff*

265
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,440
*sniff*

266
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,860
Ryo-san!

267
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,840
A good watermelon is in it.

268
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,560
*screech*

269
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,860
Huh?

270
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,180
I don't care. I want to eat something other than watermelon.

271
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,880
Something other than watermelon...

272
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,060
I'll eat it!

273
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,580
*sniff*

274
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:21,940
What is this?

275
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
What did you say?

276
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,980
It's ramen. Ryo-san ordered it.

277
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,360
What? Me?

278
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,480
Don't you remember?

279
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
No way!

280
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,100
*sniff*

281
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,500
*sniff*

282
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,800
*sniff*

283
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,640
Ryo-san!

284
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,320
How are you?

285
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,680
*sniff*

286
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,960
*sniff*

287
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,020
You're trying to eat something other than watermelon unconsciously.

288
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,860
You're almost at your limit.

289
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,840
I have 195 watermelon.

290
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,220
I have 105 left in the next two days.

291
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,060
Ryo-san is the winner.

292
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,880
I can't be careless.

293
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,020
Ryo-san will show his incredible power when he gets paid.

294
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,500
*sniff*

295
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,160
Reiko-san's anxiety has subsided.

296
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,020
*sniff*

297
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,660
*sniff*

298
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,000
*sniff*

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Wait...

300
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,080
1 million yen!

301
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,200
For 1 million yen!

302
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,360
He was chased by a threat.

303
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,240
*sniff*

304
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,980
*sniff*

305
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,540
And on the last day, he had one left.

306
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,960
*sniff*

307
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,700
*sniff*

308
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,240
I'll take 1 million yen.

309
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,420
*sniff*

310
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,460
*sniff*

311
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,420
*sniff*

312
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,040
*sniff*

313
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,220
*sniff*

314
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,040
*sniff*

315
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,060
*sniff*

316
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,180
*sniff*

317
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,520
1 million yen!

318
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,960
*sniff*

319
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,040
*sniff*

320
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,940
Wow, Ryo!

321
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,440
He managed to defeat a Tats talll!

322
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,660
*snif*

323
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,440
There's no rest for you.

324
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,240
*sniff*

325
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,760
Please, no more food.

326
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,340
Fine, l'amuse-vous, l'amuse-vous.

327
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,420
*sniff*

328
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,900
Useless.

329
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,600
I know. I'll go to the bank and pay it.

330
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,160
I'll go with you.

331
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,480
It's a waste of money to carry a lot of money.

332
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,360
I'll go patrol.

333
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,600
Hurry up and come back.

334
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,700
How can I use 1 million yen?

335
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,720
I just came back.

336
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,500
What? No one's here?

337
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,820
What's up with Ryo?

338
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,360
Is he slacking again?

339
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,320
If we leave the watermelon here, it'll get wet.

340
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,980
I guess we have to cool the watermelon like this.

341
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,080
Ohara-kun!

342
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,700
Ohara-kun, are you there?

343
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,000
Kojima, it's been a while. What's wrong?

344
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,080
I'll be right back. Please take care of this.

345
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,880
I'm sorry.

346
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,860
Watermelon?

347
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,060
I'm begging you. I'm going to the bathroom!

348
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,860
Did you eat too much watermelon to break your stomach?

349
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,280
It hurts!

350
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,400
What?

351
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,780
You fell asleep?

352
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,880
You're still not coming back?

353
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,580
There's no watermelon!

354
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
Where did you go?

355
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,820
What? Is it here?

356
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,380
I'll get ready to eat soon.

357
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,060
It's been a while.

358
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,120
What are you doing?

359
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,940
That's my line.

360
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,060
Who are you? What are you doing here?

361
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,140
Give it to me quietly.

362
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,280
Why do I have to give it to you?

363
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,460
Give it to me.

364
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,160
I won't give it to you.

365
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,420
Hurry up and get the watermelon.

366
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,580
I want to go there.

367
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,760
Go on!

368
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,700
Go and bring me watermelon!

369
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,800
Go, go, go!

370
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,040
No, you don't leave it!

371
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,640
I think it's the same thing as the others,

372
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,400
and it's boring.

373
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,160
We need no watermelon.

374
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,220
What?

375
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,420
Take this.

376
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,360
It's the watermelon.

377
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:12,880
Why are you so surprised?

378
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:12,920
It didn't have any Elise.

379
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,360
You are not going to skip again, are you?

380
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,400
No, I'm not.

381
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,760
Wait!

382
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,900
Kojima, what's wrong?

383
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,040
Oh, that's right!

384
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,980
That guy took away the thing that was left for you.

385
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,860
Oh, that watermelon?

386
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,420
That's not a watermelon, it's a bomb!

387
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,860
If you give me a shock, it will explode!

388
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,520
The one who is trying to escape with the bomb is the chief of the police in front of the park, Ryotsu Kankichi.

389
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,840
Prepare yourself as soon as you find him.

390
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,540
Also, the bomb that the chief of the police is holding is dangerous to explode if you give it strong stimulus.

391
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,100
We have been careful enough.

392
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,440
He was on his way to the main office after being attacked in an incident.

393
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,480
And then he suddenly wanted to go to the bathroom.

394
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,840
That's right.

395
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:02,960
I see.

396
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,560
Yes.

397
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,080
When he saw you, he told you not to eat the watermelon.

398
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,540
That's right.

399
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,300
It's a bomb.

400
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,500
Reiko!

401
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,240
Huh?

402
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,220
Hey, Reiko. Are you watching?

403
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,380
Ryo!

404
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,360
I'm going to eat the last watermelon now.

405
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,220
I also prepared a prize so that you wouldn't complain later.

406
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,600
Thank you.

407
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,140
I also prepared a watch.

408
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,300
Where is it?

409
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,960
It's Ryo's senior's room.

410
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,440
I also took a video as evidence so that you wouldn't say that the camera was broken.

411
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,460
Reiko!

412
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,980
You must pay 1 million yen.

413
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,080
I'll enjoy it.

414
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,960
Who is it at this time?

415
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,120
Hello, Ryo?

416
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,200
You can't cut the watermelon.

417
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,220
Reiko, I knew you were watching.

418
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,060
You can't get in the way of the situation.

419
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,820
No, it's not that.

420
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,260
That watermelon is a bomb.

421
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,260
Of course, it's a bomb for you.

422
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,180
The moment I ate the watermelon, 1 million yen flew away.

423
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,600
You're being so ungrateful.

424
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,840
That's not what I meant.

425
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,460
It's a waste to save time.

426
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,520
I'll eat this watermelon.

427
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,320
Ryo!

428
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,240
I'll get rid of these watermelon-filled days.

429
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,760
Here we go!

430
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,440
What?

431
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,760
Secured!

432
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,580
What are you doing?

433
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:26,840
What's up with you?

434
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,660
What?

435
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,120
I've got you!

436
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,780
You're so annoying!

437
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,400
You're so annoying.

438
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,360
You're so annoying.

439
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,320
You're so annoying.

440
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,560
You don't want to pay a million yen?

441
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,600
You're such a rich guy.

442
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,960
Ryozu!

443
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,080
Huh?

444
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,700
Chief!

445
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,940
Ryozu, are you waiting?

446
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,560
Give it to him quietly.

447
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,500
Give it to him quickly.

448
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,000
Are you going to be a good friend of the chief?

449
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,100
What are you talking about?

450
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,400
He's not just a watermelon.

451
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,960
Of course.

452
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,640
If you eat it by 1 p.m., it will cost you 1 million yen.

453
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,420
What are you talking about?

454
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,000
You can't eat it.

455
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,720
I don't know why.

456
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,460
It's the chief.

457
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,780
What are you going to do without eating the watermelon?

458
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,340
It will be broken soon.

459
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,600
That's why you eat watermelon with a knife.

460
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,300
Give it back quickly.

461
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,540
Give it back.

462
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,320
I don't want to eat it.

463
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,280
No way!

464
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,500
Ryozu!

465
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,780
The chief has confirmed it.

466
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,200
Please keep an eye on him.

467
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,400
Stop it!

468
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,560
Stop it!

469
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,180
Stop it!

470
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,420
What's wrong with him?

471
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,200
He is a beach ball.

472
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,540
What's going on?

473
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,560
Damn it!

474
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,760
The police!

475
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,500
I'm going home!

476
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,400
Hey!

477
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,960
Emergency!

478
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,340
Emergency!

479
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,360
The bomb is on the truck with the beach ball.

480
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,060
The bomb is on the truck with the beach ball.

481
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,200
The bomb is on the truck with the beach ball.

482
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,900
Where is the再 TRAINED beach ball?

483
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,740
If you say so, there is a beach ball.

484
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,420
Where is it?

485
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,280
What are you doing?

486
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,880
What do you want to do?

487
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,400
Emergency!

488
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,560
Shut up!

489
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,700
Go.

490
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,340
"Cut"

491
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,820
"S-Senpai!"

492
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,640
"Stop it, Yatsu!"

493
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,220
"The last one!"

494
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,040
"Ahh!"

495
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,260
"Huh?"

496
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,260
"What's going on?

497
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,140
"One of them was real!"

498
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,580
"B-by the way,

499
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,400
"we're heading to the watermelon-cutting venue next door."

500
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,520
"Alright, got it!"

501
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,700
"Watermelon-cutting?"

502
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,080
"We're going to cancel it."

503
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,580
"Alright!"

504
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,260
"Watermelon-cutting"

505
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,560
"Watermelon-cutting"

506
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,940
"100 people together, it's watermelon-cutting time!"

507
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,380
"Now then, who will be able to cut the watermelon?"

508
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,100
"Here we go!"

509
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,500
"Ahh!"

510
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,320
"Ahh!"

511
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,200
"Ahh!"

512
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,060
"Now then,

513
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,260
"let's start the watermelons-cutting!"

514
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,780
"Stop it!"

515
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,940
"Ahh!"

516
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,060
"Ahh!"

517
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,180
"Ahh!"

518
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,420
"Ahh!"

519
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,920
"It didn't explode."

520
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,080
"That was a relief."

521
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,740
"Now then, to those who didn't cut it,

522
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,000
"let's give them another chance!"

523
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,480
"One, two!"

524
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,480
"Ahh!"

525
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,120
"Ahh!"

526
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,580
"Oh? There are still some people who haven't cut it yet!"

527
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,660
"Ahh!"

528
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,820
"Now then, let's have them do their best until they do!"

529
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:06,680
"Ugh!"

530
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,880
"Ahhh!"

531
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,600
"Ahhh!"

532
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,780
"Ugh!"

533
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,620
"Ugh!"

534
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,020
"Ouch!"

535
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,520
"Oh, it's getting bigger, Ryo-tsu!"

536
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,480
"I'm the one who's gonna eat this watermelon!"

537
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,080
"Ahh!"

538
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,060
"What's going on?"

539
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,440
"It's just 1 o'clock right now!"

540
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,860
"Damn it, I didn't make it in time!"

541
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,540
"Ahh!"

542
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,300
"I-It's just a watermelon."

543
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,940
"What's going on?"

544
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,060
"Maybe the culprit tricked us."

545
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,100
"What?"

546
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,660
"What's that about?"

547
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,540
"Did you all get fooled by the culprit's lie and get in my way?"

548
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,800
"I'm sorry, Senpai."

549
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,460
"That can't be helped, right?"

550
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,920
"It can't be helped, but it cost 1 million yen!"

551
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,380
"What are you gonna do about it?"

552
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,300
"Ahh!"

553
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,320
"If it wasn't for the trouble, I would've eaten it!"

554
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,160
"Welcome home!"

555
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,260
"The watermelon's getting cold!"

556
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,060
"Well, if you eat this watermelon in 5 minutes, you'll succeed!"

557
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,340
"You're right!"

558
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,320
"Alright, I'll go get the knife!"

559
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,680
"Oh, there's another watermelon here!"

560
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,120
"It's the one I kept cold in the water outside."

561
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,420
"You brought it here, right, Terai?"

562
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,860
"Eh? This is the watermelon I kept cold."

563
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,440
"What?"

564
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:31,260
"Just now, I brought it to the water outside because it was on the desk when I went back to the station."

565
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,260
"I-I'm sure mine was here!"

566
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,140
"It's already cold enough!"

567
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,040
"It was already cold enough, so I put it back on the desk!"

568
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,580
"Huh?"

569
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:43,780
"Huh?"

570
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,480
"Then this watermelon..."

571
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,530
"Itadakimasu!"

572
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,180
"Ohh!"

573
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,600
"Ahh!"

574
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,000
"It's 1 million yen..."

575
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,420
"I hate watermelon so much!"

576
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,550
"Ahh!"

577
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,950
Thanks!

578
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,910
"Ahh! Even this summer has come!

Wow!

591
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,790
Hey! I'm getting smaller!

592
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,950
I thought it was your fault again!

593
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,570
Damn, it's hard to get back to the starting position with this body!

594
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,770
So, what are you going to do, kid?

595
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,170
Eh? I'm a fairy?

596
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,390
Wrong! A small bird is a fairy!

597
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,690
I'm counting on you!

598
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,830
There is a turtle there

599
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,650
Ah, there must be a turtle

600
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,950
There is a turtle

601
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,810
Come on, everyone, to our town

602

Thank you!
