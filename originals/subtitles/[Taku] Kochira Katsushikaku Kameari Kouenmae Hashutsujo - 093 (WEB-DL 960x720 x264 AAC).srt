00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,300
When you watch TV,

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,080
try to light up the room and look away.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,660
I look at the setting sun,

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,880
floating on the riverbank,

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,900
and look at the sunset.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,100
When I kick the pebble,

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,240
I jump to the foot.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,200
I wonder if I'm going to the gym

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,560
where I was jogging.

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,060
I was laughed at

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,480
as if I was a baby.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,920
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere,

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,860
I'm not sure

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,960
what to say.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,020
You don't know

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,320
where to turn.

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,820
The reason why you are

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:00,880
stirring up is

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:10,880
that the setting Annyeong

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,880
can't be turned off completely.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,960
I don't know

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,240
what to look for but

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,800
Tomorrow will be over like this

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,840
I lost my happiness because of Kazushika Shiba

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,720
I realized it, because I'm such an idiot

27
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,420
This is my favorite person

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,740
Let's go!

29
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:44,980
Let's go!

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,820
Wow, this is great

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,520
I can see the beautiful view of the city

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,620
Look at the number of tombo

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,880
There are many tombo and hotaru in Komachi's country

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,860
Really? I'm looking forward to it

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,540
Kei is like a child

36
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,600
Right, Komachi?

37
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,700
Hmm?

38
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,280
Ah, that's right

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,140
I'm glad you kept it a secret from Ryo

40
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,500
Even though the nature is so luxurious

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,300
It's a game, a karaoke, it's noisy

42
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,500
Reiko, if you make a rumor, it will be a shadow

43
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,660
Behind you

44
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,360
Eh? Eh?

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,440
Do you need anything?

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,700
No, nothing

47
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,700
I'm really sorry

48
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:43,940
I'm really sorry

49
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,240
I'm really sorry

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,600
You're surprised, right?

51
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,520
I'm really sorry

52
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,240
I just got scared

53
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,260
I have to do something

54
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,600
I'm getting closer to home

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,440
I'm getting closer to home

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,520
Hey, mom!

57
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,380
What are you doing?

58
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:02,780
Mom, what is this?

59
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,000
What do you think, Komachi?

60
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,960
Did you like anyone?

61
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,780
I didn't like anyone

62
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,040
I don't want to get married yet

63
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm going back to the summer vacation anyway, so it's fine to have a date.

64
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,760
No, I have one or two lovers.

65
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,980
That's a lie.

66
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,500
It's not a lie. I have a lover.

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,100
Then bring him to my house.

68
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,680
If you can't bring him, I'll talk about the wedding here.

69
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,240
I'll take you there.

70
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,480
I understand.

71
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,200
I'll take you there for the summer vacation.

72
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,140
Don't be surprised.

73
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,580
I don't want to have a date.

74
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,080
But what should I do?

75
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,040
I have to hurry up and make a lover.

76
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,080
I made up my mind.

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,040
If I want to make a lover, I have to find Nakagawa.

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,780
I don't care if it's not a real lover.

79
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,780
At least, I want to be a lover while I'm in the countryside.

80
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,320
I'll go get a lunch.

81
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,180
I need you to take care of me and Nakagawa.

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,880
Um, Nakagawa.

83
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,560
What are you doing here?

84
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:29,860
So you're staying here.

85
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,040
Keshijin.

86
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,180
How did you get here?

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,680
What?

88
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,220
I was sent to the station the other day by a Honda Bike.

89
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,240
I heard it's a countryside, but it takes three and a half hours from Tokyo to the bus stop.

90
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,380
I have to take the train and bus there.

91
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,640
It takes six hours.

92
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,200
I can go abroad in six hours.

93
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,560
What are you doing here, Keshijin?

94
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,660
You can't do that if you want to make me a lover.

95
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,560
I can't do that even if I want to be a beast!

96
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,440
Hey, Reiko! Did you buy my part?

97
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,120
Ryo-chan, you really followed me.

98
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,940
This is not a joke! Are you really going to follow me?

99
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,260
Of course! I don't know what mistakes will happen if I am young!

100
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,740
We won't make a mistake!

101
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,940
That's right! You are the one who followed me!

102
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,380
Don't talk like a kid!

103
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,760
You are a gorilla who grew up in a jungle.

104
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,740
You are the one who fooled the city on your day off and dressed like a high school girl!

105
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,040
You should dress properly on your day off!

106
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,120
Come on, Hesho!

107
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,400
I'm getting a nosebleed.

108
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,000
Ouch!

109
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,260
I won't take you!

110
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,980
I will definitely follow you!

111
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,260
Well, well, Senpai.

112
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,400
It can't be helped that you have followed me all the way here.

113
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,720
If you are with a man like this, it would be better to die.

114
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,720
I'll follow you like a cockroach!

115
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,180
We will soon arrive at Oyamakawa.

116
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,160
Oh, we have to get off next.

117
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,780
Please be careful.

118
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,340
Next?

119
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,640
Here.

120
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,760
You'll take the train again from here, right?

121
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,700
Where are you going?

122
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,900
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,800
It's actually the next autumn.

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,880
So I told you not to take me.

125
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,680
Hey, Kobachi!

126
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,700
You fooled me.

127
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,980
I'm not a man who gives up on things like this.

128
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,760
Alright!

129
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,300
Go!

130
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,320
Okay,

131
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,460
Here I come!

132
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,280
Ouch!

133
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,520
I'm so happy!

134
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,400
I was so happy when the genius came to give me a present.

135
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,900
But I don't think you can give up so easily.

136
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,880
That's right.

137
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,520
Oh, I'm going to make a call.

138
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,100
If you can make a call, it's now.

139
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,200
Um, Nakagawa-san.

140
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,440
Oh, that...

141
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,380
I caught up.

142
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,000
It's mine now.

143
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,840
Oh, it was a good chance.

144
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,620
You idiot.

145
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,480
Shut up!

146
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,060
I'm going to fly, Nakagawa.

147
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,980
What?

148
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,560
Well, then, please.

149
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,980
That's Ryo-chan.

150
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,980
Maybe it's just my imagination.

151
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,820
Could you go over to theé‡Œ?

152
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,320
Yes.

153
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,120
Go ahead.

154
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,260
Well, that's it.

155
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:40,360
I'll see you in less than a day.

156
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,300
What's the next bus?

157
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
"Before the school, before the school..."

158
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,160
As expected of Ryo-chan, he can't keep up with this.

159
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,980
I don't know.

160
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,540
If you say the senior's persistance, it's really more than a cockroach.

161
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,500
Finally, I got to the point where I couldn't shoot.

162
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,160
Go! Run!

163
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,400
Come on!

164
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,660
No, hurry up!

165
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,060
Come on!

166
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,860
I'm home!

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,120
You've come a long way.

168
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,240
Thank you for your help!

169
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,780
Dad, Mom, Reiko-senpai, and me...

170
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,200
It's Ryo-tsu, the senior!

171
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,900
There's really nothing here.

172
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Ryo-chan!

173
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,260
Did you really catch up with us?

174
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,280
Of course!

175
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,040
Mom, I'm glad the watermelon is cold.

176
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,580
Mom?

177
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,400
Tsu-tsu-shi, Mom, is that okay?

178
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
I'll put you to sleep in the cow's den.

179
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,840
Cow's den?

180
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,760
Stop it!

181
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,520
See? That's what a cow says.

182
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,420
Shut up! Do you understand cow language?

183
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
As expected of the rural people, they're different.

184
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,360
You're so annoying, Shinmachi Shoto!

185
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,280
It's all because of theEh?

186
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,640
These two are always like this.

187
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
They're good at breathing, aren't they?

188
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,140
I guess the more they argue, the more they get closer.

189
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,040
Oh, I'm Nakagawa.

190
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,520
Really?

191
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Let me go!

192
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

193
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,780
Let go of me!

194
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,720
I'm sorry!

195
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,680
Stop earlier.

196
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,640
The watermelon is cold, and I've just picked some tomatoes.

197
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,920
Huh? Watermelon?

198
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,800
Thank you, mother.

199
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,380
Master Koraken! Don't be so dirty!

200
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,240
You're taking it easy. I'm glad you came.

201
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,700
You're right.

202
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,880
You're manly.

203
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,260
Huh?

204
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,700
You're a nice person.

205
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,460
Y-Yeah.

206
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,660
I can't take it easy.

207
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,740
I have to ask Nakagawa-san to act as my lover soon.

208
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,320
I wonder if we can be alone somehow.

209
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,860
The corn has been boiled. How is it?

210
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,080
Here you are.

211
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,000
Thanks.

212
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,660
Ryo-chan, you're too kind.

213
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,240
That's better.

214
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,800
You're more kind.

215
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,880
We might be together for a long time.

216
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
You're right.

217
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:19,060
There's a river nearby.

218
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,180
That's right. Isn't it cute?

219
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,940
That's great. Let's go!

220
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,580
That's it! That's where we're going!

221
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,480
He's running away!

222
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,360
Here!

223
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,520
He's gone.

224
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,500
That way!

225
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,120
Let's catch him!

226
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,460
What should we do?

227
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,480
There's a hole!

228
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,420
I've got a chance!

229
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,580
Leave it to me.

230
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,320
Alright.

231
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,540
Please, Ryo-chan.

232
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,640
I've got a chance!

233
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,920
There!

234
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,080
There it is!

235
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,400
What's wrong, Nakagawa?

236
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,420
If he plays with fish, we won't catch any thieves!

237
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,740
It's alright!

238
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,240
There!

239
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,940
There!

240
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,160
There!

241
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,680
Who are you?

242
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,220
Oh, sandals.

243
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,860
Don't lose, Nakagawa! Go!

244
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,760
Kei!

245
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,080
Thank you.

246
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,580
It's hot!

247
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,960
It's hot!

248
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,360
He's a bother, after all.

249
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,800
What? Are you still bothering me?

250
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,580
I'm serious.

251
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
I told you he's a bother because he's a bother.

252
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,580
Don't wear that hat, you're a man and a woman.

253
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,140
It's a big show!

254
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,160
Oh, it's pretty good, isn't it?

255
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
I wonder if I can be alone with Nakagawa-san.

256
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,740
It was fun!

257
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,460
It's nice to be out in the countryside.

258
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,020
Hey, hey.

259
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,000
Right now,

260
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,720
I've come up with an idea.

261
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,020
Why don't we go to the Kimo Dameshi?

262
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,320
There's a good place nearby.

263
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,260
Kimo Dameshi?

264
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,100
Is this the place?

265
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,020
To do the Kimo Dameshi?

266
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,420
It's a pretty old tunnel.

267
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,340
Yeah.

268
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
It seems to have been abandoned decades ago.

269
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,340
This tunnel is said to be run by a ghost train.

270
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,880
A ghost train?

271
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,940
Really?

272
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,700
Yeah, it is.

273
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,920
It's about the Pacific War.

274
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,680
There was an air raid.

275
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,720
The tunnel collapsed due to a bomb.

276
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,500
The train was destroyed.

277
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,660
It seems that all the people who were on it have died.

278
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,040
It seems that no one is living here.

279
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,940
It had been launched.

280
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,340
Theziehen and I went with the train.

281
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,720
It was the last train.

282
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:19,740
It wasn't the last train.

283
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,520
But after that, there was another.

284
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,460
the last train.

285
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,800
It was the last train.

286
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,020
It was the last train.

287
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,740
And one thing led to the end.

288
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,000
It was the last train.

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,080
Ya, it was the last train!

290
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,640
It was the last train.

291
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,940
Nakagawa and I will compete who can go further and get back home.

292
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,820
Sounds fun, right? Let's go, Nakagawa.

293
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,240
Hey, hey. Are you seriously going to test your guts?

294
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,920
What?

295
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,480
It's fine. This way, Kei-chan and I can be alone.

296
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,740
What are you going to do if we're alone?

297
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,060
I thought Komachi-chan was acting weird.

298
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,620
What are you talking about?

299
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,460
It has nothing to do with Ryo-chan.

300
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,320
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,940
I'm finally alone, but I can't hear anything.

302
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,520
I have to hurry up and tell him!

303
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,420
U-Um...

304
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,400
Nakagawa-san...

305
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,900
I have a request for you...

306
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,360
It's like you're confessing your love.

307
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,400
Please tell me.

308
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,340
N-Nakagawa-san, you're so bold...

309
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,760
What is it? Tell me.

310
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,660
U-Um...

311
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,620
It's fine if you're here, but in front of your parents,

312
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,280
can you...

313
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,580
Can you...

314
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,640
Can you be my lover?

315
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,620
I-I can't...

316
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,080
This weakness...

317
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,680
Show me your heart...

318
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,860
Is this supposed to be...

319
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,040
You can't.

320
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,540
You don't have to play after me.

321
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,940
relationships here...

322
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,320
Answer me.

323
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,660
Say, okay?

324
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,720
Say, okay?

325
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,360
Say, okay?

326
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,880
Say, okay?

327
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,140
No.

328
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,620
Say, okay?

329
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,360
My eyes...

330
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,820
Gyaaaaah!

331
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,760
That's Komachi's scream!

332
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh! Oh!

333
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,300
It's you!

334
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,080
Huh. You know me well.

335
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,800
Piece of cake.

336
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,300
What?

337
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,000
Congattoryu Ninjutsu Saigo Koganemaru?

338
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,960
Nice to meet you.

339
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,140
Then what was Nakagawa-san's voice like?

340
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,940
"Ninpo, talk to me!"

341
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,560
"Let's kiss our love, Japan!"

342
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,140
"That's terrible!"

343
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,580
"Who made a door here?"

344
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,560
"Be quiet!"

345
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,980
"N-N-Nakagawa-san!"

346
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,640
"Sorry, it's not him!"

347
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,100
"Kissing our love..."

348
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,140
"What?"

349
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,160
"No, he did it again!"

350
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,400
"Ow, ow, ow!"

351
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,260
"What the hell was that?"

352
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,860
"I thought it went well."

353
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,280
"You're Gormo's grandpa, aren't you?"

354
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,360
"What are you doing here?"

355
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,060
"I'm training for a camp in Ninjutsu."

356
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,420
"I'll find you! Farewell!"

357
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
"What are you doing, Gormo?"

358
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,780
"What are you doing, Gormo?"

359
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,400
"I'm training for a camp in Ninjutsu."

360
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,600
"How dare you hide from me!"

361
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,380
"I don't want to!"

362
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,320
"How dare you!"

363
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,600
"So maybe you're in this tunnel, too, Volu?"

364
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,380
"That guy's scary. What if there's a ghost train in this tunnel?"

365
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,020
"A-a-a-ah!"

366
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,620
"A-a-a-a-ah!"

367
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,800
It's Borubo.

368
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,320
I ate the sand.

369
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,960
Borubo!

370
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,780
Idiot!

371
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,920
It's me!

372
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,760
Ryotsu, why are you here?

373
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,360
I see.

374
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,260
But is it true?

375
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,860
There's a ghost train in this tunnel?

376
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,820
If something like that happened, the tunnel would be destroyed.

377
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,420
Grandpa.

378
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,500
By the way, what time is it now?

379
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,920
Well...

380
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,440
It's just 0 in the morning.

381
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,840
I don't want to.

382
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,740
I'm getting scared all of a sudden.

383
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,040
Hey, let's go back.

384
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,600
Yeah.

385
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,320
Why are you scared?

386
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,400
You said you'd try it yourself, didn't you?

387
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,020
Even if you say that...

388
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,720
Ghost train is a story of creation.

389
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,180
The tracks are vibrating.

390
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,500
Again?

391
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,420
You can't scare me.

392
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,020
I'm not lying.

393
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,360
Put your feet on it.

394
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,940
Oh, it's true.

395
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,020
But why?

396
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,800
Something's running on the rails.

397
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,840
What do you mean?

398
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,940
Do you know?

399
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,740
It's coming.

400
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,020
It's the real ghost train.

401
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,320
No.

402
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,760
No way.

403
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,040
I can't believe it.

404
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,560
I can't understand how.

405
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,340
I'll cut you off later.

406
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:51,660
Huh?

407
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,840
I'm not scared of you.

408
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,960
The grass on the road is against us.

409
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,320
Get lost!

410
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,340
Nobody's talking to me anymore.

411
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:03,960
What special issue do you need here?

412
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,780
Yaaay!

413
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,000
Yaaay!

414
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,760
Yaaay!

415
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,140
Yaaay!

416
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,860
Yaaay!

417
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,160
Yaaay!

418
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,740
Yaaay!

419
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,160
Yaaay!

420
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,340
Not this one!

421
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,960
It's a diesel locomotive!

422
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:22,440
What?

423
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,180
What were you doing here?

424
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,120
What are you doing?

425
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,820
We're growing mushrooms!

426
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,060
Mushrooms?

427
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,140
It's wet in the tunnel, so it's perfect for growing mushrooms.

428
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,020
It's wet in the tunnel, so it's perfect for growing mushrooms.

429
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,200
We'll harvest it by night to get it in the right place.

430
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,880
We'll harvest it by night to get it in the right place.

431
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,700
You're making things so confusing.

432
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,640
You're making things so confusing.

433
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,700
What's that sound?

434
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,700
What's that sound?

435
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:48,900
What?

436
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,280
It's the missile from before!

437
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh no! It was an automatic pursuit!

438
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:53,940
That's ridiculous!

439
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,420
What?

440
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,560
Yaaay!

441
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,400
Yaaay!

442
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,520
Yaaay!

443
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,260
What's that sound?

444
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,260
What's that sound?

445
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,440
What?

446
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,720
You guys...

447
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,740
You guys...

448
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,060
What?

449
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,320
What is it, Dad?

450
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,460
Ryotsu-san, I'm a mischievous child...

451
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:23,600
Ryotsu-san, I'm a mischievous child...

452
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,460
Please take care of me.

453
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,860
Please take care of me.

454
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,320
They're all misunderstanding me!

455
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm not a spoiled child like you, you can't blame me.

456
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,620
I'm not a spoiled child like you, you can't blame me.

457
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,700
I'm not a spoiled child like you, you can't blame me.

458
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,660
You can turn me into a spoiled child!

459
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,620
What did you say?

460
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,400
There must be something fishy going on...

461
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,860
There must be something shady going on...

462
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,860
I don't know about you, but it doesn't seem to be us.

463
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,940
I don't know about you, but it doesn't seem to be us.

464
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,300
Please stop right there.

465
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,140
I hate you so much!

466
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,080
If you think you're a stiff skeleton,

467
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,760
you think you're a meteor from space.

468
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,360
Then your body will get lighter.

469
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,460
Then you'll get heavier.

470
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,300
It's you again, Professor Ezaki!

471
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,740
Next time, "A Gift From Space."

472
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,840
Don't send it!

473
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,140
The End

474
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,780
kameari no hoshi ga kururi to wa o kai sa

475
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,500
Kore de ii darou!

476
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,120
ii wake nee darou!
