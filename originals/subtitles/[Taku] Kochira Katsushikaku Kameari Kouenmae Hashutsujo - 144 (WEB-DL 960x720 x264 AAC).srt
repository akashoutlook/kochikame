Stradivari! The Great Chase

23
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:55,260
The Great Chase

24
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,320
Here it is!

25
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,800
The world's best violin magician, Michelangelo Gandini, has arrived!

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,440
Gandini is the first to arrive as part of the world tour.

27
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,920
Is this Reiko's teacher?

28
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,820
Yes, he has been teaching personal lessons for 7 years since he was 5 years old in Paris.

29
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,040
He taught personal lessons for 7 years.

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,140
He is very popular.

31
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,700
I am surprised that there is such a person who is interested in violin in Japan.

32
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,320
There are many young fans of classical music.

33
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,980
I can only hear the lullaby.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,420
He always smiles like this, but his lessons were tough.

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,380
He is always busy with 4 hours a day.

36
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,740
Oh, he is invited to today's party.

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,820
Is that so?

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,800
Actually, I also know him.

39
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,480
He will attend this party.

40
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,340
Our company will be a power for him next time.

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,620
It is a 100-person party, right?

42
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,280
Only 100 people from Japan are invited, but two people from our restaurant will also attend.

43
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,440
It seems that only very close people except the staff are invited.

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,060
Of course, there will be something that you can't eat often.

45
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,060
All right!

46
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,520
Take me with you.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,440
I will give you an invitation.

48
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,980
Thank you very much for coming!

49
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,320
You can dive into this place even the Kurobeukuu dates.

50
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,680
I'm okay with it, but please wear a backstable and tie.

51
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,780
Please do not make a fuss.

52
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,160
I know.

53
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,560
Do not treat me as a child.

54
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,780
6 hours later.

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,800
The 2nd day.

56
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,540
Finished!

57
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,260
10 hours.

58
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,420
Please go home.

59
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:49,780
The End

60
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,300
I'm so happy!

61
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,740
I'm so happy!

62
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,660
I'm so happy!

63
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,360
That was a wonderful performance, Ryo-chan!

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,140
That was a wonderful performance, Ryo-chan!

65
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,040
If you don't use that famous Stradivarius like your own body,

66
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,160
If you don't use that famous Stradivarius like your own body,

67
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,580
If you don't use that famous Stradivarius like your own body,

68
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,160
you won't be able to make that sound!

69
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,220
If you eat too much, your stomach will stick out.

70
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,020
What are you talking about?

71
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,580
It's Stradivarius!

72
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,060
It's about the violin that you have!

73
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,420
Is that Stradivarius that amazing?

74
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,160
Is that Stradivarius that amazing?

75
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,120
It's Stradivarius!

76
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,060
It's the world's best instrument!

77
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,340
If you use Stradivarius,

78
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:26,840
if you use Stradivarius,

79
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,180
it's worth 300 million yen, right?

80
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,180
What?

81
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,380
That's too much, Ryo-chan!

82
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,620
Does that Dodecadene cost 300 million yen?

83
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,740
It's Stradivarius!

84
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,640
From the 17th century to the 18th century,

85
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,980
in the Cremona region of Italy,

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,560
Antonio Stradivarius was the most famous violinist

87
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
in the world!

88
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,240
Antonio Stradivarius is the most famous violinist

89
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,600
Antonio Stradivarius is the most famous violinist

90
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,200
I don't know anyone who's not interested in violin.

91
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,980
But no matter how good the instrument is,

92
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,640
it's a treasure if you don't have the skills

93
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,540
Mr. Gandini is the world's best.

94
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,660
Mr. Gandini is the world's best.

95
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:05,680
Hm,

96
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,060
you're a different person from us.

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,220
You're a different person from us.

98
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,060
Oh,

99
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,060
Reiko-kun!

101
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,420
Mr. Gandini!

102
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,380
You've grown so big!

103
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,340
Mr. Gandini!

104
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,480
Please let me down!

105
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,780
You've grown so big!

106
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,780
You were this small when I taught you.

107
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,920
You were this small when I taught you.

108
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,660
No, it wasn't like that.

109
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,920
No, it wasn't like that.

110
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,480
You're a generous teacher.

111
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,340
Hm? Are you friends?

112
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,420
Yes.

113
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
I'm Nakagawa.

114
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,780
My father often hears about you.

115
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,580
Oh, Mr. Ryuichiro.

116
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
Nice to meet you.

117
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,400
And this is...

118
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,340
My senpai.

119
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,040
Oh, senpai! Nice to meet you!

120
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,260
N-No!

121
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,100
I'm not a senpai!

122
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,360
Well, whatever.

123
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:02,940
Well, whatever.

124
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,240
Ugh, I ate too much.

125
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,040
Senpai, you ate too much.

126
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,480
Hey, Ryo-chan, Kei-chan!

127
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,600
I'm in trouble.

128
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,900
Mr. Gandini wants to see you in Japan.

129
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,960
I'm in trouble.

130
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,560
You're in trouble?

131
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,560
But you have a lot of schedules.

132
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,400
That's right. What should I do?

133
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,020
I don't know.

134
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,000
I thought the world we live in was completely different.

135
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,460
I thought the world we live in was completely different.

136
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,220
But I can talk to you.

137
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,300
All right! I'll let you go!

138
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,100
What? Let you go?

139
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,100
Don't panic.

140
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,780
That's strange.

141
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:40,480
I heard a voice.

142
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,580
What are you going to do, senpai?

143
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,440
Don't be afraid!

144
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,420
I'll go to the elevator at once!

145
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,800
Yes!

146
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,600
Now! Let's go!

147
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,460
Senpai!

148
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,280
Nakagawa, open the door!

149
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,480
All right, it went well.

150
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,960
But what are we going to do now?

151
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,500
If you want to see the lower town, you have to go to Asakusa!

152
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,400
If you want to see the lower town, you have to go to Asakusa!

153
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,420
You can find this place at Asakusa.

154
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,960
It's near Asakusa, right?

155
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,060
Yes.

156
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,160
Eh?

157
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,300
Where?

158
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,420
Ah, is that so?

159
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,560
I'll take you to Bamu-jutsu.

160
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,400
I knew this place before I got here.

161
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,140
He's so loud, president!

162
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,120
Uh... Manager, are you listening to something?

163
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,280
When I realized, he was already gone.

164
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,380
He didn't go back to the hotel room, either.

165
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,320
Oh no! We have to hurry and find the Tokyo Beast!

166
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,400
If anything happens, it'll be bad!

167
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,060
Yes, sir!

168
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,840
Oh, this Tsukudani is the best!

169
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,120
What an interesting foreigner!

170
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,720
I can taste the taste of a girl's Tsukudani.

171
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,080
This foreigner is a good boy!

172
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,880
Of course not!

173
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,100
A girl's Tsukudani? Is this a girl's Tsukudani?

174
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,380
Oh, no, no!

175
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,280
A girl is a girl!

176
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,240
An old girl is a old woman!

177
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:27,920
Okay?

178
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,660
Oh, yes!

179
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,840
I'm scared because you're pretty good at this.

180
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,820
Mr. G, are you here?

181
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,920
What? You're the three brothers from the G-san Comic Band, aren't you?

182
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,360
Oh, you guys are doing music, too?

Oh, that's great, Mr. G!

I'll get in your way, Mr. G.

186
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,380
Oh, good! Come on, come on!

187
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,800
Here, Gomi!

188
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,400
I don't know what "resistance" is.

Oh, this is the best part!

209

"I'm still sleepy..."

230
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,420
"Wake up! If you're late, you'll never be able to speak again!"

231
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,060
"Wake up! If you're late, you'll never be able to speak again!"

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,780
"Yes, but teacher, is today's concert okay?"

237
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,720
"Hahaha, don't worry about it!"

238
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,160
"What's wrong?"

239
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,200
"No, this isn't my violin!"

240
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,400
"What?!"

241
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,840
"Huh?!"

242
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,300
"Huh?!"

243
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,540
"Huh?!"

244
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,440
"Huh?!"

245
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,620
"Huh?!"

246
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
"What?!

247
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,360
"What?! It's not a 300 million yen Miso Hibari!"

248
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,180
"It's a Stradivarius, senpai!"

249
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,080
"Oh, I get it, I get it!"

250
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,540
"Oh, I get it, I get it!"

251
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,360
"So, is it really wrong? Where's the difference?"

252
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,480
"The Stradivarius is the same as my body!"

253
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,380
"The Stradivarius is the same as my body!"

254
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,020
"I can tell right away!"

255
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,600
"But, the difference is..."

256
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,480
"The three Janken brothers, Pakichi-san,"

257
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,840
"Mistakenly brought the Stradivarius!"

258
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,140
"Mistakenly brought the Stradivarius!"

259
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,960
"Oh, no! I have to do something!"

260
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,180
"Hey, wake up, dad! Wake up!"

261
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,720
"Hmm, I'm sorry."

262
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,720
"It's not about the sake. Do you know where the two old ladies went?"

263
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:26,800
"It's not about the sake. Do you know where the two old ladies went?"

264
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,100
"Hmm, hmm..."

265
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,240
"I think they have work in Osaka today."

266
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,760
"Osaka?!" "Osaka?!"

267
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,300
"I have to get it back quickly!"

268
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,080
"The concert starts at 4 o'clock!"

269
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,540
"Don't worry! I'll get it back for sure!"

270
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,160
"Don't worry! I'll get it back for sure!"

271
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,320
"Let's go!" "Yes!"

272
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,940
"Ah, damn it! I'm late!"

273
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,560
"What should we do, Ryo-chan?"

274
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,400
"Nakagawa, it's a helicopter!"

275
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,020
"Call a helicopter!" "Yes!"

276
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,660
"We're counting on you, senpai!"

277
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,880
"Ryo-chan, please!"

278
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,020
"Hm!"

279
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,240
"We're going to catch the Shinkansen!" "Yes!"

280
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,600
"Yes!"

281
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,420
"Ah, damn it! I'm late! I'm late!"

282
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,060
"Ah, damn it! I'm late!"

283
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,160
"Ah, damn it! I'm late!"

284
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,320
"Okay, then let's go to the venue with Master Gandini!"

285
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,000
"Okay, then let's go to the venue with Master Gandini!"

286
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,100
"Okay, then let's go to the venue with Master Gandini!" "Yes!"

287
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,840
"I'll be waiting for you!"

288
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,680
"Alright! There!"

289
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,020
"Let's go!"

290
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,480
"Yes!"

291
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,880
"I'll be waiting for you!"

292
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,940
"Easy! Slowly!"

293
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,320
"Slowly down!"

294
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,260
"Hmph!"

295
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,880
"I'll be waiting for you!"

296
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,440
"Damn, the river is in the way!"

297
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,640
"I'll be waiting for you!"

298
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:51,980
"Huh?"

299
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,240
"Aaah!"

300
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,700
"Aaah!"

301
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,000
"Alright!"

302
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,720
"Aaah!"

303
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,120
"Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!"

304
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,200
"Damn!"

305
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,840
"Aaah!"

306
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,080
"Aaaaah!"

307
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:04,760
"Aaaaah!"

308
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,340
"Hmph!"

309
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,800
"I'm falling, Maruken!"

310
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:12,580
"Huh?"

311
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,180
"Ah, it hurts!"

312
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,280
"Hey, good job, Gipper!"

313
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,560
"Wake up!"

314
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,140
"Damn, I can't wake up because I'm so sleepy!"

315
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,780
"Hmm..."

316
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,480
"Aaah! Hey, it's me, Paki..."

317
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,140
"Aaaah!"

318
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,760
"Ugh, it's almost time..."

319
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,920
"Well, I'm relieved."

320
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,160
"The teacher came back and..."

321
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,460
"If you're going to the teacher's place, you should tell him that."

322
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,800
He's trying to improve his concentration before the concert.

323
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,880
That's right. Please be quiet.

324
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,180
Yes, sir. We will head over there.

325
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,740
We don't have much time left.

326
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,900
I wonder if Ryo-chan will make it in time.

327
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,440
Hi-Hai-Hai...

328
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:37,600
Rebay!

329
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,060
Yeah!

330
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,540
Yes, sir!

331
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,860
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

332
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,280
Aaaaah!

333
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,620
Ouch!

334
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,280
Alright, you're doing well today.

335
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,920
Next time, we'll go higher.

336
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,020
Alright, leave it to me.

337
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,320
Aaaaah!

338
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,860
Aaaaah!

339
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,040
That's the Stradivarius!

340
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,540
What are you doing?

341
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,340
What's wrong, Kuga?

342
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,400
Why are you so quiet?

343
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,500
N-Nothing.

344
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,460
Nothing at all.

345
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,140
Then, until the day we meet again,

346
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,880
Rock, paper, scissors!

347
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,420
Huh? What's wrong?

348
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,140
The sound is strange.

349
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,580
I think it's broken.

350
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,020
I think there's a workshop nearby.

351
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,480
Let's take a look.

352
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,220
Aaaaah!

353
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Where did it go?

354
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,600
Amazing.

355
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,140
It's been an hour since we started.

356
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,320
That's right.

357
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,240
For the time being, we can't listen to the teacher's performance live.

358
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,440
What's Ryo-chan doing?

359
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,080
It's not calm to wait quietly.

360
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,580
I think it's not having fun yet.

361
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,160
But, even so, it's too good.

362
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,440
Being able to be balanced even at a time like this.

363
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,640
Yeah.

364
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,980
Shit,

365
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,740
where the hell did they go?

366
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,760
I found you!

367
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,660
Hey!

368
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,700
Buncha keeper!

369
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,860
You think they'll come back?

370
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,640
That's the only lot that I got this month.

371
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,160
It's been a long time since I came to the festival.

372
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,320
Haru, look at this number of violins.

373
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,640
Huh?

374
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,800
The violin boom is good on the second day of Gandhi's reign.

375
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,760
But if there's a business like this, it won't end in a year.

376
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,120
Well, that's what the owner says.

377
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't say that. Look at it.

378
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,900
I won't.

379
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,320
I don't know much about part-time jobs.

380
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,340
The owner is also going out.

381
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,320
I see.

382
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,620
The sound is different than usual.

383
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,220
Did I get hit by a

384
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,480
I finally caught up.

385
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,500
Why?

386
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,440
Isn't it Kankichi?

387
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,600
You guys, that violin!

388
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,940
It's a mess!

389
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,820
I didn't know which one was which.

390
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,460
What's wrong, Kankichi?

391
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,940
You're in such a hurry.

392
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,640
It's not like this.

393
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,320
I'm not in a hurry.

394
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:49,960
It's 300 million yen!

395
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,060
What happened to 300 million yen?

396
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,420
You guys made a mistake in the violin you brought.

397
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,620
You guys are this.

398
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,780
That violin is worth 300 million yen.

399
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,260
It's a Stradivarius.

400
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,100
What did you say?

401
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,380
Stradivarius?

402
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,500
Which one is that?

403
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,800
Is there anyone who knows?

404
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,580
It's impossible.

405
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,500
Huh?

406
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,940
Just looking at it doesn't change my violin.

407
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,620
I don't know.

408
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,880
You'll know by the sound.

409
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,260
It's impossible for us to hear it.

410
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:19,660
Kankichi!

411
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,000
What do we do?

412
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,240
We don't have time anymore!

413
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,920
It's time for the concert.

414
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,560
Sensei.

415
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,020
Sensei, it's about time.

416
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,160
That's...

417
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,820
It's a little inconvenient...

418
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,200
Sensei, that's...

419
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,380
Sensei!

420
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,100
You're not sleeping?

421
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,540
What are you doing?

422
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,920
Reiko, isn't it time for the concert?

423
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,460
But the Stradivarius...

424
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,800
Yes?

425
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,840
Oh, Sensei!

426
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,660
Is it from Ryo?

427
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,360
Where are you now?

428
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,500
Where is the Stradivarius?

429
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,460
The Stradivarius has returned!

430
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,660
Yes!

431
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,840
Anyway, come outside!

432
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,700
Eh? Outside?

433
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,580
Sensei, come outside!

434
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,100
Outside?

435
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,240
Outside?

436
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,180
Eh?

437
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,720
Where is the Stradivarius?

438
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,480
Where is the Stradivarius?

439
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,540
Huh?

440
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,260
Look!

441
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,640
Nagaga! Reiko!

442
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,900
There should be a Stradivarius in here!

443
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,020
Oh!

444
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,940
The Stradivarius...

445
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,060
Where is the Stradivarius?

446
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,720
Saio, where are you!

447
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,560
You're looking for the Stradivarius from all over!

448
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,820
If we check everything, it'll take us a lot longer.

449
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,920
It can't be helped!

450
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,260
I don't know what to do.

451
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,580
Sensei...

452
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,660
Everyone's waiting for my performance.

453
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,180
But from inside...

454
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,680
?

455
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,620
Hey, hey! You're an amateur, so you don't have to be so lazy to choose!

456
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,860
Hmph...

457
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,280
Thank you for waiting.

458
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,660
We will now begin the violin solo concert by Michelangelo Gandini, the magician of the violin.

459
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:52,400
I can't believe I chose Stradivarius! My journey is over!

460
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,040
Stradivarius

461
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,540
This is...

462
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,760
Stradivarius!

463
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,100
Do you understand?

464
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,840
There's no doubt about it.

465
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,900
Stradivarius

466
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:40,960
Stradivarius

467
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,420
Stradivarius

468
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,500
Stradivarius

469
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,180
Stradivarius

470
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,420
Stradivarius

471
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,460
Stradivarius

472
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,280
Teacher, that was a wonderful performance!

473
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,520
Indeed!

474
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,800
I was able to hear the world's best Stradivarius sound.

475
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,400
But you just randomly picked the violin.

476
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,760
You knew it so well.

477
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,240
It was a coincidence.

478
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:05,720
A coincidence.

479
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,820
After a glance, the teacher understood.

480
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,400
Because Stradivarius is a part of the teacher's body.

481
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,980
Reiko-kun, Mr.Nakagawa, Senpai, thank you for everything.

482
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,520
I'll come back next year. Ciao!

483
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,240
See you!

484
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,160
Senpai! I'm looking forward to a girl's violin!

485
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,900
He said a girl's violin, not a girl's violin.

486
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,080
Take care!
