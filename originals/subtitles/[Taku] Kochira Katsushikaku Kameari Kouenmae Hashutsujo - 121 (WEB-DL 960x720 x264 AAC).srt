1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:04,860
I'm

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,280
I'm

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,740
a

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,500
I'm

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,880
a

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,000
I give a

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,300
I give a

8
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,260
I give a

9
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,460
I give a

10
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:16,660
I give a

11
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,320
I give a

12
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,860
I give a

13
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,320
I give a

14
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:19,500
I give a

15
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,160
a

16
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,880
a

17
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,040
a

18
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,120
The создoy flutters,

19
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,500
looking at the sunset

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,960
The cityscape just like that won't change a single squint

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,880
It is very kind

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,280
From the waterways of the "TNGARI-POSHI"

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,380
To Kaishyukutengen

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,640
The sun goes down

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,760
Tomorrow will end like this

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,420
If I lose, I lose again

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,400
I lost my happiness

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,720
I realized, I'm such an idiot

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,320
"Ikizama Samazama"

30
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:42,580
"Ikizama Samazama"

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,660
Wow! What should I do?

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,980
What's wrong?

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,400
This.

34
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,480
Miss Honey's love fortune?

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,780
Yes, horoscope. It's a star fortune.

36
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,080
This month, her love fortune is rising rapidly.

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,280
Girls like fortune telling. Right, Nakagawa?

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:01,940
Yes.

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,880
There are always a lot of girls in front of the fortune teller near the station.

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,140
By the way,

41
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,880
I don't see many men standing in line.

42
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,440
I don't think so.

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,560
That's right.

44
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,440
If there are many men in line,

45
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,940
you'll be mistaken for a fortune teller.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,120
But even Newton and Einstein, the physicists,

47
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,080
believed in fortune telling seriously.

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,000
When people make important decisions,

49
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,480
they want to consult with someone or rely on something.

50
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,600
Mr. Reiko often has a lot of fortune tellers come to consult with him.

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,740
But the people who come to consult with him

52
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,020
are the ones who decide first.

53
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,800
What do you mean?

54
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,220
Everyone is here.

55
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,460
In his mind, he wants to do this,

56
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,160
but he seems to be in trouble because he doesn't have the courage to take a step toward it.

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,720
I see.

58
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,700
In other words, he wants to have someone he trusts push him.

59
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,440
I'm also often consulted by men.

60
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,580
But in Mr. Ryo's case,

61
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,480
he brings someone who has decided on the way to some extent to the lottery.

62
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,640
The person who did as Mr. Ryo said

63
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,540
is a good trouble.

64
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,140
Thanks to my seniors,

65
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,180
there are many people who have taken the wrong path.

66
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,520
In Mr. Ryo's case,

67
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,360
even if they are the same person,

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,640
they are the same person from the bottom of the sea.

69
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,660
Mr. Ryo may be sued by the victim group one day.

70
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,480
Hey, this is your life.

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,560
You decide what you want.

72
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,180
That's natural.

73
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,500
But it's bad to rely on someone else.

74
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,360
Mr. Ryo can do everything himself.

75
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,460
And he can make the most reckless choice without worrying about it at all before he takes action.

76
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,420
Senpai,

77
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,300
it's a digital idea of one or zero at any time.

78
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,840
Life is one or eight at any time,

79
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,600
super or half,

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,540
yes or no,

81
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,620
or either one.

82
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,040
It's a waste of time just to get lost.

83
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,640
There is no complicated and subtle problem in Ryo's life.

84
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,700
That's right.

85
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,580
Mr. Ryo's daily life is like a primitive man.

86
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,780
Indeed,

87
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,580
Senpai is enough for either yes or no.

88
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,960
Hey, don't treat people as just a single cell.

89
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,540
Oh, there was a time when I was also at a loss.

90
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,360
There was a store selling Densuke dolls for 50,000 yen.

91
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,900
Well, if it's 10,000 yen, it will be a real disappointment.

92
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,640
That's a subtle number.

93
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,700
At that time,

94
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,840
I worked as a debt collector for 10,000 yen a month.

95
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,160
50,000 yen is about 5 months' worth of living expenses.

96
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,460
I was lost.

97
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,060
There's no reason to be lost.

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,740
You don't buy anything.

99
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,520
I didn't have a job at that time, and I lost 10 kilos.

100
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,540
I don't have a job at all.

101
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,020
Did you say something?

102
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,080
No, nothing.

103
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
Anyway, I was lost for days and it was hard.

104
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,180
Oh, Densuke, Densuke, Den-den-Densuke.

105
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,560
I want it.

106
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,560
So what happened?

107
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,560
I won.

108
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,440
I got a lot of memories of my childhood with a five-month commitment.

109
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,900
It's a story full of joy, sorrow and

110
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,120
a lot of fun, isn't it?

111
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,960
Oh, Rio-chan, you sold 3 times the original price before.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,240
What are you talking about?

113
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,120
That's another story of Densuke.

114
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,180
Is that so?

115
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,000
After all, Ryo-san's only trouble is when he's in a bad mood.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,140
When he's in a bad mood.

117
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,820
When ordinary people are at the height of life,

118
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,240
They take a step forward with love and courage.

119
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,480
When Senpai is lost,

120
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,140
Greed

121
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,340
I won!

122
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,360
It's a bad thing.

123
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,740
I wonder if anyone has a desire.

124
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,500
I do.

125
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,900
Ordinary people hold it down with reason and selfishness.

126
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,160
But in Senpai's case, his desire is too strong.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,080
Ah!

128
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,680
It's not a good thing!

129
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,400
Whoa!

130
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,540
I see.

131
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,380
I won!

132
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,360
Look!

133
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,580
Isn't this the same as what Ryo-chan thought?

134
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,300
I guess.

135
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,600
What is the motto?

136
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,640
"If what you are doing now is fun, that's fine.

137
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,280
What you want is money.

138
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,080
You want to live a comfortable life in the future.

139
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,940
I see.

140
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,920
It's the same as Senpai.

141
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,760
Look at that.

142
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,740
Young people are the same.

143
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,100
It's the same. Even if you are lost, you can't leave it without buying it.

144
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,660
It doesn't matter if it's greedy or not.

145
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,080
In that sense, the times may have caught up with you.

146
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,380
Right?

147
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,800
But in your case, you can earn premiums, rare values, etc.

148
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,540
There are many other times.

149
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,660
Reiko, you too, if you get lost in shopping, you'll be greedy, right?

150
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,800
I don't get lost.

151
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,480
For example, if you have to choose a pet dog, you'll choose the cutest dog.

152
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,900
No, I'm a love-hate relationship, so I'll buy everything.

153
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,880
Oh, Terai, if you get lost, you'll be greedy, right?

154
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,340
I won't buy it if I get lost.

155
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,680
Nakagawa, how about you?

156
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,720
I leave everything to the secretary.

157
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,520
For example, if you are at the company level, you can buy everything at 2000 yen.

158
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,840
Of course, I'll choose the one who makes a profit when I buy a million yen.

159
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,060
That's natural as a president and as a company.

160
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,780
No, I choose the one who has a better global environment than money.

161
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,720
Global environment?

162
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,240
Ryo-chan, are you okay?

163
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,600
I got it. You guys are rich and decent people.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,080
I'm a man who can only move greedily.

165
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,600
Don't underestimate the poor, you guys.

166
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,380
No, I'm not saying that I'm poor.

167
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,040
Shut up.

168
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,120
Stop it.

169
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,600
Who told you to analyze me?

170
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,100
Thank you for your help.

171
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,920
Ryo-san, you should rethink the way in which you should live by being greedy and avoiding it.

172
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,820
Shut up.

173
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,160
I decide my life.

174
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,200
No, no, no, no.

175
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,060
Eat more.

176
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,980
Senior.

177
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,180
How do you do, Ryo-tsuku?

178
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,060
Chief.

179
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,240
Well.

180
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,620
Well, well.

181
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,840
They are the ones who are so good at how to pull people.

182
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,520
Life is different.

183
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,580
Life plans are different for each person.

184
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,840
Oh, you had a life plan?

185
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,020
I'd like you to tell me.

186
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,880
Well, it's a little rough.

187
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,580
Idiot.

188
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,100
It's normal to set a life goal and pull the rails.

189
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,240
You are the same as a toy car that is bent and hit.

190
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,400
You are the same.

191
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,920
You will not be able to decide where to go when you get old.

192
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,020
That's rude.

193
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,620
You just want to go to the easy side.

194
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,320
You want to go to the easy side.

195
00:08:59,660 --> 00:08:59,860
You are just walking on the snow.

196
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,040
What is your life plan, you idiot?

197
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,440
For senior, the chief is a stopper instead of a rational.

198
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,660
That's right.

199
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,800
The end.

200
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,180
What are you talking about?

201
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,380
Ryo-san.

202
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,620
No. 8 is yours.

203
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,420
I don't want to buy it.

204
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,500
I've already stopped buying cars that have such a desire.

205
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,740
I've already stopped buying cars that have such a desire.

206
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,920
I'm going to buy smart cars like a British gentleman.

207
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,040
You can race just by desire.

208
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,020
You don't know what romance is.

209
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,800
But no. 8 is big when it comes.

210
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:42,900
It's a waste to erase no. 8.

211
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,400
No. 8 is a waste to erase no. 8.

212
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,420
What are you talking about?

213
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,460
I'm going to buy no. 8.

214
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,260
I'm going to buy no. 8 and wash it completely.

215
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,300
You have to.

216
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,680
I'm going to buy it.

217
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,600
Okay.

218
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,400
You'll make money.

219
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,700
Oh no.

220
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,780
I was pushed by the behind.

221
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,820
There is a straight line.

222
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,360
No. 8 has a shot.

223
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,500
No. 8 has a shot.

224
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,520
I did it!

225
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,220
Ryo, you did it!

226
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,060
I'm close to 500,000!

227
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,300
Ryo, the next race, the "Tanihayate" is strong, but it's not popular.

228
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,840
If this comes, it will be a big trap.

229
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,640
No, I'll buy my favorite horse this time.

230
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,720
But the hole is big when it hits.

231
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,500
This is also thanks to greed.

232
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,660
What's wrong, Ryo?

233
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,140
Are you okay?

234
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,420
I'm a little stuck.

235
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,980
Where are you going?

236
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,640
Damn it! I can't lose to greed!

237
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,200
I'll be fine.

238
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,360
"Tanihayate" is 500,000!

239
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,060
The four corners have been turned.

240
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,720
The front camera is about to run away.

241
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,720
"Tanihayate" is attacking.

242
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,580
The goal!

243
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,300
No. 3, please!

244
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,640
It is confirmed!

245
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,400
"Tanihayate" has won the first game!

246
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,420
I did it!

247
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,880
It's here!

248
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,640
Ryo, it's a single win, so I'll get 50 times.

249
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,500
50 times!

250
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,360
25 million!

251
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,320
Let's change the fast place and send it to Ginza today.

252
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,060
That's right.

253
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,720
Winning is important.

254
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,620
I'll make 25 million a billion yen in the next race.

255
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,060
Yes!

256
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm sure the next main race will be the best in 24.

257
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,160
It's the most popular, but it should be four or five times.

258
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,880
I'll get on the big 100 million.

259
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,580
100 million!

260
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,720
What?

261
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,680
I'm dead!

262
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,900
Ryo, are you going to buy it?

263
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,000
No, greed is free!

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,940
I'll take this mask home.

265
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,640
I see.

266
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,860
I have a feeling that I'll make a little profit, so I'll be obsessed with greed.

267
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,200
If I throw away the bad things, greed will disappear.

268
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,400
"Tanihayate"

269
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,900
But I may make a profit.

270
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,260
It's getting bigger!

271
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,320
I can't do it anymore.

272
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,400
Excuse me.

273
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,580
It's a big loss!

274
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:35,780
I'll buy it!

275
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,500
2425 million yen!

276
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,760
Yes!

277
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,880
Ryo, stop!

278
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,940
Did you really spend a lot of money on the race?

279
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,220
Yes.

280
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,120
I heard that you bought 25 million yen by contacting your senior friends.

281
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,040
What?

282
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,140
There they are.

283
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,200
I stopped the car, but I lost because of the difference in the nose.

284
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,360
He's being crushed by his desires.

285
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,260
It's miserable.

286
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,540
What a shame.

287
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,500
I'm going to eat you up.

288
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,240
The face is the source of the trouble.

289
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,700
Alright!

290
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,160
Ah, good morning!

291
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,300
No, Ryo-chan, you're sleepy.

292
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,440
Huh?

293
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,240
The top of your head is flat.

294
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,340
Here.

295
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,420
Ah, that's true.

296
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,180
I slept like a weirdo for 30 hours after opening the nightclub, so I fell asleep.

297
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,460
Even so, you're perfectly flat.

298
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I feel like I want to put something on.

299
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,660
Me too.

300
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,900
It's really flat.

301
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,980
Yeah, that's true.

302
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,660
It's very stable.

303
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,120
I often hear that the back of your head is flat, but Ryo-chan's is the top of the head.

304
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,340
What's wrong?

305
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,460
It's flat!

306
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,340
Give me more!

307
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,460
How about this?

308
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,440
It's flat!

309
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,180
How about this?

310
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,200
Ah! It's flat! It's flat!

311
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,640
I'll have fun with my head!

312
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,520
But it's too late.

313
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,960
I have to go to the wedding of childhood friends from this afternoon.

314
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:27,980
I can't.

315
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,460
No, it's not.

316
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,900
You can count on me.

317
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:32,960
All right.

318
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,740
You can count on me.

319
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,220
And then...

320
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,160
Do you want to use the real set spray?

321
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:38,880
Yes.

322
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,600
Finished!

323
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,060
So you're awake.

324
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,900
This is how you get on in the end of the day.

325
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,500
You're back to normal, Raycon.

326
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,540
Yeah, I'm delayed.

327
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,760
It's not like any of those set up lotion we can find in the market.

328
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,920
You're such a Hahahahaha!

329
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
You've got great judgment!

330
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,300
Soup's too plain to 예�!

331
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,060
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

332
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,180
Wait a moment.

333
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,460
I'm going to ask my friend's stylist for advice.

334
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,100
I've never seen such a hair.

335
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,340
It doesn't look like a human hair.

336
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,560
It won't be fixed with a hair dryer.

337
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,340
You're right.

338
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,460
Well then.

339
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,160
Ready? Go!

340
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,140
That's not good, Ugo-chan!

341
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,560
Nagagawa, what's wrong with that woman?

342
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,780
Yoko is a top-class hair and makeup artist in charge of Hollywood movies and special makeup.

343
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,240
Nice to meet you.

344
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,720
Special makeup?

345
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,020
Yes.

346
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,620
I have to fly to Los Angeles soon today.

347
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,320
It's not on sale, but we have a special makeup spray that we use.

348
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,560
This is it.

349
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,420
First of all,

350
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,360
apply the A spray,

351
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,140
brush your hair,

352
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,380
and then apply the B spray.

353
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,320
See, it's completely fixed.

354
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,960
Oh, it's fixed.

355
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,140
You're a pro.

356
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,040
You should be able to set it up easily.

357
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,860
You should use this from the beginning.

358
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,100
It was a great help.

359
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,900
Thank you.

360
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,880
Ryo, set the A spray and fix the B spray.

361
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,740
Okay, thank you.

362
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,960
Well, I'm going.

363
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,100
Ryo, if you're going to a wedding, let's separate the seven colors.

364
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,180
Can you do that?

365
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:33,900
Yes.

366
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,740
I'll set it up with the B spray.

367
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,240
It's done, Ryo-chan.

368
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,220
Oh, it's really done.

369
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,740
It looks good on you, Senpai.

370
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,260
It's really a great spray.

371
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,140
Yeah, I've given up hair styles other than square-cutting before.

372
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,820
Now that I look at it, I'm a pretty man.

373
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,040
It's a good thing I went to the wedding reception.

374
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,980
It's a good thing I went to the reception,

375
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,680
because there are many couples who are newly engaged.

376
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,660
Senpai, do your best.

377
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,560
Oh, I see.

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,480
Okay.

379
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,100
I'll study more hair styles.

380
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,820
Ryo-chan might wake up in a fashionable way after hearing this.

381
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,440
That's a good trend.

382
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,300
It looks like Tamori from the past.

383
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,140
This is also interesting.

384
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,920
It looks like a child.

385
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,340
Let's do more.

386
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll study more hair styles.

387
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,880
Senpai is late.

388
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,280
I'm sure he's playing with that spray.

389
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,940
Oh, Senpai is calling.

390
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,740
Senpai, what's wrong?

391
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,680
It's a big problem.

392
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,260
It's hardened.

393
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,240
It's not strange to have natural styles.

394
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,000
That's a mask.

395
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,620
The mask, the mask has hardened.

396
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,280
Don't tell me.

397
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,100
Ah, it's true.

398
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,700
I did a lot of things, but in the end I decided to make my hair hard in the original style.

399
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,720
When I apply the B spray,

400
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,140
I realized that I didn't have a magic bag with me.

401
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,600
When I thought I had it, I accidentally put it on my face and it hardened.

402
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,820
Even if it didn't harden with that face...

403
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,680
Why don't you put on a spray that will bring it back to normal?

404
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,540
I used it too much, so the A side of my face became empty first.

405
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,940
It's true! It doesn't move at all!

406
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,560
What should I do about my blood pressure?

407
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,520
It's okay. You'll be fine by then.

408
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,860
Excuse me.

409
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,020
Yes? I want to know where you are.

410
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,960
Yes, yes, miss, where are you?

411
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,720
No, I'm not angry!

412
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,360
Even if you say you're not angry with that face...

413
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,060
Nakagawa, call that hairdresser back!

414
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,680
I'm calling him back now!

415
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,500
I know that it's hardened, but that face is scary.

416
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,940
Huh?

417
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,280
I'm sorry, senior. I'm already out of power after standing in the alley.

418
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,660
Okay, I'll be back in a little while.

419
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,480
I think I'm getting scared.

420
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,360
Really?

421
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,980
If you sit up straight and eat something, it will look natural.

422
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,140
Ugh...

423
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,580
And when you hold the microphone or the stick, the demon will be easily affected.

424
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,500
How about eyelash extensions or something?

425
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,880
The more you do it...

426
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,780
It's startling to me.

427
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,880
Hey!

428
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,960
Don't play with the face!

429
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,040
Huh?

430
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,260
Oh no! It's time!

431
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,060
...

432
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,100
You're really going to keep that face?

433
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,980
I'm being asked to speak on behalf of my friend.

434
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,580
I can't say no.

435
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,360
Hey, you can change your expression with this.

436
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,960
Zero-Han tape?

437
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,900
The tall man in the corner is also great.

438
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,320
I got a beautiful bride.

439
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,360
Besides, what's with the naked face?

440
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,020
It's true, Kankichi.

441
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,900
There are many reasons for this.

442
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,500
But it's painful to swallow without biting.

443
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,880
I finally got in.

444
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,760
It's painful, but it's a waste to leave it.

445
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,820
It's painful.

446
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,840
I swallowed it at last.

447
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,900
I wonder if I can eat more comfortably.

448
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,960
Kankichi, you should get married soon.

449
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,700
Yeah!

450
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,220
You bastard!

451
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,260
What are you doing to your parents?

452
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,920
If you're lucky, you should go to your parents.

453
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,780
It's nothing.

454
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,680
Oh, my God.

455
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,540
The tape was removed.

456
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,240
Hey, wait a minute.

457
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,700
I have to hold it until I speak.

458
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,860
He's having a strange face again.

459
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,620
How about wine?

460
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

461
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,620
How is it?

462
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,140
I'll take it.

463
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,140
Okay.

464
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,540
You're a good man.

465
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:50,660
You're a good man.

466
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,660
Thank you.

467
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,480
I'm sorry.

468
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,100
What?

469
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,020
Oh, I got it.

470
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,040
It's off again.

471
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,360
It's easy to peel off the tape.

472
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,900
I was surprised.

473
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,240
What are you going to do if you're surprised?

474
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,840
I have to make a face as soon as possible.

475
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,340
It's time for speech.

476
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,620
I'm sorry.

477
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,100
I'm sorry.

479
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:19,580
I'm sorry.

480
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,180
I'm sorry.

481
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,960
I have to apologize that I should say goodbye.

482
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,080
This is the end of this match.

483
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,240
I am very sorry.

484
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,440
It's half past ten.

485
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,820
You should say something to Mr. Shin.

486
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,940
I'm sorry.

487
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:34,800
Eh?

488
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,600
Are you fine?

489
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,000
He's fine?

490
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,280
I'm fine.

491
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,080
Let's play some games.

492
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,560
Yeah.

493
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,060
I see.

494
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,460
Mr. Simp.

495
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:45,900
I'm the future.

496
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,460
It's Kan-kichi!

497
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,440
Huh? It's Kan-chan!

498
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,880
What's wrong with you?

499
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,740
I'm not mad!

500
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,940
Look, you're smiling.

501
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,140
No matter how you look at it, your face is angry!

502
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,240
Even if my face is angry, my heart is blessed.

503
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,340
Takabou's wife, congratulations on your new trip!

504
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,500
Thank you.

505
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,520
You idiot!

506
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,400
What are you doing?

507
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,340
You're not getting married, so you're going to ruin someone's wedding.

508
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,820
How much do you want to be a boy?

509
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,900
I told you I didn't mean that!

510
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,140
You idiot!

511
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,680
You're a jerk.

512
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,240
You're not good enough to your parents.

513
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,880
What's with the parents?

514
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,480
Be like your parents!

515
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,440
You two, come with me!

516
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,260
You bastard!

517
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,000
Our cake is...

518
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,760
Senpai!

519
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,660
Senpai!

520
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,380
Let's play!

521
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:43,520
Hey, you!

522
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
There's still a little left!

523
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,740
What?

524
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,600
Really?

525
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,320
There's just a little left!

526
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,560
Good for you, Ryo-chan.

527
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,820
Okay, all set!

528
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,500
Now we just need to use this B spray to harden it.

529
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,360
We don't have to harden it anymore, right?

530
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,840
What are you saying?

531
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,880
Since it's already been decided,

532
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,500
if we harden it with this,

533
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,140
we won't have to sleep for 2 or 3 more days.

534
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,900
And if we decide on a speech,

535
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,320
you're replaced.

536
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,620
Your back and top of the head,

537
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,360
And you have to fix your bangs...

538
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,240
Ouch!

539
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,180
-Senpai! -You're hurting me!

540
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,600
I drank a little spray!

541
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,780
Shinro and I were childhood friends in elementary school.

542
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,860
We both studied and played sports together.

543
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,620
We even fought sometimes.

544
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,500
He's very good, unlike me.

545
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,600
I always had his notebook at my desk.

546
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,580
Thanks to that, I graduated from elementary school without any difficulties.
