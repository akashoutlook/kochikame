1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,300
When you're on TV

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,060
Make the room look brighter

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,140
And take a look away

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:34,160
A night coming up on the inside

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,560
I wonder if you're going to the gym that you used to go to

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:48,060
She laughed at me saying I was just a kid

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,940
Even if I try to cheer up somewhere, I can't do it

8
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:01,080
The cityscape that doesn't change even one yawn is strangely gentle

9
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:13,280
From the tapestry of a cap, the sun sets to the taishakuten

10
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,960
Tomorrow will end like this

11
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,320
I heard that the happiness of Katsushika and Shiba is also lost

12
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,060
I heard that the happiness of Katsushika and Shiba is also lost

13
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:50,160
I heard that the happiness of Katsushika and Shiba is also lost

14
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:59,820
Hey, the seats are broken!

15
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,220
What the hell are you doing?

16
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,880
Oh, thank you.

17
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,760
Hey, mister! Be careful!

18
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,060
Oh, sorry.

19
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,560
Noooo!

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,320
Don't touch my butt!

21
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,620
Not me! How can I touch you in this state?

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Oh, I see.

23
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,060
I see.

24
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,160
I'm going to the station.

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,600
Ouch!

26
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,100
Oh, no!

27
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,020
Why are the trains so crowded?

28
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,780
What?

29
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,200
What's going on?

30
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,240
I want to take a train too.

31
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,600
Huh? The manager is buying a car?

32
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,880
Today and the day after, the train is full.

33
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,220
Every day, the train is full for more than two hours.

34
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,820
Oh, Amalia.

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,820
Reiko is on a paid vacation, so she's in trouble.

36
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,640
Thank you.

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,700
That's why you have to build a house in the countryside.

38
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,520
But I said I didn't have enough money to pay for a house.

39
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,480
Right now, you're late for such a thing.

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,460
Anyw-

41
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,800
The manager, there's a few cars I've only driven a few times.

42
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,480
Do you want it? I'll give it to you.

43
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,520
What? Really?

44
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,040
No, poor you, Kei.

45
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,620
I bought the same color car two times by mistake.

46
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,580
And what's the abilities of that car?

47
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,700
It's a yellow Porsche.

48
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,660
Yellow Porsche!

49
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,560
"Porsche"

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,780
I'd pay you 10 million if I were you.

51
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,760
10 million?

52
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,540
I can't afford such a high-end car.

53
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,880
Why not?

54
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,680
I'd be happy to buy it.

55
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,180
You idiot!

56
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,840
You're being moralized by the civil servant.

57
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,760
Even if you're a subordinate,

58
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,840
you can't afford such a high-end car.

59
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,000
That's a waste.

60
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,180
So, how much do you plan to buy?

61
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,860
About 500,000 yen.

62
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,640
Then you can't even buy a new car.

63
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
I can buy a used car.

64
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,240
Your subordinates, Nakagawa and Reiko,

65
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,500
are driving Ferraris and Porsches.

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,500
But the chief is driving a used car.

67
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,020
I don't want to hear

68
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,700
that you're driving a new car!

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,380
It doesn't matter to me.

70
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,680
Wait.

71
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,460
Is this a chance to make money?

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,020
You'll get one.

73
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,160
I understand.

74
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,120
I'll help you choose a used car.

75
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:49,980
What?

76
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,140
You're kidding!

77
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,080
If I bring you with me,

78
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,160
I can't even make a deal.

79
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
But, chief,

80
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,560
there's no one who can beat you.

81
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,180
But...

82
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,920
When you choose a house,

83
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,760
or when you travel abroad,

84
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,240
you've achieved a lot.

85
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,540
You're right.

86
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,960
I'm sure you'll give me a good deal.

87
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,400
Leave it to me.

88
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,920
"Your new car is here."

89
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,620
"I'll buy it for you."

90
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,840
"I'll buy it for you."

91
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,700
"You can't even buy a used car."

92
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,040
"You can't even buy a used car."

93
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,180
I remember a bad face.

94
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,640
I'll be fine today.

95
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,300
Oh.

96
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,440
"Hi."

97
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,680
"Oh, you're a traveler."

98
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,680
"You're selling a used car now?"

99
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,060
"Don't say something so mean."

100
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,280
"Don't say something so mean."

101
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,020
"This is a honest and honest shop."

102
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,820
"I can't trust you, but I'll take a look."

103
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,760
"I can't trust you, but I'll take a look."

104
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,180
"That's too bad.

105
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,320
I'm on a day off today."

106
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,080
"Don't lie to me!"

107
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,620
"I'm not on a day off."

108
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,080
"What am I doing?"

109
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,320
"I'm not on a day off."

110
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,700
"I'm on a day off."

111
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
"I'm on a day off."

112
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,760
"I'm on a day off."

113
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,640
"This car is worth 500,000 yen."

114
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,740
"This car is worth 500,000 yen."

115
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,260
"How is it?"

116
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,060
"It's shiny."

117
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,500
"It's really beautiful."

118
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,820
"It's like a new car."

119
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,100
"There's a way to paint it all."

120
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,860
"Giku!"

121
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,320
"How do you like it?"

122
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,340
"I thought it would be a luxury car."

123
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,700
"It's only 6,000 km away."

124
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,620
"That's right. It's almost new."

125
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,660
"That's right. It's almost new."

126
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,780
"The 1993 model?"

127
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,300
"It's strange that a car that was 5 years old was 6,000 km away."

128
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,300
"It's strange that a car that was 5 years old was 6,000 km away."

129
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,760
"Giku!"

130
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,260
"You're right, I can't do it."

131
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,320
"I want to see the engine, so please turn on the bonnet."

132
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:01,940
"I want to see the engine, so please turn on the bonnet."

133
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,260
"Okay."

134
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,640
"What's wrong with this engine?"

135
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,140
"It doesn't seem to have a very long range."

136
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,580
"It doesn't seem to have a very long range."

137
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,520
"Hey! It's only 2 laps per meter!"

138
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,940
"Hey! It's only 2 laps per meter!"

139
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,860
"That's ridiculous. It's only 1 lap per meter!"

140
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,080
"It's ridiculous. It's only 1 lap per meter!"

141
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,480
"Oh no!"

142
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,580
"That means it runs 106,000 km, right?"

143
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,680
"This man is such a cheat."

144
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,140
"This man is such a cheat."

145
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,940
"Friends in Gocho!"

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,320
"This used car center is..."

147
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,320
"This used car center is..."

148
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,980
"Please wait!"

149
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,240
"I'm a pro!"

150
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,600
"I'll show you my super eyes!"

151
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,880
"Super eyes?"

152
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,300
This is the price for the two years of full equipment.

153
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,340
I've been looking for such a cheap car all over Japan.

154
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,700
Even the engine...

155
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,660
Indeed, the engine seems to be working properly.

156
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,760
It's not bad, but it's 698,000 yen.

157
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,400
I understand.

158
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,060
I'm a customer of the first round of the conference,

159
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,000
so I will do my best to serve you.

160
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,060
What? Really?

161
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,880
How about it, Ryotsu?

162
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,860
The bumper is new, but the number plate is dented.

163
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,420
This is an accident car.

164
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,340
It's not a joke.

165
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,320
If you buy a new car, you will get more than 2 million yen.

166
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,840
This is an accident car, but it may have pulled many people.

167
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,640
Never do such a thing.

168
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,960
What are you doing?

169
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,620
I'm calling out the spirits that have settled in this car.

170
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,460
Ah!

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,080
Three people.

172
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,680
The chassis was just damaged by the car.

173
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,160
It's an accident car.

174
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,460
I got it.

175
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,740
You're cheating again.

176
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,280
I'll deal with you with a fraud.

177
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,820
Please forgive me.

178
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,100
Oh!

179
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,200
What?

180
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,600
It's a Wagen Beetle.

181
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,120
It's nostalgic.

182
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,480
I don't know the price, but how much is this?

183
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,680
Oh, it's not for sale in my car.

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
Oh, is that so?

185
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,740
When I was young, I admired this car.

186
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,500
You have a good car.

187
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,420
Thank you.

188
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,820
The chief likes it so much.

189
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,860
I'll sell it to you.

190
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,880
He said it was a defective product.

191
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,720
Everyone in the town hall,

192
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,540
this car is an accident car.

193
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,240
It's a defective product.

194
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,360
Please stop.

195
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,500
Then, will you sell it to me?

196
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,220
I understand.

197
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,560
But that car costs more than 500,000 yen to restore.

198
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,340
If it's not about 1 million yen...

199
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,260
Everyone in the town hall.

200
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,300
I understand.

201
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,780
I'll pay you back with 500,000 yen.

202
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,560
I see.

203
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,060
Ryotsu, what have you been doing?

204
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,480
Please be happy, chief.

205
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,180
He says he will sell it to me.

206
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,980
What?

207
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,780
Really?

208
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,500
But it was my car.

209
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,920
What?

210
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,900
There are so many cars.

211
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,520
We are negotiating the price.

212
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,000
Please wait a little longer.

213
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,560
I see.

214
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,760
Thank you.

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,900
I introduced you to the customer.

216
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,320
Of course, you will be introduced.

217
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,640
I'm not kidding.

218
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,240
I already lost 500,000 yen.

219
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,980
Please.

220
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,680
I understand.

221
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,180
Please don't be an accident.

222
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,360
I understand.

223
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,000
Thank you.

224
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,420
I'll be back tomorrow.

225
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:52,820
I'll buy you the best car.

226
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,440
Good luck to the car dealer.

227
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,560
Ok, I was there.

228
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,820
kendya

229
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,300
Thank you.

230
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,660
See you tomorrow.

231
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,040
Yeah, but it's not a fire truck, so it's a little bit red.

232
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,520
I gave you a million dollars, but don't complain.

233
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,080
Oh, isn't that the chief?

234
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,660
Really?

235
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,780
Chief!

236
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,480
Oh.

237
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,000
What's wrong with this red car?

238
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,280
No, I just bought it.

239
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,100
It's unique in shape, and it's red, and it's kind of fashionable.

240
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,140
I see.

241
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,280
I thought so, too.

242
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,680
You two should drive together next time.

243
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,840
Really?

244
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,780
I'm looking forward to it.

245
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,860
Well, then.

246
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
Yes, be careful.

247
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,760
Well, isn't red pretty good?

248
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,080
What kind of personality is the chief?

249
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,400
No, no.

250
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,680
The Beetle of the Wagen is pretty cool.

251
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,940
Isn't it?

252
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,980
The engine is in good shape, and it can be driven for another ten years.

253
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,740
The chief is the type to be taken care of, so it's all right.

254
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,180
Chief!

255
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,060
The chief wants to talk to you.

256
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,420
Oh.

257
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,440
I'll be right there.

258
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,400
Next time, I'm going to drive the car in Nakagawa and Nikko.

259
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,380
That sounds good.

260
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,300
You're really good at it.

261
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,020
Oh, what are you doing?

262
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:28,900
Huh?

263
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,200
Ryo-san, get the ball!

264
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,180
All right! Leave it to me!

265
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,860
Oh, senpai!

266
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,140
Ryo-chan, you're the best!

267
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,940
Thank you, Ryo-san!

268
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,980
As expected of you, senpai.

269
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,620
You're different from when you rode a bicycle!

270
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,120
Sen... Senpai! Are you all right?

271
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,160
Ouch...

272
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,220
Oh!

273
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,040
Huh?

274
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,780
Ryo-chan!

275
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,100
Sen... Senpai!

276
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,780
You're in trouble!

277
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,100
Oh, really?

278
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,820
Actually...

279
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,500
If the chief sees this, he'll turn into a demon!

280
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,540
What... What should I do?

281
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:10,620
Here I go!

282
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,140
Ryo-chan!

283
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,180
Ryo-chan has run out of

284
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,060
Where did he go?

285
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,940
Listen, Ryo-chan.

286
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,000
What's that come about?

287
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,860
That's something I don't want to hear.

288
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,820
Ryo-chan...

289
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,100
You go over there and talk to Senpai.

290
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,420
Yes...

291
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,520
Ryo-chan...

292
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,580
Alright, this should be enough.

293
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,420
Now we just need to paint the plastic.

294
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,420
Alright, this should be enough.

295
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,560
It's not enough at all.

296
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,400
Look closely.

297
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,640
It's too noticeable.

298
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,200
In this case, I'll just paint the door with this paint.

299
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,120
Oh no, it's broken.

300
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,940
If it's like this, I'll paint it with this.

301
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,520
This too?

302
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,180
Damn it.

303
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,500
How about this?

304
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,220
Again?

305
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,400
I won't give up!

306
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
How about this?

307
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,620
It's not in its best condition.

308
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,280
It's the worst.

309
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,140
Oh my god!

310
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,100
How about this?

311
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,020
I know a repair shop nearby, so you should get it repainted.

312
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,900
I've earned 50,000 yen!

313
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,720
50,000 yen?

314
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,340
No, it's nothing.

315
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,360
Alright, let's go there.

316
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,200
I'll borrow the key from the manager.

317
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,800
Manager, I have something to tell you.

318
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,480
What is it?

319
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,840
I really want to try driving that car.

320
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,960
Nakagawa will drive it, so can I drive it for about 3 hours?

321
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,460
It's a useless guy.

322
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,760
Well, if it's Nakagawa's driving, it'll be fine.

323
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,440
Don't hit me.

324
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,860
I just bought it.

325
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,940
Of course.

326
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,580
Don't worry.

327
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,420
Nakagawa, I'm back.

328
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,560
I'll fix it in 3 hours.

329
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,320
Then let's hurry.

330
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,720
Senpai!

331
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,320
The president isn't here for dinner.

332
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sorry he's not here.

333
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,780
Find him no matter what!

334
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,240
Got it.

335
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,840
Then, Senpai, please wait in the car.

336
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,600
Oh, come on.

337
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,680
The manager is lost.

338
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,580
He's buying a new car.

339
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,300
I can't believe he's buying a new car.

340
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,460
I'll sleep until he comes back.

341
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,200
Which one is Mr. Yamada's car that the president asked you to destroy?

342
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,040
This one.

343
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,620
It's dirty and the mold is old.

344
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,540
Alright, let's carry it.

345
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,160
Bye!

346
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,460
Goodbye!

347
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,420
Bye!

348
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,180
Stop!

349
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,500
It's not a car of the accident.

350
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,220
Anyway, the paint is fine.

351
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,720
It's not a good thing.

352
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,220
The owner must have been shot.

353
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,120
President!

354
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:43,500
It's me.

355
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,880
Huh?

356
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,520
Senpai!

357
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,820
Mr. Yamada's car is still here.

358
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,080
It's not a good place.

359
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,460
Where did he go?

360
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,600
There's no car.

361
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,820
What was that?

362
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,680
What was that?

363
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,480
Don't be silly.

364
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,100
It's an earthquake.

365
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,180
Stop!

366
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,200
Stop!

367
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,280
Stop!

368
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:15,980
Stop!

369
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,980
Hey! Stop the car!

370
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,500
Boss!

371
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,320
In the van there's someone!

372
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,520
What?

373
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,880
Sir!

374
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,980
Hurry!

375
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,740
Thank God, he's still alive.

376
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,980
Burn all the bodies.

377
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,480
And take them out.

378
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,080
I... can't believe it.

379
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,540
Ouch!

380
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,660
I was pressed when I woke up. What happened?

381
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,840
You're safe.

382
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,100
You've lived in that space a lot.

383
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,000
You're like the second Hikita Tenko.

384
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,420
The head of the club, Beetle, has become a dango bug!

385
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,520
It's impossible to regenerate.

386
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,680
Do something!

387
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,740
I can't do anything about it.

388
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,520
Take off the body and stretch it out.

389
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,360
Make it the original shape.

390
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,100
Bring it back to Beetle.

391
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,580
I can't do it.

392
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,140
Shut up. Let me go.

393
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,900
I understand.

394
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,740
Let's try to reproduce it.

395
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,760
I'm sure.

396
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,520
I'll be killed by the head of the club.

397
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,760
There are only about 360 cars that look like this.

398
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,940
They look the same.

399
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,200
The size is completely different.

400
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,560
Shut up.

401
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,500
There are only two hours left.

402
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,780
I don't care about the details.

403
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,640
But, boss, the engine is dead.

404
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,860
I see.

405
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,340
I have no choice but to install a different one.

406
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,920
Then install the Porsche engine.

407
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,060
It's impossible.

408
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,020
How can you install a Porsche 300 horsepower engine on a Subaru?

409
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,100
Shut up!

410
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,140
The 300 horsepower engine will make the head of the club happy.

411
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,340
Don't forget the wagon emblem.

412
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,860
I understand.

413
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,400
Is it really okay?

414
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,660
We have to work together.

415
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,320
I'll call you back.

416
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,520
But you'll get to know me soon.

417
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,720
Tomorrow the wind will blow.

418
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,540
Let's go.

419
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,160
Ryo!

420
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,360
How did you feel on the ride?

421
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,720
It was the best feeling I've ever had.

422
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,480
I thought you would go to the other world with such a good feeling.

423
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,140
Yeah, yeah.

424
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:37,960
Huh?

425
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,320
You look a little smaller.

426
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,680
What are you talking about, chief?

427
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,940
Beetle has always been this big.

428
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,820
Oh, I see. Because I've been watching you from afar.

429
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,000
Please look at me closely.

430
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,980
See? It looks big.

431
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,480
It's the illusion of the eyes of the telescope.

432
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,860
I see. It's a misunderstanding.

433
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:00,720
Huh?

434
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,180
The shape of the mirror is different.

435
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,180
No, no, no. It's the same. See?

436
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,200
The emblem is Volkswagen itself.

437
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,220
That's true, but...

438
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,440
Huh?

439
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,080
How do you open the door?

440
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,520
Chief, you're just kidding.

441
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,420
Beetle has a common front.

442
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,740
I see.

443
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,460
Nakagawa, I'm sorry.

444
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,000
We can't keep chasing oil.

445
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,880
Let's go to the patrol.

446
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,320
Yes.

447
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,280
Wait!

448
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,540
Ryozu, the steering wheel has changed to the right.

449
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,100
No, I can't let you fool me anymore.

450
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
No, I can't.

451
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,100
The chief had the right steering wheel from the beginning.

452
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,460
It's my car.

453
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,060
I mean, this is the chief's car.

454
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,400
No, it's not my car.

455
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,240
Please look at me.

456
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,820
Look, Porsche's engine is running.

457
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,360
This is amazing.

458
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,560
The chief is a drag racer.

459
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,160
Cool.

460
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,100
What happened to my car?

461
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,700
No, if you're in this car, Kogyaru won't leave you alone.

462
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,480
I want to know what happened to my car.

463
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,940
My car...

464
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,620
But I'd rather not see it for my own sake.

465
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,640
All right, come on!

466
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:22,780
Stop!

467
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,620
Hey, hey!

468
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,660
Stop!

469
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,300
Well, we're going to...

470
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,500
This is my car.

471
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,160
The shape is a little different.

472
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,420
But there's a big shadow.

473
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,920
The door on the left is there.

474
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,680
The engine is in the black part.

475
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,740
I'm glad it opened.

476
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,560
Well, I have to reverse here.

477
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,620
I'm annoyed.

478
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,040
I know.

479
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,320
Very good.

480
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
I really don't like this state.

481
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,400
This is the car.

482
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,700
Hey, you...!

483
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:15,720
It's my car!

484
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,220
Stop!

485
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,400
You little...

486
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,460
You're a passenger...

487
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:19,560
For once, stop!

488
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,380
The door didn't open.

489
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,620
You're amazing.

490
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:22,700
It's a fast car!

491
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,360
WS-senpai! The steering doesn't work!

492
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,760
I can only go straight!

493
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,320
What?

494
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,180
I'm in the way!

495
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,460
Chief! It's a speed violation!

496
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,720
Shut up! You're under arrest!

497
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,740
Stop! Stop!

498
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,340
I'm going to stop!

499
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,800
Idiot!

500
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,580
If you keep going, you'll get away!

501
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,920
I'll kick you out!

502
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,280
I'll kick you out!

503
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,360
Idiot!

504
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,640
I'm in the way!

505
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:15,920
I'm in the way!

506
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,800
Shut up!

507
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,040
I'm in the way!

508
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,540
It seems like something terrible has happened.

509
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,380
It seems like something terrible has happened.

510
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,280
It seems like something terrible has happened.

511
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,180
Good morning!

512
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,800
What's the matter, everyone?

513
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,660
I have something to say.

514
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,280
Chief, you're the best at this season.

515
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,300
Chief, you're the best at this season.

516
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,280
Shut up!

517
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,000
Why are you making me and Nakagawa

518
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,340
so busy for you?

519
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,760
I'm sorry!

520
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,780
I'm sorry!

521
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,520
I'm sorry!

522
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,900
I'm sorry!

523
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:01,980
I'm sorry!

524
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,020
I'm sorry!

525
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,560
I'm sorry!

526
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,840
I'm sorry!

527
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,960
I'm sorry!

528
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,640
I'm sorry!

529
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,820
I'm sorry!

530
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,840
I'm sorry!

531
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,740
Good morning.

532
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,320
Uncle!

533
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,420
