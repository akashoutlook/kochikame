00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,260
After the rain

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,160
I looked back and walked

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,480
I was drawn to my mother

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,800
I felt it at that time

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,520
A strange feeling

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,020
So I gave it to her

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,300
I tried to walk on the black tile

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,340
Everyone was a child once

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,500
But everyone has forgotten

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,280
A politician with a great face

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,840
And a blue aunt above his eyes

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,240
Turn around and look at that corner

18
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,860
You can see everyone

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,500
There is a wall there

20
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,200
There is a wall there

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,640
There is a wall there

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,560
Everyone come to our town

23
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,740
Thank you!

24
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,720
To be continued

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,860
S.F.!

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,100
Aliens have been attacked!

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,080
Ryo!

28
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,460
What is this?

29
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,220
This is...

30
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,040
No!

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,100
It's Ryo!

32
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,260
He is definitely a senior!

33
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,800
I...

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,380
I...

35
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,260
I have been so embarrassed!

36
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,860
I have never had such a difficult feeling!

37
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,840
I don't like it!

38
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,380
This is not me!

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,720
Look!

40
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
In the world, there are three people who are similar to me!

41
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,240
This is definitely my similar!

42
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,540
You idiot!

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,500
Look at this!

44
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,020
Ryo, who is happy to earn money in the field,

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,100
I'm riding it with a polite name!

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,260
No!

47
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,680
There must be a same-sex alliance among those three!

48
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,680
There is no such thing!

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,420
There must be no such thing!

50
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,020
There is only one idiot in the world!

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,320
You are the only one!

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,140
There must be no one else!

53
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,400
You are the shame of the Japanese police!

54
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,160
The source of the evil!

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,500
The enemy of humanity!

56
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,940
The devil!

57
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,820
Look!

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,840
Accept that the person in the photo is yourself!

59
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,680
Come on!

60
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,320
Admit it honestly!

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,840
Get rid of everything and relax!

62
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,280
That is me!

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,980
You are so stubborn!

64
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,500
It's not me!

65
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,100
I couldn't confess my guilt, but it is clear that you have committed a crime.

66
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,240
So as a punishment,

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,400
I will give you a day off tomorrow for your duty.

68
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,440
What?

69
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,080
Boss!

70
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't be so rude!

71
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,760
Tomorrow is the day of the Kamen Rider, which I have been waiting for!

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,900
Besides, tomorrow I have a lot of plans...

73
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,240
Shut up!

74
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,120
I won't let your useless plans get in the way of my plans!

75
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,540
Boss!

76
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,260
Go away!

77
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,100
Boss!

78
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,460
This is the fuel that can be obtained through the Earth.

79
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,220
Go to Sennai to procure this!

80
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,720
Understood!

81
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,960
However, it is not good to keep it as it is!

82
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,700
Have to change its appearance!

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,740
Copy the earth-man!

84
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,500
Hey, Reiko,

85
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,320
tomorrow we'll manage without me.

86
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,320
And now you are somewhat tympered.

87
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,080
And now you are somewhat tympered.

88
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,300
I was supposed to take a break.

89
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,780
I don't mind, but it's not good to go against the director's orders right now.

90
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,400
If you make the director angry any more, you might not be able to go to work on holidays.

91
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,660
That's right, senpai.

92
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,440
There's an event at the shopping street tomorrow, so I haven't overstepped my limits.

93
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:31,940
Ugh!

94
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,180
You took a picture like this!

95
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,040
You're free to do whatever you want in front of the working hours!

96
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,840
You're free to do whatever you want in front of the working hours!

97
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,020
I think it's based on the position of a police officer.

98
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,900
You need to have a common sense as an adult before you become a police officer.

99
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,480
Who do you think you are?

100
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,220
You say whatever you want!

101
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,680
This is a sign of my love of horses, the expression of my forgetfulness.

102
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,200
Who should I be ashamed of?

103
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,540
I'm proud of myself for that day!

104
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,160
Hallelujah!

105
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,340
Huh?

106
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,060
Huh?

107
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,960
Ryo-tsu!

108
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,460
Stop it! Stop the car, now!

109
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:17,820
Okay!

110
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:20,900
Huh?

111
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,580
Ah...

112
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,540
What's up, manager?

113
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,640
You changed your mind or something, and are you trying to finish what we talked about earlier?

114
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,200
Ryo-tsu. Are you at the Alberto police station right now?

115
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,380
No limit, you don't know what you're talking about right now.

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,220
So you've been there this whole time?

117
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,880
Yes, I've been working by being very serious all this time.

118
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,020
So, since you're here...

119
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,460
Chief, you're off tomorrow.

120
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,320
I might be a bit tired.

121
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,500
I'll be back early today.

122
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,080
The chief suddenly said something I didn't understand.

123
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,400
Huh? Mr. You?

124
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,720
Hey, everyone.

125
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,480
What are you talking about?

126
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,060
Did you change your clothes?

127
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,420
That thing earlier was the stuff for tomorrow's night.

128
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,500
It was pretty good.

129
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,240
Anyway, please take care of the thing tomorrow.

130
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,380
I'm sure Ryo will do well.

131
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,940
What's wrong with him?

132
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,920
Mr. Onomawari!

133
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,040
Mr. Onomawari!

134
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,060
It's terrible!

135
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,820
The girls' school has a new recruiter!

136
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,280
A new recruiter?

137
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,480
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,860
Where is the new recruiter?

139
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,940
Oh, it's me!

140
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,680
Oh, no!

141
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,600
Who was it?

142
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,620
Oh no! I'm a police officer!

143
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,400
Wait! How did you become so similar to me?

144
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,160
And how come you could be so fast?

145
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,580
You bastard!

146
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,180
How did you become so similar to me?

147
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,800
Explain yourself!

148
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,880
Chok chok!

149
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,500
Shut up!

150
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,700
I picked it up from the trash can.

151
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,280
And then I copied it.

152
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:12,980
Copied?

153
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,260
What the hell are you?!

154
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,900
I'm an alien!

155
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,380
I came to Earth because of the UFO's fuel shortage!

156
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,240
I'm looking for this! Help me!

157
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,220
This is the fuel of the UFO?

158
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,840
Yes! Otherwise we can't go back to the stars! Help us!

159
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,940
You can change your appearance freely?

160
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,580
Yes!

161
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,620
Anytime!

162
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,540
Anywhere!

163
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,040
Anyone!

164
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,880
Transform!

165
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,760
Isn't that amazing?!

166
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,600
Of course! We're all aliens from the past!

167
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,420
Don't use half Japanese! I don't get it!

168
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,160
We're all aliens from the past!

169
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,380
You should practice your words!

170
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,160
You should practice!

171
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,680
Listen, it's hard to get this fuel on Earth. It's a rare item!

172
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,620
Oh, lucky!

173
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,660
So you should be disappointed!

174
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,720
But if I cooperate, we might get it.

175
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,280
Really?

176
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,760
Instead, you should cooperate with me.

177
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,040
Reiko-san, did you read the newspaper this morning?

178
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,540
Huh? What?

179
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,900
Look at this!

180
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,140
Ah, the article about the UFO's shortage.

181
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,500
I read the newspaper yesterday.

182
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,260
Apparently, there were a lot of reports from the observers.

183
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,400
But in the end, they couldn't find the real thing.

184
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,100
Kei-chan, do you believe in UFOs?

185
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,700
Reiko-san, don't you believe it?

186
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,820
Well, if there are aliens, I want to meet them at least once.

187
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,560
I think Ryo-chan is familiar with this kind of story.

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,660
Ah, you believe in it, right?

189
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,280
Huh?

190
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,720
What's wrong?

191
00:08:59,720 --> 00:08:59,740
I wonder what happened.

192
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,040
Ryo-chan seems to be serious today, like a stranger.

193
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,300
I think the one who was scolded by the chief yesterday answered so much.

194
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,280
But it's a little creepy.

195
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,920
I hope nothing bad happens.

196
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,440
It's convenient to have your own copy.

197
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,020
I'll keep him on Earth as long as possible and use it all my strength.

198
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,000
Stop it!

199
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,720
Hey, Pramoya!

200
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,180
What are you doing?

201
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,500
I'm waiting for you.

202
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,140
Ouch!

203
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,320
If you don't hurry, Noriko Sueyoshi will come.

204
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,660
What are you talking about?

205
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,240
What are you talking about?

206
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,600
I promised you yesterday.

207
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,040
Promise?

208
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,120
Anyway, Ryo-san,

209
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,060
You have to help me with the stage for the Kameari Shopping Street Festival event.

210
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,720
You have to help me with the stage for the Kameari Shopping Street Festival event.

211
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,760
Yes, sir.

212
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,360
That's not me!

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,140
I've checked that you're not on the stage.

214
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,420
Come on, hurry up!

215
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,140
No, that's not me!

216
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,020
No, that's not me!

217
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,560
Stay there.

218
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,700
Thank God!

219
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,520
I'm in such a hurry, not you!

220
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:09,980
Sir!

221
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,680
Pick me up, please!

222
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,760
My time's up!

223
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:15,940
My time?

224
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,800
That looks awesome.

225
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,960
Merch, you have to be on the stage, too.

226
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:18,980
Ah.

227
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,180
That sounds like a good opportunity!

228
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,280
I'm looking forward to it.

229
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,080
Can I ask you a favor?

230
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,840
Yeah?

231
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,160
What do you need?

232
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,000
Well then, let's go and see what we can do.

233
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,760
Okay, this is great.

234
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,040
We were sick of it, but thanks to this we got to experience that fantastic performance of the Kamairi Shotengai!

235
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,560
No success!

236
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,700
That doesn't make any sense!

237
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm really sorry.

238
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,720
Ryo-chan, did you get any rest?

239
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,760
You have a very light at the end of the day.

240
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,060
I'm fine, I'm fine.

241
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,580
What?

242
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,180
What?

243
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,560
Huh?

244
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,360
It's the other side.

245
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,720
Is it the inside?

246
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,480
Right.

247
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:56,920
Ugh.

248
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:57,920
Ugh.

249
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,960
Hot pot, ramen, dumplings!

250
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,400
And change the money, too.

251
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,140
Ryo, you're back.

252
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,620
I'm not going to change my mind.

253
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,320
Sueyoshi can't come.

254
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,600
What do you mean?

255
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,520
What do you mean?

256
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,920
What? Sueyoshi Noriko can't come?

257
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,400
Yes.

258
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,360
The drama in the morning has been delayed.

259
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,620
Is that true?

260
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,780
Yes.

261
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:39,100
The drama was delayed because of the delay in the book,

262
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,940
so it became a mess.

263
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,580
That's terrible.

264
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,680
The event in the shopping street was very popular.

265
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,540
There were many customers looking for her.

266
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,000
If she doesn't come, it'll be a riot.

267
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,260
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,340
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,700
I'm sorry.

270
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,740
It's terrible.

271
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,920
What should we do?

272
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,080
This is a good chance to make money.

273
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,320
It was a good chance to make money.

274
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,660
It's over.

275
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:36,980
What should we do?

276
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,600
We have a problem.

277
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,940
We have to make money.

278
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,520
What's the matter, Ryo?

279
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,060
Actually, Sueyoshi Noriko has a problem.

280
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,420
Is that true, Ryo?

281
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,280
I wonder if you could give me 30% of the original price.

282
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,320
30%?

283
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,760
Of course.

284
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,680
No matter how much money you spend, you can't ask for it.

285
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,220
It costs a lot.

286
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,120
So, the amount is the number.

287
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,880
30%?

288
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,580
How much do you need?

289
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,540
The other day, I got a big problem.

290
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,980
What are you going to do?

291
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,300
I don't mind, but...

292
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,760
100%?

293
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,960
That's too much.

294
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,260
That's too much!

295
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,680
Then, I'll take it.

296
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,640
OK.

297
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,620
Listen, this time, you will be this guy.

298
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,040
Look closely.

299
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,400
Look closely!

300
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,420
You will see it!

301
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,620
You hear me?

302
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,620
This is all to get the fuel for the UFO.

303
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you understand?

304
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,840
Why...

305
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,900
No!

306
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,220
No!

307
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,220
No!

308
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,840
No!

309
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,380
No!

310
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,180
No!

311
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,580
No!

312
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:07,840
No!

313
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,200
No!

314
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,320
No!

315
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,340
No!

316
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,340
Why is your filler standing still like a statue?

317
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,920
-You're right. -That was great!

318
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,780
Thank you, Ryo!

319
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,600
-This is what I promised. -I see.

320
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,420
Well, I won't hold back.

321
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,900
If you have any trouble, I'll be here for you.

322
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,400
-Well done! -Did you find the fuel?

323
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,240
-I did. -You did!

324
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,760
I did.

325
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,800
Well, I did find it.

326
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,280
But the fuel you're looking for is very expensive on Earth.

327
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,520
You can't buy it without a lot of money.

328
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,300
-Do you understand? -A lot of money?

329
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,980
I'm an idol of Takahai.

330
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,820
I'd like to have a bottle of Takuya Hoshikawa's Sokkuri in 30 minutes.

331
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,580
Here you go.

332
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,440
What on earth did he start?

333
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,860
It's not that easy.

334
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,100
Takuya Hoshikawa and Takuya Hoshikawa.

335
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,560
Takuya Hoshikawa.

336
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,720
What should I do?

337
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,200
Riko, please calm down.

338
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,860
Don't be panic. He's Takuya Hoshikawa's Sokkuri.

339
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:29,920
What?

340
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,900
I don't think he's Sokkuri.

341
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,660
He's just like him.

342
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,160
From the front, from the side, from the back.

343
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,920
He's just like him.

344
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,160
He's just like him.

345
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,140
He's just like him.

346
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,580
If you ask him...

347
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,480
He's just like him.

348
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,380
He's just like him.

349
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,800
The client is a high school girl.

350
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,280
She wants you to walk with her to the center of Shibuya.

351
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,840
Come back in an hour.

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,560
Come back.

353
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,860
Hello?

354
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,180
I'd like to invite Ken Shimura to the kid's birthday party.

355
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,100
He's a young man.

356
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,200
If you're a young man, you'll have to pay extra money.

357
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,800
But you'll also get a strange old man for the service.

358
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,700
It's very good.

359
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:03,720
You'll get 25,000 yen.

360
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,920
Ken Shimura!

361
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,840
Not someone you'll meet.

362
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,140
I see.

363
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,800
So you are the Sokkuri.

364
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,360
Got it.

365
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,480
As you wish, please come back otherwise the price will be fair.

366
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,160
Matsutaka!

367
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,400
Trapi!

368
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,340
Gita!

369
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,500
Amida Baba!

370
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,640
Komayomachi!

371
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,540
Takechampan!

372
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,540
Butcher!

373
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,940
Money in the bank?

374
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,640
Golden Harf by EVA!

375
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,600
Good! Good! Good!

376
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,520
The reservation is only for 3 months.

377
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,700
I see. Then, on that day...

378
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,500
Yes, Nerima's Edanaga-san.

379
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,240
Yes, I understand.

380
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,100
Hey!

381
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,520
The company's secret is in the room.

382
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,420
Don't peek.

383
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,760
I understand.

384
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,100
But Ryo-chan,

385
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,280
is it okay to be such a big guy?

386
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,180
If Chief Ohara finds out, it'll be bad.

387
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,380
That's right.

388
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,620
This time, I'll really be fired.

389
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,000
Fired?

390
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,780
Shut up!

391
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,240
This is not just a money-making.

392
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,540
It's a help...

393
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,180
No, it's a help.

394
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,280
What is it?

395
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,460
Nothing.

396
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,660
Go ahead.

397
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,920
Yes, I want to date with Max's Nina.

398
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,420
Yes, yes.

399
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,420
I want to date with Ikemure-san.

400
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,260
Yes.

401
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,680
I want to fight with Chixon Gracie.

402
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,360
Yes.

403
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,040
I want to date with Natsukawa-san.

404
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,260
Yes.

405
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,680
I want to have a skit with Masayuki Watanabe-san.

406
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,520
Yes.

407
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,480
I want to date with Komia-san.

408
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,960
What's wrong?

409
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,860
I'm tired.

410
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:29,780
Yes...

411
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,060
Yes.

412
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,480
Yes.

413
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:32,200
Yes.

414
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,240
Yes.

415
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,300
Hey, are you alright?

416
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,340
I'm fine.

417
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,840
Even aliens get tired, don't they?

418
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,860
Let's call it a day for today.

419
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,600
Take a bath and enjoy yourself.

420
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,260
But we have to hurry.

421
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,620
We can only stay on Earth for 60 hours.

422
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,020
60 hours?

423
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,660
If we go over that, our spaceship will return to the planet.

424
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,540
So we have only two hours left.

425
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,500
Two hours?

426
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,420
Why do you say such important things so quickly?

427
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,400
I don't think it's that hard to get that fuel.

428
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,980
Hey, hey, get a grip.

429
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,700
Hey!

430
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,980
Fuel...

431
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,120
Don't worry. I'll go get the fuel.

432
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,960
But the money...

433
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,460
It's okay. I'll do something about the money.

434
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,880
But this is still...

435
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
I'll cancel the rest, so don't worry.

436
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,400
Fuel...

437
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,020
Fuel!

438
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,500
What are you doing?

439
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,420
It's proof of our friendship.

440
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,120
Friendship, huh?

441
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,420
It's okay. If you call a friend in the UFO, the rest of the work will be done immediately.

442
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,500
What? You have a friend?

443
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,100
Call a friend!

444
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,580
UFO!

445
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

446
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,400
Oh, no!

447
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:20,560
Farmers, the

448
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,480
Hey! Where are you? Hey!

449
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,260
What the...

450
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,120
Do you have any fuel?

451
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,340
Oh, it's you. I bought some fuel and brought it here.

452
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,420
Thank you, Ryo-tsu.

453
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,540
This isn't it!

454
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,860
Huh? There are 18 carbon batteries in here!

455
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,600
No, this isn't it!

456
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,240
You know, this card says there are 4 carbon batteries.

457
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,480
Carbon and carbon won't change batteries.

458
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,700
You just need to connect them.

459
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,960
This isn't it! I can't change it!

460
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,180
I don't care what you say. There are no carbon batteries.

461
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,900
Why not? I can't change it! I can't change it!

462
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,160
I told you to use carbon!

463
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,060
I'll do it!

464
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,320
Ryo-tsu, you liar! I can't change it!

465
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,580
I can't change it!

466
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,240
I can't change it!

467
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:27,900
I can't change it!

468
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,100
Why don't you just give up?

469
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,400
Carbon batteries are cheap, so 4 of them will be about 200, 300 yen.

470
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,340
I bought 18 of them.

471
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,140
And I can get them easily.

472
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,120
But I had to go out of business or I ran out of money today.

473
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,780
So I ran around here and there.

474
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,780
I have to thank you.

475
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,700
Who's the one complaining about you?

476
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,320
It's cheap. Two or three hundred yen.

477
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,080
I can get it easily.

478
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,540
Liar of the 4!

479
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,800
Help me!

480
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,320
I won't forgive you!

481
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,820
I'm so happy to be able to date you.

482
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,760
Good luck!

483
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,880
What's that?

484
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,640
I won't forgive you!

485
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,840
You're not going to play anymore, are you?

486
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,600
Help me!

487
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,760
What's that?

488
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,700
That voice is Senpai, isn't it?

489
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,060
It seems like someone is chasing us.

490
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,360
Now I'm scared.

491
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,180
Everyone, it's Ryo-chan!

492
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,820
Please help me, Mr. Ibu!

493
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,020
Let's go!

494
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,040
Don't just goodbye!

495
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,700
What's going on here?

496
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,160
What are they doing?

497
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,960
They're aliens!

498
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,480
Why are they all scared?

499
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,440
It's a long story...

500
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,020
Let's go!

501
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,240
I'm in trouble! I'm in trouble!

502
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,640
I-I'm dead...

503
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,960
Hey, Ryoutsu!

504
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,320
Help me, Butch!

505
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,960
But if you don't know who the real senpai is, help me, Okaka!

506
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,220
I-I'm the real one!

507
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,280
I-I'm the real one!

508
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,620
I'm the real one! I'm the real one!

509
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,580
I'm the real one! I'm the real one!

510
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,880
I'm the real one!

511
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,820
I don't know who the real one is, after all!

512
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,500
I'm the real one!

513
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,700
I'm the real one!

514
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,340
I'm the real one!

515
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,960
I'm the real one!

516
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,580
I'm the real one!

517
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,620
I'm the real one!

518
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,560
Stop it! Stop it already!

519
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,300
Stop it! Stop it already!

520
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,140
So the story that the UFO crashed was true, after all.

521
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,880
That's right.

522
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,860
Ryoutsu is so popular by himself, but...

523
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,020
I'm getting dizzy.

524
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,820
Let me know when the real one is decided.

525
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,600
If you do, let me know.

526
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,860
No way!

527
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,080
Please wait, Butch!

528
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,800
Please wait, Butch!

529
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,180
The town began to move again as if nothing had happened.

530
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,920
No one cared how many people I was going to be.

531
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,300
No one cared how many people I was going to be.

532
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,200
They didn't care, and they didn't care how many people I was going to be.

533
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,480
Stop it!

534
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,340
Hey, are you serious, Pramoya?

535
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,320
You're retiring for the last time this year?

536
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,780
Pramoya, that's why I,

537
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,120
that's why you don't want me to give you flowers!

538
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,000
Next time on Bonus Gathering War!

539
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,360
I'm counting on you!
