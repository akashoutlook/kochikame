Katsushika Space Station

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:46,880
I missed you, Katsushika.

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,340
A robbery occurred at the Shimae Bank.

26
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,920
The culprit is in the bank with a hostage.

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,860
The police are on the scene.

28
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,300
Let's go, Nagawa.

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,840
I'll take care of the rest.

30
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,020
Roger that.

31
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,580
Be careful, you two.

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,980
Wait a minute.

33
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,060
What is it, Chief?

34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,600
In order to solve this case,

35
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,800
a security police officer will be sent from the main office.

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,240
You will be sent to that command center.

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,340
What kind of person is he?

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
I don't know the details, but his name is Hoshi.

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,800
He's known as Hard-Boiled Deka in the main office.

40
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,020
Hard-Boiled Deka?

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,680
That's a cool nickname.

42
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,720
He must be someone who appeared in the Hard-Boiled movies.

43
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,480
I have a bad feeling about this.

44
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:32,960
Huh?

45
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,180
Think about it.

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
There was no one better than this police officer.

47
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,240
Kaipan Deka.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,180
Moon Deka.

49
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:41,960
Venus Deka.

50
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,500
And Dolphin Deka.

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,640
I don't know.

52
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:45,960
That's right.

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,900
Then, this time, too.

54
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,900
I'm sure some strange guy with our reputation will come.

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,100
Hard-Boiled means a hard-boiled egg.

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,600
That's right.

57
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,640
Then, he always eats boiled eggs.

58
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,780
He may have a smooth skin like a boiled egg.

59
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,620
No, he may be wearing a huge egg shell.

60
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,920
He's not a normal person anyway.

61
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,720
You'd better be prepared.

62
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,660
He's stupid.

63
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,380
A strange police officer would never come.

64
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,600
You're so naive, chief.

65
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,580
Have you forgotten all the bitter experiences you've had so far?

66
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,100
He's Kamado.

67
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,660
Could it be that he's one of them?

68
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,480
I'm Hoshida, from the main office.

69
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,640
People call me Hard-Boiled Deka.

70
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,280
He's a normal person, isn't he?

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,120
I can't let my guard down.

72
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,160
Here comes the boiled egg.

73
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,620
What's that? Isn't that a cigarette?

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,240
No, I don't think so.

75
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,400
He's probably hiding something.

76
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,600
I'll show you this time.

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,260
What's that? Isn't that a lighter?

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,300
He just wanted to smoke, didn't he?

79
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,380
You're overthinking.

80
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,740
Then, everyone.

81
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,280
Let's go to the scene.

82
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,160
It's definitely a hard-boiled egg.

83
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,100
Won't you give us the boiled egg?

84
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,160
Hey!

85
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,180
You're making me look like a gag.

86
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,900
What's with the boiled egg?

87
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm Hard-Boiled Deka.

88
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,880
Why do you have to do that?

89
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,280
Even if you ask me why, I'm just...

90
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,300
I'm just not satisfied.

91
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,120
What are you talking about?

92
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,440
You boarded Kamado and appeared at the scene.

93
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,000
Suddenly, you had a happy strike.

94
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,900
You lit a fire with a lighter from a Garche.

95
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,520
And now you're making a cool face.

96
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,740
Cool? I'm too cool.

97
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm sure I'm drunk.

98
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,100
Is this enough to make you look like Hard-Boiled?

99
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,180
I'm not drunk.

100
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,820
What is this?

101
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,980
This is like a daily comedy.

102
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,700
I can't show my Hard-Boiled charm enough.

103
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,980
What are you talking about?

104
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,420
This background is bad.

105
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,600
Change it.

106
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,960
Okay.

107
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,440
This is a background that is suitable for Hard-Boiled.

108
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,580
Next is...

109
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,460
You should make your appearance more realistic.

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm realistic.

111
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,600
This is...

112
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,420
No way.

113
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,980
What's going on?

114
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,880
This is like a movie.

115
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,240
A terrible person appeared.

116
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,280
This is a Hard-Boiled world, suitable for a Hard-Boiled man.

117
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,260
Now, I'll do my appearance scene again.

118
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,580
I'll do it again.

119
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,060
It's time for a new one.

120
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,080
Hey!

121
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,120
You don't have time to do something so ridiculous!

122
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,920
Ryo!

123
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,720
What?

124
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,360
The clock is back to three minutes.

125
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,640
If you don't do it again, you can't proceed.

126
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,700
Is that so?

127
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,240
I can't help it.

128
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,580
I'm sorry, but I have to do what he said.

129
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,760
What did you talk about three minutes ago?

130
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,400
I think I said that I was not just a person.

131
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,680
OK.

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,520
Then, let's start from there.

133
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,200
Everyone, go back to your position.

134
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,780
Do I have to do it too?

135
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,380
Of course.

136
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,840
If the chief is gone, the conversation will be difficult.

137
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,640
Are you ready?

138
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,320
OK!

139
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,800
OK.

140
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,440
Then, Hard-Boiled Deca appearance scene, take two.

141
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,840
Ready, start!

142
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,120
Anyway, it's not just a thing.

143
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,320
You should be prepared.

144
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,120
What?

145
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,140
I'll go first.

146
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,560
A strange detective will come soon.

147
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,080
You are too naive, chief.

148
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,000
Have you forgotten your bitter experience so far?

149
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,920
Kamaradesu.

150
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,520
Maybe he is inside...

151
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,920
*snort*

152
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,940
I'm Hoshida from the main office.

153
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,140
People call me Hard-Boiled Dekka.

154
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,340
You're satisfied now, right?

155
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,180
Now, let's get to the real thing!

156
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,660
Wait a minute!

157
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,540
What? I've already redone it with Hard-Boiled!

158
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,700
No, I feel like you're still missing the Hard-Boiled-ness.

159
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,360
*snort*

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,040
That's right! Let's turn the screen into a sepia tone and aim for the sharpness!

161
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,240
It's like a Hollywood movie from the 40's.

162
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,940
It's kind of cool.

163
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,460
Let's change the setting of the screen into a 40's style.

164
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,540
Why me?

165
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,720
What?

166
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,880
Alright, let's do that scene again.

167
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,300
Are we doing it again?

168
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,080
Then, let's do the Hard-Boiled Dekka scene, take 3!

169
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,560
Ready, start!

170
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,940
*snort*

171
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,700
*snort*

172
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,280
*snort*

173
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,900
Anyway, it's nothing but a piece of cake.

174
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,180
Yeah. It's better to be prepared.

175
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,980
*snort*

176
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,800
*snort*

177
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
*snort*

178
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,560
You're so stupid!

179
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,060
It's no use for you to be a detective!

180
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,580
You're so naive, Chief.

181
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,760
Have you forgotten how painful your experience has been?

182
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,120
*snort*

183
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,500
*sneeze*

184
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,420
It was Kamalo!

185
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,440
Could it be that in here...

186
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,940
I'm Hoshida, from the capital.

187
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,260
People call me Hard-Boiled Deka.

188
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,620
No! I don't know what this red cauldron is!

189
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,600
Let's figure it out first!

190
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,620
I'll color it after all.

191
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,120
It's back!

192
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,100
How can I make it look like a Hard-Boiled movie?

193
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,220
Just give up already!

194
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,940
Don't you think that the size of the screen is different between TV and movies?

195
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,820
The size of the screen? That's it!

196
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,960
That's unnecessary.

197
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,280
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,320
Alright, let's change the size of the screen.

199
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,680
Cinesco size!

200
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,740
You guys are lying on the outside of the screen!

201
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,460
I'm sorry, Ryo-sama.

202
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,840
They're such a pain in the ass.

203
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,560
Just do it.

204
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,760
Alright, Hard-Boiled Deka, scene 4.

205
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,680
Ready, start!

206
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,140
The End

207
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,180
At any rate, it's not easy.

208
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,520
You better be prepared.

209
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,740
This is ridiculous!

210
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,520
It's amazing that a weird detective came all of a sudden!

211
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,840
Hey, Honda!

212
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,600
Why are you here?

213
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,960
Isn't this Chief's line?

214
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,640
I didn't do it because I wanted to!

215
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,740
I just came to see Senpai, but Chief Ohara suddenly...

216
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,960
gave me this script, and asked me to do it.

217
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,140
You're cheating, Chief.

218
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,400
You ran away on your own!

219
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,520
You're really shut up.

220
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,520
Hey, don't change the cast.

221
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,220
Don't tell us. The chief has escaped.

222
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,660
Chief Ohara, did you say anything else?

223
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,980
I can't go on anymore. I'm tired.

224
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,820
We don't want to go on anymore.

225
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,020
The chief is gone, and there's no more of this scene.

226
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,840
Idiot! This is the scene where the leading character appears.

227
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,540
Are you going to say that it's gone?

228
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,900
But the chief is not here.

229
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,680
I can't help it. You have to play the chief.

230
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,000
Make-up!

231
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
Change the camera angle.

232
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,980
Don't show his face.

233
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,640
That's good.

234
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,680
Now, take 5 of the scene where the hard-boiled giant appears.

235
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,960
Ready, start!

236
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,540
All in all, it's not just a piece of cake.

237
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,360
Yeah.

238
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,360
You'd better be prepared.

239
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,920
I can't believe that a stupid, crazy, and strange detective came.

240
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,940
You're naive, chief.

241
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,900
Have you forgotten the bitter experience you've had up to now?

242
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,400
It's Kamalo.

243
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,780
Could it be that in here...

244
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,820
It's Hoshida from the main town.

245
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,500
People call me the hard-boiled giant.

246
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,220
It's finally decided.

247
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,880
Well, where am I?

248
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,840
The camera went negative.

249
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,260
The main character is gone.

250
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,040
But you didn't see it because it was hidden!

251
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,820
Everyone is now completely hidden.

252
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,700
That's true.

253
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,240
Now, I know what you're talking about.

254
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,240
And now I know what you're talking about.

255
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

256
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,180
What's wrong?

257
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,400
What's happening?

258
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,020
There's something I like about the main character and him.

259
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,220
He's being so columnsome for making such a stand.

260
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,120
It's such a pride.

261
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,240
He doesn't know that.

262
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,720
He's truly not playing.

263
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,080
Now, it's your turn.

264
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,880
It was a wonderful scene.

265
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,760
And are we still in the exit?

266
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,260
We used all the first half of the Hoshi's appearance scene.

267
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,740
Thanks to you, the story hasn't progressed at all.

268
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,240
We'll get up to speed in the second half.

269
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,580
But it's still hard-boiled.

270
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,520
I understand. So please proceed with the story.

271
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,880
All right.

272
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,900
Um...

273
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,380
What?

274
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,520
Can I just pull it in?

275
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,500
Is it okay to pull it in?

276
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,860
Um...

277
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,500
It seems that the chief Ohara has no more lines.

278
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,900
You can go back now.

279
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:27,980
Yes.

280
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,740
Well then, I'll excuse myself first.

281
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,340
-Good job. -Good job.

282
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,900
So who and who will be under me?

283
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,100
Is it already started?

284
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,160
It seems so.

285
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,800
I'm asking who and who will be under me!

286
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,380
I'm asking two people!

287
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,720
Y-Yes, it's us.

288
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,940
It's Nakagawa Keiichi, the inspector.

289
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,740
It's Ryotsu Kankichi, the inspector.

290
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,380
All right.

291
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,700
Get in my car, Ryotsu Nakagawa.

292
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,060
I'll be right in front of Kameari Station.

293
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:53,780
Yes.

294
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,120
It's decided.

295
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,880
This time, it's decided on the first floor.

296
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,920
I'm going to be happy.

297
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,960
I'll go to the next scene like a thief!

298
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,600
Start!

299
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:16,800
Wait a minute!

300
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,080
Wait a minute!

301
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,160
Hey, don't stop suddenly!

302
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,100
No!

303
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,580
This scene is NG!

304
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,080
Huh?

305
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,080
There was nothing strange.

306
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,100
The starting point should be the biggest showcase.

307
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,120
It's the place where you have to be the most hard-boiled.

308
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,540
But something was missing.

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,720
Are you going to do it again?

310
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,180
What is it?

311
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,020
That's right!

312
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,800
It's the 10-day high school!

313
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,400
10-day high school?

314
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,120
What is the 10-day high school?

315
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,000
You'll see if you watch it.

316
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,980
Put the 10-day high school in the scene now and do it again.

317
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,900
Hard-boiled or starting scene take 2!

318
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,440
Ready, start!

319
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,600
Start!

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,480
What?

321
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,640
Why is it night?

322
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,020
I don't know.

323
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,880
Is this the 10-day high school?

324
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,800
It's cool.

325
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,900
But why is it suddenly night?

326
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,520
To make the 10-day high school shine beautifully, the background has to be night.

327
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,560
A robber entered the bank in front of the station.

328
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,340
It's not a good time at night.

329
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,380
Shut up.

330
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,320
If you arrive in the other side, you can go back to the daytime.

331
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,120
That's such a selfish thing.

332
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,220
Excuse me, but where is this car running?

333
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,320
It's the 10-day high school.

334
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,940
It's heading for Kameari Station.

335
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,060
Why is it in the 10-day high school?

336
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,740
It's noisy every day.

337
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Hard-boiled movies are running in the 10-day high school.

338
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,920
That's so stupid.

339
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,560
It's a harder game than you think.

340
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,700
Wait a minute!

341
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,300
What is it this time?

342
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,680
It's no good.

343
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,060
Something is still missing.

344
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,340
I think it was hard-boiled enough.

345
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:49,840
What do you mean?

346
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,660
It's the music.

347
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,620
The music?

348
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,480
At times like this, the background music of the program can be used as a theme song.

349
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,460
If you say so.

350
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,420
That's true, but...

351
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,780
I'll add the theme song to this scene one more time.

352
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,140
Are you really going to do it?

353
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,160
Of course.

354
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,140
Hard-boiled movie scene take 3.

355
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,580
Ready, start!

356
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,640
Start!

357
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,620
Didn't you say that the tempo would be up in the second half?

358
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,000
Is this the third time?

359
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,120
All right.

360
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,560
What the hell are you doing?

361
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,400
I can't turn this around.

362
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,400
We have this theme song.

363
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,120
I told you so.

364
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,520
No, there's another song.

365
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,100
Yes!

366
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,960
Music start!

367
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,540
No.

368
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,460
What is this?

369
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,600
Wrong!

370
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:46,700
No!

371
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,700
I'm not a woman who can't do anything

372
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,760
This is not it either!

373
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,280
Ah, summer has come again this year

374
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,440
Summer has passed, enough! No music here!

375
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,800
Let's smile anytime

376
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,300
I said no!

377
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,340
Summer has passed

378
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,360
Hey, it's really noon, what's going on?

379
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,500
No matter what happens, I'm not surprised

380
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,160
The criminal's request is still nothing

381
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,880
I see

382
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,860
It's been a long day

383
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,740
Nagawa-san!

384
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,080
Hey, don't raise your voice there!

385
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,900
It's a hard-boiled evolution!

386
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,360
What?

387
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,040
Because Nagawa-san is cool!

388
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,300
It can't be helped

389
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,220
Cool?

390
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,260
This guy is?

391
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,380
Why is this weak man

392
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,140
This guy is not cool at all!

393
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,220
This is why people who can't understand hard-boiled are troubled

394
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,260
If you are really cool, you are talking about a cool man like me

395
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,660
Not at all, not at all, not at all cool at all

396
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,160
It's okay

397
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,420
I'll make it easier for you guys to understand

398
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I feel like the star's face suddenly got deeper

399
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,200
What's going on?

400
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,480
Look closely

401
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,000
Zoom up!

402
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,180
What's this?

403
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,740
Isn't this mitochondria?

404
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,600
No, no, it's too high

405
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,700
Let's go back a little

406
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,040
Look closely around your eyes

407
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,800
This is?

408
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,600
What's wrong?

409
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,940
The shadow is three-stage

410
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,380
You seem to have noticed

411
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,920
By making the shadow three-stage, you can create a deeper shadow and give a hard-boiled expression

412
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,260
Our shadow is?

413
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,000
One-stage

414
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,740
Furthermore, four-stage

415
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,780
Five-stage

416
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,880
Six-stage

417
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,820
How about this? This is the hard-boiled coolness

418
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,160
It feels good!

419
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,060
It's too real, it's creepy

420
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,220
Even if there is only one shadow, Nakagawa-san is better

421
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,120
You guys who don't understand hard-boiled, it's a waste of a single shadow

422
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,460
Become a two-stage character without shadows

423
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,260
What is it?

424
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,320
Shut up!

425
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,360
You guys have no business anymore

426
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,200
Flavor Art!

427
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,320
The intruder is gone

428
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,200
Now we can go through the hard-boiled world

429
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,220
Damn it, I can't bear it anymore

430
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,080
You can do whatever you want to a guest character

431
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,580
Now I'll show the actor's power

432
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,700
What should I do to solve this place in a hard-boiled way?

433
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,900
You can hear the footsteps of a gag manga here

434
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,320
I think I heard something weird just now

435
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,620
It's my imagination

436
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,320
After all, I have no choice but to rush into the canyon

437
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,000
The footsteps of the robot anime

438
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,660
I heard something weird again.

439
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
Maybe it's just my imagination.

440
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,440
Hard-boiled Dekka is the greatest master of all.

441
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,480
And now, the old lady's laugh.

442
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,760
What?

443
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,440
What?

444
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,540
There's no social window.

445
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,400
And no clothes are torn.

446
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,340
I'm sure it was a bad omen.

447
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,080
A man like me who lives in a hard-boiled world

448
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,800
should never laugh at an old lady.

449
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,080
I'll laugh at her again.

450
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,660
What was that laugh?

451
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,060
You!

452
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,140
Don't laugh at me!

453
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,680
Shut up!

454
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,480
You've always done what you wanted to do.

455
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,100
You're the star of this show.

456
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,280
I'm the star of this show.

457
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,960
I've done what I wanted to do.

458
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,300
What's so funny?

459
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,360
You're the star?

460
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,120
You're not the star of this show.

461
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,220
What?

462
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,120
Watch this!

463
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,800
It's the opening of the show.

464
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,180
What's wrong with this?

465
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,180
Read the title.

466
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,500
I don't need to read it.

467
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,400
"This is Katsushikaku Kameyari Park's opening."

468
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,920
"This is Katsushikaku Kameyari Park's opening."

469
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,360
Yes.

470
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,500
"This is Katsushikaku Kameyari Park's opening."

471
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,480
This is the title of this show.

472
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,140
There's no such word as "Ryotsu."

473
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,780
Shut up!

474
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,760
The main character of this show is the opening,

475
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,320
and you're just a side character.

476
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,540
I see.

477
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,740
I wasn't the main character.

478
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,320
I wasn't the main character.

479
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,680
You finally realized it after two years of broadcasting.

480
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,480
You fool.

481
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,620
What?

482
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,540
Wait a minute.

483
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,120
Even if Hatsujyo is the main character,

484
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,480
it's still a building, so he can't move.

485
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,580
That's an animation.

486
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,940
You have to put your hands and feet together.

487
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,180
This is Hatsujyo-kun,

488
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,240
the Hatsujyo-kun of Katsushikaku Kameyari Park.

489
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,260
I'm Hatsujyo-kun.

490
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,420
Nice to meet you.

491
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,660
Hatsujyo-kun is running.

492
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,300
Hatsujyo-kun is falling.

493
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,640
He fell.

494
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,440
Hatsujyo-kun is standing on the slope.

495
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,200
Nice shot.

496
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,060
Hatsujyo-kun is eating ramen.

497
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,820
Hatsujyo-kun is watching TV.

498
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,000
Anji, Anji.

499
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,140
You're still a kid.

500
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,300
You happen to be a Hatsujyo-kun,

501
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,640
so you can act like a main character.

502
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,920
If I become a Hatsujyo-kun,

503
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,900
it will be a story that I will be very active.

504
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,660
Are you going to play my role?

505
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,520
I just thought that a hard-boiled man like me

506
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,220
was more suitable for the regular.

507
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,380
I will never let a regular work for a guy like you.

508
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:58,860
Absolutely.

509
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,640
What do you mean?

510
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,080
What?

511
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,440
I prefer a dragon.

512
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,120
Get me a new one.

513
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,120
Don't say something like that when you make an ending pose.

514
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,720
It's the hard-boiled man's obsession.

515
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,260
In this case,

516
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,360
the fact is whether you are suitable for the regular.

517
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,420
So,

518
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,800
it's better to arrest the criminal who is hiding there.

519
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,200
I'm sure I'm going to win.

520
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,560
Let's start the game!

521
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,780
The culprit has been arrested!

522
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,040
It's already evening.

523
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,700
What's going on, Director Takamatsu?

524
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,860
The broadcast time was too short, so I cut out all the scenes of the culprit being arrested.

525
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:53,960
What?

526
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,900
Then what about the game?

527
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,000
What about the game?

528
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,140
It's the next opportunity, so...

529
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,700
No way...

530
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,200
What's going on?

531
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,140
My place of appearance is...

532
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,500
What? The background disappeared.

533
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,100
You always ask for too much, so the background ran away.

534
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,080
What?

535
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,860
The color disappeared, too.

536
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,320
It seems that Mr. Saishiki also ran away.

537
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,280
What?

538
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,300
Hey, isn't it strange to move?

539
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,980
I'm talking, but my mouth doesn't move.

540
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,040
The person in the video also ran away.

541
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,620
What's this number? It's annoying!

542
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,400
That's a cell number.

543
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,680
And this whistle!

544
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,160
You can talk according to that.

545
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,800
It seems that the film is not in time, and it's like a recording site.

546
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,040
What's this line?

547
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,800
At last Gengaman also ran away.

548
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,460
Hey! You don't know what this is!

549
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,480
So what happened to Mr. Hoshi?

550
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,820
I don't know. All the pictures have disappeared.

551
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,400
I don't know where he went.

552
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,180
I don't know where he went.

553
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,120
This story was a mess.

554
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,040
I don't want you to come out again.

555
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,280
So, what's next week's lunch?

556
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,760
What?

557
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,780
What? Hey!

558
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,200
Don't come out without permission.

559
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,060
No!

560
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,080
Damn it! I'll definitely come out again!

561
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,860
Thanks to you, I couldn't read the comments.

562
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,360
Next time, "Love's Bodyguard".

568
