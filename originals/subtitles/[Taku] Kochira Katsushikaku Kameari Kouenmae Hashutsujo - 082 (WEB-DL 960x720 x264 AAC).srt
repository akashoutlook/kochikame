The nearby patagas are under our control.

27
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,240
Roger that.

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,900
Let's go, Maria.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Okay, Reiko.

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,780
The Cosmo's name is not a joke.

31
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,540
If you connect the lines with the artificial satellite we gave you,

32
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,320
you can accurately see the movement of the ground from the navigation.

33
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,140
Maria, will you take out the car of the culprit?

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,360
Yes.

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,000
The manufacturer is an old man.

36
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,640
The name of the car is PearlyDX.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,860
It has five cars in total.

38
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,200
The color is black.

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,560
I've got one.

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,380
The number is being displayed by UTMS.

41
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,180
It's a car of the culprit.

42
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,780
There are three passengers.

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,300
There's no doubt about that.

44
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,240
What's that?

45
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,380
It's a patagas!

46
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,880
When did you...

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,260
PearlyDX over there!

48
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,000
Stop right there!

49
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,260
What?

50
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,340
It's scary.

51
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,320
You won't catch me.

52
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,520
I'll show you how to use the A-class license.

53
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,760
I'll show you how to use the A-class license.

54
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,860
I'll show you how to use the A-class license.

55
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm going to run away, no matter where I go.

56
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,760
Damn it!

57
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,160
I have to get up.

58
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,400
Here you are.

59
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,160
A gift from Super Cosmo.

60
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,680
Do you know this?

61
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,540
No, I don't.

62
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,720
I can't believe you have this power.

63
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,860
That's my first time in this car.

64
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,480
I can't believe this is your first time in this car.

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,860
Close this place.

66
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,080
If I see you in the middle of the street,

67
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,420
I'll come on up.

68
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:50,700
Don't tell me you're not done with the school record.

69
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,180
Are you the king of school?

70
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,260
I'm not doing anything.

71
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,380
Don't you agree?

72
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,620
As you can see,

73
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:52,640
Who does that?

74
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,360
We can't miss out on the activities of Reiko Harimoto and Junsa Asato Ai.

75
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,540
There are many men in Japan who want to be caught by them.

76
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,060
They became very popular.

77
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,900
We want a car like that too.

78
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,060
Don't you know?

79
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,140
Actually, today, a new car developed jointly with the United States will come here.

80
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,180
What? Really?

81
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,120
I'm going to drive it!

82
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,140
It's true! This car is amazing!

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,820
You seem to like it, Mr. Gorilla.

84
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,180
Why are you...

85
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,380
Professor Ezaki, then, who developed this new car?

86
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,740
Right. This is the famous super car I developed.

87
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,080
Ezaki G1.

88
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,720
Wow, what a wonderful car!

89
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,680
You're with the chief?

90
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,160
I'm glad to see you.

91
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,380
You were chosen as the driver of this super car.

92
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,300
Me?

93
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,440
But, that guy developed it, didn't he?

94
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,460
Exactly.

95
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,320
Ezaki G1 is the best robot car I've ever developed.

96
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,540
Robot car?

97
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,100
Are you going to transform it?

98
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,300
No, no.

99
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,560
It has artificial intelligence.

100
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,420
It can control the car and decide by itself.

101
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,040
Hello. Nice to meet you.

102
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,600
Wow, he talks!

103
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,760
Is he really talking to himself?

104
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,520
Yes. I'm talking in my own will.

105
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,780
What's surprising is that he's still imitating it!

106
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,340
Can you do it?

107
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,540
Hahaha. It's a face.

108
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,440
It looks nothing like you.

109
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,200
And the game for the first time in a long time!!!

110
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,700
You're a mess than usual!

111
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,840
I'm not going to let you do that!

112
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,460
You're going to make a comedian out of me?

113
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,320
I'm not going to let you do that!

114
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,760
You're going to make a comedian out of me?

115
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,620
You're going to make a comedian out of me?

116
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,440
What are you doing, Chief?

117
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,640
Watch your mouth!

118
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:16,820
Watch your mouth!

119
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,120
I'm a police officer!

120
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,800
What?

121
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,240
You're a police officer?

122
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,840
What are you talking about?

123
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,700
You're a police officer?

124
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,020
Yes, yes.

125
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
You're a police officer?

126
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,540
You're a police officer?

127
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,580
You're a police officer?

128
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,080
You're a police officer?

129
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,440
I'm a robot with artificial intelligence.

130
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,380
You got it?

131
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,900
You're far better than me.

132
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,340
But why am I your driver?

133
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,600
It's a test job, so it's dangerous.

134
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,380
Yes!

135
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,940
Maria and Reiko's Cosmo is far more powerful.

136
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,240
You're the only one who can stand up even if you get hit by a tank.

137
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,640
Isn't that a risk of your life?

138
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,160
Okay.

139
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,900
Frontier Spirit!

140
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,520
The soul of America!

141
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,500
Before I knew it, you have become an American cowboy.

142
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,200
I'm only a switch politician.

143
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,660
The water in America is water.

144
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,140
King of Beer!

145
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,820
I'm no different than you, call me Eizaki Korosuke.

146
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Remember this style.

147
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,220
You don't even drink and still get out of the way.

148
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Anyway, Lyots,

149
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm going to be your boss today.

150
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm going to work hard every day.

151
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,980
I can't believe this car is your boss.

152
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
Ouch!

153
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,260
What's the point of being a boss?

154
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,380
Natsu!

155
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:09,700
Natsu!

156
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,560
You're going to die!

157
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,100
This is my special skill.

158
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,980
Headlock.

159
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,240
Damn it!

160
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,560
That's right.

161
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,920
If you're far from me, it's my fault.

162
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,100
What's the point of being a boss?

163
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,140
You're a car, but you're not good at talking.

164
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,000
You're naive.

165
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,180
I'll tell you this next time you run away.

166
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,300
I'll visit someone more capable.

167
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,640
He's bigger than you!

168
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,980
Of course!

169
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,880
Your smart index is more than three times your own.

170
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,540
Then you change your mind as a paragon of male and female.

171
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,560
I'll tell you why I watch a movie.

172
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,760
The American computer industry is the leading global industry.

173
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,800
How to fool people does not exist.

174
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
I can hear you.

175
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,360
What are you talking about?

176
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,160
I got it! You're the boss! I won't fight back!

177
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,680
If you understand, you're welcome.

178
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,480
He seems like a tough boss.

179
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,220
The waxing is finally over.

180
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,480
It looks like it's going to be a lot of work.

181
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,760
It's a car made by that crazy professor.

182
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,640
It was made in opposition to Reiko and Maria's Cosmo.

183
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,660
I wonder what kind of special feature it has.

184
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,760
Look at this.

185
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,520
It's a different car!

186
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,940
It's a double-sided patrol car.

187
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,720
I see. No one would think this is a patrol car.

188
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,640
I don't wanna know what a patrol car is!

189
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,580
Ryo-kun.

190
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,760
Put your hand on my door.

191
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,200
Like this?

192
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,020
The fingerprints.

193
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,720
Their names.

194
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,560
Ryo-kun, Yuki Kanchi, and Jun Sakusho.

195
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,880
Love of love.

196
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,020
Millionaires who are like-minded.

197
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,140
One who isn't interested in getting married in the opinion poll.

198
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,300
Number 1 in seven years in a row.

199
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,840
Don't give me that kind of name!

200
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,440
Ouch!

201
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,620
I'll teach you how to fight!

202
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:40,300
That was a rough one.

203
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,040
Hi! Ryo, Kei, Ryo!

204
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,380
Oh, Reiko and Maria.

205
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,900
I heard your rival was stolen, so I came to see you.

206
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,320
I'm not a rival.

207
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,160
Hello, Lady Reiko, Lady Maria.

208
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,380
The car's talking!

209
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,560
I'm Ezaki Z1.

210
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,060
I'm a robot with artificial intelligence.

211
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,090
You two look so beautiful.

212
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,980
You're so good, Scott.

213
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,420
You're wrong.

214
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,820
Reiko is a woman, but Maria is a man.

215
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,320
Hey!

216
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,080
I like singing!

217
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,680
You're right!

218
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Hey, Maria!

219
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,740
Yeah?

220
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,880
Yeah.

221
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,660
Maria is a man.

222
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,420
Maria is a man.

223
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,240
Reiko is a woman, and Maria is a man.

224
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,360
Hey!

225
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,960
Maria is a woman.

226
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,340
Maria is a woman.

227
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,080
Stop....

228
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,200
Stop thinking too much.

229
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,400
It's going to break in the end.

230
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,540
It's going to break in the end.

231
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,440
But the first place of the score is...

232
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,860
It's going to be the first place of the score.

233
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,980
Ryo, you're right.

234
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,640
It's going to be the first place of the score.

235
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,780
But the number one ago is indeed the number one.

236
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,520
Everyone's staring at it.

237
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:56,560
I'm getting used to it.

238
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,400
It's easier to drive automatically.

239
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,100
What's the matter with you?

240
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,740
You didn't put on an airbag, did you?

241
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,100
Watch your step while driving.

242
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,480
I got it.

243
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,620
Then I'll just listen to the CD.

244
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,820
I'll just listen to the CD.

245
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,420
You're not my type.

246
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,600
You're my type.

247
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,540
What are you doing? I love listening to it.

248
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,520
You're going to fight your boss?

249
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,620
Then I think you're in trouble.

250
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,520
You'll be kicked out of your course and you'll get a bonus.

251
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,820
I got it.

252
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,680
Don't worry about it.

253
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,380
I'll laugh at you every time.

254
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,640
I've been doing it for a long time.

255
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,320
I told you I'm a police officer.

256
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,160
Emergency call.

257
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,420
I know where to get the water.

258
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,120
It's in the warehouse over there.

259
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,820
All right. It's your chance.

260
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,840
Don't lose, Z-Wing.

261
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,940
I'm going to eat you up.

262
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,580
Emergency food.

263
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,640
Hey, don't come over here.

264
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,140
Come back!

265
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,320
Let me go.

266
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,800
Not there.

267
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,180
Over here.

268
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,680
Let me go.

269
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,760
I will try this again.

270
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,300
Gamgam Umi.

271
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,780
What's happening?

272
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,200
Cut it out!

273
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,000
It's a threat!

274
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,560
You're even more lethal than Kuinigehan!

275
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,600
Hurry, hurry!

276
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Hurry up! Hurry up!

277
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,040
We're a little late, but we have the Gamgam and Missile, and the Mitsudan.

278
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,800
We're the best!

279
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,780
It's our fault!

280
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,920
Go!

281
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,680
We found the evil injection vehicle! Move immediately!

282
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,300
Again?

283
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,620
Let's forget about that!

284
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,080
We can't let this crime go!

285
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,760
Fire the grenade!

286
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,220
This is no good.

287
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,540
Look at this.

288
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,180
There's not a single piece of paper about Z-1.

289
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,860
It's all about Maria and Reiko.

290
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,600
Hmph. That's strange.

291
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,620
What is the Japanese press looking at?

292
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,340
You're doing it the wrong way.

293
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,380
If you keep this up, Cosmo will be in deep trouble.

294
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,340
What do you think will happen then?

295
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,100
What will happen?

296
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,440
That's obvious.

297
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,560
Z-1 will be judged as incompetent and disqualified.

298
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,220
Scrap!

299
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,460
No! No! No! No!

300
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,500
Then I'll do as I say!

301
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,680
What did you say?

302
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,620
What do you mean?

303
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,840
The Japanese are most interested in...

304
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,480
the mito-ko!

305
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:52,660
It's a trap!

306
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,840
It's Goto!

307
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,820
Wait!

308
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,720
No, it's Goto!

309
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,440
It's Goto!

310
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,580
No!

311
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,440
Young man, wait!

312
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,120
This window is the key!

313
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,960
Listen! Listen!

314
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,380
What's this?

315
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,920
It's the Net-Dan!

316
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,220
Net-Dan, fire!

317
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,940
Damn it!

318
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,860
How's that?

319
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,340
This brain-based strategy

320
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,460
that used a Japanese's brain

321
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,240
to make a fool out of a ghost!

322
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,840
What's the problem?

323
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,940
If you do something that stands out,

324
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,920
you'll become a real reporter.

325
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,640
I see.

326
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,000
From now on,

327
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,680
you can do as I say.

328
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,740
Listen!

329
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,840
This is Japan!

330
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,020
Japan!

331
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,620
I must work hard

332
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,440
to make the Japanese happy!

333
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,160
Good.

334
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,500
Ryo-chan,

335
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,180
I'll give you a special mission.

336
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,380
Teach me how to make the Japanese happy.

337
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,260
Alright!

338
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Leave it to me!

339
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,340
Listen!

340
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,660
The song is Enka and the name is Bushi.

341
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,140
I'll treat my subordinates well,

342
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,580
and I'll show them my guts!

343
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,120
Sons!

344
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,240
I'll show them the true power of my spirit!

345
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,700
It's time for our match.

346
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,000
I've been waiting for a long time.

347
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,280
Hey!

348
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,420
I won!

349
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,920
It's time for our match.

350
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,140
Hey!

351
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,580
I can do it!

352
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:42,520
Ryo-chan!

353
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,360
You can do it!

354
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,140
You can do it!

355
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:44,680
You can do it!

356
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,540
You can do it!

357
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:46,820
You can do it!

358
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,500
Kei-bouho!

359
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,460
Special drink service time!

360
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,840
-The best wax... -This is so nice.

361
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,360
The more you polish it, the more glossy it gets.

362
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,620
Oh, really?

363
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,840
Should I add a bottle?

364
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,240
Boy, a new bottle.

365
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,140
And two water-resistant bottles, please.

366
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,140
Kei-bouho, I can't drink anymore.

367
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,460
You idiot! Let's do it again!

368
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,440
I'm sorry, I can't drink anymore.

369
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:20,680
Ryo!

370
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,800
What the hell is this?

371
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,700
A yakitori shop, a karaoke box, and a cabaret!

372
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,560
I don't want to, Chief.

373
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,920
It's all Kei-bouho's money.

374
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,580
What?

375
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,980
I just got paid for it.

376
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,700
I can't refuse my boss's invitation.

377
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,540
It would be a punishment.

378
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,240
You're really good, Senpai.

379
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,240
You've already got a D1.

380
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,560
There's no way the D1 would do that!

381
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
You did it all!

382
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,700
You should be punished!

383
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,060
"The terrorist in the ICPO's international mission is found!"

384
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,240
Emergency call!

385
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,600
"The terrorist in the ICPO's international mission is found!"

386
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,240
What?

387
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,540
That violent guy?

388
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,320
Ryotsu, go arrest him with the D1 right away!

389
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,580
But you have to take off all those stickers.

390
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,040
"The terrorist is heading towards Tokyo Bay."

391
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,600
"He's probably going out into the ocean."

392
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,600
"He's probably going out into the ocean."

393
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,640
"He's probably going out into the ocean."

394
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,400
"He's probably going out into the ocean."

395
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,380
"There's a car behind us that's coming very fast."

396
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:24,620
"There's a car behind us that's coming very fast."

397
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,500
"This is it."

398
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
"This is Ryo's car."

399
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,460
"There you go, bros! Let's race!"

400
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,220
"He's in a bad shape."

401
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,800
"He's affected by a car. His AI is changing his character a little."

402
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,560
"He's in a bad shape."

403
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:41,920
"That's pretty amazing."

404
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,440
"Hello?"

405
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,260
"How are you?"

406
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,160
"I don't get anything."

407
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,980
I can't lose to a criminal arrest.

408
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,740
Reiko, you're speeding up. Don't lose, Z-1!

409
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,600
Don't get any closer!

410
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,880
Watch out!

411
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,840
Can you see this window?

412
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,240
Is that going to surprise me?

413
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,480
Emi and Sherry, the missiles are being launched!

414
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,720
All units, fire!

415
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,260
What? Hey, what about that?

416
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,740
Fire!

417
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,760
Watch out!

418
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
The boss is running away!

419
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,540
It's not over yet.

420
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,240
The sea and sky are a gift from Cosmo!

421
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,460
He's running away!

422
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,340
But...

423
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,900
Now's your chance to get a chance to do something!

424
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,220
Fly, Z-1!

425
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,840
Be brave!

426
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,920
You can do it!

427
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,760
...

428
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,080
...

429
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,140
...

430
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,760
...

431
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,480
...

432
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,460
Ryo, what are you going to do?

433
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,260
...

434
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,760
Fly, you'll be a hero!

435
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,740
...

436
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,560
...

437
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,300
...

438
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,680
Ryo!

439
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,680
...

440
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,500
...

441
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,300
...

442
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,580
...

443
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,040
...

444
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,680
...

445
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:37,700
...

446
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:42,920
"Ryo-chan"

447
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,180
Where's Senpai?

448
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,980
It can't be... Ryo's...

449
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,620
Ryo-chan! Ryo-sama!

450
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,480
Senpai!

451
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,020
Ryo-sama!

452
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,080
Ryo-san!

453
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,780
Ryo-san!

454
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,060
I'll save you right now, Z1!

455
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:01,780
What?

456
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,720
Whoa!

457
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,520
Hang in there, Z1!

458
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,780
I-I'm fine...

459
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,800
It's nothing...

460
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,760
Z1!

461
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,180
R-Ryo-san...

462
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,780
We were best partners, weren't we?

463
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,720
Yeah! We're best partners!

464
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,040
So don't die, Z1!

465
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,460
R-Ryo-san...

466
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,660
Z1!

467
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,780
Z1!

468
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,380
I'll take care of you!

469
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,640
I'll never forget you!

470
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,320
Z1!

471
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,980
Hey, everyone.

472
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,480
The Chief is here today for an inspection.

473
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,240
The Chief?

474
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,260
Ryo-san, don't be rude to him.

475
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,080
Oh, the Chief is here!

476
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,660
Everyone, I'm the Chief!

477
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,680
Hahaha!

478
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,400
Little brother's back!

479
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,200
Z1-chan!

480
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,260
Look, Z-1, I was just being polite.

481
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,740
Now then, let the matter of honor BE relax!

482
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,500
Wh-what do you mean?

483
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,080
Hey, Mr. Lawrence.

484
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,400
Ryo-tsu!

485
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,500
Let me apply wax for you.

486
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,300
Ohara-kun,

487
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,680
I'll do the glass polishing.

488
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,600
The boss is on his side.

489
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,380
Yo, Rei-kokumaria-kun!

490
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,780
Let's go to Rainbow Bridge together next time.

491
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,040
You've been more selfish than before.

492
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,620
The tears I shed...

493
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,800
Why didn't you put me in Tokyo Bay at that time?

494
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,060
I was told that.

495
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,800
Hey, Ohara-kun, Ryo-tsu-kun!

496
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,400
Yes!

497
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,860
What are you doing?

498
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,060
You two, come here quickly!

499
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,360
I'm here, Mr. Head Office.

500
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,440
The right side is still dirty.

501
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,740
The boss is more strong.

502
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,700
Oh, that feels good.

503
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,360
Such selfish people.

504
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,140
I don't want to do it anymore.

505
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,840
Oden, ramen, beer, nya-tsukan.

506
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,900
Here is the mass-produced store we're talking about.

507
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,480
Are you the father of Bakuryu again?

508
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,760
Please don't get in the way of business.

509
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,180
What is it?

510
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:15,940
What?

511
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,020
It's a bomb!

512
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,580
Next time, "Gekisou Speed Yatai!"

513
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,340
Please stand by!

514
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:31,980
Next time, "Gekisou Speed Yatai!"

515
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,740
Please stand by!

516
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,400
Truth

517
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,000
The sudden

518
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,160
You make the answer

519
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,480
soon

520
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,040
You make the answer soon

521
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm ready.

522
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,120
Beep, beep, it's decided.

523
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,460
Bang, bang, it's a flash.

524
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,980
Wham, bang, it's a bang.

525
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Beep, beep, it's all together.

526
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,820
Bang, bang, it's an action.

527
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,280
Wham, bang, it's a fly.

528
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,020
Power is the greatest thing.

529
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,280
If everyone gathers here,

530
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,360
the final energy will be like a dream.

531
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,360
If you look at tomorrow, believe in yesterday,

532
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,900
draw the universe, and stand on the ground,

533
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,820
the planet Kameari will turn into a circle.

534
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,840
Isn't this good?

535
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,660
Of course it's good.

536
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,940
Thank you for watching.
